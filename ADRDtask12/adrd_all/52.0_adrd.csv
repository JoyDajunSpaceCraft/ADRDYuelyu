"my mother is 77. she lives alone in a small town with no public transportation and everything she needs being at least a 15 to 20 minute drive away. she still has her license and drives daily. my sisters and i each live anywhere from a 2 to 12 hour drive from her house. she has a very supportive friend network at home. this is how we found out she was having problems. my sisters started getting phone calls from her friends a little over a year ago voicing some concerns. she was repeating herself in conversations. she would show up for a meeting on the wrong day. stuff like that. after being alerted by her friends we started to pick up on some of the same issues in our phone conversations with her. my sisters and i all go to mom's for a week or so every summer as a kind of reunion. this last summer we voiced our concerns with the memory issues she was having and suggested that she permit us access to some things and that she schedule an appointment with her dr. to see what might be the source of the problem. she acknowledged that she was ""a little forgetful"" and wasn't combative or argumentative, but it did seem like she lacked the insight into the potential severity of her situation. we scheduled an appointment with her primary care physician that one of my sisters was able to attend with my mother.  after a mini test and a referral to a neurologist for an mri the results came back showing a pretty normal brain for someone her age and a diagnoses of mild dementia.in the immediate aftermath we made sure we had access to her bank accounts so we can monitor activity. she has given her pcp permission to speak with us about her care and we can all look up her medical information on the online portal for her drs. office. we also have the ability to track her by her iphone when she remembers to keep it with her.  i brought her to stay with me for a month over the winter with the plan of having her evaluate if she wanted to come and stay with me permanently. my sisters have done the same. over the course of the past 6 to 8 months it is apparent to us that mom has some serious deficits. she still has trouble focusing on dates and times. she takes blood pressure and diabetes medication that we can't get her to stick with consistently. we have tried the pill containers with the days of the week and all of that stuff, she just doesn't remember that she needs to take them. she still drives and is familiar enough with everything at home that she knows where things are and how to get to her house, but in the last few days a friend of hers, who is a saint and spends a lot of time with her, informed us that she was out with mom for lunch and when they left the restaurant mom couldn't remember where she parked her car and had trouble remembering how to get to her friends house to drop her off.she is flying out to stay with me this sunday. the original plan was to have her here for a week or two, but i'm starting to question if i can let her go home, and just typing that has made me start crying. i'm already feeling overwhelmed and i feel like things aren't going to get any easier.i have drafted a financial and medical power of attorney and plan to take her into my office on monday, where we have several notaries, to get them executed. i'm scheduling an appointment with a local geriatrician with the hopes of getting a more detailed assessment of her cognitive deficits. i have also reached out to my local county office of adult and aging services to see what resources they might have. i plan to discuss with her, as i have previously, what her thoughts are. i have told her from the beginning that i want her to be as much a part of this process as possible as opposed to feeling like it's something that is happening to her, but her insight into the gravity of her illness is poor and i don't have any faith that she has a reliable memory of any of the detailed conversations we have had around the issue. when we do discuss it she is open and her responses remain fairly consistent. i am also thinking about seeing if i can set up tours of some local long term residential memory care facilities so she can get a look at them now while she's at a point where she can still give me feedback about what she does and does not like so down the road i'm not flying blind. there is a part of me that feels like all of this might be too much for her too, so i don't know. i'm going to wait to see what the geriatrician has to say, but i think i'm looking at two options. one is letting her return home where she is familiar with things and has a solid support system of friends, and hiring someone to come in for a few hours in the mornings every day to make sure she knows what she has on the agenda for the day and that she's taking her meds. the other is having her stay here permanently. my sister was at my mother's earlier this week to pick mom up. she said the house is in good shape and well kept. mom pays her bills, is active with her friend group, and is capable of all her normal activities of daily living and caring for herself for the most part, but she's just very forgetful and gets disoriented. i'm just afraid that i'm going to let her go back and something bad is going to happen. so now that i've written way too much i guess i'm wondering if i'm doing everything i should. is there more i should do with her when she's here? am i trying to do too much and will it confuse her? if she is going to stay here permanently, is it terrible of me to just make that decision and keep her here without any kind of lead up or preparation for her to leave where she has been for the past 50 years? would allowing her to return home for a short period of time to get things organized at her house confuse her even more than just having her stay here and having me go back to get necessary things on my own without her? for everyone who has been doing this for a while what are the things i'm not doing at these early stages that i should be, and what sort of things can i do to help her function as independently as possible for as long as possible considering she's on the very front end of this thing?", does she have a friend who would be willing/able to live with her for the next year? ideally she would remain in her own home and live with someone she likes who can drive and provide companionship. not as an employee but someone who might benefit from having a free place to live and be in need of companionship themselves.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uju3ki/help_for_a_newbie/,Help for a Newbie

"a long post that is just me venting more than anything else.to start off - i just want to say i recognize that 99.9% of the posts on this sub are being made by people who are burdened with the heart-wrenching task of caring for a relative and/or loved one with dementia.  i am not in any way comparing my situation to any of yours at all, because this is happening with a neighbor who i barely know.  i also want to thank you all for your posts, honesty and vulnerability with your feelings, because they have educated me a bit on a horrible disease i (very thankfully, up until this point) knew little to nothing about it.my partner and i moved to a new, quiet neighborhood in kansas last september.  in fact we made a special point of finding a house that was a bit further from the center of town so we could enjoy a small yard, a garage for a project car we're working on together, and a spare room so i could have a home office (i work from home).  anyway, it's in a quiet little neighborhood and we share a duplex with a single woman in her mid 70s.  i was delighted by this initially because i like a quiet work environment and what is better than living next to a ""little old lady?""  her yard is immaculate and her decorations are always adorable and changed out immediately after a holiday passes.  always thought that was so charming / interesting.  a few weird things happened since we moved in. the first thing being, about a week or two after we settled in, i was standing in the kitchen drinking water and watched a bunch of flower heads get chucked over our mutual backyard fence onto our patio.  it took me a minute to recognize what was evening happening.  i hadn't met our neighbor yet so i thought it was a bizarre but slightly cheeky sign of welcome?  a bit odd.then in the coming weeks there were a few rogue doorbell rings / ding-dong-ditches around 3am - 4am.  it's a neighborhood full of kids and right by a high school, so we chalked it up to that, and the police confirmed this was likely the case when i finally called them about it because i was starting to get weirded out.then there was the time i was relaxing at night baking muffins, my partner was snoozing on the couch after watching a movie, and we saw cop car lights out our front window.  six cruisers out front and suddenly police banging on our door telling us to come out with our hands up.  a shooting had been called in at our specific address / residence, apparently someone named diane was inside bleeding to death.  of course that wasn't the case, and we were both totally bewildered why someone would swat us, we are new to the town and barely know anyone aside from my partner's boss and coworkers.all that was a bit odd but nothing i really thought about too hard.  life is weird sometimes, right? we did (and do) get woken up occasionally at 3 or 4am with absolutely thundering door slams from next door, i'm talking the whole house shakes and our cats scatter and hide.  i don't even know how a human can slam a door that hard.  definitely made us scratch our heads but there isn't anything inherently wrong with someone slamming a door in their house, i guess.  there was also the weird thing - on windy days when the little wooden bamboo wind chimes i had on our patio would make more noise than usual, she'd angrily go outside, put a stake in the dead center of her yard, and hang up this massive metal wind chime, only to take it down an hour or so later.  this is repeated often.anyway.  about a month ago, our neighbor rang our doorbell while i was on a work call.  i saw her walk away and thought to myself she'd come back if it were an emergency or something - not to mention we have tons of houses all around us in the neighborhood.  the next day i was napping downstairs on the couch and heard a voice yelling in our backyard.  i looked out our back slider door and our neighbor's entire head was sticking out like a turtle through this one area of our mutual fence that had blown over in a wind storm.  it was just the top that was leaning a bit, and i had already put in a maintenance request with our landlord about it.  anyway, the look on her face spooked me, it was as if she was looking at something or talking to someone who wasn't there.  a day later the doorbell rang again.  i was upstairs working in my office.  then the doorbell rang about 26 more times and someone was violently banging on the door.  i ran downstairs, heart pounding, and could recognize at that point that it was our neighbor who was now also shouting angrily outside the door, although it wasn't clear to me about what.  something about something leaning on something else - i had to guess the fence?  i didn't open the door because i was very alarmed by how aggressive she sounded, but i called my landlord.  he confirmed that she had some ""mental health issues, maybe dementia"" and mentioned that she had made numerous noise complaints about me and my partner and our six children since we moved in.  we do not have kids.  she also never made a complaint about the fence.  i asked him to fix it as soon as possible, nonetheless.another day later.  the doorbell rings again, 58 more times, followed immediately by the same violent pounding, and now she's grabbing the doorknob and hulk-pulling and pushing the door in and out so aggressively i do not know how long our stupid little lock will hold.  i call the police because at this point i have zero idea what is going on and by all accounts she's trying to break in.  they come over, try to talk to her, she refuses to open the door for them, screams at them through her closed window, and they speak with me and let me know they are ""familiar"" with her as she calls in a lot, believe she has dementia, she has made various noise complaints and they are often about us or a little boy who lives in her attic (there is no little boy.)it takes me about an hour to calm down after this outburst, and i finally go back upstairs to continue working.  at this point it's late at night and i'm waiting for my partner to get home from the class he teaches at night.  sit down at my desk and hear a massive bang downstairs.  i bolt down the stairs and hear a million more bangs, here she is again, our neighbor is in our backyard trying to smash our glass slider door with a rock.  what the actual.  i call the police again, this time they send multiple cruisers, at this point she's crawled back into her house (she literally broke down the rest of the fence and squeezed through it to get into our backyard) and has transformed back into a sweet little old lady again.  she talks to the officers this time, and tells them that we are just playing pranks on each other and there was no need to call the police.  definitely not the case considering i have no idea who she is and have never even spoken to her.my landlord contacted an officer on the police's mental health unit the next day and the officer asked if we'd be comfortable going over to her house (with him supervising, and her permission) and formally introducing ourselves to our neighbor.  we had zero problem with that, so we did so.  she was perfectly lovely, her house was utterly immaculate inside and she had a sweet little dog who she clearly loved and cared well for.  she was kind although she did ask me slightly aggressively how many children we have, to which i replied none.  i did compliment her on her lovely outdoor decorations which i always do (truly) admire.  the mental health officer followed up with us afterwards and said that when he spoke to her alone, she admitted to him she's been having hallucinations but hasn't been to see a doctor in over 7 years.two days later the doorbell rings again.  this time i run downstairs and am about to answer the door, seeing as i've met this lady now, and stupid ol' me thinks maybe i can talk to her and figure out what's bothering her and smooth it all over.  i stop short when i hear her start ranting and raving about how i stole all her decorations and then she proceeds to start ripping my wreath and all my outdoor decor off our front entryway, smashing all our items very hard against the frosted glass window on the side of our door.  alarmingly hard.  this repeats a few more times.  we decided to take out a formal trespassing complaint because we don't know what else to do and it's becoming increasingly alarming/disturbing/upsetting to have this happen.  i don't see her getting arrested as a solution at all, in fact it feels wrong, but it appears that she has no family, no contacts, the emergency contact information she gave our landlord was a nonworking number.  she has refused medical treatment from anyone who has suggested it to her (the mental health officer and a social worker who has stopped by multiple times) and at this point isn't even admitting she's having hallucinations anymore, she flat out denies she has any issues whatsoever. a few weeks passed after we took out the complaint, but the knocking and harassing started up again, this time she called the police and filed a complaint that we had burglarized her home, stole her dog (who was barking in a room upstairs) and we also stole a firearm from her home and left it on her front step.  that last bit was particularly chilling, a. because it meant that she has a firearm and b. because our neighborhood is full of young children running around during the day and the idea of a loaded firearm sitting on her front mat in plain sight for a few hours (or god knows how long) midday makes me want to throw up.the door knocking and bell ringing has died down a bit, but has now turned into almost constant banging on the interior walls we share in the duplex.  when i shower she smashes stuff against her walls and screams at me.  when i use the toile or make any noise in the bathroom at all, she is often standing in her adjacent bathroom saying directly at the wall ""i can hear you in there.""  not sinister at all.  almost none of this happens to my partner, or rarely occurs when he is home. she seems highly observant so i'm sure she can tell whose car is whose and notes when each is gone.  to the point where i've had my partner use my car for a week just to give me some peace.  i can't pretend to apply logic to this situation but maybe she feels threatened by his presence, he's certainly a much taller male whereas i'm on the smaller end of most females.  but again she may well be hallucinating so who knows what she sees or thinks is going on with us anyway.  when she's not actively banging on the walls she is hulk-smashing things inside her apartment, moving objects around that sound far too heavy for a 76 year old to move around, talking to herself frantically and chain smoking nonstop which is seeping through her walls into our unit. she has called both our landlord and the police and blamed the smoking on us and says we are ruining her house.  neither of us smoke.our landlord served her an eviction notice after the umpteenth time she violated our order, and she quieted down for almost exactly the 14 days she had to comply with the order.  then right as rain she started up again.  it's stuff like that that makes me frustrated, because she seems to have some self awareness of the situation.  our landlord finally decided that rather than evict her he'd do a nonrenewal of her lease which is coming up in august to give her more time to find a suitable place to live.  this is somewhat of a relief, i guess (for us, certainly not for her, realistically where is she going to go) but it's ratcheted up her aggression to a freaking 12/10.  she's home all day, and with the newfound information that her mortal enemies ie us have caused her to be driven from her home, she now lies in wait in her entryway for us to leave the house and on multiple occasions has started walking quickly towards me as i'm trying to get into my car.  i've called the police about this and all they say is to ""avoid a confrontation"" and oh also, ""assume she has a firearm.""  i am not a gun owner, no desire to be, but i've at least bought pepper spray which maybe i can spritz in her direction before she shoots me in the head.  at this point i am scared to leave the house, which sounds ridiculous, but it's true.  i also hate being in the house now too, for what it's worth.reading everyone's posts has been really helpful, though in many cases deeply upsetting and profoundly sad to read all of your situations.  they make me understand the behavior a little bit, although of course this is not someone i am emotionally attached to or have history with like a parent or grandparent or other relative.  knowing her illness is causing this behavior is one thing, but all the same it's hard to not think she's just a compete raging control freak jerk set on making our lives a living hell. it often feels like she is a predator and the behavior is very unpredictable and quite aggressive.  the police don't seem to take this particularly seriously, and whenever they are called and come by, the majority of them smile and say ""oh yeah we know \_\_\_\_, she's a sweet old lady"" and in one case i quote, ""i'm a softie so i don't think we should take her in.""  it's like, live here for 2 days, then get back to me.  again, i don't pretend to know what the solution is here, i did call the mental health officer to make sure he knew she'd need housing in august and he said he'd offer her some resources, but the last few times he's checked on her she's gotten very aggressive and slammed the door in his face.  it's a tough case because she's still quite self-sufficient at this point but is nasty as all get out to who she wants to be.anyway, i'm trying to have compassion here and of course at the end of the day want this woman to get help.  not really looking for any advice as such, just looking to vent.  thank

"i am in the early days of suspecting my mom might have dementia.  i think there's something not quite right with my mom. every single day is different.  the thing that caught me off guard earlier this year was her mood.  complete silence from her to me.  i am mindful of my attitude to my mom and i am not sarcastic or critical of her and i help around the home and pay bills. i did nothing to warrant silence from her.   then there were times when she was in the silence mode and she would rush around the home and grab her jacket and run from the house to go out walking.   the silence was something that was happening for a few months.  the silence was the number 1 thing that caught me off guard earlier this year and i began to wonder if this could be dementia. then there was other behaviours over the past 2/3/4 years that i think i can now piece together alongside the silence.  currently a type of ocd cleaning has taken her over.  every single day with her - cleaning.  also she's not able to comprehend the energy crisis and the there was little effort to reduce energy consumption.   i am nearly at a stage where i am going to have a heart attack at the machine.   60 degree loads with prewash and extra rinse.  washing only one or two items at a time. the whole works.  there's no effort or understanding to reduce the energy consumption.  she's washing as if she's leaving severe disease on everything. there was a type of silliness over the past few years like buying more shoes when she has shoes, shoes, shoes, shoes.  she just wants more.  recently i read something that said when dementia is found, quite often dementia change have been happening for up to 10 years before diagnosis. is that true? looking back there were other things over the past few years.  her reasoning was warpped over some issues over the past few years. for example she was not able to follow instructions from the vet when our dog was old and sick.  now, i am thinking if it's dementia and of it was setting in for years? i hope i am wrong.  i don't have time to be a carer to my mom.  and especially this.  i am trying to suggest to my mom to turn the temperature down on the washing machine and leave off the extra functions and it's not going down well.  she's looking for a fight from me when i try to conserve energy like this.", been watching mom decline since 2014. we only felt she needed 24 hour care last year.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ui8d3r/dementia_is_it_present_for_years_before_diagnosis/,Dementia - is it present for years before diagnosis?

"this is the late-night/early morning ramblings of an autistic, stressed-out, terrified mind. i (40f) live with my parents because i can't afford to move out. i have alerts set up on various property websites that let me know when a property matching my search criteria is listed, but the rent is always far too much especially with the deposit added on top (usually equal to or greater than the 1st month's rent.my dad is 73 this year and i'm not sure what stage of altzheimer's he has. i think middle, cos he's always asking me if i'm working that day, even when i'm dressed in my work uniform. sometimes he'll randomly ask me in the afternoon when i've been around all day.. i really can't keep going like this- constantly getting super anxious when dad gets up in the middle of the night. always laying awake worrying about what he's doing. where he's gonna pee. if he's gonna make a mess. i'm terrified of mum finding it &amp; going apeshit, yelling at dad, slamming doors &amp; drawers, dad saying stop shouting/slamming stuff cos it makes him confused. i just finished cleaning up after him again.it's a good thing i was still awake tonight when dad did what he did. this time he peed out the front door. i was retching as i came downstairs. i used the last of the kitchen paper, some tp, &amp; some (antibacterial spray cos it got all over the door frame. when i asked why he did it he claimed it was cos my mum doesn't allow him to pee anywhere else. i think i got it all but some may have gone under the bottom of the door frame. i worry abt the stink that may develop even with the spray. he'll probably get found out at that point and i'll get yelled at for covering it up. last time this happened, he peed in the living room! and guess who cleaned that mess up as well... i asked him if he was gonna just leave the pee as is and he said no, but he had already gotten back into bed. plus he can't really get down onto his hands and knees anymore. i can only pray none of our neighbours were awake and happened to look out their windows in our direction. i had to give up on numbering these cos i wasn't sure how much i needed to get off my chest. i'll definitely have to call the housing association &amp; beg for a house/flat.yes, dad has altzheimer's, but is it wrong of me to want a calm, stress-free life? i'm sure that's what mum wants too. as an autistic person, i hate stress, i hate the anxiety, i hate what this is doing to both my parents but esp to my mum. in my darkest thoughts (&amp; i'm ashamed to admit this), i sometimes think it would be better had he died. or that i had gotten out of this house years ago.  i also wish nursing homes were less expensive- £800 per week is in no way affordable! i'm tired. i'm tired of having to hide the messes dad makes.i'm tired of the stress, the anxiety, the fear. i'm tired of having to mask. of having to pretend things are perfectly fine. of having my home invaded multiple times a day by the carers for dad. but at the same time i know they're necessary to cut down on messes, to get dad up, washed and dressed in the mornings, toileted 2x during the day then again at night &amp; also changed for bed. i'm laying here in bed, still awake, with only a short nap yesterday (sunday) afternoon plus maybe an hr or so tonight. but i still can't sleep. i stg, i'm not gonna be happy if i hear dad get up again tonight. i'm so thankful i don't have to work today. but tomorrow is another story.i had thought of renting a room from someone, but often the rent for a room is close to the price for a 1bed flat. but then again your bills might be included in that price. i definitely need a place of my own as soon as possible though. i really need to cry but i can't afford to.marking as nsfw just to be safe (i've never posted anything like this before)."," everything you're saying is absolutely understandable, and you're not a bad person for wanting to be in a less stressful situation. the sad reality is that this is a horrible disease and it only gets worse. there may be moments and days that are easier or better than others, but in all it's just a terribly stressful and tiring job to be in the home when caring for someone with alzheimer's/dementia. a lot of children feel the responsibility to help care for their parents when this type of thing happens. sometimes it's because of a sense of duty to their parent/guilt about trying to help them, other times it's a financial issue. either way, you are under no obligation to stay in a situation that is causing you harm or emotional distress.if you haven't already, you should talk to your mother about how this is affecting you. she might not be receptive, but you'll feel better being honest with her. it may work out that even while not living at home, you are able to have some time to rest and recharge and then come home for a couple of days to help each week or month. i would seek out any services that may be offered in your area for alzheimer's/dementia patients. sometimes there are day programs where you can drop off your family member, allowing you to get some time to rest. full-time care is very expensive, but sometimes it's less expensive to have an aide living in the home 24/7 than to move someone to a care facility. and for your own sanity, create a realistic budget if you haven't already. there may be options to rent a room in a larger home or shared building (with common kitchen/bathroom areas). cut back on all unnecessary spending and get that first month's rent + deposit. you need to do what's best for you. your parents (hopefully) had you with the wish that you would lead a life that was as happy, fulfilling, and independent as possible. in the meantime, do your best to take care of yourself and your mom. try to sleep as best as you can, and eat as well as you can. you're no good to anyone, least of all yourself, if you're burned out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ugjp94/i_need_to_vent/,I Need to Vent

"my mom is nearly 70. earlier this year, my mom was doing something weird.  basically more often than not she was in a silent mood to me.  i live at home and i am mindful of my own attitude and mood.  i am not critical or sarcastic.  i am always helping with jobs and paying bills.  i can't think of a reason for the silence.  it wasn't the first time.  the silence was on and off for months. one morning she might not be talk to me and than the next she could be trying to be my best friend.  the evenings as well.  some evenings after work, she's sitting in her chair and i would be lucky if i got 'hello' out of her.   any attempt at conversation from me was met with one word replies.  then there would be days she would be in the silence mode and she would start prancing around the house and get her jacket and looked as if she was making progress to go out and then the next second i would hear the front door close.  not even a 'goodbye' from her.  no speech to tell me where she's going.  if she's going for a walk or to the shops. this was the behaviour that caught me off guard.  i thought it was so weird.   i was able to think back over the past 2 years and there were some other behaviours too and it's only now that i am piecing things together and thinking maybe dementia might be setting in. my understanding of dementia though is that there is a forgetfulness or confusion.  i will admit, there is some mixing up of things from her but it's ever so mild and i can be the same when i am busy and stressed.   a relatively new behaviour from her is ocd cleaning.  the youngest is gone now from the nest and she had a lot of focus on him and helping him.  she's now cleaning every day and a lot of it i think is ocd cleaning.  this is difficult for me because my suspicions of dementia is not showing up as forgetfulness.  it's just some odd stuff on mood and angers and ocd stuff. every day is different with her.  some days are ok and then other days she's just flat if that makes any sense. i don't know how to go forward with my suspicions.   i feel like i can't talk to her about this. she's not going to welcome any of this and it will likely result in an outburst from her. i don't feel comfortable ringing or writing or emailing to the gp practice. i would feel more comfortable talking to a gp face to face.  we attend to the same practice.  i wonder would it be ok for me to make an appointment for myself at some point and raise concerns about my mom so they can maybe not it on her chart and start the process of investigating. i think there's definitely something going on but it's not showing up as a typical forgetfulness. i know some replies to me before said sometimes utis can present in a similar way.  i don't know if it is a uti because i can go back 2/3 years with pieces of my mom's behaviours.  if it was an undiagnosed uti surely she would be in sepsis by now."," a change in personality is often a first sign, op.  try to arrange a drs visit. anyone who specializes or has worked with the elderly is great. a psychiatrist is great, too, esp if they have worked with the elderly. call around. ask questions. since this isn't an emergency yet, you have a chance to get in with a good dr at the beginning of this. trust me, if it's cognitive decline or worse, that will make all the difference. best of luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ufxbyf/what_do_i_do_with_my_suspicions_of_dementia_in_a/,What do I do with my suspicions of dementia in a parent?

"hi all, my grandfather 93 years old has dementia that has been progressing fairly quickly. i even notice a big difference in the past 2 weeks. my question is: how can i know what is his dementia progressing vs delirium? he had an episode of delirium in september, and again 3 weeks ago but the hospital didn’t catch it and they assumed he had covid even if he has zero symptoms. pcr and rapid tests all came back negative and they sent him home. he is extremely intelligent and if you don’t know him you wont notice the extent of his confusion. he basically tells the same story over and over again about how he was a microbiologist and could have worked in a hospital but ended up vice-dean of medicine at our university etc etc this past week he has become completely obsessed with a watch that was “stolen” and he sleeps a lot during the day. he called me an hour ago and couldn’t tell me the name of the residence where he was (unusual), apparently had called the reception at the residence because he wanted a list of all the employees that were working easter (when he thinks his watch was taken). the receptionist told him he couldn’t have that information and he got very agitated. he called me to tell me his frustrations and asking for a lawyer wanting to sue the residence."," delirium is acute onset typically caused by infection or potentially miss use of medication or the potential for electrolyte imbalance.dementia would be long lasting.as a registered nurse when i hear from my families, i’m a visiting nurse, that their loved one has a sudden personality or behavior change i think i have delirium versus dementia. and then i start asking questions to try to determine if there’s an infection involved, and electrolyte in balance which can because if there’s frequent loose stools or nausea with vomiting or alcohol misuse or abuse, and then review medications.if the patient is diabetic or has a history of pre-diabetes also checked her blood sugar.as i share this since this is the internet always seek medical attention from the provider.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uewt9c/normal_dementia_progression_or_delirium/,Normal dementia progression or delirium

"i (23 f) am about to graduate with my masters degree in nutrition and am basically guaranteed a position at a local veteran's hospital. i've lived with my family for the duration of college. at first i did it to avoid the expenses of dorming/renting, but it has basically led me into being my 71 year old dad's caregiver. my dad was in a car accident right before i graduated highschool about 6 years ago and had a bad concussion. his memory was a little fuzzy afterward, but totally understandable given the accident. ever since then though, he had been declining and has gotten especially worse the past 2 years. my mom and i have had to take away the car keys and so someone has to drive him to appointments. we have to cook for him because he can't be trusted with a stove or oven, and even basic foods we have to do because he, for example, will not make a sandwich unless we get everything out of the fridge and set it in front of him. he can't be left alone because he will call people non stop on his cell phone and get very agitated. even when he is home he still tries to do this, so then i take his phone, and instead he will constantly ask me for the phone back or where it is. we tried sending him to a senior center during the day while i was at an internship and my mom was at work, but he would call us non stop and tell us he was bored and wanted to come home. and then would also get agitated at the center. we have to lay clean clothes out for him and remind him to take a shower, brush his teeth, etc.     and his most recent development is that if someone is asleep while he is awake, he thinks they are sick and will repeatedly wake them up to ask if they are okay. problem is, he gets up at 5 am and i sleep late (like 10 am). so from 5 am until whenever i get out of bed, he is waking me up every 20 minutes to ask if i'm okay. when i am inevitably tired in the afternoon and want to lay down for a nap, he does the same thing. oh and of course he can do basically no household chores unless he is supervised like a hawk, which at that point it's not really help anymore. i feel like i am taking care of a 6 year old. and well, i'm just sick of all this. it's not like i was never expecting to be a care giver for my parents, just not this early when i am just establishing myself. like my parents really didn't start caring for theirs until they were in their 40s.  i feel like i have no life. if a friend invites me out somewhere, i have to either decline becsuse my dad will be home alone, or i have to arrange for him to go to the senior center and then subject my mom to his torrent of phone calls (and i know i can't just take his phone away then, because then he will harass one of the supervisors their to call my mom for him). and now my mom doesn't want me to move out because, well, she can't care for my dad on her own, and so i have no privacy at home to have a relationship with someone. if i did ever move out i feel like she will have no choice but to put him in a snf, which i don't ever want as i spent part of my internship working at one and they are just sad and pathetic.i have a younger brother, but he moved out years ago and is not going to come back to be a caregiver as he just got offered a full time position at a lab he works at. nor should he have to be a caregiver at 22. i'm not sure what the point of this post is. i guess i am just ranting."," i sympathize with you  especially at a young age while trying to get your life started, then life goes not so fast. i'm older but in the same boat, had to move out of my appartment move back home to take care of mom all because she didn't have her legal work in order. it's a mess. i'll be here for at least a year. also greatly sympathize with the interrupted sleep, my mom while i'm sleeping will ask me until i wake up if i'm asleep.  just leave me the fuck alone for 4 hrs please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/udzus3/i_was_just_getting_my_life_together_and_now_i_am/,I was just getting my life together and now I am a care giver.

mom has stage 5 dementia and cataracts. doctor says he doesn't think it's best to do the surgery because he thinks she will mess with her incision or not do well with a patch. he changed her glasses script and told me to bring her  back in a year. it was an ordeal to get her there. has anyone's family member with dementia done well with cataract surgery? i don't want her vision to get worse; as it will affect the dementia and add to the confusion i'm sure., i can't comment in regards to the procedure itself however her ability to tolerate the installation of eye drops for several weeks post procedure will factor in as well.  do you think she will respond positively to the instillation of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops etc. 2-4 times a day following the surgery?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ud6v6z/mom_has_dementia_and_cataracts/,Mom Has Dementia and Cataracts
"my mom is stage 5/6 alz. i’m her only daughter. she’s a covert narcissist and i have adhd. she’s always relied on my struggles with adhd to fit her narrative about how hard her life has been just being my mother. i’ve always rejected the manipulation with avoidance and dissociation. this has translated to my mom telling everyone that i dont like her and dont want to be around her and she cant rely on me to be there for her when she needs care, which she knows is bullshit because i have told her repeatedly that just because she cant live in my house doesnt mean i wont take care of her. she does this as a ploy for sympathy and a way to keep me isolated so that i can focus only on her. im almost 100% that narcissism is directly linked to dementia so im sure some of you can relate. anyways - now her pity party stories and manipulation tactics have created real consequences and i’m at my wits end waiting for aps and my lawyer to move with a purpose. my moms husband of 20 years passed in early feb and left her with his sister. he had late stage copd but he ultimately died of covid after his sister gave it to him when they drove down to get my parents without telling anyone the day after christmas. before he died, i had never met or seen this woman. she decided they should move to her house last september and i found out bc i just happened upon a facebook post. a month later they decided to stay and again, i was notified with the rest of the world via facebook. i tried to talk to my stepdad multiple times about including me and keeping me informed in their decisions and what is going on and he apologized and said he would. then two days after xmas their hospice nurse called saying that she was at their house for their appt and their car was gone and their door was padlocked. no one could get ahold of them until we said we were going to call the police and then 2 minutes later the phone rings and they tell us they moved. i couldnt make a trip until early feb and by that time, my stepdad had passed and they had given all the legal everything to his sister. since they moved to her house, she has been a nightmare. she wont give me phone numbers and addresses. she refuses to discuss any of my moms finances with me. they decided to put her in a home, found a place, paid for it, and had a move in date before they ever told me anything at all. she’s been making my mom travel every week and stay with different people and when it was my turn, she sent her away with me with no atm card and no id. my mom has been having regular anxiety attacks when she forced to sleep in all these weird places and this lady just blows it off. i told her that i wanted to move my mom to a place closer to me and asked to discuss all my moms money and she said she wasnt comfortable discussing my moms finances with anyone. she wont show me any docs. she wont tell me whats going on with moms money. she has control of my mom and stepdads house. and now she wont give me my moms new phone number in her new facility - its a private number and the facility says they cant give it out. so i called adult protective services and now they’re going to investigate. im waiting for a lawyer to call me back. but these coupe of days where i’m not able to check on my mom and this woman could be doing or saying anything to smear me, i feel sick to my stomach. how can people do this to their kids?!?! these two dont even like each other and it feels like im just the scapegoat for both of them. i love my mom and i never could have imagined that she would just write her life over to a virtual stranger that she doesnt trust or like just to spite me because i said she cant live in my house. i will never do that to my kids. i feel horrible, conflicted, angry, disappointed, disrespected, sad. im just deflated and confused because all i ever wanted was for my mom to love me- and she just cant."," i'm so sorry.  you're doing the right thing for your mother, to get her help, but this is out of the goodness of your own heart.  from what you're saying she doesn't deserve your help, but you're going to give it anyway.  i think that's the best way to look at it and keep your sanity.  you're not a bad daughter, you never were.  don't let your adhd trick you into feeling guilty or responsible.  take care of yourself here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ud3n42/elder_abuse_and_nok_rights/,Elder Abuse and NoK rights
"i have just been told this and it’s now so apparent. i hated my life and wanted to die so bad, but i couldn’t find a way i felt comfortable ending myself with. i would’ve done something like an opioid but i never had a place to get it, so i chose diphenhydramine. i poisoned myself everyday with usually around a gram of diphenhydramine for if my memory is correct about 7 months. i thought it would kill me quickly, like with cardiac arrest or something. it became apparent to everyone around me that i wasn’t going to die from a heart attack or seizure, but that i was declining mentally instead, and fast. i was so isolated during my use due to laying in bed all day i never noticed too much impairment aside from forgetting things a lot. since almost everyday i have some sort of mental breakdown about how i’m not doing enough with my life, i tried to get out again and put in an effort to function like everyone else. that’s when it became apparent. my voice was so frail and timid, and i could never find the words i was looking for or would just completely forget what we were talking about, and completely freeze up like a classic alzheimer’s patient. the most scary thing is i will be walking sometimes and before i know it i’m in a completely different place with no memory of getting there, it’s an absolutely terrifying realization. my mom has seen these effects and it’s become apparent to me that i have managed to kill myself, but this will be a slow and agonizing death for me and everyone who cares about me. i am so terrified. i don’t want to die anymore, and especially put my poor family through this. the doctors say i have given myself drug induced dementia from dph addiction, and i am so scared that i may have just lost my life. i will be on acetylcholinasterase inhibitors very shortly."," omg gosh mate well that sucks, what do your therapists / counsellors say?   sorry you feel so badly about your life, that's sad.    is there any chance you can go to a rehab facility?    sounds like you might need some pretty intensive therapy right?    if you're going to college, there must be some support groups around that you could join, as well?   like ptsd support groups, depression anxiety dark thoughts... bloody hell taking  acetylcholinasterase inhibitors at 18yrs old, you need to get yrself off all these shite pharmaceuticals before yr adult life has even started, stop using bandaids to try patch over problems that are not being addressed at the source - go therapy!!    best of luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ucy230/im_18_and_ive_given_myself_dementia/,I’m 18 and I’ve given myself dementia.
"i thought perhaps this form might help some folk with communicating their lo condition to doctors / medical / care industry staff  -- from fb page &lt; dementia : the journey ahead &gt;while we were searching for an accurate diagnosis in the late 90's, our family practitioner attempted to treat my husband’s agitation and behavioral issues with a drug called ativan. ativan, which goes by the generic name of lorazepam, is an anti-anxiety drug used for the management of anxiety disorders associated with depression. our physician was not aware that many dementia patients have an unfavorable response when given this medication. for this reason, avoid medications such as valium, xanax, and ativan if you suspect frontotemporal degeneration (ftd), as they may create more problems than they solve.  my warning does not apply to all dementia patients.   dishonesty (fiblets) and distraction has its rewards when caring for a dementia patient; namely, reducing patient agitation and caregiver stress.  if you are experiencing agitation problems with your loved one please fill out the agitation inventory sheet below and give it to your loved ones physician. please deal with this problem before it gets out of hand and someone gets hurt...it can and does happen... more than you realise.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ucs5t8/interesting_post_on_agitation_of_yr_loved_one/,Interesting post on agitation of yr loved one
"i ask because, months after my dad's death and almost a year after i put him in memory care, i'm still having a lot of issues.for example: i have trouble sleeping at night. i snap awake at every sound, everything suddenly on high alert. i never used to, but then dad stopped sleeping at night and started getting up to shenanigans. (he tended to destroy things. or try to bolt into the night because the fbi were after him. or whatever.)my temper is also frayed. i'm burned out. i have no patience. i also can't seem to stop reliving what went on. i walk into the house and i almost see him again. i have trouble going into the room that was his bedroom, because it brings back all kinds of unpleasant memories.i do try to remember better times, but the total insanity of dementia overshadows it all. i am in therapy, but it doesn't seem to be helping a lot, because the thoughts/flashbacks/insomnia are all still there.but i always thought of ptsd being a thing you suffer after being in war, or suffering attempted murder. like, serious trauma. not from caregiving, which is traumatic in little ways but nothing like listening to bombs fall on your neighbor.so, has anyone had any experience of this? if so, what did you do? i've been drinking more than is good for me just to drown all of these thoughts out, and i really need a better solution.", so very true experiencing  the same thing can b so  tiresome .,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ucrwd2/can_dementia_caregiving_cause_ptsd/,Can dementia caregiving cause PTSD?
"so last year my paternal grandmother moved in with my parents from out-of-state. my father had gone out to take care of her since she started developing dementia and has had a hoarding problem that led to several house fires when she was living alone. she's also had at least two falls since living out here with my parents.in the past year, we've seen several different doctors and specialists, and the two conclusions that have been made is that she has lewy body dementia and/or a mild form of psychosis (i.e. doctor described her psychosis by saying that *""she sees the world differently that us""*). my mother is retired and does most of the care for her (e.g. medications, appointments, making sure she eats, taking her to social events, and so on), but my mother has severe panic anxiety and depression (i know she's contemplated suicide several times before during her panic attacks). the stress of dealing with everything with my grandmother has really taken a toll on her, and i've come over a few times to find her in tears because she doesn't know what to do and it feels like we aren't getting anywhere with the doctors and social workers who were supposed to help us find a place for my grandmother. it's been over a year of appointments now, as well as a few home visits from social workers and nurses, and nothing has changed. last we heard from anyone was back in january.i want my grandmother to get the care that she needs, but it also really pisses me off seeing how hard this has been on my mother while my father's been pretty much useless since he has no interest in helping his mother - and he has power of attorney in this situation. so i've started stepping in recently to alleviate some of the stress on my mother, but my grandmother really needs some professional care that we aren't equipped to provide for her. what concerns me is that, to my understanding, my grandmother hasn't reapplied for medicaid since coming out here to live with my parents. my family is pretty low-income and we can't afford even a single month of paying for an assisted living facility for her. so our options are limited. i just want the best for everyone, but the situation needs to change soon because i'm not sure how much more of this my mother can take. is there anything that we can do? any government groups we can reach out to expedite this process and get the financial assistance we need?"," i am just sending you hugs, good thoughts and blessings. you are trying to help and that is wonderful. you are a blessing to your family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uce6eu/need_some_urgent_help/,[deleted by user]
"i went low contact with my mom in 2017 because she was becoming more and more toxic to be around. she was always complaining about my dad and was rude about both my and my brother's relationships. i saw her on holidays and birthdays and that was about it. in 2019 i figured out that it was likely early onset dementia and told my dad to get her seen. i told my mom to go get seen. and they didn't do anything.in early december her mental state dropped off a cliff. she left the house and called my brother because there was a strange man in her house. it was my dad.  she's isolating herself more and more and when we go over, it's like there's a wall in front of her. her personality is just flat.my husband and i had our first baby, her first grandchild, a few months ago. she barely cares. and it makes me so angry because if she had gotten seen 3 years ago, they could have possibly slowed the decline. my mom was so excited for grandkids. and honestly, the woman who has met my baby isn't her.she never recognizes my dad anymore, even though she recognizes everyone else including the baby. the past few days she hasn't been eating and hasn't even turned on the tv which is extremely strange for her. i feel like we're in the late stage, and we don't even have a formal diagnosis yet. i don't know what the specialist is going to do, but i feel like now, it's too little, too late."," gosh.  people entering dementia need compassion & understanding, not told they're toxic & cut off, and the carers (your dad) need help, not just given orders or what someone else thinks they should do.  you're making judgements and assumptions there that 'she barely cares'.  maybe she's lost confused and embarrassed.  idk, maybe she is toxic or whatever, so sorry for that.  maybe you ought to access dementia org &/ alzheimers org to get educated about living with dementia, *how to actually help people experiencing losing their mind*, rather than bitch about how she doesn't appreciate your baby enough.  sorry but, just the way your writing comes across, to me.   best of luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ucde6d/my_mom_is_finally_seeing_a_specialist_today/,My Mom is finally seeing a specialist today
"i’m not quite sure if this is the right sub, but i figured i’d give it a try. my mother is 62 years old and has never been known for her great memory, but it’s been steadily getting worse and we’re worried about early onset dementia or something similar. i recently moved for work and don’t speak to my mom as frequently as i did, so the change has been extra apparent for me. i know stuff like this can be genetic, but both of her parents died over twenty years ago so we don’t have any elder relatives to compare to. my brother, my sister, my father, my cousin, and i have all had conversations with each other about how to help my mom but it’s been to no avail. every time someone has tried to bring up the topic with my mother, she gets really defensive and sometimes mean. she seems aware that it’s getting worse, making comments like “what is wrong with me?” when she can’t remember something but whenever we suggest talking to a doctor she shuts down.i guess my question is, are there any tips for trying to talk to my mom about this and trying to get her some help? or tips for the family so we can better understand what may be happening? i know you can’t help people if they don’t want it, but it’s so hard watching this happen especially when everyone is so hyper aware of it but we still can’t do anything."," my mom was the same, something else had to trigger us bringing her to the doctor. in our case, she had dropped 20 pounds, basically starving herself on accident and the apparent weight loss was leverage to get her seen. unfortunately that doctor we took her to was horrible and extremely unprofessional so we need a second opinion. i was able to schedule an appointment for 4 months later (coming up this monday) and i'm saying it's a referral from the other doctor to to talk about the brain to gut connection since eating and weight is an issue for her. phrasing it differently and not saying its a memory thing might help, best of luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ucbsc7/mom_in_denial_about_losing_memory/,Mom in denial about losing memory
"so i'm in my 40's and my folks (divorced) are in their early 70's.""conversations"" don't exist anymore. my dad is on the computer 24/7 doing nothing but watching the news, it's all he talks about, no original thoughts, nothing personal, visits last no more than 2 hours max because by the end of the 2 hours he's run out of news stories to repeat and then a light goes off in his head and he leaves. other than that it's daily graveyard walks while his dog (who should be put down) shits in the car.with my mom her dementia is more clear and present, she'll have no more than 3 things to say and then play the track list on repeat. last time we went out we heard no less than 30 times that she wants to get out walking more, stopped taking her antidepressants, and people should be wearing masks.. over and over and over. neither of them seem to be able to function well in new situations. my dad's soundbar died and he wanted me to fix it over the phone but wouldn't do anything i asked him to do. he refuses to learn how to use a cellphone, not because its complicated but it's about sending a message that he's superior to people that are addicted to cellphones. took my mom to a restaurant and my spouse had to order for her because she wouldn't even look at the menu, totally overwhelmed.for a long time i resented them (hated even) because they were being stupid, lazy, and even manipulative, neither of them have made good life choices, have any friends, hobbies, or anything.. there's just nothing to these people. age seems to be amplifying the effects where now i'm thinking ok, they are not assholes they just have had dementia since their 50's and now its ramping up.meeting my spouses parents was a real eye opener, they are actually living their life and it's a shocking comparison.if i'm being totally honest a lot of my anger towards my parents is also mixed in with fear that i'm going to be just like them which makes me think about eating a bullet when i turn 60, not that i would.is any of this behavior dementia or can it be chalked up to depression?"," in my experience, mental illnesses go hand in hand and make dementia that much harder.my mom, blind and mentally ill, was my dad's sole caretaker (lewy body dementia). with my mom, the only way i could deal with her was to remind myself that she isn't well herself and most of her mental issues come from her past. i took breaks from her as often as i needed. it sucks, but it is what it is.also anyone can tell you not to worry for yourself - live your life. it's hard. i worry too. so i always look for distractions - for myself, and for my mom. with practice, it gets better.medications are an entirely different monster. anti-depressants i believe are contraindicated with dementia patients. they may be taking meds incorrectly or not at all, and that's bad. my own dad had an elopement at 3am, and we believe my mom probably gave him the wrong meds, because he was totally out of it and there was no other reason (no infections, etc.). these events usually happen without warning, and we're left to try to figure out how to deal with it. there isn't a lot of help out there.i can really feel your anger and it's completely normal and even common. but hard as it is, this is only going to affect you. i hope you can find a way to get past that, sincerely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ucb6wc/2d_parents_early_dementia/,[deleted by user]

"don't know if anyone has experienced this, my grandmother is in mid stage, moving into late. we can have an amazing dinner with her getting to see her great-grandkids, she will have a wonderful time, but the next day she forgets it happened.  sometimes, if you remind her, she will partially remember it, other times she has no recollection.  but the moment she is told someone in the family is sick, hurt, needs help, it's like her mind reverts back a decade.  six months ago when my mom had surgery, she called everyday to check on her.  she didn't need to be reminded or prompted.  a few months ago when her great-grandchild had covid, same thing.  yesterday, i was pretty sick.  i called up her and my grandfather to let the know that i was, and wouldn't be stopping by.  twenty minutes later, they were dropping off some fresh cut fruit for me and a bottle of juice.  talked to my grandfather on the phone and he said it wasn't his idea.  when i called, she was having a bad day.  laying on the couch, not dressed at noon time, confused about where she was.  the moment she found out i was sick though, my grandfather said she got up, she put on her clothes, went into the kitchen, got out some fruit from the fridge, cut it up, bagged it up, and told him her to my house to leave it on my porch.then this morning, i get an phone call from her, she's asking how i'm feeling, asking if i ate the fruit, telling me to make sure i drink a lot of liquids, and she just comes off as sounding very cognitive during the entire conversation.  like i said in the title, it feels both comforting and depressing at the same time.  it's just so insane how the mind works.  her mind has been breaking down for years now.  on my daily visits i'm asked the same set of questions every time.  when sundowning she gets angry, agitated, doesn't even recognize my grandfather most nights.  but **she** is still there.  it's as if the moment she hears any one of us is sick, hurt, in trouble, her brain just uses everything it has left to kick into overdrive for a time period in order for her to focus on doing what she did for her entire life, take care of family.", maybe because it gives her a sense of purpose. don’t feel depressed about it. i’m sure she loves taking care of her loved ones.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ubw3gg/its_both_comforting_and_depressing_how_much/,"It's Both Comforting and Depressing How Much Better My Grandmother Gets When Someone Needs ""Help"""
"my dad—who has dementia—is currently in the hospital for various reasons too complicated to get into here. the point is, his health is now stable, and the wheels are in motion for him to be discharged to a long-term-care facility today or tomorrow. that’s wonderful news for my mom who has been his sole caretaker for the past decade or so. in addition to having dementia, he also has a below-the-knee amputation, diabetes, copd, and numerous other chronic health problems. she’s been the one who risks injuring herself multiple times a day when he falls while trying to transfer from his recliner to his wheelchair. she’s been the one to bear the brunt of his mood swings. she’s been the one to clean up his feces. she’s been the one he wakes up every two or three hours at night, for one reason or another. i mean, you guys all know the drill. the thing is, mom had a choice between placing him in a short-term facility with a high-degree of physical rehabilitation (for about a week before being transferred to long-term care or home) or a long-term facility with a low-degree of physical rehab (indefinitely). she close the long-term option, *and the hospital’s care manager and a rep from the short-term place are guilt-tripping her for it.* they honestly don’t seem to grasp that he’s never getting better, or that taking care of him 24/7 is killing my mom, or that any effort he puts into rehab in a facility will never be duplicated of his own volition if he’s at home. similarly, many of the doctors, nurses, and therapists who have cycled through his room have radiated this naive positivity that makes me, frankly, furious. the man hasn’t used his prosthetic leg since he got it almost a decade ago, he keeps mistaking the trash can for a window, and he’s told my mom he wants to stab her. stop acting like mom should cheerfully take him home and nurse him back to health. when can she live *her* life again?", these people are just glorified warehouse workers trying to maintain their inventories. tell them to stfu.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ubt03h/why_do_some_healthcare_professionals_seem_so/,Why do some healthcare professionals seem so wrapped up in fixing the dementia patient’s body that they remain blind to the realities of the patient’s mind—and it’s impact on caregivers?

"my step-father has been a struggle for me. before dementia he was an alcoholic, bi polar, abusive monster.   present day, it’s gotten even worse.  he still drinks a case of beer or whatever he can get his hands on. he is diabetic as well and thinks no doctor can tell him what to do.  he buys alcohol with money given to him by his other children and sometimes my mom because she just gives in to avoid conflict. he has destroyed parts of this house usually when he is manic. which could last for weeks. today he is currently hoarding all the potted plants into his bed room and spray painting them.i’m autistic so i live at home with my mother and step father. my mother is an attorney, so most of the day she is at work. i work from home and the last 3 years have been hell. i’ve all of a sudden am the care giver to this man that i hate.  he has 3 children from other marriages and none of them give a shit about his condition.  i feel like everyone is gaslighting me when i try and explain what is going on at home. no one listens to me. my family knows that i hate this man but i’d never not care for a person who is in need. i just wish something could be done because i can’t handle this much longer."," oh gosh a\_lion, so sorry that really sucks, i feel for you, what a nightmare.  my sister is ex-alcoholic, has abusive (unaddressed) mental health issues (she lives with me & alzhms mum who i'm carer for), so yeh, i can relate to being stuck with abusive monster.  grrrrrr....i hope you can get away for a respite rest, or even somehow move out, find a new place to live or at least stay for a while?   i get that you don't want to leave a person in need, but you have zero obligation to being abused - not your monkey not your circus, as the saying goes.his birth-kids & yr mom need to experience for themselves the full story of looking after him 24/7, they need to find some other options or solutions.    contact dementia .org or alzheimers .org for your area, they ought to have some suggestions & advice for how to get through to yr mom & step-kids that he's as difficult & traumatising as he is, that you need to stop being his carer, and for respite / counselling for you, some sort of options for step-dad.take care of yourself, you deserve to be living a happy life, taking care of you.   best of luck!  \* hugs \*",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ubr6ly/my_stepfather_i_need_to_vent/,My step-father ( I need to vent)

"how much longer does mum have / how much worse will it get?   i’m just looking for advice, i guess, or more accurately a rough road map of how the next few weeks or months might go. my mum is 58. she was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer’s 3 years ago but had been suffering symptoms for at least 6 years before that. for months now she’s been unable to speak properly. she’ll say some words but they’re mostly unintelligible. every now and again she’ll smile and wave as if she recognises me. she needs help with pretty much everything—getting up and washed and dressed and eating and moving around and using the toilet. my stepdad does everything for her. he’s an absolute saint. they do have carers go in every day to help him. these last few weeks she’s taken a worse turn. she’s currently in hospital on a drip (because she hasn’t eaten properly for weeks) and under sedation—because she’s been becoming violent, lashing out at my stepdad and the carers and even the dog. i can’t overstate how unlike her this is. especially the dog—she’s the most gentle and animal friendly person you can imagine. or she was. a ct scan has shown aggressive dying off of brain cells. i’m getting this all second hand from my stepdad. as her designated carer he’s allowed to be up there with her but no one else is. the only reason i mention this is because i have a feeling this is it, this is the end times, but that he doesn’t really want to say so. i don’t know how specific the doctors would have been about his? but rapid dying off of brain cells sounds like the end doesn’t it? when she’s stable they’re going to send her home. they’re helping my stepdad get a hospital bed set up for her downstairs. he’s determined to have her home, which is fine, i know she’ll be happier there and he cares for her well, i just can’t even imagine the toll this is having on him. the reason i’m writing this is mainly to vent it, i guess, but also to ask if anyone can give us a rough idea of what to expect? how long we can expect to have her home before she’s gone, how much worse this is likely to get? anyone that answers please do be honest, don’t sugarcoat it—i’ve always had a good relationship with my mum, i love her very much but i’m sure she’s ready for this suffering to be over. thank you."," brain cell death basically means her brain is shrinking and that’s why she’s acting off. parts of her brain that used to be connected to each other can’t communicate as well. it’s probably rapid as in shrunk a bit since the last time she had a scan done, not like her brain is actively deteriorating as they watch it. i don’t think that it can necessarily be guessed how long she has based on that as far as i know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ubem0c/near_the_end_how_much_worse_might_this_get/,Near the end.

"really hoping someone can help! my dad is 70 years old and has always been exceptionally intelligent, though also a textbook narcissist and not always very nice. last month he started acting very out of character, rambling for hours and being generally manic. he ended up going to the er as he realized something was wrong; discovered he was having frontal lobe seizures and was prescribed an anti-convulsant. however, due to the personality changes and diminished cognitive ability he displayed, was also prescribed an anti-psychotic, which he has adamantly refused to take. after a couple other er visits/dr. appointments, it was clear this was more than just seizures. some of his visit summaries/med charts specifically cite dementia, one in particular ""aggression due to dementia."" his condition continues to deteriorate, but he has decided he had a singular neurological incident and nothing else is wrong with him. everyone is against him, the doctors committed malpractice and are colluding with his wife (my mom), he's going to sue, etc etc. he has effectively kicked my mom out of their house and told her they are getting a divorce. unfortunately, this isn't a new thing and probably should have happened a long time ago. the main problem is that he refuses to go back to any doctor to get an actual assessment/diagnosis, won't take his prescribed medication, and is overtly hostile with anyone who brings up his medical care. he and my mom have done well over the years financially, but he has always taken care of all of their assets and business. they own several rental properties, have multiple bank accounts, stocks, iras, etc but she does not have access to any of them. i have found her a short term rental so she's not on the street, but we are completely unable to have a rational discussion with him about how she's going to support herself. i have no idea if he is paying his mortgages or other bills, filed his taxes, etc. it's not likely things are getting taken care of as every day he seems to slip further away. i know she needs a divorce attorney, but i'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation-- are there divorce lawyers that deal with this type of situation? how should we approach him, if at all? he is currently alone in a big house by himself, just deconstructing mentally but won't allow anyone to help since he ""doesn't have a problem."" i have no idea what i can do to help someone with these symptoms, let alone who has always been a difficult person to deal with anyway. just kind of desperately reaching out into the internet ether and hoping someone can give some guidance.", could be encephalitis? there's always alternative diagnosis's.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ubcsgt/dad_wont_go_to_doctor_to_get_diagnosis/,Dad won't go to doctor to get diagnosis

"this is my second post here. and i appreciate all the support i got on my last post for not making me feel like i’m insane. 4/22 my father fell and hit his head (on blood thinners so we immediately called ems) he has a laceration from it. he blamed my child who wasn’t even in the room w him. 4/23 at 5 pm my time we caught him falling and he only hit his butt, because we caught him mid fall. at that time i took his cane away and enforced a walker only rule. at 930pm he fell and hit his head again. he tried to blame it on my 17 mo old who had been asleep for 2 hours. this time he is admitted, even though the attending wanted to discharge him i protested and won. this is his 6th hospital visit in 8 weeks. i’m asking the hospital to put us in touch w a social worker and care management worker so we can place him in a home or facility till we can get him somewhere permanent. (we have a meeting w a care placement coordinator monday so we’re already on it.) i’m not gonna lie. money is super tight. but he has bcn advantage hmo and from what i’ve read they should cover it especially since he has zero funds. at this point from my self it’s basically 24/7 care and watching. my mother in law and wife cover when i’m sleeping (i haven’t been able to work for over 2 years pre pandemic cause of it) what do i need to say or tell the dr’s to look for to have him put in a rehab facility or snf? im i’m michigan btw. so idk what that affects care wise. but we’re just done. we can’t do it anymore. we spent 400k on a new build house built to his needs and he has been here less than a month and has deteriorated immensely and had all these falls. (it’s a one story ranch style house with tons of items out in place, grab bars, rails, etc.)im at my wits end."," how many days has your dad been in the hospital? usually they need to be in the hospital for a 3-day qualifying inpatient hospital stay. then they can be transferred to a skilled nursing facility (snf) that is covered by medicare. but the reason for the snf is for ""rehabilitation"" and physical therapy, etc.but medicare only pays for short stays at a snf. but once your dad is at the snf, they can't kick him out because medicare runs out. you can apply for medicaid which will pay for long term care at a snf. but if he doesn't qualify for medicaid, then he needs to transfer to a private pay assisted living facility.you definitely need to speak to an elder care attorney. you mentioned paying $400,000 for a new house. that could be a problem with qualifying for medicaid. the elder care attorney can help you with that information.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uapdtf/i_come_seeking_advice/,I come seeking advice.
"my mother is turning 60 this year and i’ve never been concerned about the state of her mental health other than her severe depression and crippling anxiety. a couple months ago my brother told me to keep an eye on her, said she was “airheady lately”. i hadn’t noticed anything of the sort not till now. my mom has never had much trouble finding things other than her car keys. but a few weeks ago, she came in my room asking where her purse was i asked did you check under your bed or your car she said she had looked everywhere. she started canceling cards and i was just as convinced as she was that it was missing. until i went out to her car to get my charger i saw her purse sitting on the floor of the passenger side. i’m thinking in what world could she have missed that. so this is already unusual behavior. but last night and tonight is what really has me worried. last night i was doing my hair in her bathroom and she asked if i had work the next day i told her yes i go in at 2. within the hour she asks me again, “do you work tomorrow” i laughed a little and said yeah you just asked me that. she looked at me absolutely bewildered, she said no i didn’t i don’t recall kept saying she didn’t remember and i’m assuming joking accused me of gaslighting her. maybe i’m being dramatic but does this behavior show signs i should be concerned about?", have her draw a clock on a sheet of paper and put # in place and the ask her to draw any time you decide 4:15 5:30 you  will have a strong indication after seeing the drawing.my mom has dementia  the clock was one of the test,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uap2o2/im_worried_about_my_mom/,I’m worried about my mom

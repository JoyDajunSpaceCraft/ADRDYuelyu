"here is the link to my original post last week:i had been telling my mom she had a podiatrist appointment the day i took her to her new home. that morning she told me she was sick and i had to cancel the appointment. she always did this with my dad, to get out of leaving the house. i calmly insisted she had to go so she wouldn’t end up with ingrown toenails and an infection. you see her big toenails were almost 2 inches long because she wouldn’t let anyone cut them. so, begrudgingly she got out of bed and started to dress. two days before i had my brother take her for a ride so i could stay at the house and pack her things. i hid the suitcase until very early monday morning and my brother placed it in his car. he went to the memory care home the day before she was to arrive to sign all the paperwork and delivered her belongings in advance. so, now it’s tuesday morning and we have to arrive by 11:00. i get mom dressed and cleaned up and in the car. she keeps complaining that she isn’t going to like the doctor and if she doesn’t she will leave immediately. i change the subject and started telling her what a wonderful mother she has always been and i just love her so much. she tells me she loves me too and she is so lucky to have two incredible children. we continue to reminisce for the half hour drive. just before we arrive i tell her i just noticed the gas tank is almost empty and i will have to fill it while she gets her toenails fixed. no problem. when we arrive several staff members are waiting outside. they greet her warmly and enthusiastically, calling her by name and saying how beautiful she looks (my mom loves flattery.). they help her inside and sit her at a table, continuing to chat with her while i speak briefly with the administrator. i then wave goodbye to her and say “love you, mom, see you soon”, and i leave. and i left. some might call me a coward for not seeing her to her room, but i knew what would follow. after the two previous weeks taking care of her 24/7 with the shock of losing my father unexpectedly, i could not take another emotional tirade. that evening, a neighbor called to let me know she had been up to the same facility, where her mother was currently in hospice. she said she saw my mom sitting at the main table enjoying her dinner. i did not expect that! i expected her to pull a hunger strike. they had told us to not try and contact our mom for awhile, but i decided to call the next afternoon just to get an update from one of the staff. a nurse told me she was having a bad time because she was accusing them of stealing her dog. we had the dog at home. she asked if i would like to talk to her which surprised me because i assumed she now hated me. it took me a few minutes to convince her her dog was fine and we were taking very good care of her. i asked her how she was being treated and she said everyone was very nice. i asked her about her dinner the night before and said it was lovely. there were more questions and demands about her dog, and then i told her i loved her and she said she loved me too. i said i would see her soon. that was it. i returned to my parent’s house and updated my brother. we finally had a restful night after more than two weeks of mind numbing stress. i returned to my home across the state today with her dog safely in my care and will rest for a few weeks before i return to help my brother with the house. all in all this went much better than i ever expected. i know my mom is safe and i know she is cared for so much better than we could have cared for her. and when the time is right, i will visit her and maybe bring the dog along … maybe. i want to thank everyone on this sub for. the love and encouragement i received on my previous posts. i know the battle is not over, but i can sigh with relief, at least for awhile.", what a sense of relief. i'm glad it went well,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nmweub/follow_up_to_mom_goes_to_memory_care/,Follow up to Mom Goes to Memory Care

"this is purely anecdotal.my mom's doctor said we should get a gamma light and have her use it for an hour every day so we did. my dad is my mom's primary caretaker and he is such a freaking turd that he can't even get himself to do it every day.. but even not doing it every day we have noticed an improvement in her symptoms! she doesn't have as many panic, sundowning type of moments, and she doesn't seem as manic anymore.i totally suggest trying it. there are some studies that suggest it may help. the lights are cheap enough and you can order them online. also you can do it with gamma 40 hertz medication sounds on alexa (if you have an alexa she will play it if you ask) and that is supposed to help as well (all supposedly!)i just want to suggest this for anyone looking to try something that may or may not help.", i don’t understand. how are using the gamma light? are you supposed to put it up against the head or something? thanks for sharing this!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nmpkqr/gamma_wave_light_therapy_our_results/,Gamma Wave light therapy-- our results
"brand new to this sub so please forgive me if i make any mistakes. also on mobile so please forgive formatting.i feel like i should start by saying that my mom and i have lost several different family members (some dead, some just gone) to several different types of dementia and have both been caregivers in some form or fashion. not that we are experts by any means but we know enough to know when to worry.my mom’s friend d (74f) has no children, no partner and no extended family. she has a neighbor that helps with her yard work and taking her trash to the curb and stuff like that, a financial advisor who helps looks after her assets, and my mom. over the past 10 or so years my mom has gradually gone from weekly phone calls and occasionally meeting for lunch to driving d to all of her appointments (doctor, hair salon, etc.) and having to fix all of d’s “technology issues” which started with a crypto-locker, then there was an “amazon” scam, then a handful of facebook scams... basically d clicking on links that she shouldn’t have and my mom dealing with the fallout for her. in the past year these incidents have increased in both frequency and severity, even though we’ve both told her multiple times how to identify and avoid harmful emails/texts/phone calls. at this point my mom has most if not all of d’s logins and password info even going so far as when d updates a password she calls mom to tell her.mom and i recently (in the last month) discussed mutual concern for d’s potentially declining mental state. we both think that she is showing signs of some form of dementia, and hindsight being 20/20, has been for some time.today d called my mom saying she was having trouble resetting her username for her main bank account. d claims she tried to reset it online but was told she had to go to a branch. when she went to the branch they told her she had to do it online. so now d is all worked up and flustered and frustrated and freaking out because she needs to get online to pay her bills. mom agrees to meet d at a different branch office (d refused to go back to the one she had already been to) and thankfully they got a rep who was both patient and compassionate. long story short, d forgot her username and new (about 2 months ago) password, rep provided correct username and mom had the new password. they get it all sorted. mom &amp; d go to leave and d is still noticeably agitated so mom is concerned about her driving. mom offers to drive d home and arrange to get d’s car there too. d gets confrontational, mom backs down. d gets in her car but can’t remember how to get out of the parking lot. she calls mom (who is also still in the parking lot) and mom again tries to talk d out of driving. d’s having none of that so mom leads her back to the main road (literally 2 turns) and lets her go. d made it home safely.so this brings me to the two main reasons for this post. 1) i’m not sure if i’m projecting due to my previous experiences but it really seems like she has early signs of dementia and has started escalating rapidly in the last year, and 2) we have literally zero authority in any way, shape or form but there’s also (as far as we know) no one else who does. how do we help d?(i have more examples of signs but this post is already super long and i figured today’s events were most relevant)"," first, decide how involved your mom wants to be in the rest of d's life. does she have anyone else close to her at all who might step in or be a problem if your mom steps in? decide if your mom could/would be willing to be poa and medical poa. then talk to d about it sometime when she's calm and coherent. if it were me, i'd use the incident with the bank as a way to bring up the topic. explain that your mom could handle that sort of thing for her a while lot easier if she has poa. i honestly wouldn't get senior services involved until that's squares away, once she's got the standing to make inquiries or if d doesn't agree to it and you think action needs to be taken.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nmosbr/family_friend_has_no_family_and_showing_signs_of/,"Family friend has no family and showing signs of escalation, need advice."
"my first reddit post.  yay!  my mom has dementia and it's been hard caring for her in our home.  she has always been a clean freak so it makes sense that she enjoys her showers.  i even help her take them, but what is frustrating is that she will try to take numerous showers after her daily shower and i have tried everything from taking before and after shower pics and videos to leaving her dirty clothes in the shower, but she argues that she hasn't taken her shower yet.  i show her proof and she doesn't believe it.  then she sneaks in a shower.  it would not be a huge deal except that we live in a desert state.  water waste is a no no.  she likes to take 20 to 30 minute showers if i don't stop her sooner.  that's a lot of water down the drain.  also, she loves hot, hot water which in turn strips her ancient skin of its natural oils and makes her itchy all over.  every time i tell her, she responds by saying that she is wants to move back to her own home.  honestly, if i thought she was capable of living by herself, i would gladly move her back, but she is physically fragile and mentally demented.  unless she becomes physically violent or totally forgets me, i do not want her going in to a memory care facility because she doesn't speak english, can't read and can't write.  i gladly welcome suggestions on how to stop her from taking excessive showers.  otherwise, it is just easier to let her waste the water and pay overage fines."," is there only one bathroom with a shower and are there other bathrooms with a toilet?  if so, install a lock only you can open.  one that locks people from entering but not exiting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nmo194/need_advice_to_stop_the_showers/,Need advice to stop the showers

"i recently posted [about my dad]( going to rehab and long term care.we’ve been talking to his care team a little more, and we think we’ve figured out what’s causing his dementia: the liver failure mentioned in the last post. in hindsight all the physical and mental symptoms match up. it’s also what’s going to kill him.my dad has a [meld score]( in the mid 20s, giving him around a 1 in 5 chance of dying in the next 3 months. his hospitalist today said we are looking at 6-12 months most likely, maybe up to 2 years if we are lucky and his progression is slow. and obviously things could progress faster too.my dad doesn’t know any of this yet. we told him about rehab today. he initially threw a fit, but he’s coming around to the idea. i guess we will cross the long term care bridge when we get there.i guess where i’m at now is whether we should tell him about his prognosis. i want him to take care of himself and make what time he has left as meaningful as possible. i’m not sure if telling him would be better or worse, especially with the dementia.me personally, i would want to know. but my dad is deathly afraid of death (pun intended). i can see ethical reasons either way, and i’m just stuck in a bit of a moral quandary."," i'm sorry you and your family are going through this.unfortunately i don't think there's a clear path on that, like you said there are valid reasons either to tell or not to tell.normally i'd want to know, or be told, at least once, so i get the chance to try and process it, and allow some closure to my family. from there should i be reminded of it when i forget? even if i took the news well i don't think i'd like to be reliving that moment.on the other hand if i'm going to react poorly and it's only going to cause pain, fear and confusion i hope they would just reassure me with some story why i'm there and let it proceed as peacefully as possible and relieve themselves of any guilt they might be feeling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nlril9/should_you_tel_your_loved_one_theyre_dying/,Should you tel your loved one they’re dying?

"hello. this post is not like me but i feel like i need it. i was raised by my grandparents from the time i was 8 till 18. my mom left me and my brother and they took us in. my dad was a jobless alcoholic during that time. growing up, my grandma was always distant. she suffered from mental illness and depression. there were times where she would stay in bed for months, she never loved us unconditionally, it was always conditional. since i moved out and started college, she hasn’t called me once. i love her like a mother, yet experience so much confusion. her dementia is getting really bad, she has forgotten so much. for her, however, at this point she is more paranoid. despite how distant she is, i don’t think much of it. we never celebrated holidays, she never told us she loved us, she’s like that to everybody. still i go over there maybe once every few months. this time was different. she said my dad doesn’t live with them anymore (he was because like i said he’s a drunk). i simply expressed how i think that is for the best. she felt as if i was attacking her son and lost it on me. she called me every name in the book, called me worthless, and said i’ll never amount to anything. my face went white, i was so hurt. she said my dad is an amazing man and with every bit of courage i had in me i told her i’m 4 times the man my dad is (he beat my mom, never worked, done nothing for us, and does drugs). she pointed her finger in my face and told me to leave her house (the house i grew up in) and never return. before this, i never knew where my dad got it from, but seeing the wantonness on her face, i now know where he gets his anger. i went straight to my car and cried, my grandfather said her meanness has been a constant lately. that she simply forgets losing her cool and acts like nothing happened.how do i get past that? how do i not take it personally? i want to go back but i can’t put myself through that again. i am not worthless. everything i do i do to make her proud, she was an educator so i am in school to be one. her calling me nothing might not be my last memory of her but it will forever be the most prominent and i’m angry."," i live with this neatly daily with and from my wife. all the advice about not arguing is right on target, but we know that’s so much easier said than done. be well - you are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nl9dvj/grandma_called_me_worthless/,[deleted by user]

"my grandfather is just shy of 95 and has moderately severe dementia. my almost 87 year old grandmother and i are his primary caretakers, and my parents help out as often as they can. my grandfather's older brother, who also had severe dementia, died about a month ago from various health issues and old age. he and my grandfather were extremely close and used to talk on the phone and visit each other once a week before covid hit. although talking on the phone was challenging for them because of their dementia and significant hearing loss, they never missed their weekly phone calls. although my grandfather has virtually no short-term memory and has lost most of his long-term memories aside from his childhood through early adulthood (he still remembers who some of his family is), he seems to know that he and his brother haven't talked in awhile. when his brother was still alive, he would ask my grandmother about once a week to call him so they could talk. ever since his brother died, he has been asking to talk to him everyday, multiple times a day. and a few weeks ago, he said that he was really worried about his brother because they hadn't talked in so long. now i'm going to give some backstory: last summer, my grandfather became terribly ill with a urinary tract infection that resulted in extreme dehydration and kidney failure. he spent a week in the hospital and due to covid, we could not visit him. without my grandmother, he barely ate and became weaker and weaker. we ultimately decided to bring him home on hospice so that he could pass peacefully in his own bed surrounded by loved ones. he somehow made a miraculous recovery physically, but his dementia is significantly worse. a couple weeks ago, he developed another uti and oral antibiotics weren't helping. we brought him to the hospital again (this time we were allowed to stay) where he got a bunch of iv fluids and iv antibiotics. he was there for 2 days and seemed to be getting worse, so once again, we brought him home and once again, he seems to have made a miraculous recovery. it's only been a few days since he's been home from the hospital, so maybe it's too soon to tell, but his doctor doesn't seem to think it's that surge of energy that people sometimes get before they die. either way, he probably doesn't have long left. his doctors are fairly confident that these utis will continue, plus we just found out that his slow-growing prostate cancer has metastasized to his spine, stomach, and a few other places, and at this point, we've elected palliative care for that. he also does not eat much (which is nothing new) and now weighs only 100 pounds (he's also only about 5'1"" at this point). i guess my point in sharing all this is because i worry that due to his poor health and weakened state, telling him about his brother would deeply upset him and exacerbate his illnesses. my grandmother doesn't want to tell him and keeps lying to him about why he can't talk to his brother. i feel that we should tell him once because he deserves to know, but not revisit it if he asks again because then he would be reexperiencing that trauma over and over again. my hope is that if we tell him once, some part of him will remember and he won't be so worried that he hasn't talked to his brother. anyway, sorry for the long post. any help is much appreciated!", these are my thoughts >> ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nkm6go/should_we_tell_my_grandfather_about_his_brothers/,Should we tell my grandfather about his brother's death?

"dad is 83 and is suffering vascular dementia. he had a stroke last year which has rendered him non-ambulatory. there have been 3 of us who have been the primary caregivers (in his home) for about the past 9 months: my sister (58), my wife and i (60). although unable to walk, his upper body strength remains strong even though his brain does not seem to parse the requests to ""raise"", ""grip"", ""turn loose"" etc. if anything, those requests often result in the opposite muscle reaction. so changing his soiled clothes can often be a battle. especially for my wife who is slight in stature and not nearly as strong as i am. as difficult as the physical aspect can be, the mental side of it is also crushing. the early part of the day (7am - 11am) seems to be less taxing on him and he can generally converse in short bursts. more and more those conversations include seeing flying cars or being in a boat or in business meetings or other obvious hallucinations. later in the day, he regularly insists that he is going home or that he be taken home. he repeats this 100's of times despite all of our efforts to convince him he is home (familiar pictures, rooms, neighbors homes). he has gotten agitated to the point of yelling and cursing at us and even threatening to strike us if he could get his hands on us. on the other hand, he has also hit on my wife on several different occasions, wanting her to go out with him and have some good times together. obviously don't take that seriously, just mention it as an indicator of his mood swings.as i re-read what i've typed above, i realize that i'm including more details than i had originally planned and that i should get to my request for advice and guidance. so, my wife and i both agree that this 24/7 care by the 3 of us is unsustainable. we are totally burned out, it is affecting our health and the health of our marriage, as well as job performance due to lack of sleep. additionally, my sister has different philosophies regarding his meds. she says it turns him into a zombie and resists giving it to him until later in the evening as she preps him for bed. this despite the tremors and anxiety that hit him each day which the pill seems to help. my wife and i both agree that memory care must happen soon and is in the best interest of all parties. dad would get professional medical care rather than the guesswork that takes place now, and our lives would return to some sense of normalcy. my sister, however, disagrees that this is the best route, insisting that he will promptly go downhill taking endless turns for the worst.  i'm currently researching memory care in an effort to present it to her even though i sense that she will take him home with her rather than allow him in memory care. she lives about 3.5 hours away. i should have mentioned earlier that she has power of attorney. any advice on how to deal with this situation? i know my sister is just as exhausted as we are and that will obviously only get worse if she ends up taking him to her house. thanks in advance for any insights you can share."," i think the three of you need to have an in person discussion, and really try to compromise, in order to give your father the same type of care.   i can see where your sister is coming from, a lot of memory care places are rampant with elder abuse.  maybe talking to your sister about hiring someone to help you and your wife out, if he will still be staying with you? it depends on your finical situation though.  i do wonder, why does your sister have poa if she lives so far away?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nk5033/strong_differences_of_opinion_for_care_of_my/,Strong differences of opinion for care of my Father between my sister and me

"as the title says my grandparents are slowly declining mentally due to dementia. i can't even stand to talk to my grandma due to her just looping her conversations, and the more she loops the more i want to break down and cry. my grandpa is practically deaf. he can't speak on the phone because he can't hear. he refuses to wear his hearing aid. he has trouble walking, and can't keep his balance. he falls every week, and goes to the hospital weekly due to him hitting his head. he finally was forced to go to a rehab center for elderly people so he can learn to use a wheelchair... you would think this was a good thing, but i'm afraid it's not. he is very dead set on the fact that people there will steal his stuff, he shoves everything in his underwear... yes his underwear, and is constantly trying to escape. the other day my aunt visited my grandpa, my grandpa told her ""they don't let you leave, once you are in here you stay here forever."", my aunt explained why he was there, and why they wouldn't let him leave, ""just wait, once you try to leave they won't let you."", he is dead set on believing he will never leave this place. my grandmother still thinks i'm 12. this is all just a lot for me to handle. i love them so much, but seeing them descend slowly but surely is overwhelmingly bitter. another thought i have is mental illness runs in my family. i myself am schizophrenic, with major depression, and ptsd. now i'm ashamed because one day this may be me as well. i don't want my girlfriend, and my loved ones to have to see me go through this as it's not fair to them. the way i'm feeling about all of this i wouldn't wish it upon anyone. the only thing that's truly keeping me afloat is my dark humor, but inside it is eating me alive. i go to visit them sometime soon and is wrong for me not to want to see them in this state? i love them to death, but i just feel like it would kill me inside knowing truly how they are, or even if they would truly remember who i am, and what i even look like. i'm sorry for this question which i suppose turned into more a rant. i just needed to get this off my chest."," imagine if your grandparents had some other kind of awful problem like cancer, or were paralyzed but it didn’t affect their minds.  you would likely be much more sympathetic.  all the things that you see in your grandparents are classic symptoms of dementia. this is not who they ever were, it’s what the disease has done to them.  i’m quite sure there are core elements of their personality which are still in tact.  often it is in music, songs they loved to listen to, maybe they loved the outdoors, or certain foods.  look and listen to them carefully. you will find bits that will engage them and which you can still share.  this won’t bring back the people who once loved, protected, and guided you but it will allow you to give back to them something that you share.  even if they don’t know who you are and behave in awkward and uncomfortable ways — at the root they certainly will recognize that someone who loves them is making an effort to reach them. even it they can’t express it they can sense it and you can provide them that comfort. in more substantial ways you can help them by being their advocate to make sure they are being kept clean and safe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/njzjzw/how_to_cope_with_seeing_your_grandparents_slowly/,How to cope with seeing your grandparents slowly mentally deteriorate due to Dementia.

she gets really vicious and cold. i’m trying my to learn to have boundaries and figure i should have some with her still. so as she insulted me i tried to calmly explain i was just trying to help and she kept insulting me. so i told her that it’s okay she doesn’t want help but if she’s going to be mean that i can’t help her anymore when she asks (she asks 50000 times a day and obsessive loops she gets in). but it made me feel bad bc unlike my mom my grandma seems to feel genuine remorse and she tried to ask me kindly to help her again with the paper i wrote out for her with her concerns- so she was trying to like reconcile. and i saw her face looked sad but her insults had me almost in tears so i gently  told her  i could help tomorrow.i’m not sure what to do bc i don’t understand dementia. i’m assuming she’s not capable of changing her ways and i hate to make her feel bad or guilty but i also don’t want to be treated horribly. before she had dementia she was always nice but attention seeking .. although one time i slept at her house while visiting and the bedroom door locked me out. so i asked her for help and her voice turned into this creepy witch like scraggly voice and she kept repeating “u knew it. u locked the door on purpose” and she was just genuinely acting like a wicked witch  has snuck out of her," i came here because i'm starting to get worn getting asked all the time about grandma's new medical device that she has to carry with her.  we are 17 days into using it and i get the same question about whether she has to carry it, and when i let her know she has to she gets upset.  i've had to give a lot of help to get her able to use it.  a lot more help dressing and also plugging/unplugging power cables for her.  i have to really work to get her to do things she can do, because she gets so bothered by the device she comes to ask questions.i'm worried it will be somewhat permanent confusion even if she gets the device off in a few weeks.  like getting into a car she thinks she needs to crawl in to accommodate the suction tube vs normally by pointing your butt more towards the seat.  or getting dressed the tube on her leg confuses her when she just has to pull pants over it.  it is no different action than pulling pants up, but the idea of it is different to her and confuses her.  i hope she can return to normalcy after, and doesn't get stuck thinking about the struggles of the last couple weeks, but i'm not really that hopeful.the confusion over things that are new but no different is hard to manage.  this year we've had to replace hearing aids and a medical alert.  both are functionally the same as last set, but she mentally thinks they are different, and right away that means she can't know how to use them.  i don't think there is any real fix to this i can tell, other than trying to adjust to what she can use.  like i hope to get her hearing aids adjusted so they just are always on one setting because she adjusts them to max volume then is miserable (understandably), and isn't capable to get herself out of her problem.  the medical alert pendant is very new, and she just told me that tonight when we were putting it on her charger basically, ""oh that's new, i'm never going to be able to learn to use that"".  &#x200b;as far as the situation gently lie as best as you can.  it is rough getting verbally abused when trying to help.  particularly from a loved one.  there is a lot i don't understand about dementia, but i have to remind myself that some of the comments aren't who grandma is, and often are some sort of emotional response to something they are feeling, whether they are feeling confused, left out, or just upset not being able to do or help with things they've done before.  i've somewhat maybe found a way to communicate about the medical device.  i just asked if she wanted to get better as fast as she could and let her know the doctors thinks this was best.  and if she gets a little upset, just remind her that the doctors are wanting her to try this, but sort of remind her that it is her option.  it helps a little with her getting upset and mopey about the whole thing, which is hard to see and also just ends up wasting time everytime she gets upset about it rather than just doing things like getting her pajamas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/njm0fy/how_do_you_handle_a_dementia_relative_who_gets/,How do you handle a dementia relative who gets angry when given help

"hey everyonei just wanted to tell you that if you are caregiving for a loved one, and you are sincerely doing your best, despite how difficult it is, i truly appreciate you. the diseases that fall under the dementia umbrella are vicious. in my personal opinion, and admitting my bias they are the most devastating diseases out there. not only do we have to deal with the loss of our loved ones as we have always known them,  we are dealing with their emotions, their loss of independence, their anger, their mood changes, their everything.it can be seriously overwhelming, and it takes extreme emotional resilience. personally, my mom's battle was extremely hard on both my father and me, and i don't think my dad ever fully recovered from the journey. it took me many many years to reconcile everything that happened.we all get frustrated, we all lose our patience, we all act in ways that we wouldn't in ideal situations. please give yourself grace. remember to do all acts in love, as much as possible. even when our loved ones aren't acting loveable themselves. there is no straight ""start to finish"" line, there are sometimes hundreds of squiggles along the way. if possible, (some if us are/were sole caregivers, i realize) lean on others when you can. do not do this on your own, if you don't have to. if you can, take some time for yourself. it's important for everyone involved. if everything falls on you, i'm sorry, i wish i could give you some strength and rest. find small ways to find happiness. please remember this situation isn't permanent. if anyone needs to vent, troubleshoot, listen to dumb jokes, research, whatever, feel free to send me a message. if you do message me, just tell me where you found me, i find it weird when randoms i don't recognize message me. i always feel like i'm about to get scammed. peace", wow...i needed to read this ♥️,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/niwivy/the_importance_of_self_care_for_the_care_giver/,The importance of self care for the care giver
"my wonderful grandmother, has moderately advanced dementia. her care needs are growing every day and her main carer is my grandfather. it's been a tough year, made even tougher by the fact that my aunties, uncles and mum have fallen out. the falling out that has bothered me the most is between my mum and aunty.  i don't get involved and i always remain civil, but it's getting harder and harder to keep my mouth shut! it all started over a division of labour argument. my aunty (53) does not work and was being paid carer's allowance to help my grandmother, whereas my mum (61) worked part time. my aunty felt that my mum wasn't doing her share, and my mum got upset as she feels that she does as much as she can. then my aunty's husband got involved and was rude to my mum, to the point where she had panic attacks and was in tears. i don't recall if he apologised, but my aunty didn't say anything about it. anyway, this led to my mum being very cold and standoffish with my aunty...which upset my aunty  and prompted her husband to be rude to my mum again...and this cycle has repeated a few times now.  the issue is, my family's not fantastic when it comes to communication. my mum has never outrightly said to my aunty that my aunty's husband upsets her...and my aunty has never asked my mum why she's always cold with her. my mum is afraid that if she comes out and says that my aunty's husband is an issue, that he'll be even worse and my aunty will get upset. but, my mum will still be cold with my aunty, and my aunty doesn't know what she's done.i just don't know what to do! i've encouraged them to talk and to sort it out, but my aunty says she needs space and my mum doesn't want to tell my aunty that her husband is the issue. so far, i've kept quiet and just tried to be sympathetic and supportive (mostly to my mum), but i'm worried that my aunty's husband is going to upset my mum again...and next time, i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to hold my tongue!   any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated!", i don't think it's doing you any good by getting upset over how other people are acting towards each other. the only thing we have control of are ourselves and no one knows what the future holds.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nivnuv/family_has_fallen_apart_dont_know_what_to_do/,Family has fallen apart - don't know what to do!

"tonight, i had a conversation with my mother that lasted ten minutes. she told me that she was coming to pick me up tomorrow morning and take me home. i told her that she can't do that until 4 pm, because i have a job. she was confused about this and cycled back to saying that she would be here tomorrow morning to pick me up and take me home...i reminded her that i have a job....i'm going to be honest, i never had a fantastic relationship with my mother. not that we fought; i was much too afraid of her to disobey or disagree with her. in her culture, mental illness is unspeakable, which is unfortunate, given the prevalence of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in my family. i grew up around unstable people attempting to control unstable people before the government could step in and do it for them. this still results in mutual violence, substance abuse, and er visits, in which no one tells the hospital ""what really happened"".my mother knows that she has a problem--she's been buying suspicious supplements that make dubious claims--but she will deny everything if confronted. so we don't talk about it. which is how my family has dealt with every problem since long before i was born. but now that my mother has no inhibitions, she unleashes every secret in her mind at the least appropriate times and utterly without warning. she told me about my grandfather's serial infidelity for the first time in a cvs. because that's the best place to tell your daughter about her grandfather's mistresses: the checkout line of a cvs.losing a parent is tough for everyone, but i'm barely old enough to drink. my youngest brother isn't even old enough for a learner's permit. i always assumed that i'd have not only time with my mother, but time to sort out my complicated feelings about my mother before death began to loom in the background.  while my mother refuses medical help and her problems accelerate rapidly, the voice in the back of my head nags me to hurry up and make one-sided peace with all the things she will never apologize for (and probably doesn't remember). this is made even harder by the fact that her lack of inhibitions is causing her to double-down on the aggression that i'm trying to move past. i didn't get to have a ""teenage rebellion"": mom had cancer. i didn't have rebellious college years: mom had a worsening memory problem. so, right now, i am a working adult staring at my ceiling and wondering who i am and whether life has a meaning. but my mom's worsening memory does have at least one benefit for me: i can have difficult conversations with her with the full confidence that she will not remember anything. i can live with the peace that i eventually ""told her"" about incidents of abuse and violence, without having to live with the consequences of my mother knowing the truth."," sounds like she is in the beginning stages.  please seek help from her primary. she is clearly open to taking medicine and there are many that she could actually benefit from.  on the flip side, i can totally relate to the feeling of being able to have those difficult conversations without reprecussions. it's a strange relief.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nhixrh/memory_loss_aggression_and_forgiveness/,"Memory Loss, Aggression, and Forgiveness?"

"hello i wanted to see if anyone could help me in my situation. my grandmother had dementia and has become unstable. medication used to help control her behavior in the past but nothing is working anymore. she’s stubborn by heart and having dementia isn’t helping. she currently sees hallucinations. she has glaucoma in her eyes so she can’t see clearly and constantly accuses my grandfather of cheating with this “woman” she constantly sees. she doesn’t believe anyone when we tell her nothing is there. my grandfather is at his breaking point and told me she’s better off dead. she has medicare but i know they don’t pay for anything. she used to have medicaid in the past but she was notified that she no longer qualifies (i’m gonna start the process of disputing this). she doesn’t have a single cent to her name. neither does my grandfather. no savings, no retirement fund, no nothing. they get social security income every month &amp; that’s the only thing getting them by. the house they live in is in my father’s name due to my grandfather’s poor credit. we can’t afford nursing care. we have home health showing up once a week but she needs daily assistance. she can’t even get up herself. but her stubborn self often insists that she can take care of herself. she often claims she cooked food or washed her clothes but she hasn’t lifted a finger for years now.  we used to pay my aunt to take care of her, which worked really well for the past year but my aunt couldn’t take it anymore. my grandma is tough to deal with. her attitude itself is hard to manage. my grandma crossed the line &amp; insulted my aunt so she quit. now we’re at a loss. i don’t know what to do anymore. i know medicaid will pay the first 100 days of nursing care but doesn’t she have to go to a special dementia place? does anyone know what resources are available in texas? whoever takes the time to read this, thank you so much. any help is appreciated."," please apply for hospice.  that's what we did when it got to this point and while my grandmother wasn't violent, she needed help with life sustaining tasks which is what they're there for.  i also found a caregiver to help out when i ran out of steam.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nhhw67/resources_for_a_poor_texan_elderly/,Resources for a poor texan elderly ?

"for anyone who has dealt with dementia, i have a question. my dad was diagnosed a couple of years ago. his mother and sister both have/had dementia, but both were diagnosed significantly later. he was diagnosed early in large part due to the fact that he had a family history and when he showed the earliest signs, he saw a doctor immediately. we’ve noticed some personality changes in the last year, which i know is normal (he’s getting angry and the last year of pandemic restrictions has aggravated it). however, he’s now in a loop of wanting to sell his house and move. we’ve been dealing with this for months now. apparently a huge part of this is wanting to take advantage of the current crazy market to cash in on the value of their home. he says he’s worried about how my mother will have enough money after he’s in a nursing home/passes away. on the surface, some of his arguments make sense, but deeper down they don’t. he’s pushed to move to new brunswick (think, detroit to boston for distance from where he currently lives), because it’s cheap. no problem that he can’t cross the provincial borders right now and doesn’t know anyone. or that my mother doesn’t want to move there. in fact, he started packing last week, told her he would move without her. he’s also thought about moving within the province, but to areas that they don’t know anyone, again, because it’s cheap. he’s calling the real estate agent they know regularly, insisting she list their house. thankfully, i reached out to her a while ago and she knows he has dementia, so she called my mom back on her cell (dad listens in on conversations if you call on the home line 😲). she’s told him their house isn’t worth what he thinks it is (she says $200000 less than he thinks it’s worth) and he got angry at her. my mom is lovely and wonderful, but can’t stand up to my dad. she’s always let him make the big decisions, and just tried to steer them onto a smooth course. she knows moving is a terrible idea for multiple reasons. she even got him to agree to wait a year a month ago, but he’s circled back to it again. he can’t actually sell the house without her agreement, but he is making her life really hard. after all that (thank you for your patience!), do you have any ideas about how to get him to stop focusing on this, or how to deflect him?  rational arguments don’t work. he calls people without my mom knowing and tells them that he is moving. he is not making rational decisions, but is far from needing care. i’m not even 100% sure what i’m asking!  i guess just, how do you deal with irrational behaviour in someone with mild - moderate dementia?my dad has been making these phone calls to the real estate agent without my mother knowing about it. is there a way to deal with that? my dad is very lucid and his dementia isn’t really apparent on first glance. the real estate agent they’ve worked with knows (only because i told her), and thankfully is happy to try to keep him pacified as much as possible (she credits my parents for saving her life). however, if he doesn’t get the answers he wants from her, he’s threatened to call other agents. some of them may not be nearly as helpful. he can’t sell the house without my mom (they are both on the title and she does have poa), but i fear her being bullied into something she doesn’t want, to try to keep the peace."," unfortunately i think you may have to take action to remove some of your dad’s rights.  i know, i know.  but this will only get worse, and if he can legally sign things, that’s a problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ngggy0/fixations/,Fixations
"my father has dementia with lewy bodies.  i have been blessed beyond measure with this man as my father.  he is the sweetest, kindest, more wonderful person you could ever meet.  he would be there for anyone anytime.  he has always been my biggest fan and made me feel that he was proud of me my whole life.  i am honored to be able to be a part of helping him through this part of his journey and onto the next.  i have processed and still grieve the loss of my father, but have accepted that he is not going to get better and my relationship with him is now a different one. it is hard and my heart breaks everyday that i look into eyes that look back but don't look the same. to hear him struggle with things that once came so easy for him, to see the fear and confusion that comes over him sometimes it is heartbreaking. but i will be there until the last breath to help make it as easy as possible.   my parents have been married for 62 years.  he is 84 and she is 80.  besides the dementia he is in excellent health for a person 30 years younger than him!  my mom is the same.  he has been rapidly declining and has become more aggressive and insistent on leaving the house or trying to do things.  my mother is very controlling and is constantly redirecting him and telling him he can't do things, even if it is just getting up to use the bathroom.  she is so scared he is going to do something that she tries to control his every move. (this is not new and has been how she is our whole lives.) they are polar opposites and always have been.  she has terrible social anxiety and is controlling, he is a social butterfly and is laid back and cheerful.  i have been helping out as much as i can.  i am a therapist and have been making space for her to process the loss of her husband as she knows him and adapt to the new relationship she has with him as he is now and help her handle the challenges that come with this.  i am sad for what they both are going through.  he recently has had some more aggressive instances and it is becoming more difficult for her to ""control him"".  we (my brothers, kids and i) have all tried to help her learn how to deal with things that make it less likely for him to react that way but she wont listen.  his  dr. recommended looking into a local agency that will come into their home or a nursing home.  she will not under any circumstance let anyone come into their home.  i understand that and i respect her wishes.  however, i also know that she is going to have to allow something because she cannot maintain this and provide for him what he is going to need. recently i have tried to get her to let the area agency come into their home and help her set it up so that it is safer for them and teach her skills to help recognize, cope and handle some of his new behaviors.  she gets angry and tells me that no one is going to tell her what to do.  i told her that this is something none of us are experienced with and that we all need to learn so we can do the best for him and ourselves in this situation.  i even used the comparison of the delivery and installation professionals of their new appliances recently. she had them come into her house (strangers) and use their professional knowledge to provide a service that she needed. she didn't care and didn't see that we need services from professionals that know what they are doing.   i got some information from some local nursing homes that specialize in this and gave her the information and she refuses to even talk to them. this is after she wanted to look into nursing homes and requested me to.  i do not want my father in a nursing home that is going to medicate him into a stupor to control him.  however, i am realistic about the ability of my mom at 80 years old to take care of him and how this is also taking it's toll on her health. if she won't let someone come in to help or help her learn how to help, or talk to a nursing home for respite or other services at least i am concerned one of them will get hurt.  my relationship with my mom is difficult because she has always been very mean to me and in ""competition"" with me over my kids.  she is controlling and manipulative but  i love her and want to help her through this time.  and my dad deserves to not be so stressed and restricted during this time.  he literally cannot look sideways without her freaking out about if he is going to open 2 doors before he finds the door to the bathroom. we have many professionals in our family that are able to provide advise and direct us towards assistance and she refuses to give up her ""control"". i have done investigation and asked question, done things that i have been advised to do and given her the information we have received, even tried to show her.  i have provided the tools she needs with no positive response. i am probably just venting but i am tired of taking the brunt of her nastiness when i am helping and i don't think it is fair to my dad.  believe me i have not been forceful, i provided information when she stated she needed help and wanted to know her options.  i check in with them daily, sometimes more than once a day.  i take them out on the weekends, i take them to their appointments, i sit with him one afternoon a week so she can run errands or go to lunch with her friends and i usually stop by at least on other week day to check in even if it is just for a little bit.  i also have a private practice and work at a school, but i am always available.  i really feel defeated today and not sure what to do.  i miss my dad, he would know what to do. :-("," i couldn't tell for sure, but i'm gathering that they both have dementia, just his is more progressed? if that's the case - or perhaps, even if not - and you feel that either of them could be a danger to themselves (unsafe conditions, falling, preparing food incorrectly, wandering, etc) or to each other (wrongly handing medications off, the aggressions/physical outbursts many with dementia have, etc), then you have grounds to pursue making the decision in their/his best interest, not what she considers her best interest. it is rare that you'll find a compliant, agreeable dementia patient once they get to the stage where tending to themselves or others could be unsafe, and unfortunately, there isn't always or maybe even often a great way of convincing them otherwise. if she does have dementia or dementia symptoms as i'm understanding it, your practice of being helpful and explanatory is right on (as very few with dementia can be 'argued' with) but at least in my experience with family & the anecdotes i read here, i don't think she can be convinced. however, if you think she's of sound mind and the controlling and stubborn qualities are only coming from her baseline personality, perhaps there is a way (which i'd be ill-equipped to advise). not sure where you are located, but at least in the us, generally speaking, nursing homes are reserved for those either very progressed in an illness or else physically incapacitated and usually if you can provide payment, they would be best suited in an assisted living facility with a memory care wing. if that at all eases your heart about where he'd be living, i can attest that the facility we are aiming to get my grandmother into (she is also in her 80s, physically in excellent condition, but not safe to live on her own/doesn't want someone coming in taking care of her) is practically a resort that focuses more on stimulating activities, therapies, and minimal medicating when possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ngdk2q/dementia_with_lewy_bodies/,Dementia with Lewy Bodies
"i had a very frustrating follow up for my dad with the neurophysiology doc yesterday. he basically told me that he doesn't think my dad has dementia. i don't know how that could be possible. he has been showing cognitive decline for several years, sundowning for 4 years, he is now incontinent of both stool and (most of the time) urine, he has days that he can remember some things (like where he is, the year, president, what happened the prior day) but other days he is completely lost, only recognizing me but not my kids. he can't make decisions, he forgets what he is doing in the middle of doing it (i say, ""dad let's go try to pee."" he says,""okay"" starts walking to the bathroom and then either keeps walking or literally stoops and goes the other direction), can't articulate what he wants most of the time, gets super emotional over things he can't even express... and so much more. this dr. from the va has told me he doesn't think he has dementia, he thinks he has normotensive hydrocephalus. but my dad has brain scans that show significant and even severe atrophy dating back over a year. his most recent scan the first week of march mentioned he ""might"" have a slightly enlarged ventricle, to consider normotensive hydrocephalus, but i just don't agree. i think this neuropsychologist guy is fixated on the ""consider"" part and isn't looking at the big picture. he doesn't live with my dad and see all of the things i see. he chalked his poor scores on comprehensive questions to his hearing loss (bs). im just so frustrated because i can't get all of the help he needs until he has a diagnosis and i think the va has been slowing this process tremendously. we waited 2 months for this appointment and now we have to wait weeks for a phone appointment with the neurologist. they aren't even going to lay eyes on him! ugh. so glad i can vent here!"," does your dad have frequent falls? nph has a pneumonic of “wet, wobbly, wacky” not giving medical advice just a thought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ngc1us/frustrated/,Frustrated
"i am 31f and my mother with dementia is 70f. i'm an only child. my dad died about a year ago. he and i had been noticing symptoms for 5+ years, but they were subtle. things took a but of a leap when she went through chemo and then had an aneurism surgery. she still pays her own bills but i often catch them unpaid or in arrears, same with medication, she's pissed off at me when i point it out (i try to do so gently in a non accusatory way- lots of help with phrasing and approaching things from the sub). she will ask me things many times, and say good morning as if she hasn't seen me many times. the questions are endless. meal time is the worst.  she's so good at faking it around other people. her doctor diagnosed her with dementia symptoms as of a year ago. it's gotten worse but she can still mostly function independently and i've exhausted efforts to make her go in for a check up ""for other reasons""... i can't force her, and she doesnt present as cognitively impaired enough for me to enact poa. i resent her for not contributing at all towards my dad's end of life paperwork, for not cleaning her house and for starting new projects everywhere that i end up needing to clean up. i have to secretly go through all her bills after she's done. i did her taxes for her and my dad and was met with resistance the entire way. she's so capable of so many things but just won't do what actually needs to be done, nor do i think she's capable of deciding what her best interests are. this is  part of her non-dementia personality and exacerbated by the dementia (i think?)i moved in to her gigantic messy house about 6 months ago and live on the second floor while i finished my graduate program. it's been hell and i worry our relationship will never recover. my partner is here too now and taking time off work to help. i worry about our relationship too.i can no longer tolerate being around her unless i've been drinking. it feels like a huge charade all the time. i'm so angry and i've gained 40 pounds. i feel like my body and mind and shutting down. it's damned if i do and damned if i don't. if i don't help then stuff goes wrong because, if i do, she's upset with me for taking too much control. i have medical and financial poa [if she were to be deemed unfit]. she's in too early stages for moving her into care. her friends say ""she's just forgetful, she's always been a bit wacky."" no she's on the edge of being incapable to live by herself. anyway, i just feel so angry and resentful and guilty. she still is a lovely person, but i can't stand to even be within 10 feet of her at the moment. she won't stop shewing on her cheek (no injury or tooth problem but just a 'new' habit). i feel like i'm hiding and it's increasingly difficult to hide how angry i am at my situation, which i feel doubly guilty about because i know she can't help it. i think even if she didn't have dementia i would be having a tough time living with her because of the mother/daughter thing, our history and personality differences etc. i can't afford psychological counselling, and i haven't been able to get a job since finishing school 3 weeks ago because i spend so much time doing her stuff for her which leaves me mentally exhausted. i think i need to let go, move out, help where i can, try to set up outside visits from a 'cleaning lady' and just wait for something catastrophic to happen that proves she needs outside assistance but i fear that i'll be judged as negligent, i just don't know how i'm supposed to move forward with my life. i just wish someone would release me from the responsibility just for a bit, i feel like i'm staring down the next 10 years of my life just thrown away. my parents never took care of their health, their property etc  and i spent a lot of my life already cleaning up their messes. it feels like ""goodbye any hopes and dreams."""," i was going through something similar. i took care of my father with cancer for the last 6 years then my mother got diagnosed with dementia. so... the only answer i have is get home healthcare. i did not train to handle this and i was losing my mind. but, as soon as i was able, i got her finances under my control then i hired help and it’s liveable. still sucks a bit. i think if you want true freedom then your mom has to go into assisted living.  i can’t tell if your mom was nice before she was diagnosed but just remember this version of her isn’t that woman. dementia is mother fucker!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ngbmkx/i_just_need_to_vent_i_feel_like_im_at_the_end_of/,I just need to vent.

"my mom is just in the process of being diagnosed with dementia. i had thought we were maybe avoiding anger/aggression as a symptom but nope.. it’s here. i called and spoke with her boyfriend about her finances and she lost it in the background. yelling, saying that she hopes i have to suffer someday like she is. the works.it’s particularly hard because her and i have always had a strained relationship. we’ve always fought but this was definitely the dementia talking. she went on and on about how i’m “taking over.”my “taking over” now just consists of me making doctor’s visits for her but in the future i may try to get a poa/ medical poa. for those who have done this, how in the word did you get your loved ones to agree with it?!? she has to sign it right?"," i’m so sorry. it’s so hard. the fact that a feature of dementia is the inability of the brain to recognize its own dementia symptoms makes it that much more difficult. would her doctor be supportive of her setting up the poas? maybe be reassuring in the, “please don’t fret, it’s only if something serious happens; all my patients have one” kind of way? because paranoia and anger (and denial, along with refusing to bathe) are textbook symptoms of the disease, so a child’s reasoning isn’t usually successful. (not that you are a child, obvs, but the parent still sees it that way!) navigating the ups and downs of dementia is a minefield, and i wish you the best of luck. my mother is at the delusional-but-mainly-content phase, but it took a lot of time and patience to get here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ngazor/the_fighting_has_started_sigh/,The fighting has started.. sigh

re: people with dementia are the any prescribed medications that medical marijuana is known to interact with? it was recently prescribed to my friend's dad to help calm his physically violent behavior. also has anyone had this prescribed to their relative for that reason and it helped? they've tried almost everything else.," you might want to watch out with heart conditions and thc, as large amounts can increase heart rate. that said, it sounds like they are working with a physician, if they have access to medical products. edibles seem to be the best method for dosing with the elderly. please note cannabis can take up to an hour to take effect, so consider timing when dosing.also, start low and slow. 10mg of thc is considered the ""standard"" dosage, but it's best to start with a dose as low as 2.5mg and work your way up.if you are able to access it, pick an edible with equal parts thc and cbd. cbd can reduce the negative side effects of too much thc. plus it has a ton of additional positive benefits, such as promoting feelings of contentment and reducing inflammation.  also, cbg has been shown to promote feelings of joy without psychoactivity, so that might also be beneficial. lastly, if you are a caregiver, keep notes on the dosage given and time, so you are able to zero in on what works best for the patientplease keep in mind, i am not a doctor and my comments are based on past experiences and feedback i have received from patients and caregivers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nftdbf/medical_marijuana_to_calm_physical_aggression/,Medical marijuana to calm physical aggression?

"a friend of mine suggested i write here. it's pretty long.i’m 20 years old. my grandmother, now 73, has been a major influence and presence in my life ever since i was born. my brother, 17, and i would usually spend our weekends with her and a dinner every wednesday as children. for as long as i can remember, she’s had a problem with her short term memory, due to a side effect for her fibromyalgia. for a while, even if she’d sometimes forget what she was doing, she was able to function. but december 2011, my grandfather passed away. this left my grandmother crushed, and for a while she spent some time with her older sister. around that time she was diagnosed with dementia. the decline in her health was initially slow. she was still able to drive, live alone, and we would check in on her. she would tell us her older sister was “taking care of her.” but as i was going through high school, i could tell things were off. she would lash out more frequently, and kept talking highly of her sister, claiming that “she does everything for me.”during my senior year my mother and i started visiting her more often (we had stopped spending weekends due to school and my job) and found her kitchen completely empty of food. we began taking her to the store every time we saw her, only to come back to find weeks worth of food eaten in days. come to find out her younger sister, who lived right next door, was getting money from the older one to take her to get food, only to buy cereal and milk. claiming, “well your grandma doesn’t eat anything else.” then my grandmother started having episodes. it started back in 2019, when she was visiting her sister and we got a call saying she ended up in the hospital. i shuffled in to find my grandmother, bruised with a swollen eye, frightened and not wanting to stay away from her two dogs any longer. when we asked her what happened, she said that, “my sister was climbing up the wall, and well i had to go get her down.” we later found out she tripped over the dog gate at the top of the stairs. since then she keeps seeing a man, a large man, in her house. she sometimes says he took her younger daughter away from her father, my grandmother’s ex-husband. she sees her younger daughter as a small child, when she’s in her late 30s. my aunt, the younger daughter, recently moved in to keep an eye on my grandmother. she was a cna and figured she could keep an eye on her own mother. and it has helped. she keeps an eye on my grandma’s eating, how many sweets she eats (she’s diabetic but will eat whole sleeves of oreos at a time without thinking), and how many aleve's she takes a day (we bought a big bottle before thanksgiving and when i went back a couple weeks later the bottle was almost empty).  however, due to her doing stupid stuff in her childhood, my grandmother has some resentment that always seem to cloud over when my aunt tries to help. that isn’t fair to my aunt, but in her mind this is her way of making up for her mistakes. truth be told, i can see my grandmother trying to tell us she appreciates all that we do, but she can’t get that connection to us. and she keeps thinking what we’re doing is what her older sister set up. and sometimes we had to use that ruse to keep her calm. i hated the day i had to fake a phone call to my great-aunt to keep my grandmother from thinking she was robbed.  i try to visit as much as i can, but sometimes visiting her is draining. i have such vivid memories of her doing things, going places, and smiling. the woman i see now is sad, frail, and almost a shell of whom she was. it’s hard to face someone who raised you for 20 years one day look at you as though you were a stranger, and then slowly recognize you.  my brother is in pain as well, but he doesn’t quite remember who she was before all this. sometimes i think about her and start crying. i love her very much. i hate to see her like this. we’re expecting to one day hear her doctors tell us that it’s turned into full fledged alzheimer’s.  this all just hurts so much, and i don’t know what to do. thanks for listening, i really just needed to vent."," thank you so much for sharing. i am sorry you are going through this. i swear your post could have been written by me. my mom and grandmother raised me and my grandma was like my 2nd mom. i miss the vibrant, fun grandma i used to know and i have so much guilt about not enjoying my time with her anymore and making visits shorter because it is so emotionally draining to see her like this and have the same 2 conversations over and over the entire time i am with her. again, i am so sorry you are going through this as well. the long goodbye is torture. you are not alone. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nfrmeh/my_grandmother_and_her_dementia/,My Grandmother and her dementia

"i’ve noticed my grandma slow down a bit over the past few years. she’s 83 so i want to cut her some slack as she’s elderly and i know the brain won’t work like it used to.however i’ve noticed a few concerning things. i visited her today and she repeated a story about her sending my grandad to the shops and how long he takes, shes very talkative and was in the middle of another story and we ended up going off topic a few times and she had to ask me what it was we were talking about (to be honest i momentarily forgot myself). also she forgets the name of things sometimes, like the pool for example “what’s the thing with the water”.she has always been a highly anxious and high stress individual so she tends to work herself up into these states. and even complains constantly that she’s “losing her marbles”. apart from the above she’s fine and we’re able to have normal interactions but i don’t know. maybe i’m in denial a bit."," this sounds like me with my father at the moment - he's late 70's, and we're dealing with similar issues.what always made me second guess my concerns is that prior to this year, every 12-15 months it would be like he'd get stuck in a loop for a few weeks.  i'd call him 3-4 times a week, and for those 2 weeks or so he'd tell me the same stories each time we spoke, and would forget things and words and places.  then just as suddenly he'd snap out of it and be completely fine.it's really hard to know if it's the slow progress of something, or just normal forgetfulness and their personality.  having my dad in my house the last few months has really made me believe it may have been the start of dementia, as he's now doing things he's never done before.  so many things on tv (especially if he's had a few drinks) trigger him to spout some inane fact or story, or sing a song vaguely related to whatever just happened.  then if 2 people in the same or next room say something to each other he automatically assumes they were talking to him and jumps/shouts to find out what.it's hard to explain, but if these smaller things are a bit out of character for her, and they're adding up, it's worth talking to others around her and see if they're having the same feelings.  for me, i'm building up the courage to see if we can get him assessed, as in nearly all areas he's really quite good, but he is definitely not like he used to be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nfawk3/is_this_dementia_or_just_normal_mental/,Is this dementia or just normal mental deterioration for an over 80’s person (my grandma)

"today has been a strange day. my grandfather woke up out of the blue in a very distressed state, yelling at my grandmother about locking him out of the house and stealing his money. he honestly never yells and he was so angry. he locked himself in the bathroom and refused to come out. everything he was yelling about didn’t make sense and there were no physical signs of a stroke. paramedics were called. all tests at the hospital came back normal but he failed the quick test for alzheimer’s, he got 0/5 correct. he’s staying in hospital overnight to be monitored as he’s still confused and disoriented. yesterday he during the day, he was fine both physically and mentally. our family is stunned at this seemingly rapid onset of whatever this is. there have been little warning signs lately. things he’s forgotten that he needed to be reminded of, or confusion about where things are in his house. the night before this outburst he was looking for his toothbrush when he already had it in his hands. i guess my question is whether others have experienced this kind of rapid change at the beginning of this journey? it’s like a switch got flipped and today he’s a totally different person. he has an appointment in a few weeks with a geriatric specialist but in the meantime, we’re not sure if he’ll be able to be released back to his home."," yes, it has been very rapid for my dad. matter of a weeks time. we had a brain mri done and diagnosed with nph. partially reversible but doctors have advised against it - he has diabetes, heart stent, hearing problems.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nf0bx9/89_year_old_with_rapid_symptoms_of_dementia/,89 year old with rapid symptoms of dementia.
"hello, this was longer than intended, and i apologize, but i am very passionate about appropriate health care. everyone deserves the best care possible.quick blurb about me, my mother was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's the summer i graduated high school. she died when i was 26. my father and i were very active in caring for until she had a stroke. her last few years she was wheelchair bound and unable to speak.  her entire illness completely devastated me. my twenties were an absolute mess that i'm lucky to have survived. i'm tearing up as i write this. i miss her so much.in my early 30s (i'm 42 now) i became a certified nurses aide, first working in a hospital, then on a dementia ward for almost 6 years, and for the past years have worked in a group home for severely mentally disabled adults.as someone who has worked in health care for a decade, i can tell you one of the most frustrating parts of the job are seeing family members in denial about the reality of their loved ones situation, unfortunately, very much to the detriment of their loved one.i have seen too way many people i have cared for and truly grown to love very quickly, suffer way more than  should have, because of families not preparing for the end.in many (but not all) assisted living facilities, there is a general practitioner doctor who visits the facility on a weekly, bi weekly, or sometimes monthly basis. at my al facility, the doctor was responsible for 60-70 residents just for that day, nevermind the rest of the week. basically, when our care staff noticed a problem, it would be reported to our management, who would do rounds with the doc. communication with the doctor when he was not at our facility was a nightmare. he was almost impossible for our staff to reach when immediate issues arose. if you were a family member wishing to speak with him, it was even harder.the visits were brief and absolutely not thorough. issues with residents were routinely dismissed by the doctor. please consider the facility i was employed at was considered high end, with most residents having at least a million dollars in their savings accounts. this was a wealthy community, the facility bring brand new when i started. it was considered one of the best in the area.when people are in the end stages of dementia, they can not clearly communicate the pain they are in, if they can communicate at all. because of this, their health issues, while may not intentionally be ignored, are way too frequently misjudged by an overworked gp the benefits of hospice/palliative care are numerable. you get much more personalized care with actual nursing staff coming for visits 2-3 times a week minimum, where they do thorough examinations. they visit daily when the end is near. they have the ability to prescribe proper medications immediately, no delay. in addition a cna also comes in a few times a week to give a bath and provide general companionship, feeding, etc. they are available to take calls very quickly, as most nurses provide a cell phone to reach them.please please please do not delay in getting hospice involved, i beg of you. dying is very physically painful, and no one wants to see our loved ones suffer. if you are unsure the time is right for hospice, please reach out to hospice organizations as they can give you a brief overview of signs to look for, and arrange a screening interview, to see if acceptance into hospice is the way to go. finally, this may seem strange, but acceptance into hospice does not necessarily mean the end, i have seen several people be accepted and released from hospice, as the care they receive gets them to a healthier baseline. it's not extremely common, but it's happened several times.if anyone has any questions, i'd be happy to answer them as best i can."," thank you for this post!  we actually had the faculty where my mom is decide not to give her certain pain medications because they have been known to worsen dementia symptoms.  without consulting us! wait, what???  she is in the second to last stage of alzheimer’s!  i had to make a hundred calls and threaten them to get them to provide more.  insane, we had to document we wanted her pain relieved more than we wanted to prevent worsening symptoms. i don’t believe anyone should go through this watching a loved on suffer in pain!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nevjkp/please_do_not_delay_in_getting_your_loved_one/,Please DO NOT delay in getting your loved one signed up with a palliative care/hospice organization well before they are actively dying.

"hi everyone. how do you handle the frustration-guilt sequence of events?i feel sad. my father came to my home-office unannounced and without asking about me or anything else (a sign of early dementia - being inconsiderate), he told me he needed my opinion about the recurrent indigestion and fatigue he's been having. i was already stressed from work, and so i was very dry in answering him - short answers, to the point, and basically a b\*\*\*\*y attitude. he left and after i calmed down, now i feel guilty to tears. i am aware that this is not who he was, and also aware that his visiting me is him telling me he needs attention/care - so i feel terrible.

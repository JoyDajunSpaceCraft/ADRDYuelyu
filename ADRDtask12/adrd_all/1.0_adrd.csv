[removed]," i was too young to comprehend changes in my dad when he started showing symptoms. the earliest concern i remember my mom mentioning was that he drove into a ditch on a road he normally wouldn't be on, so he must've been lost, but by the time i heard the story it was more progressed. but, no matter what, the best thing to do is to get him evaluated by a doc (i know you addressed this in your op, but still). if hes resistant, maybe call his doc ahead of time and tell him your concerns and his resistance, and maybe doc can frame an initial evaluation like its ""routine"" for everyone his age. even if its nothing it might be good to have a baseline. also, if the changes coincide with his gardening hobby (or any new activity even), id maybe check around to make sure there aren't any chemicals, like pesticides, that he might be overusing, or using without proper protection. some gardening chemicals can be absorbed through skin, and some are associated with neurological problems.  i might be projecting my paranoia for my mom about her home gardening here tho lol. im no doc, and no pro gardener, but i do know its a common bad habit of home gardeners to use ""too much"" of whatever they are using and i do know a lot of those bottles have warnings and guidance about these things that can go ignored :p. and at least in commercial farming, pesticide use has been linked to dementia and confusion, but i don't know much about the practices and exposure.stuff like this:  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/w0kmdz/first_signs_of_the_disease_that_you_noticed_in_a/,First signs of the disease that you noticed in a loved one?

[removed]," there are six activities of daily living that are often evaluated to see whether someone has a need for assisted living \[and alzheimers care\].   they are:1. ambulating or functional mobility: to move about freely and safely.feeding:2. to feed oneself.3. dressing: to assemble an outfit and put clothes on properly.4. personal hygiene: to manage aspects of personal hygiene, such as bathing, grooming, and brushing teeth.5. continence: to control both bladder and bowel movements.6. toileting: to get to and from the restroom, use the restroom properly, and clean the self properly.when your loved one starts having problems with a number of these activities, it may be time for assisted living.  this was something that the facilities used both as a way to evaluate incoming patients and the level of care they need; and to establish their pricing \[based on the work they would have to do\].  here is a checklist from [pbs.org]( that is commonly used for evaluation. for completeness sake, here are a couple more tools:[[",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/vzdv69/transitioning_from_independent_living/,Transitioning from Independent living

[removed]," hi. sorry for your struggles. been there, done that.my partner had a range of psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on anxiety and depression. she was supposedly competent to manage her own meds. i saw some bad patterns emerging: too many benzodiazepines prescribed, little good effect. docs' failure to renew psych meds timely. suicide attempt. 100 lbs. body weight lost in one year. and i said ""aw hell no, i'm taking the meds in hand.""after years of my prodding docs and counselors, and another suicide attempt, finally a white coat said ""dementia?"" ultimately, yeah, alzheimer's.

my mom has already been taken advantage of a few times because she's pretty out of it and it's obvious to unscrupulous people. it's just a matter of when something worse happens financially. what steps do i take? ," it was very stressful to pay all the bills online for my mom - it must be years since she's been to a bank the last time to pay bills - so, i offered to do it for her. i'm pretty sure that she doesn't even remember how to do it anymore. then i started to do more and more of her shopping because she couldn't drive anymore. so, one day i suggested that i'll have her credit card from then on unless she wants it back for some reason. for occasional purchases i promised to make certain she'll always have enough cash in her purse (which has meant about 60-70‚Ç¨, a little more in dollars). at first she asked the credit card back a couple of times, but after a few months it was the new normal that she didn't have the card but cash instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/9o8af0/so_how_does_the_person_with_poa_take_over_the/,So how does the person with POA take over the finances?

"hi! i posted a while back about my mother in law and how to support my husband. i've taken a lot of the advice you fine humans provided, and it's helped me learn a lot about how to support him. we are still working it out, but the best thing that has come about is that he knows that it's safe to come to me and cry/yell/vent/whatever he needs. unfortunately, as i am sure many of you know, processing one aspect of having a family member with alz is often immediately followed by another more pressing situation. so here is where we are at: my mil is in the moderate-advanced stages. she lives independently with my fil in a senior community. i am unclear how many issues they are having at home regarding self-care, safety, etc because my fil is an expert at hiding her symptoms. i also have a brother and sister-in-law who recently moved back in a hurry to ""help support the family."" the quotes are intentional in that they've not helped nor supported anyone since they came into town. they are young parents, had an unplanned pregnancy very young and added a second one to the brood 4 years later. my in-laws provided them with endless support when they had their first, and continued to do so until they moved to a different state a few years ago. fast forward to now. they rushed moving back here before they could save up the money for an affordable home, so they went with the first overpriced condo they could find. to keep up with their finances, both of them work 50-60+ hours a week, often with no days off. their oldest is in school, so he's occupied until 2:30 on weekdays, and they finally found a preschool that they send their youngest to twice a week, but they rely on my in-laws for childcare 3-4 days a week. and these boys are exhausting. my fil is stressed, tired, and depressed. i don't think it's fair that he is spending his retirement and his remaining years with my mil caring for my nephews for 40 hours a week. on top of that, i am pretty sure that he is still letting her drive, possibly with the kids in the car. they have been told by their doctor that she should not be driving, and i am terrified for the safety of my nephews. we called him the other day, and he was with my mil and the kids and they were picking up his new car at the dealership. my husband tried to play it off like he had a plan that avoided her driving the kids, but i don't see how that could have happened.i am trying to help out. i have taken on one day a week, but i am also in an extremely intensive doctoral program taking 22 credits right now and i can barely keep up with that. they ask for 11-14 hour days for childcare, and neither child is disciplined enough to get anything done when they are home. so... wtf am i supposed to do here? my in-laws deserve peace. i want them to spend this time relaxing and spending time with each other, not chasing kids around for 12 hours a day. what can i say to my brother/sister in-law to get them to take care of their own lives? what can i say to my fil to make him realize how scary and inappropriate it is to let my mil drive, much less with the kids in the car?

i‚Äôm not sure i‚Äôm in the right sub but i‚Äôm getting desperate and i‚Äôm just looking for any advice that anyone might have. my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs when he was 64 that was two years ago and since then they have changed the original diagnosis to frontal temporal dementia and things have gone downhill rapidly. he lives with my mom and my younger brother in kentucky and my brother has been taking care of him during the day while my mom works and i visit when i can but i‚Äôm a few hours away. things weren‚Äôt great but livable until a couple weeks ago when my brothers appendix ruptured unexpectedly and i went down to take care of my dad so my mom could be with my brother. turns out the appendix was a bit of a blessing because they managed to discover a tumor and they removed it all quickly so even though it was cancer it hadn‚Äôt metastasized yet and he will only have to undergo one round of chemo but it‚Äôs been really hard for him to help my dad physically since he has been recovering from surgery and it has taken a real toll on my moms mental well-being. since my brother has returned home though my dad seems to be deteriorating rapidly. his hallucinations are getting worse and he is getting more violent and his balance is almost nonexistent. he keeps falling and not being able to get back up and he is larger man so my mom can‚Äôt always get him back up on her own. he also has a medical alert system ( think life alert) that he was using fine but he no longer seems to understand what it‚Äôs for and he keeps playing with it and alerting the company and he keeps trying to open the necklace because for some reason he thinks it‚Äôs a locket with something inside. so it has become apparent that he needs a caregiver or to be in a nursing home and we have no clue how to figure this out financially. he isn‚Äôt on medicaid/medicare because with his social security benefits and his pension he isn‚Äôt eligible but he is on my moms health insurance and she can‚Äôt afford her bills if she gets rid of his pension or benefits so that‚Äôs not really an option but we aren‚Äôt sure what options he might have. we don‚Äôt want to put him in a nursing home but we aren‚Äôt sure what level of care he would need. he has been reversing his nights and days and stays up all night and that‚Äôs when he tends to fall and he has also become incontinent so that‚Äôs another factor and basically we are just unprepared because we thought we had more time to save money before it got this bad. i was looking into care.com and local nursing homes but i‚Äôm really overwhelmed and feeling guilty that i‚Äôm not closer to help with the day to day stuff and if anyone has some experience with this i am all ears!," you should be able to get an in-home caregiver. your mother's insurance may cover at least some of the cost, or you may have to pay for it out of pocket, but it will still probably cost less than nursing home care. since he's over the age of 65 he should qualify for at least some types of medicare, which is totally different than medicaid. here is an eligibility calculator you can check for him: ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/9ivy00/any_advice_would_be_helpful/,Any advice would be helpful
"i decided that it would probably be a good idea to update my experiences since my last post [here](i'll try to keep this one relatively short compared to my last post, but i wanted to address somethings that you guys have suggested and ask a few more questions.first of all, his psychiatrist had prescribed him small dosages of an anti psychotic to administer to him 4 times throughout the day. we realized this was too small at first because it was not working at all. the psychiatrist then upped the dosage and said to give him two full pills twice a day. this had minimal effect. three days ago my dad had the worst aggressive/confusion episode yet, which lasted a little over an hour. my mom was home during this and had filmed some of it (we don't want any abuse allegations when they want to know why his face has bruises), but for the most part she attempted to help me control him. it did not work. i tried taking some of the advice of talking to him calmly, and we administered some ativan at the start of his episode, but it had no effect until we gave him a second one about 50 minutes into the episode. during this episode he was crying, hitting himself, getting in our faces and screaming at us, hitting his head on the fireplace and the doors, banging on the windows screaming for help, etc. i'm sure some of you have been through this before, so i won't get into too much detail. towards the end of his episode, he started screaming and asking us who we were, which i took as a very bad sign and i think it confirmed my suspicions that it was not a uti (he gets tested for one later, i'll get into that). while he was anxiously walking around looking for things to hit his head on, he tripped over a small box on the ground and fell on his side. while he fell he was crying and just muttering ""ow, ow"". it broke my heart. my poor younger brother later saw the video and also couldn't stand it. that whole event was too much, too sad, too painful to watch or even think about. that he could be in even more pain than he already was. that he just wanted to feel safe and secure, but i had no way to give that to him.my mom and i resolved to get him committed to a geriatric psych ward the next day. after taking him to the hospital and going through the routine tests, he went through a small episode in which a cop had to come in and restrain him to administer another anti psychotic. we then waited in the er for roughly 10 hours for them to get a bed ready, filled out the paper work and for the first time in awhile, were able to leave without having to worry about how he was going to be at home the next day. also they did a uti check, ct scan of his head (to make sure he didn't injure his head i guess), and some blood tests, all came back as healthy.the next day, my mom and i were pretty much on speaker phone talking to neurologists, nurses, doctors, social workers, etc. for a good while. they confirmed that this aggression is likely due to the disease and had asked if we thought about having him placed in a nursing home.we've wanted to put him in a home for some time now, but the spend down system really, really terrifies my mom. she says we will not have enough money for the mortgage if we lose his checks every month. to make matters worse, one of the social workers who has experience with spend down told her that they only examine money coming in and will look at both incomes, meaning that my mom's income may also be limited if we go through with this. her sister told her to forget it, but i told her she needs to talk to our attorney (which the caregiver said was one of the best elder law attorneys in the area) i told her i can't keep ""living"" like this and basically begged her to talk to the attorney, but i have a bad feeling she won't. i have no idea how a modern society like the us, can have no social safety nets for people dealing with this. if we spend down and limit our income we can't afford our mortgage. if we don't spend down, i can't even get a job to help my mom pay for it anyway. this is all at the state level too, which apparently, according to the social worker, means that we cannot fight this in a court."," i agree, you need to see an attorney. they do have solutions to a lot of situations the government and nursing homes cause. there are ways to accomplish what your mom needs. please see one as soon as you can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/9iuvgq/update_anger_and_confusion/,[Update] Anger and Confusion

"i'm sharing this story in hopes that someone can give me advice about what to do going forward.  it was clear the situation occurred due to illness but perhaps if i had been more knowledgeable it could have been different.today i moved into a new apartment, and was making trips carrying things upstairs with the help of friends. at one point i was outside and one friend had just carried in two window boxes with some rather lush plants in them and he put them out on the window ledge.  the upstairs neighbor somehow saw him and started insisting that the plants were hers but of course he politely told her they were not.  at that point i came upstairs and met the woman and could see quickly that she has a mental issue (other neighbors later confirmed alzheimer's) because her conversation was very repetitive.  i also told her the plants were mine and she apologized and left.  after my friends had left and i started arranging things, she rang my bell about five times within 90 minutes, each time politely apologizing for disturbing me but saying again that the plants were hers. each time she was more distressed and i suppose i should have just given her the two window boxes but i'm new at this and anyway i like my plants that i grew from babies....also, if i delayed answering the door (i was cleaning after all), she buzzed and buzzed.  i decided to go out for coffee thinking maybe if i wasn't there, she would forget.  i came back about 90 mins later and she was clearly waiting for me, coming down just as i was going in.  she pushed her way into my apartment, pushed me away, flung the window open (i thought she had broken it but it's ok), grabbed both window boxes and pushed me again heading out.  i didn't want to physically fight with her, as she is older and it could have been bad if she fell, but she's clearly healthy and strong.of course even before that, i was in touch with my landlady (a friend), who tried to call her to get her to leave me alone.  after this final event, she called the husband and said he has to keep his wife in better control or she will tell me it's fine to call the police  (i should add i live abroad, all of this happened in my second non-fluent language, and i would probably never call the police). i thought perhaps the husband would stop by later to apologize (give my plants back??) but hours have passed and i guess i should be relieved that they haven't rung my bell again.so, again, i recognize this is driven by illness and despite the shock i don't have any ill will towards this woman, but i certainly feel like i need to stay out of her way.  i suppose now that all my stuff is inside the apt, she won't try to claim anything else, but i'm worried what else might happen that i can't even guess. the other neighbors have said they have had problems with her stealing plants (from outside, not in their apts), throwing things off her balcony, and nagging people about keeping the (clean) stairs clean.any advice?  actually, i am currently dealing with end-stage cancer with my mother and that is super hard but my eyes have been flung open to just how hard this disease can be for families  to deal with."," it would probably be great if you brought her small plants as gifts from time to time. ""oh, mrs. jones, i was at the garden center earlier and i thought you would just love these african violets"", or engage her in conversation about the plants she has ""what variety of fern is this? oh really? how often do you water them?"". this kind of thing helps them see you as an ally and friend instead of as a threat, and giving them an opportunity to talk about something they love and are knowledgeable about can help them be more oriented in general.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/9fwara/first_experience_seeking_advice_for_dealing_with/,"First experience, seeking advice for dealing with neighbor."

i started noticing a few days ago my mom making mistakes that is uncharacteristic of her1. i accidentally turned off the lights in the garage where my mom was. then i quickly realized that she was in there and turned the light back on. i walked in to tell her sorry about that. but she looked at me and said can i turn the lights back on when it was. she‚Äôs been super busy and tired from the recent move to a new house so she was super exhausted at this state.2. my mom was making dinner for my dad. she had the water boiling while chopping up some veggies. she seemed to forget she was boiling the water and asked why my dad was boiling the water while chopping up the veggies.are these signs i should be aware of?, is she diagnosed with something?dementia (symptom) can be caused by any number of things- even something benign like sleep deprivation. make sure she's taking care of herself and not pushing too hard. a doctors visit will be worth a trip.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/9eqmt2/question_from_someone_new_to_this/,Question from someone new to this
"hi all,i need to purchase a new phone for my grandmother, who is in the mid-early stages of the disease. i‚Äôm trying to suss out something that‚Äôs good for a reasonable price and was wondering if anyone had some suggestions. i was also curious if anyone knew of an app or os for smartphones that could tailor a home screen for the purposes of someone with alzheimer‚Äôs? we have already tried the kisa phone and it didn‚Äôt work out. thanks! "," my mom quickly got to the point she couldn't use the remote for the television - regardless of how simple it was.  the phone was way beyond her. mom got to the place that a ringing phone scared her to death.  so we disconnected the phone in her room . a phone is a tool but for someone with alzheimer's it becomes confusing, overwhelming, scary or lost.  remember how serious this disease is.  mom has lost 3 pairs of hearing aids. we have no idea where she put them.  (at $5000 a pair). she's lost her dentures (they told us to engrave her name on them but we didn't). she hates to be touched. she is fighting the staff giving her eye drops for glaucoma.  it takes 5 people to hold her down to give her medications or an injection....yesterday her care center notified me that they're changing her diet to minced food.  and she will be given only plastic utensils and paper plates - because she's throwing table ware at the staff and other [residents.](my big take-away so far is that i need to be really clear if i'm doing something for my ease or my mom's. her world has shrunk so small that everything is frightening or overwhelming.  just remember whatever you do today, might be totally useless tomorrow -  depending of course on the progress and path her illness takes.i saw mom late last week.  she had 2 sentences she repeated: ""lock the door"" and ""i'm tired"".  and in the middle of repeating these 5 words, she broke out  yodeling - something she's never known how to do. all this while sitting with a group of residents all of whom are watching television.sorry to be such a downer but this illness is a real bitch. it strips dignity, morals, intelligence language, etc. etc. etc. be very clear about your expectations for her and yourself.

"hey everyone, i've been browsing this sub off and on since my dad was diagnosed in late 2014, early 2015. he was 54 at the time. i'm not sure where to start with this or why i am posting this, but i suppose i hope to relate to anyone else who has been or is in my position. i am the oldest of 4 children, at 23 years old and am currently wrapping up my final semester of college from home. i decided to stay home because i realized that with my mom working full time, my brother commuting downtown for his college, my sister dorming at her college, and my youngest brother in high school from 8 am to 3 pm, that no one would be able to take care of him. i overestimated my ability to handle this.my father has a bad habit wandering and getting very lost outside. in the last year there has been 2 incidents where he was missing in a very urban area for over 6 hours at a time. we invested in a gps watch and installed a new lock on our front and garage doors, but at times he still finds his way outside. we also installed various wifi cameras inside of the house that alert us whenever someone walks past, allowing us to easily catch him from getting too far if he does manage to figure the lock out. he has made it clear that he does not want to be in our house and would prefer to visit my aunt instead. he is obsessed with being anywhere but our house. he constantly asks, and this is true even today. every 15 minutes he is asking about visiting his sister, his mom or my mother's mom (she takes him to her house if we need to be out for the day or whatever) and it just wears us down so much, but that is manageable.for most of the summer, this was very manageable, partly because my dad would visit his sister, my aunt, in his hometown. she seems to be alright taking him in for up to a week at times, and last summer she even took him on a trip to a few different states where apparently he was fine. my dad would have mood fits, hysteria, and panic attacks occasionally, but we would administer a lorazepam, prescribed by his psychiatrist and this would calm him down within about an hour. this was workable and an easy solution to his issues. as of 2 weeks ago he has been very very confused, upset, and angry. he went through a phase like this before (minus the anger), so we thought we would be able to tough it out, but now it's just so much worse. my dad as of late has had incredible mood swings and confusion. anything you say or do is threatening to him. if you tell him sternly not to do something, he cries and attempts to run out of the house. if you tell him calmly not to do something, he gets aggressive and combative. if you have him in the car and help him put his seat belt on, he gets angry. when driving he attempts to open the car doors or even climb out the window because he thinks you are driving too fast and that you are going to kill him. yesterday was the worse he has ever been. at first i thought he was fine. he told me in his own way he was tired and he was going to attempt to sleep, so i used that time to get things done that i needed to. as soon as it was noon he flipped and kept walking into my bedroom to stare at me. when i ask him what was wrong he would scream ""i didn't do anything!"" and would slowly shamble out of my room. i follow, calm him down, return to my room after about an hour, then it happens again until i have to go pick up my brother and neighbor from high school. this is where it got very bad. he was upset about the seat belt thing i mentioned above, it took him about 10 minutes to get him into my car, numerous times he ran out into our yard and tried to get down the street before i would stop him. after finally getting in the car he started screaming i was going too fast and muttering things like ""i'm done. i just want to go."" while attempting to get out of my car while it was moving; i noticed he had undone the manual door lock as well so i had to be careful to lock it the door whenever he moved his arm over to it. on the way home, with my brother and neighbor in the car, he started screaming and aggressively posturing towards me. he, once again, yelled i was going to fast (i was going 5 under the speed limit of 40) and i was trying to kill him. anytime i would stop at a stoplight he would yell at me to keep going. when i finally got home and dropped my neighbor off, he got out of the car and aggressively circled in front of me, like he was anticipating a fight. i asked him to go inside while i attempted to call my mom. when he got to the doorway into the house he stood there and waiting until i got close so he could get into my face and scream again. at this point my mom heard me talking to him and heard him screaming that he was going to punch my face in. he never got violent but continued to aggressively posture towards me and would occasionally yell until i got him his lorazepam. as of now he has gotten almost violent towards my brothers and i. a few days ago he claimed he was going to attack my youngest brother because he was ""messing with his head"".then came the worst part. he apologized and continued to apologize, like he knew he did something wrong to me. i couldn't handle it. his mood changed so rapidly that i couldn't keep up. i realized that this will be my life and his life now until he dies or goes to a home. it was too sad to see him stuck in a cycle of doing something he doesn't want to do then feeling guilty for it. i wanted to help so badly, but i can't do anything for him. i have now realized that i am sacrificing my way of living, my life for someone that can't recover. i can't do this any more. i can not go through this every day for the rest of this stage of the disease. my family can't do this either, but we aren't putting him somewhere where they can really take care of him. i know that home will do the best for keeping their memory intact, but i can't deal with this every single day. i feel selfish and terrible. but the thing is he won't ever get better, i will never have my dad back.i'm so sorry for the huge post, but i need to know how other people deal with this."," get tested for a uti. then, place a plain black mat in front of the door. some alzheimers patients will see a black hole and simply turn around.

is there any therapy that can help with early onset," we went to a physical therapist to help with a painful shoulder. he suggested we see one of his coworkers for speech therapy as well. we haven't tried it, but the treatment is designed for those with parkinson's. the exercises can slow progression. the pt was amazing btw. my early onset lo is not good about communicating aches and pains (likely due to arthritis) and was able to get dressed better afterward. apparently wardrobe choices were simply what she could get on. hoping to go back for hip issues. she also gets massage therapy. helps with the aches, and the masseuse is great at getting her to talk. good for mind, body, and soul.

"hey everyone i just stumbled upon this community and i wanted to write a little bit about my grandpa who passed away last saturday. a friendly disclaimer beforehand, i am from germany so excuse any potential mistakes concerning grammar or terminology and whatnot; i also don't know if posts like these are allowed/appreciated. my grandpa passed away last saturday after years of fighting off the inevitable. even though we were kind of prepared it still hit us harder than we thought. he was diagnosed with alzheimers in 2014 i think but at that point he was not even able to write his name ""alexander"" or even ""alex"" in short in his medical evaluation so i guess he already had it for a lot longer. he had mixed up the names of my dad and me for years and he sometimes had trouble ""finding the right words"" and finishing sentences. in 2013 when i was at their house during lunchbreak he would later tell his wife that ""the tall guy with the bag"" (that is me) had been there cause he couldn't remember my name anymore. what i found weird was that compared to other documentaries i had watched about dementia and alzheimers was that he also degraded physically a lot. it came to a point where he could not move for longer than a minute and he couldn't walk down the stairs to their basement. his overall movement became very slow and it took multiple tries for him to get up from a seated position. from 2016/2017 he was constantly in and out of hospital with pneumonia, high fevers or other things. sometimes he would wake up at night and not realize he was in his own home and other times he would not even recognize his wife, his daughter or his sister. a few days before his passing he came out of the hospital again and they told us they had moved him to palliative care which was a bit of a surprise for us. he often refused to eat or drink, sometimes consuming not more than 2 or 3 glasses of water each day. maybe he didn't want to life anymore? there was one weird instance in 2014 a few weeks after his official diagnose. at this point he was not able to walk down the stairs for quite a while now but one night he managed to get down the stairs, woke up his sil and basically told her to lock him up and beat him to death which was odd and totally out of character for him to say something like that and since then this event stuck with us...he was 75 years old and an avid runner. going through his notes i have learned that he wasn't born a strong runner but he had the motivation to change his life in his late 30s and he wanted to do ""something sporty"". so he started off slow and painful and through hard work and determination (he ran 15 miles at least 3 times a week) he was able to run one marathon (26.2 miles) after another. i can't find the exact number but it's gotta be more than 35 marathons and he even participated in a few 100 km (62.1 miles) and 24 hour runs. in 2003 he also flew to nepal to go on a hiking trip. there are so many things i've learned in the last few days and i'm quite amazed about the things i read. i think it's a shame he could never tell me these things personally and convey the emotions he must have felt during these achievements. the burial is this friday and until then i hope to learn a lot more awesome things about my grandpa which light him in a different, motivational and happy way.thank you all for reading this! i just wanted to share this story... rest in peace [opa alex](", i'm so sorry for your loss. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/98ichp/my_grandpas_story/,[deleted by user]

"hey guys,i'm posting here because this is fairly recent, and i've mostly been alternating between crying and denial over the past two weeks. my situation is... problematic, to say the least. i'm 22 (almost 23), transgender &amp; finishing up my transition pretty soon (october); my brother's autistic, high functioning and 24 and violent/unemployed/neet-ish; my mom has issues of her own, undiagnosed. myself -- i work as a software engineer, i'm known to be pretty intelligent, i can more than ably take care of myself and have a good circle of friends and support more or less. most of my misery in life comes from my family, not really even due to the transgender thing (which is usually pretty bad by itself).for the purposes of below, my dad is about 59, and my mom is about 57.the past two years have been a rollercoaster of heartbreak, mostly - my dad was fired from his job of 20-something years in october 2016, and i helped him a new job around april 2017. he was then let go from the new job in march 2018, and was supposed to start another job (in florida, away from my family) in september of this year. he was fired for reasons i don't want to get into, but the running diagnosis up until there was unmanaged bipolar disorder, leading to episodes of mania and culminating in an involuntary psychiatric hold in october 2017 (my brother was also put in psychiatric hold at that time for attacking my mom).over this past year, my dad has been somewhat forgetful, and more distant from me conversationally, which i also ascribed to my transition (aka not knowing how to relate to a daughter, rather than his son). he's also had 4-6 minor car accidents. he's also on a cocktail of meds (abilify, prozac, trazadone, valsartan, atorvastatin, antabuse, omeprazole, and vyvanse) and historically has depression and alcohol issues (partially due to family drama). last month, my mom took my dad to see a neurologist (funnily enough the one who i used to see for my juvenile epilepsy, which thankfully i outgrew). the neurologist, owing to what my mom described and observing my dad, recommended my dad for further testing and told him he should minimize driving as much as possible.today and this past week, my dad's been going to testing at ucla, which culminated in the montreal cognitive assessment, which detected significant impairment in my dad's visiospatial &amp; mental tracking, and mild-to-moderate in verbal memory. this is indicative of cognitive impairment, and some amount of decline.my greatest fears is - does this likely point to early-onset familial alzheimer's dementia? his dad died of alzheimer's related dementia around 82, and his side does have a history of it, but from what i know in old age mainly. i don't know of any other sufferers of efad in our family line, but i can start searching.also - what does this mean for me? i'm in the process now of trying to schedule apoe/psen2 testing if i can get it, but i don't even know exactly how i'd handle the results *if* i get them."," it's incredibly frustrating,  but there won't be any easy answers.  a lot of this will depend on evaluations over time and determining the extent of changes in his cognitive abilities as well as mri results.  i'm more familiar with frontal temporal dementia and the genetic implications.  my mother passed away from this.  if she carried the genetic marker, i would have had a 25% likelihood of developing it too. the  neuropsychiatrist took a blood sample from my mom to see if the gene was even there.  however, i chose to have him throw out the sample and cancel the test and not know.  it would have been too easy to label any odd behavior as an indication that i might be developing it.  even without the genetic testing,  i'm still anxious a lot of the time.  i think you just need to prepare for the future and this would be true  regardless.  if dementia doesn't get you,  there are multiple other diseases that might.  there are no guarantees in life.  as far as your dad is concerned,  i agree that you need to get some things in place - a financial and a medical poa,   a plan for the future.  do talk to your local alzheimer's organization.  they have many resources.  if your dad is eligible for va benefits,  check that out now.  it can take months to get them started.  make sure you're talking to the right kind of doctor(s) and that they are the type of people who will patiently answer your questions.  get those meds evaluated.  that just sounds like a lot of stuff and i agree... those would cognitively impair anybody. finally, live your life.  if this is dementia, you can't change the outcome.  it is very easy to take on so much responsibility,  you sacrifice your own needs and wants.  your family should sit down as a group and collaborate.  i know you're worried about the implications. there are counselors who work with adult children of dementia sufferers,  frequently licensed counseling social workers.  i started working with one several months ago and its helped me clarify a lot and make decisions based on what was in my best interests.whatever you learn,  good luck.  you sound like a very competent,  caring individual.  its unfair of life to saddle you with so much to worry about at your age.  just remember,  you can't take care of anybody else unless you're  ok.  so don't forget to take care of yourself,  too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/97y6n8/my_dad_might_have_earlyonset_dementia_and_i_dont/,"My dad might have early-onset dementia, and I don't know what to make of it."

i was talking on the phone with my mom who i speak to almost daily. she asked me the same question and replied to my answer in three consecutive statements. it wasn't a short question but her question was long. my answer was long and her response was long. the strange thing was that it seemed like it was a tape player being reversed. same words/phrases.a similar thing happened when my son was talking to her today... and he was freaked out and calling her to stop repeating something. i took the phone from his hands and called out mom. mom. its me. she was silent but the started repeating what she said to my son. i hung up. then i called her back and she said she nether heard/remembered him or me calling out to her. finally she got angry at us.what the hell is happening?," for certain individuals, that's just going to happen, with each case being unique. we met up with friends of my mom, who has dementia, one of whom also suffers from dementia, who literally kept asking my mom where she lived and would she like to visit her home every 5 minutes. this to the point where even my mom noticed and commented on the behavior. there's not much to be done, but i *am* interested in what the new fda approved alzheimer's drug does.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o3muyp/this_has_now_happened_twice_in_a_span_of_two_weeks/,This has now happened twice in a span of two weeks.
"i vented on this sub the other day about my experiences caregiving for my grandma, how she fell three nights ago, and how she finally agreed to move into assisted living after my dad insisted. she still seems agreeable to the move, but she is now saying it may take a while because she needs to research facilities, sell every single piece of furniture and knick knack in the house, then sell or rent the house. she insists she needs to be the one to do these things. this seems like an attempt to drag out the timeline, so my dad and i are starting to strategize to combat any further excuses she may have. my dad talked to her and said he would do all the research and take care of the house and furniture later because it's imperative she move into a safe home as soon as possible. she grumbled, but didn't argue. our plan is to research and choose two assisted living communities that will best fit her needs, go over the choices with her, have her tour them, then have her choose which she likes best. if she decides not to tour or make a choice, my dad will choose for her. on moving day, if she resists, my dad will tell her not going is not an option. if she still resists, he will fib and say he will delay putting her home up for sale in case she hates assisted living and wants to come back, but she has to give it a chance.if she still resists, everyone is in agreement to present a united front and say: i'm moving out immediately, my dad and other family won't visit, her best friend/housekeeper won't come to clean or bring groceries. is this too cruel to say? we can't actually follow through, it's way too dangerous for her to be alone.any advice for if she still refuses after everything is said and done? any other ideas or better ways of going about this? we've tried the patient route, but it seems tough love is more effective at this point."," i’m so sorry, making the move is really hard and she is very unlikely to do it on her own. my mom did a similar stall with a planned fall move day of fall 2019. we had even signed papers for a lovely senior independent living apartment that at the last minute she backed out of. long story short - her delusions and anxiety that prevented her from moving kept getting worse and late in the year my husband was hospitalized for close to two weeks with an emergency life-threatening situation resulting in major surgery. in the meantime her anxiety, unrelated to my husband’s surgery, and her general lack of awareness that for those 15+ days i was not able to put everything aside and immediately address her needs was when i made the arrangements and i moved her myself (i have power of attorney).if i had known 2020 was going to be a complete lockdown i may have waited until this spring but who could have predicted what the year would be. although the strict social distancing in 2020 was really, really hard on her, just getting three nutritious meals a day improved her coloring and general well-being, but nothing really helps much with the memory loss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o3iqhe/tips_for_how_to_move_grandma_into_assisted_living/,Tips for how to move grandma into assisted living?
"about five years ago when my grandpa was 89, he had no obvious issues with dementia and was mentally sharp. one day he called my mom into the kitchen when my grandma was in the back room and touched her butt and asked her if she liked it. a few months later i hugged him goodbye and he asked to hug a little longer and then touched my butt.fast forward a few years later it’s obvious now he does have dementia. he often things there are cops after him and wakes up confused not knowing where he is. a few months ago i was cleaning for him, grandma gone, and he said he wished we weren’t related so we could get together. i said that was sick and he said “you’re not wrong.” then yesterday he straight up told my mom they should have sex. she threatened to tell her mom / his wife and he said “you know you better not do that.” he knows it’s wrong, he knows we are his daughter and granddaughter, and he is aware enough of reality to not do it in front of our grandma. is this all really just dementia? the other thing that gets me is when mom was a teenager he had a weird night where he checked her out and later tried to put his hand up her skirt during a movie. what if he is always a pervert and it’s not just dementia?"," if it really happened to your mom when she was a teenager, it cannot be dementia.  is it possible she misinterpreted things?  i get the feeling the answer is no so yes, i actually think he was always a pervert.but what's happening now is that he can't hide that perversion as well anymore.  my dad cannot hide what's inside anymore.  which isn't being a pervert but he's constantly insulting people cause that's what he really thinks in his mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o3immd/is_this_all_just_dementia_grandpa_sexual_towards/,[deleted by user]

"okay so this may be another dementia rant, or i may be at a wrong subreddit... but i dont know where else to go... i'm tired of having close friends tell me to ""be patient"" or ""i know you're strong"" and ""its going to get better soon."" so after observing my 65y/o mom deteriorating, me and my sisters decided to see a geriatric psychiatric. during the first session, the doc said she looks fine, because even during the session, mom was able to correctly tell the day and the time roughly, telling that she knew it was around 4 pm because her appointment was at 3 pm, remembered all her daughters and grandchildren. she was also able to form perfect english sentences, and describe things quite vividly, except for a few mistakes. this frustrates us a little because at home, she would always ask us the time and confuse day for night, getting anxious that she didn't get her meds yet and its getting late (my sister comes down on time to hand her the amount she needs to take, because she used to take double dose or skips them altogether) when its actually just not the time yet. she cant even wear her clothes right, always mixing up the holes and cries in confusion when her head couldn't fit into the arm hole. she would ask one of us where did the other go, she would claim she saw our youngest sibling getting into a strange car with a guy and would get all worried, when the said sibling had been sleeping in her room all this while. she would claim that she saw my sister's car, who had been living in another state and hasn't come back for nearly a year due to covid, and would say that we are hiding her in our rooms so that she can never meet her. saying the truth and even explaining gently is useless because it will end up in her crying because ""its true and nobody believes me in this house"" and ""nothing i say is ever right!"" she is always suspecting us of always being against her and that everyone just wants her to suffer, so she never believes anything we say. even when we praise her for being able to do something, she would cry and say ""of course i can, why did everyone treat me like an incapable child""the doc only suspected possible dementia due to my sisters' statement of moms' behaviour and the results of her evaluations (on paper, like she had to draw some objects and write some words) so she set a date for her to go for a brain scan, blood and urine test. we were hoping to finally get a concrete diagnosis... but alas... doc said there is only minimal brain shrinkage, normal for her age but not enough for significant disruption, all her vitals are healthy and urine test came out fine. the doc is also confused and finally ruled it down to depression and some issues with focusing on a task.  she was prescribed with antidepressants but that didnt help except that she cried less. we are at our dead end, we stopped going to psychiatrist because it costs too much. there are government general psychiatrist which are free, but we went and the doc there only spends 30 mins telling her to be happy and basically we have to care for her better so that she wont be depressed. we can't get senior care or help because we have no concrete idea on what's the issue, and homes are limiting intake due to covid.can depression mimic dementia? or is it something else? i can relate to most of the stories and symptoms posted in this subreddit so we were certain that this was the problem, but having a specialist doctor tell you ""well, your mom seems fine, maybe just a little bit out of focus"" and that she was supposed to be healthy really messes with you, especially when you have struggled to care for her drastically changed behaviour and wanted to come to terms with this condition. we've been telling the kids and her friends that its dementia because we thought it would be easier for them to understand, but we don't know if that's the best action. she's definitely not fine, definitly not just a bit sad, and we're confused and tired."," if the doctor only did a brief mental status examination, that might not have been enough to detect the problem. it would be good to get a thorough neuropsychological evaluation from a neuropsychologist who specializes in dementia. neuropsychologists with this expertise can usually be found at hospitals with recognized dementia centers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o2m5bi/confusion_with_diagnosis_maybe_another_rant_long/,"Confusion with diagnosis, maybe another rant (Long post)"

"all of the articles i can find about alcohol and dementia talk about the effects of alcohol on developing dementia. there’s certainly disagreement, but many seem to think that heavy alcohol usage can increase the risk of dementia and light alcohol usage can decrease. what about in someone who already has dementia? is light alcohol usage likely ok (or at least not that bad?). or would people with dementia be best served by completely abstaining from alcohol?"," the only alcohol that is considered good for dementia is quality red wine as far as i’ve read. it is rich in anti-oxidants. however it is best to talk to a doctor about this. in regard to developing dementia there is a type of encephalopathy that develops from alcoholism however it is extremely fatal and life expectance can be within 6 months of diagnosis. so the only type of alcohol usage that leads to a decreased risk is alcohol that contains antioxidants when drank in moderation. otherwise alcohol is known to be an inflammatory substance. inflammatory substances can make current brain disorders, injuries, and other illnesses worse. additionally they can make people with dementia have exacerbated symptoms, new symptoms, or accelerated decline. depending on the patient though no alcohol may be required. the reason for this can be seizures/epilepsy. people with epilepsy have issues with activity in the brains and inflammatory substances can be seen to create more of a likelihood that an epileptic episode will occur.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o2b310/some_alcohol_ok_during_dementia/,Some alcohol ok during dementia?

"i just need to vent, i guess.my 86 year old grandmother was diagnosed with dementia 3.5 years ago. she was still able to complete most of her adls, could pay her bills, and manage her appointments. the concern at the time was her short term memory was starting to go and her physical mobility was declining. she started falling more.her doctor recommended she have someone in the home to assist with her physical limitations and be there in case of a fall. my husband and i were in process of selling our home and moving out of state to be closer to his father, but after talking with my grandmother, she asked if we could delay our plans, move into her home, and help her age there until it was time for her to move into assisted living.things were fine for a while, but she has taken major dive in the last year. her short term memory comes and goes. her long term memory is starting to go. she no longer bathes or dresses. she refuses meals other than mcdonald's or chocolate. she has urinary incontinence and is starting to experience sudden loss of control of her bowels. she mistreats her dog and overfeeds her treats and food to ""make up"" for it. any assistance or advice the family/her best friend provides is now seen as butting into her business or turning against her. she is verbally violent and has said she wants to kill my 4 year old son and have me terminate my current 4 month pregnancy. it took us 6 months to finally get her to see a doctor but when she got there she refused every single test the doctor wanted to run. she has fallen 8 times in the past year. she is 5'1"" and probably over 200 lbs. it is extremely difficult to lift her. it's all dead weight because she has become so weak.she refuses to go into a senior facility although every single person in her life is saying it would be best and we all believe she would thrive there. i'm experiencing care giver fatigue to the extreme. i'm stressed out of my mind and overwhelmed. my husband and my dad (her son) are extremely supportive, but we all feel done with this situation. her needs are beyond what we can provide. her doctor has been recommending assisted living since august 2019.last night, she fell while we were all asleep. she apparently tried getting herself up for nearly 2 hours because she was embarrassed, but finally called out for help.my husband and i were so unsure of what to do. i can't help lift her as i'm 4 months pregnant and my husband hurt himself the last time. my husband and i were debating how to get her up and she kept telling us to shut up and get her up. i called my dad who lives 5 minutes away. he wanted to call an ambulance but she started yelling at us to just get her up. he and my husband finally got her up and back in bed a little after midnight.my dad put his foot down and gave her some tough love. he said: ""this is the last time we are picking you up. the next time you fall, an ambulance will be called. i am looking into assisted living tomorrow. i will gather information for us to review together. i will take you to tour them. you will decide which place you like best. your needs are now beyond what we can provide. this is what's best for you. it's time. you are going.""she now seems to accept she will be moving into assisted living. she called some friends and told them today. i'm so fearful she will think about it more and start to resist again.we've talked to 2 places today and set up meetings for a few more. her only requests are that the place is local, pet friendly, and that she has access to a fridge and tv. easy enough. i hope she really goes. not going is not an option. i can't do this anymore. i want my life and freedom back. i'm just so damn nervous she will end up refusing to go. then what?"," >not going is not an option.that really is what it all boils down to.you've done everything you can, a bit more than that.don't give her any other options. this isn't up for discussion any more -- **it's settled.** you have made the decision, it's a matter of where, not if.she's at a point where she needs you to make some decisions for her, whether she admits that or not. be firm, for everyone's sake, including hers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o29kwu/will_she_finally_go/,Will she finally go?
"about 3 weeks ago, grandma was admitted to the hospital for lack of energy and dizziness. she stayed there for a few days, seemed happy to be getting some 24 hour care, and seemed to be doing well. after her hospitalization she was sent over to skilled nursing, for what was supposed to be a temporary stay before she went onto her new memory care facility. it has gone disastrously. everything that was happening at home was now being amplified. she wouldn't eat, drink, take her medicine...and she started hitting, which is a first. she has been verbally abusive in the past, but the physical violence was a new behavior. she's 94, and weights 110lbs at the most, but the poor staff were obviously having a hard time getting her to calm down.when the nurse at the memory care facility was notified of this, she said grandma couldn't come and that a geropsych unit was more suitable. i couldn't believe it...grandma's behavior has gotten so difficult, not even a specialized memory care unit can take care of her.originally, she was supposed to start hospice at the memory care facility since she's refusing meds and food/water, but now we have to figure something else out. we're hoping her current skilled nursing facility is willing to take her, so that she can at the very least start hospice care. what should have been a relatively straight forward 2-3 week transfer over to memory care has turned into weeks and weeks of stress and heartache.if you're reading this now and thinking to yourselves ""should i get my lo into al/memory care?"" do it now. don't wait until it's too late. don't wait until your lo has to get into a psychiatric facility because they're refusing to take their medications, and they're being verbally/physically abusive. if i had just gotten things done a month sooner, we wouldn't be in the position we're in now.", my question is how is she being treated. people with dementia respond to their environment. and it’s super well known that they decline in institutionalized environments.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o29hp0/well_grandmas_too_violent_for_memory_care/,Well.

"hi i’m 20 years old and i live with a large family, we have my mom, 15 year old brother, 22 year old sister plus her boyfriend and their 2 year old son, then we have my aunt and my grandparents. so it’s a very large family in a like 6 bedroom home just to give a bit of a background. recently my grandma who’s around 76 has been showing signs of dementia and it’s just kinda hard to deal with. a few weeks ago she wandered out of her room at about 1am which is near my room and she started opening the closet door in the hallway and started going to the bathroom. she unfortunately fell because when she tried to sit there was no toilet just the floor and my mom came out of her room and found her and asked what she was doing and she was very confused saying she was going to the bathroom. then once again this morning around 10am my mom and i had just gotten home from my doctors appointment and my grandma was cooking dinner and asking when jack (my sisters bf) was going to pick up the rest of the food for dinner. my mom was confused and asked why she was cooking dinner and my grandma didn’t really answer and then just proceeded to say that the dogs needed to be fed, the dogs are typically fed everyday around 4-5pm. my mom told my grandma it was morning time and reminded her that she just ate breakfast. my grandma was convinced it was about 5:00 and my mom eventually told her to look at the clock and then my grandma was just like “oh what do ya know it is morning!” it’s just starting to get really difficult because she sometimes seems unsafe, or for instance she’ll sometimes pick up the 2 year old and he weighs about 35 pounds and my grandma is a small very unsteady woman. she still drives and still picks up the baby whenever she can a couple times we’ve found her getting the newspaper at like 3am. we’re just all kind of unsure what to do and we want to support her the best we can but it is very difficult when there are so many people in the home and especially a babies safety to consider. if anyone has any input i’d love to hear some! this has only been going on about the past 6 months or so so she is also still in the denial stage that anything is actually wrong."," in addition to the resources another listed, see if you can also talk to her primary card doctor for advice and help.  my mom’s helped a great deal and my mom had to sign forms so we could talk to her doctor on behalf of my mother.edits",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o278v5/grandma_is_deteriorating/,Grandma is deteriorating
"currently waiting for aps to arrive to take my grandma into a facility. my mother died when i was young. i am her last living relative. i had to move in with her because she ran through an entire companies caretakers. they all kept quitting because they didn’t want to work with her. she is extremely abusive. social services came out yesterday with a pallative nurse. the nurse said she had never seen anyone as angry and abusive as my grandma. that really gave me validation for what i have been going through. i’ll update this later: hopefully with good news, but who knows."," ugh. sympathies to you. my dad is generally very considerate and hasn’t had too many meltdowns. he had one last night and told my bil and my son to “f-off”. not terrible in the scheme of things but very uncharacteristic (although he dislikes bil and he is not crazy about my son either - they both loves sports which he hates). today he apologized and said it was because he gets stressed due to his father, mother, sisters and brother all dying when he was a child. (his father died when he was 14, his mother when he was 50, his only sister when he was 80, no brother).  he was confused by father’s day. i think he thought it was his birthday because of the gifts and he asked many times what his age is. sigh. hang in there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o278l3/waiting_for_adult_protective_services/,Waiting for Adult Protective Services
"my grandma (83f) lives between my mom and my aunt. i called her today to see if she wanted to eat dinner with me and my family tomorrow. i had to deal with 10-15 minutes of manic. she immediately broke down on the phone. didn’t know where my aunt was, couldn’t communicate why she was upset, couldn’t remember that she signed a lease to her new al place (i think that happened earlier today or yesterday). i stayed on the phone, remain calmed, listened and waited till my aunt was in the room. i texted my aunt letting her know that grandma was confused and manic and the reason why she didn’t come in sooner was she was in the shower. the fucking shower next to my grandma’s room. i sat on the phone while my aunt comforted my grandma and waited till things calmed down. this all started because my grandma started to get verbally aggressive over something stupid. then she cycles into the victim role and blames herself; she needs professional help i’m aware but she refuses. i was about to take a half day from work and drive over to her just to hug her. i was scared for her mental sanity and physical in case my aunt was outside doing yard word or something. i’m seeing her after i coach tonight but i’m just exhausted. i’ve been up since 5:30 this morning and really wanted to just go home. i’m so tired of being her crutch and her refusing help. she has major trauma and abandonment issues which results in her trusting literally no one but family. i don’t even feel bad complaining at this point. i’m honestly excited for her to be moving to an al in the fall so she can get the support she needs and feel better about herself. no need for sympathy or support i just needed a place to rant.", you are not alone in your struggles.  we all understand and often feel as helpless and confused and frustrated as you are feeling today.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o26ru1/just_need_to_rant/,Just need to rant
"my father is in his mid 60’s, and has suffered with manic depression and anxiety for the past decade. i don’t get to see my parents nearly enough, especially because of covid. i’ve noticed, however, his memory beginning to slip more and more over the past year or so - as has he, “please don’t tell your mother i can’t remember things any more.” my mother has been in denial, i think because she is just so close to the situation and doesn’t see the drastic developments. about 2-3 weeks ago (and they’ve only increased), he began having hallucinations and delusions of hearing voices, seeing his dead sibling, seeing old co-workers he hasn’t seen in 15 years, and telling me he needs to get the case ready for work. he’s retired. after extensive inappropriate behavior, wandering around outside naked, being blatantly rude / no filter, losing motor skills for walking / eating, and incontinence, i asked my mother to take him to get evaluated. i asked her if she was sure this isn’t dementia. that was almost a wake up call. she took him to the er, and they did a ct (nothing abnormal) and lots of lab work. nothing physically wrong. because of his behavior and mental state - thinking it’s 1998, thinking clinton is president, telling me to go to high school, telling me about how he saw his ex-mil, etc — they admitted him to the geriatric psych ward. they did this to “regulate his medication” and order a neuro/ psych test to confirm a dementia diagnosis . after a few days of no updates, we finally get a call that the neuro test has been approved and they’re waiting for the results. i just don’t know where to go from here or how to support his care. i don’t know how to support my mother in this."," i’m not sure why my post is being down voted. this is such a new development for our family, and i don’t know anybody with first hand experience, nor do i have anyone to talk to about this. i was hoping to share to be in a like minded community to get resources and information.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o26nr5/looking_forward_and_dont_know_where_to_turn/,Looking Forward and Don’t Know Where to Turn
"my (f60) mil (f81) has been experiencing progressive memory loss over the past three years.  it has accelerated during covid. she no longer remembers visiting us in another state or frequent calls with loved ones.  my husband (m60), her eldest son, was recently hospitalized with a severe infection.  she was staying with us at the time.  she could not remember why he was in the hospital, why when she couldn't see him due to covid protocols or where the hospital was.  last week she called him three nights in a row wanting to know what his illness is and why she hadn't been told about it.  she has lost the ability to problem solve, ie if she can't remember her pin number she walks away from the purchase rather then paying by credit card or check. in conversation we speak of the same things over and over.  her hygiene is declining, only showers once a week and wears dirty clothes. she frequently has no food in her home due to the pin issues. she has cycles where she says that she is ill and cannot describe what is wrong. during these episodes she is more confused and combative.  they appear to happen around every 4 to 6 weeks. i could go on but you get the picture.her children have taken her to a gerontologist where she passed the simple memory questions with ease. she was prescribed anti depressants which she took for a while.  a referral to a neurologist was granted and she saw one in december and again passed the memory questions with ease.  i took her in may and she did not do as well on the memory questions and a mri was ordered.  she had it this week and the results are normal.  this is a blow to the family as we had hopes it would shed light on her condition and provide a diagnosis and a treatment plan.  she has another appointment in early july and we do not have a lot of hope that it will provide us with much information.have any of you had any similar experiences?  are there other tests that we can request that might offer us a path forward?  we are very concerned because she is currently living alone and it doesn't seem like this will be an option for much longer.  many thanks to you all in advance for reading my rather lengthy post.  any information or advise would be greatly appreciated.", an mri is not diagnostic in this situation. i would suggest finding a recognized dementia center and getting both a neurological and neuropsychological evaluation. the latter is important because it is much more thorough than the short mental status evaluation that mds usually administer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o25i8y/mother_in_law_with_moderate_to_severe_memory_loss/,Mother in Law with Moderate to Severe Memory Loss and Normal MRI

"hi... me (65 yo female); my husband (79 yo male, retired physicist); married 31 years.  i've been worried for about 18 months that my husband is showing signs of dementia.  (i also believe he has undiagnosed autism.  and he has been a heavy drinker for at least the last 8 years, although slightly less recently.)  any advice as far as getting him to discuss honestly with his doctor?  he can be very stubborn and has a long history of hiding things from his doc-- for example, doc will ask about drinking and he will reply that he's a moderate/social drinker (when he's drinking a bottle of wine per day, every day.  i have talked with him and given him books/articles about the detrimental effects of too much alcohol on the brain-- he cherry picks one study that shows a positive effect and dismisses the stuff he doesn't want to hear.)  he's been pretty adamant that he doesn't want to talk about possible dementia with his doctor or do any baseline testing, and he often finds a way to minimize things that are going on or write it off as due to ""xyz"" rather than possible dementia.  (he's recovering from gout and this week is attributing his anxiety to after effects of prednisone.  he's forgotten that he's been very anxious for the last 18 months.)  he's become very needy/wakes up afraid nearly every day, and i see him struggling-- having trouble remembering storylines and characters in shows that we are watching together; at times taking really weird driving routes or being uncertain about how to go somewhere he's been driving to for years; forgetting conversations or decisions that we've made together; difficulty learning new things; occasionally having frightening dreams and yelling out in his sleep.  (but it is still at a point where it is not that noticeable to anyone other than me.) dementia is most likely terrifying to him, as i think it would be to any of us.  about a year ago i discussed with a therapist the idea of going behind his back to alert his doctors of my concerns but have held off on doing that because i know he would see that as a huge violation of trust.  we have 4 adult kids and i've briefly discussed it with our oldest son; the other 3 live very far away and i have not said anything to them, but i worry that they may be missing the chance to have some meaningful conversations with their dad.  i honestly don't know what is the best thing to do... my gut feeling is that he's in denial but his personality is one where he is either at one extreme or another... i don't know that he wouldn't just give up totally if he thought he is developing dementia.  (his maternal grandmother had dementia and lived into her 90's-- she was very far gone for the last 10 years or so of her life.)  thanks for taking the time to read this and i appreciate any input you might have.", thank you all for your thoughtful replies.  i have written a confidential letter to my husband's primary care doctor and his cardiologist.  he has appointments with both doctors coming up within a couple of weeks.  his primary care doc is pretty new to us (he's only seen him once before) but my husband is scheduled for a senior physical with him. (pc has a very kind and compassionate bedside manner.) i am hopeful that appointment will start the ball rolling to get a comprehensive evaluation and whatever tests/imaging are appropriate.  this is sooo hard :(  my heart goes out to each of you dealing with this.  it was hard watching my father decline with dementia but it is even harder when it is my husband.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o1ms7a/first_time_poster_worried_about_husband/,First time poster- worried about husband

"sorry, long story. so my mil, technically my gmil, was taken to the hospital last night. we called the police and an ambulance because were instructed by a social worker through our county, that if she becomes violent and erratic to call and have her admitted to the geriatric unit of the hospital near us for evaluation (einstein medical.) the past few weeks she has been obsessed with 92k, the asking price for a condo that my wife and i sold, which has been in my wife’s name since since ‘08. we used the money to renovate the run down home that we bought from her. bought for 200k. now here is where it gets violent. sunday night she hit me across the face several times. my wife found knives in her drawer on saturday. she cleans out her bedroom when i take mil to get her hair done, because mil hoards. the past two weeks mil has said she would stab my wife, and shoot her in the gut. my wife is 5 months pregnant and has high blood pressure. she started again with the erratic and violent behavior. so we called the police and she is at the hospital admitted. her “friend” has been a problem. he knows she has dementia, and eggs her on. he has gone so far to contact my wife’s cousin saying that we beat and abuse mil. total lies. that’s what my mil believes though. her car sits in the driveway because her primary dr is taking her license. mil thinks we are keeping her prisoner. she refuses to take a taxi and never tells us she wants to go anywhere when we ask her. we are located in pa, usa. are there any recourses we can use to get mil’s friend away from her? we have already told him that he cannot come to the house. my wife has power of attorney both medical and financial."," did you record any of her out bursts? my mom was violent towards my dad and was paranoid and delusional. i luckily had installed cameras and recorded her hitting my dad. i showed the doctors to prove what was going on. because like your mil, she was really good at showtiming. there is also a real disconnect in the dementia world between cognitive decline and mental health issues. it's like cognitive decline (like forgetting things) is considered a completely different realm from psychiatric symptoms like paranoia/delusion. and if you show mostly psychiatric symptoms, they want to push you off into the psychiatric world.many people aren't familiar with fronto-temporal dementia where the behavior changes drastically and the memory changes aren't as dramatic.  it sounds like your mil needs a mental health nurse or psychiatrist  that specializes in geriatrics. they are really really really difficult to find. we only found a good one once my parents moved into a ccrc. (mom is still living with dad in independent living.) and she was able to find the correct medication cocktail to stop the violence and curb the paranoia. as for her friend, you can tell whatever facility she is in to block them. if you mil has a phone, block that person's number or set it up that it only receives calls from a list that you set up. and if she has the number in her phone contact list, either remove it or change the number to one that is a fax number or an out of order number.   if mom asks about friend, you are either vague (yeah, that's strange he/she hasn't contacted you) or you outright lie and say (he/she said they were mad at you and to never contact them again.)oh, yeah, also learn about therapeutic lying. my dad's (who is honest to a fault) life got a lot easier when he started therapeutically lying to my mom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o1lgah/mil_is_now_in_the_hospital_and_her_friend_is/,MIL is now in the hospital and her “friend” is exacerbating things.
"so my stepmother's dad lives with us. he is a very bored man despite all we get for him.literally anyone who shows up to our house and looks alone, be it car repairmen, people we're looking to sell our stuff to, hello fresh delivery men, and so on and so on, he constantly shows up to the front door, tries to offer food and water, tries to introduce himself and shake their hands, and constantly rambles on about his life. it is not anyone's burden but ours, but when my stepmother isn't home we're powerless to get him to just stay inside and not bother anyone. there are multiple reasons this is all bad.* he has a tendency to leave the door open. combined with unfamiliar people walking through the front gate, this could let our dogs out.* he is a disgusting man, who's had dysentery in the last two years due to how he eats everything with his hands and rarely washes his hands. we even had to stop having a bin in our kitchen recently because he keeps bindiving for food that's expired, or scraps like bones left with tiny bits of meat on them that we've thrown away. it's constantly annoying to run out to every guest and offer them sanitiser but thanks to the pandemic a lot more people are keen on accepting it these days.   * speaking of the pandemic, it's not like we want him to die either. every time he goes out he risks himself a great deal, but he doesn't understand why he specifically can't interact with people.* a lot of the people we have over are service workers charging by the hour, and he's distracting and bothering them, also financially hurting us.* he is not a good man, but he's proud of his life. talking to him long enough reveals that he's banged his way across the world and has dozens of kids from his time as a flight attendant. people do not feel comfortable hearing his stories.* he does attempt to flirt with every woman that comes by. even my friends back when i was in highschool. this of course again, makes female guests uncomfortable.we just really don't want to share his shame with every random person who shows up to our yard.one time i tried to intervene by telling him to go feed our sheep since she's probably hungry from all the yard work lately, and instead he took the guest in to see the sheep in the backyard. this guest was a customer from the facebook marketplace, no, we don't want them inside exploring our house.today as i saw him come out to another guest i tried telling him outright to just stay inside, and he complained at me that he shut the door (since my father told him to make sure the door stays shut, with the implication being to not even open it to go outside but he ignored that).how are we supposed to deal with him? he can barely remember our rules, and when he does he despises them. we're very close to just sending him to a retirement village but we're trying to delay that as long as possible."," honestly, if you're able to get him into that retirement village, you should do it.  that hygiene problem is a sign things aren't working at home.  and as an extreme extrovert, he should like it a lot once he gets over that he's in a retirement home.  i'm sure it'll be way easier on you guys too unless it costs a small fortune and your country doesn't cover it.if covid is the concern right now then i'd still wait until he can get the vacinne.  in the mean time, do not schedule service people to come when your grandmother is not there or take him on a walk before they arrive. .  and take some other work off grandma if he is too overwhelming an effort. do not worry about the shame part.  it doesnt matter what strangers think and as for friends, i just tell them my dad has dementia and they just think it's the disease talking (when actually my dad has always been sxist and made up stories to make himself look good).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o1k551/how_do_i_stop_my_grandfather_from_being_annoying/,How do I stop my grandfather from being annoying to guests?

hey everyone. so my grandma is potentially moving into an assisted living situation. there’s a lot of details i’m going to be leaving out but i wanted to hear some experiences people have had and if they recommend looking for an assisted living vs memory care/dementia unit. my aunt has been spearheading this so i know very little besides the name of the place. i’ve done the basic research i can and my biggest worry is that they place her in the assisted living when she actually needs to be placed in the memory care. i’m no nurse but they will be doing a 30 day health evaluation prior to her moving if it all works out (ie if my grandma is able to make the decision which she really shouldn’t be. she has severe anxiety and fear related issues that makes literally anything new terrifying. she won’t even see a therapist due to fear of being locked away.) so anyone have experience with either memory care or assisted living homes? and what should i expect? i’m her granddaughter whose been helping her out the most and as of now she still remembers me so i want to provide as much support as i can.," from my experience, it really won't be up to your grandma if she can go into al or memory care. when they do the evaluation, either a nurse or physician will do a cognitive assessment to see if she's suitable for al. if they feel she needs more help than al can provide, they will recommend memory care.does grandma have a diagnosis? the facility may want an diagnosis for memory care placement as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o1e6yq/what_to_expect_when_moving_lo/,What to expect when moving LO

," probably the reason there aren't so much is because we don't expect children and adolescents to be caregivers, especially to parents with dementia. after all, a person diagnosed with dementia needs a caregiver with medical power of attorney, which i don't believe a minor can hold. you absolutely should not be stuck with the majority of the care or any of the decision making. there should be an adult your parent has named to hold power of attorney - medical and financial. even if there is, it's not a minor child's job to do more than a few chores in support of their household. the emotional stress of caregiving can break a healthy adult; it's nothing a minor should have to deal with.if you are in that situation - if your parent has early onset alzheimers or another form of dementia, and there's no one with power of attorney or you've found yourself having to do daily living tasks (cooking, bill paying, dressing, setting up medications, taking to appointments, etc) - you need help. it's just that you have to be the one to reach out for help. if you're still in school, get ahold of your school's counseling office. or call 211, which is a public service number that will set you up with health and human services. get ahold of whomever your parent has designated as executor of their estate or your guardian in case of their death. they should have at least a passing familiarity with your parent's personal assets and be able to help with details, possibly even take over for you. if your parent never set that up, see if you can find out their emergency contact - the person the hospital would call if they were brought there by ambulance. that's usually a best friend or family member.children are amazingly loyal, willing to take an enormous amount of damage to protect the one they love. that's why the adults need to step in. you're still growing. stress at this time of your life can do huge damage to your maturing body and mind. you deserve a chance to grow up as healthy as possible. it's bad enough to lose your parent. it's worse to lose them when you're still a child. it's even worse to lose them to dementia. losing your parent to dementia while you're a child and you have to take care of them is hell on earth. don't do that to yourself. your parent wouldn't want you to.and remember, this is a loving, supportive community, and we are here for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o185jd/i_wish_there_were_resources_for_children_and/,i wish there were resources for children and adolescents who are caretakers to their parent with early onset.

"i'm fairly new to reddit and this is my first post ever. i tried to search this topic but came up empty, so hopefully this isn't something that has been frequently discussed.my beautiful momma has been in a memory care facility for about six weeks now. when she first went in she was wearing regular underwear during the day and disposable underwear (generic depends of some sort) at night. the facility ultimately decided that it would be less confusing for her if she just wore the disposables day and night, and thus they had my dad bring all of her underwear home. the problem is, she hates how the disposable underwear feels. she's not very verbal anymore, but she has let us know that they are scratchy and uncomfortable. my dad visits her daily, and part of his routine is to check and see if she is wearing them. more often than not he finds her commando under her pants and then he has to get her to put them on. my parents are well-off from a financial standpoint, but they got there by scrimping and saving and being very frugal with their money. bargain shopping has been the name of their game my entire life. i share this because i am certain that my dad has found the least expensive ones that he can find, because ""she needs two a day and that can add up"". my mom's incontinence issues developed when she was well into her dementia and thus she never had an opportunity to try different brands and/or formulate an opinion as to what she found comfortable.i'm hoping some of you might have been down this same road. are there brands that are better/worse than other brands? anything you won't buy? is any brand on your ""must buy"" list? any information you could share would be appreciated.", a big thank you to all who posted. i have searched out many companies and have a ton of samples coming my way. i had no idea that was even an option. hopefully we can find something that is more comfortable for mom. i know my dad will be on board for spending more money on them once he can see and feel that they are not all created equal. grateful for you all - thanks again!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nzy626/looking_for_disposable_underwear_advice/,Looking for disposable underwear advice
"my father never cared much for me and basically abandoned me the second i turned 18. he’d only ever really provided the legal minimum for me, and otherwise just ignored me or yelled at me to leave him alone. over the years i’ve done my best to never ask him for anything because he specifically told me not to, but there have been a couple of emergency occasions where i had no other choice, and he always made it very clear what a terrible burden it was for him to have to help me at all. i once got angry at his attitude toward me and pointed out that i’d never asked to be born, and his response was “well i tried to tell your mom to get an abortion.” i never wanted to completely cut him out of my life because i didn’t have anyone else to even resentfully be there for me if something bad were to happen. i’ve tried to maintain a mostly shallow and tepid relationship i suppose. but at the end of the day he’s my father. he’s the only father i ever had, and i can’t help but care about him i guess because i’m just a sensitive and empathetic person. he’s typically been cordial with me as an adult so long as i was never asking for anything. now he’s in his 70’s and has dementia. i didn’t even know about his diagnosis until several years had passed and he had already begun to show obvious symptoms and it couldn’t be hidden from me anymore. recently it came to light that his spouse who was supposed to be taking care of him has been failing entirely to do anything that she was supposed to be doing. he’s been out driving severely drunk and has gotten multiple duis, and has been falling and hurting himself and has bruises all over. he even got some cuts so bad he had to be taken to get stitched up. my sister has recently had no choice but to take him in at her house, and he’s in the process of getting a divorce. i’d love some advice from anyone out there who can relate to the complicated grief of having a shitty parent suffer with this condition. dementia is terrible and heartbreaking to think about even for people i don’t know. my heart has always broken for others who have had to go through this. but when the afflicted person was not great to you, there’s this extra layer of awful in the form of conflicted feelings and resentments. for days now i’ve been anxious and depressed, randomly crying and then simultaneously getting so mad that i’m having to feel so worried and upset for someone who never loved me. i know that he’s only going to keep getting worse and i just don’t understand how on earth i’m supposed to get through this. when my mom died it was sudden. i didn’t have to watch her decline and suffer. i didn’t have to worry she was going to go out and kill someone with her car. i didn’t have to worry that she couldn’t even get up out of bed in the morning without falling over and busting her head open. i didn’t have to watch her forget everything. i didn’t have to anticipate the grief of having to put her away in a home somewhere and wait for her to forget who anybody even is.", my heart absolutely understands you. i am actually having a moment about it all about my dad (he had lewy body)tonight. my toxic response would be to disconnect but that’s not the way. it’s gonna be ugly. the ugliest moments of your life. but the best way is to find the best moments you can and become better and a fucking badass. i send you all my love and light sweets🤍🦋✨,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nzwhas/how_to_deal_with_your_heart_breaking_for_a_parent/,How to deal with your heart breaking for a parent with dementia who never loved you?

"i posted about two weeks ago. so, after living alone with dementia for 5+ years, currently with 4-5 hours of aides per day, aps now determined it was necessary to take mymom forcibly for an evaluation which ended in a determination that mymom required 24/7 care. when i came to visit two weeks ago i had the first floor of the house cleaned up - the cleaner mentioned how much mouse poop there was on the 20 year old spices in the kitchen… my sister was angry that i didn’t tell her i was getting the house cleaned and now blames me for aps intervening because all of the old rotten shoes under her coffee table were thrown out and a deck of cards that my sister claims kept her busy organizing (the shoes were nowhere near organized). my mom doesn’t know what day or year it is, gets lost 5 houses from the home she’s lived in for 40 years, hasn’t showered in years, can’t hear, no longer knows how to use a phone and my sister thinks she was fine at home? i understand she fears mymom going into a home and being abused or drugged into a vegetative state but the set up she had was totally unsafe. now mysister took the responsibility of 24/7 care. she also has 4 kids and a full time job. but she has mental problems and is passive aggressive and just wants to guilt trip me. i’m sorry, but i’mnot about to take on care of mymom, i’ll help find her a memory care or even try a live in but i’m not caring for her. my sister hates me for it but i’m quite sure she’s mostlymotivated by the potential inheritance. i’d rather have my moms assets go to her care…"," i’m sorry to hear you’re going through all this op. something similar is happening with my grandma as well. first, my grandma has some serious mental issues and unresolved trauma that she needs to work through. because of this, she has been playing the victim role and claiming she’s always a burden. obviously her needing constant care is stressful but she’s family and i wouldn’t ever call her a burden. as of now, my mom and aunt have been switching back and forth taking care of her.yesterday my aunt and grandma come over and tell us that my grandma wants to move into an assisted living. which i though was a great idea until it was specified it isn’t a memory care facility. my grandma never eats and cannot make her own decisions anymore. my aunt refuses, even after bitching to us about how much baby sitting and constant attention is required, to believe how bad she is. my aunt is fine leaving my grandma at home alone. she locks herself in bathrooms snd can’t understand how things function when she gets confused. when i saw her yesterday and asked how she was she smiled blankly at me because of stress. let your sister be angry and take the reins. my mom and our family have no control over what our aunt does or says. at the end of the day, we all want the best for my grandma but family dynamics typically get in the way of that. i’m happy to hear she’s finally in a place that can provide the care she needs; even if it didn’t happen in the nicest of ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nzbk25/aps_intervened_and_took_my_mom_for_eval_and_they/,APS intervened and took my mom for eval and they finally said she needs 24/7 care
"is there any suggestions for when you start seeing more cognitive confusion, i guess other than checking again with their doctor.  grandma (89) has just seemed to be more confused than normal lately.she doesn't recognize the tv remote, her telephone, and her lift chair remote as being different, and will complain that she can't change the tv while holding something different.she didn't seem to know what she wanted for utensils trying to get a fork tonight.  and when putting up dishes, she didn't seem to understand that when i said the dishwasher is clean that she couldn't put her dirty dishes in it.  she kept trying but in the small kitchen i was in the way, actively trying to put things up.  particularly, she doesn't piece clues together, like when i prepared food and said i was going to the table, she asked if we are having dinner.  i have to talk exactly through what we are doing a lot more.  she also gets real behind and will ask after we've finished something when are we going to do it, or do we need to do it.  i've gotten a little worn down trying to stay ahead, sneak doing some things when she is not up to constantly question and second-guess things.  she was real insistent at supper to get cinnamon because she can't seem to eat rice without it, but then didn't know where spices were so was just shuffling around the kitchen.  it was the packet flavored rice, but once she had her cinnamon, she kept asking me if i was going to have it, and took several times explaining (eventually just lying to say i didn't like cinnamon).she has a physical pretty soon, so we might check again.  though i think she does well enough on the tests, so we'll have to see.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nzavaf/dirty_dishes/,Dirty dishes
"my mom is 81 with moderate but getting worse dementia. she lives with her husband who is of sound mind but not good physical health. mom is reliant on him for her medication, etc but her hygiene and social interactions are severely lacking. i’ve talked to her husband about getting help once or twice a week but he said he doesn’t want strangers coming in the house. mom has episodes of wanting to leave the house and get away from her husband. it seems to be a pattern and happens when he gets frustrated and raises his voice, or when they don’t get out of the house for an extended period. she used to read and do puzzles to occupy her time, but she can’t do those things anymore and i think she gets confused and antsy and doesn’t know what to do with herself. when these episodes happen, her husband calls me in a rage/ panic to talk to her and get her to calm down. i live an hour away. it’s just me because my only brother lives out of state and doesn’t get involved at all. i just lost my dad in december to alzheimer’s and can’t even properly grieve because of the ongoing stress of this situation with my mom. i’m alone and need to work so i can’t just drop everything to take care of her. i take them to all their doctor appointments and go once a week to visit or get them out of the house. they seem to rely on me to do anything, even though my moms husband still drives. i know how difficult and frustrating this is for him and i know he needs help. he doesn’t seem receptive to getting help, yet my mom deserves to have her makeup applied and her hygiene addressed at the very least and he’s oblivious. i also don’t want to insult him because he does do the best he can with all the cooking etc now. i’m sure he’s depressed to an extent. are there part time retirement homes? i’m wondering if mom might benefit from the social aspects and get the personal care she needs. would this warrant hospice if i can talk him into it? i know a change needs to happen but i feel helpless and hopeless. i am beyond stressed and feel so alone. my mom deserves dignity. please help."," force the issue. he likely loves his wive more than he dislikes having ""strangers"" in the home to help her. gotta push over that bar, its actually pretty low. maybe point out that they're no longer strangers after the first day and they're vetted by the agency. have the agency come help sell him on their involvement and people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nzaoif/need_advice_when_to_seek_care/,"Need Advice, When To Seek Care"

"i don't even know where to start at this point, or what i'm asking for by posting here. i've lurked many times throughout the years, just to know that other people are in this struggle, too, but the isolation of being a full-time caregiver is overwhelming. my father is bipolar, and admittedly it took a while for us to realize there was more going on with him. in 2018 there was just a sharp turn, and we finally realized that it wasn't just his bipolar disorder. it took a full year to get him an official diagnosis, as he is a veteran and anyone in the us that has had to deal with veteran affairs knows how difficult it can be to get appropriate and timely care. i've applied for the family caregivers program twice, and only in march of this year did anyone get back to me about setting an interview appointment. surprise of surprises, i've had to leave several messages for the family caregivers department to set this ""interview"", and no one has gotten back to me. it's the middle of june. three months and i can't even get an interview to prove that my dad needs 24 hour care, despite the fact that he is on medication to help slow the progression of dementia and has had all sorts of tests and scans done. never mind about even being told this program exists - took two years for anyone at the va to even mention it to us. not even his doctor recommended getting a slums test or anything like that done when i made contact about his deteriorating condition. it was just information i had to find on my own, and then i had to call and set these appointments with various departments on my own, and continually follow-up as almost no one ever gets back to you. it's just so hard all the time. i'm already my father's medical poa (had to submit that twice, too!), and my mom is fiduciary. legally i think everything is taken care of, but that doesn't ease much of anything. because of my father's bipolar disorder, back when he was still able to take care of himself, he racked up an insane amount of debt in both his and my mother's name. credit card bills and private loans are still where the bulk of his va benefits go to, which leaves us with very little. for clarification, i live at home with my parents, as does my older brother. my mom must continue to work full time despite being almost 70, just because there's not nearly enough money to support all of us on my dad's benefits. sometimes it feels like i have no future to even begin planning for, because i have no money and no ability to go out and get an actual job unless i leave here entirely because my dad truly needs 24 hour care.when i say my dad needs 24 hour care, i mean there is no respite from it.  i can't go out on the weekends, i can't even get a part time job. even doing something online feels impossible, because no matter what hour it is, my dad will come to get me just to sit and be with him. and i don't blame him for that; he's always been very extroverted, and with (sadly) most of his friends having already passed, there's not much to be done for company. i've suggested before that he might like to go somewhere for a few hours a day just to talk to new people and make friends (adult day care), but he just laughed and said, ""fuck no!"" that's humor, though, he wasn't angry. the weird thing is that as his dementia has progressed, it feels like his bipolar has evened out. tempered a bit, in some way. his mood swings aren't nearly as big, and they don't last nearly as long. instead of weeks or months of him being too depressed to get out of bed, it's a few days where he sleeps a bit extra. when he's manic it's more like being in a really good mood, wanting to socialize and talk. it hurts to see him more like his old self, because i know it won't last. sometimes he asks about the dementia. a few days ago he woke me up, ""so is this shit gonna kill me, or what?"" and i just told him no. i just straight up lied to him, because what else could i do? a lot of my job seems to just be lying to my dad so that he doesn't get upset. it's heartbreaking, all the time. i'm sorry that this is just a big ramble of a post. it feels like i'm just constantly scattered, because i'm always on edge about what new bullshit the va is going to run us through, or whether or not my dad will die in his sleep because i wasn't right there with him. hyper-vigilance, i guess. it's been three years and i have promised my mom one more, and then i have to get out of here. i suffered from pretty severe agoraphobia for a number of years, but just as i was ready to try and start having a ""normal"" life again, my dad's condition got worse and there was nothing i could do about it. there's still nothing i can do about it.i take the best care of him that i possibly can, and it's clear that he favors me over my mom and my brother. i think i'm just nicer to him, more attentive, because i've been able to let go of a lot of resentment i had from my childhood. when i was younger i really hated my dad, because his bipolar was completely uncontrolled (of course, i had no idea it was a mental illness, i thought he was just an asshole) and he was abusing benzodiazepines that the va let him stay on for 17 years. seventeen years! we're just now weaning him off, only after his doctor surprised us by not renewing his prescription and i had to scramble to get another doctor in a different department to come up with an appropriate plan and convince his pcp to prescribe enough to actually be able to follow through. imagine going cold-turkey after 17 years on a drug that's meant to be used for a few months at a time. it could have killed him if i hadn't started frantically making calls to figure out what the fuck was going on and get an actual plan in place before his prescription ran out. it doesn't help that my brother has his own issues with substance abuse, and while he does the best he can and he's an adequate caregiver, it's just an added stress for me knowing i can't 100% rely on him during the night. i wake myself up just to make sure everything's alright; sometimes it is, and sometimes my dad is sitting alone while my brother is crashed out on the couch. i feel lucky that i've really drilled it into my dad that if he needs anything to just come and get me in my room, and he generally does. the drawback of this, however, is that my dad will walk right past my brother or my mom to come and get me if they are distracted and he needs something. there have been occasions where my dad needed help but was unable to physically get up to get me and just had to wait for my brother to wake up. nothing serious, an incontinence incident sometimes, or he's just hungry or lonely. i sleep light as a feather most nights. is it hyper-vigilance if there's actually something to be vigilant about?there's so much more that i want to say, but i don't know that there's a point to it. you can only vent so much before it stops helping, you know? again, i have a plan in place for my life (with the bonus of extreme guilt at feeling like i'm abandoning my family), but i don't know that i'll actually be able to follow through with it. a lot depends on whether or not we can hire caregivers, as putting my dad in a va-run nursing home sounds like a terrible idea just based on how the va handles literally anything, and we definitely don't have the money to place him somewhere privately. anyway ! i'm scared of the future! i don't know what's going to happen and none of us can ! and it's horrible ! thank you for reading this, and again i'm sorry it's kind of all over the place."," no apology needed. my dad was 92 when he died of dementia last april. we eventually decided on a state veteran's home. the facilities here in tx have units devoted to memory care patients, there's one in every state now evidently. funding is a mix of va, state, and private. meaning you avoid the medicaid penalties that come with a typical va facility - like where assets would be treated as gifting, pension is considered disposable income, and you can't apply for low-income exemption. contact the state veteran's homes in your state.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nz53kl/my_veteran_father_has_dementia_and_i_am_so/,"My veteran father has dementia, and I am so overwhelmed all the time [vent?]"
"i'm feeling really guilty because i yelled at my father on the phone today, really loud. to preface, i'm not aware that my father has dementia and have not considered it before this. he's in his 80s and my mom sometimes complains that he has a bad memory or that she's frustrated with him, but i really don't know what going on. what confuses matters is that he is an immigrant and english is his second language while english is my first language. i normally speak to him in like 80% our native language and 20% english. today i was on the phone with both my mom and dad and i said in english, ""the garage door is broken."" my mom understood me perfectly. however, my dad did not. this lead to a lot of confusion and conversation because my dad said he thought i said ""the glass door is broken"" and kept trying to work out which door was broken. so probably i said 10-20 more times, ""the garage door is broken"" and variations of that, answering questions about which door i was talking about, just going round in circles. my mom is at the same time berating my dad on why he wouldn't understand what i said. finally it seemed like he got it and we were discussing how the garage door was broken (it would go down and pop right back up). but then after about a minute, he went back to not knowing which door exactly was broken and asking me again which door was broken. suddenly, i just lost my mind. i mean, i lost it. i started screaming in the phone: the garage door is broken! how many more times do you want me to say that? i""ve said it at least 20 times!  i was standing in the open garage and the entire neighborhood heard me and i feel so ashamed i yelled at my father that way. but i just did not get why this really basic information exchange could be so impossible and i have a lot of pent up feelings about not being able to communicate with my parents over the years because they just start screaming at me or just don't get it.  i felt it must be somehow on purpose that he could not understand which door was the garage door. though now that i consider it, why would he do that on purpose? after my horrible yelling, my dad got really quiet and said that since he wasn't there, he really couldn't help me figure out how to fix the door. then we ended the conversation and since then i've been wracked with guilt. my question is, is losing your ability to understand very basic words in a second language a sign of dementia? my dad has lived here over 50 years and worked his entire professional career speaking and writing in english. he reads english language newspapers and magazines every day.  but his english pronunciation and listening comprehension has always been pretty awful. it seems to have gotten to a new level of bad though. a few weeks ago my young niece was saying ""my favorite food is watermelon!"" then she would ask my dad, ""what's my favorite food?"" he \*could not\* answer her. she did it like 5 times. when he retired 15 years ago, he proudly proclaimed that he was retiring from english too. which i was like, whatever. everyone deserves to take a break. but recently it has really gotten so bad and i've found myself really annoyed. i felt like he was doing it all on purpose. but after the incident today, i'm wondering if this is an early sign of dementia? if so, what to do about it? do doctors even do anything about dementia? i'm sorry, i'm totally ignorant about the subject."," you may also consider getting his hearing tested. personally i believe that people should start wearing hearing aids as soon as it becomes tricky to hear clearly enough to understand. it's gotta become a habit early.my grandmother has dementia and for a long time she simply refused ti wear hearing aids (often still does) insisting she doesn't need them. i believe that lack of hearing (and denial thereof) contributes to/accelerates the anti-socialization that comes with dementia.it becomes a cycle where you say casually in rather natural speech, they don't hear you (either not correctly, or they just don't acknowledge you at all). repeat yourself several times, and each time you get more frustrated and clippy. you stop bothering to try telling the entire story. by the time they heard you, you are shouting and then it's ""ok ok no need to shout! god!"" so basically any typical social interaction has become antagonistic and defensive as the default, by the beginning of the actual ""understanding the conversation"" part. people give up on including them meaningfully in nuanced or detailed conversations or telling them interesting stories. people stop being polite to them (in their eyes... by the time they actually understand you); and they in return. then no one wants to spend time when them and the cycle continues",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nyrcax/could_forgetting_basic_english_as_a_second/,Could forgetting basic English (as a second language) be dementia?

"terminal lucidity is an unexpected return of memory and mind, a brief moment of mental clarity that happens promptly before death, it can last for minutes, hours or days, it has been estimated that only 10% of dementia patients will experience this last moment of consciousness, it is still unknown the reason for it to happen. and my theory is that it happens as a last effort of the brain to save the body from dying, a part of the hippocampus is still healty, causing long-therm memories to come back and the brain uses it's last energies to clear out synapses and tangles, returning to what it was before, but since the body is weak and can't do much, sadly it doesn't lasts for long, and only strong people who were healty and exercised their body and mind constantly will experience it."," it is said that on moment of death, you get flooded by dmt, which acts similar to magic mushrooms (psilocin/psilocybin are analogs of dmt). there is no proof of this.anyway, interesting is that dmt improves brains oxygen intake.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nxwj49/my_theory_about_terminal_lucidity/,My theory about Terminal Lucidity

"first a disclaimer: i'm not a physician and have no intent of breeding false hope for anyone. this is by no means medical advice, just something to explore if dementia/alzheimers are having an impact on your loved ones and family. with that said, i lost my mother to 'alzheimer's' after several years of 'dementia.' near the end, a friend i hadn't seen in some time asked a couple simple questions and suggested i find a specialist who understood nph ([ and might have the ability to properly read an mri related to nph. if identified sooner, she would have had several more productive years in all probability, although there are no guarantees in all this. but once the fluids pressure causes the brain to shrink, it stays that way. note: it is natural and we will all have a build-up of the fluid if we live long enough, so far as i understand it. the doctor we found asked my sister and i to consult with him out of the room and was literally in tears. you see, there is no long-term money in the relatively simple shunt procedure for nph but it presents as dem and alz and it seems when you are a hammer, the world is a nail. so my mom, who had never touched a drug/med and drank less in her life than i do in a month was on aricept and something else, the side effects of which only exacerbated things. if we had known and caught it a couple years earlier, her golden years might have been very different. i don't blame the excellent dr.s at banner alzheimer's or her other primary care physicians as they simply don't know (i hope it's that and not something more nefarious) what to look for or how to read the shadow in the mri. but for anyone whose family/friend might be slightly dragging a leg when walking or have mild confusion, i'd highly, highly recommend exploring nph to rule it out through an nph specialist along with seeking the normal avenues of care normally associated with old age, dementia and alzheimer's. take care and bless all of you caregivers/family members."," sorry to hear about your mom. we are currently having my dad tested. last week they did three days of a brain scan. something like a “cisternagram”? they had to do a spinal tap for it and i think they drained some spinal fluid in doing so. strangely his symptoms got way better through the week. we are hypothesizing that maybe the released some of the fluid pressure. however, it’s already getting bad again. we meet with the neurologist wed to go over the results. nph was his first guess and what he tested for first. my min is really hoping it is and thinks it can all be fixed. however, he’s 80 with a lot of other health issues so even if it is, i’m really not sure how much they can actually do for him. we’ll see.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nxof5p/please_look_into_this_if_a_friendfamily_member/,Please look into this if a friend/family member might have dementia

"my father (66m) and i (27f) had to move away from where we lived before because it was too expensive, both in overall cost of living and for the upkeep of the home we were in. we moved to the geographic region he requested, but because it’s impossible to find a 10 acre apple orchard within walking distance of town, he hates it. it’s been 6 months and he still has hardly adjusted. he is upset about me managing his finances (i’ve had financial poa since 2018 but started actively using it august of last year) and setting boundaries like he can’t access the part of the house we live in, and if he’s being rude, i will not entertain the conversation and walk away whenever possible. i know arguing won’t get anywhere and if i try to deflect it’s impossible so walking away truly seems like the kindest thing i can do. he’s not far along enough to need to be watched 24/7. after selling the previous house, he has the financial means to hire caretakers. it took three private caretakers/agencies not working out before we found one that has. now this agency is saying his mental health issues and associated behaviors are outside the scope of what they normally work with and are becoming too much to handle. they acknowledge that i make sure all his basic needs are met, he has food, cigarettes, a large yard to garden in, caretakers coming to socialize with him, keep himself/his space tidy, and take him on outings. yet he still wants to constantly “play the victim” and use any example of any (perceived or real) mistakes i’ve made as evidence that he should sue me. for example, last winter he insisted on trying to use a heavy metal plow to “shovel” a part of the yard that didn’t need to be shoveled. he refused to give the plow back to me so i had to physically pull it away from him. he is trying to claim that this was assault. there’s a few other examples like this he always comes back to and repeats over and over again. it’s getting to the point where the care agency says if he continues to lash out at the caretaker repeatedly (or flirt with them, which he also likes to do) that the caretaker has the right to leave and be paid for a full day. i don’t blame them, but i’m wondering if i should switch to a different agency with more direct experience with patients with co-occurring mental health conditions. yesterday after one of his usual ramblings the agency’s head person called me upset; i said “yes, i’m aware of this, he has dementia” and she said “no, this is psychosis”… she thinks that because he “remembers” all these details about ways he feels wronged (which sometimes are completely fabricated stories) that he doesn’t have dementia. three neuroscientists that tested him over several months last year would beg to differ. sadly his health care has been stuck in limbo, due to moving, confusion about what he qualifies for, him not being willing to receive care in the past, medicare not thinking he’s a us citizen when he is.. it’s a whole mess. today the head caretaker lady is going to come over and help me sort that out, so hopefully we can get him on medication that mellows him out soon. maybe they can re test and confirm independently that he does indeed have dementia and i’m hoping they can confirm if other mental health conditions are also affecting him. he goes through spurts of having lots of energy and periods of needing a lot of rest and emotional ups and downs and has always been this way so bipolar honestly seems the most likely. i’ve had to call the police three times in six months since we’ve moved here, twice because of my dad. the second time they were not helpful at all and basically told me he’d be better off if i left him alone and stopped caring for him. they referred me to an aps social worker who keeps telling me to pursue courses of action that don’t make any sense. i wish there was an elder crisis service for situations like this that actually had the knowledge and resources to help, and not shame the caretaker and take the dementia persons word at face value. i’d appreciate honest feedback if there’s anything different i should be doing. it seems like a lot of dementia patients just need a need met to be satisfied, but almost every day my dad makes a long list of things he wants and gets mad if i don’t get every single thing on that list. even on the days i get most of the things or give him something he really wants it doesn’t make a difference in his mood. lately i’m trying to be super nice every time i see him and even have invited him to do fun things with me/my friends but he responds by yelling at me. i envisioned us going hiking together, doing arts and crafts, all sorts of fun things we couldn’t do when we didn’t have the money/time… but it turns out all he cares about is money and freedom, neither of which can i give to him.", i read the first two paragraphs. maybe look into twsting him for bvftd. just my opinion. if he does have ftd there’s a ftd association to help with caretakers and people living with it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nxmsht/is_it_possible_my_father_doesnt_actually_have/,Is it possible my father doesn’t actually have dementia?

"i have read where many of us in this group experience caregiver guilt. i have a question to caregivers who have gone through all the ups and downs of parenting.i am childless by choice and i recall parents telling me about the guilt they felt returning to work after having a baby and/or dropping off their kid(s) at daycare. guilt about not doing enough as a parent.in your experience of caregiving for a loved one with dementia, is this a similar guilt that you may have had as a parent? or is it worse? from my perspective it seems like it would be worse because my mom (84) won’t get better; she will regress rather than progress. there are so many times my mom dumps all her negativity on me. she is not angry or abusive in her communications, just complains about how she hates living in assisted living, hates that she has three meals a day and can’t eat sugar and junk food all day, hates this, hates that. every day seems to have its own major or minor problem she is dissatisfied with, including lack of padding under the carpet in her apartment. i get it, she is at the stage where she knows she has dementia and needs help, but her negativity can really be a grind.it feels like there is zero joy in this form of caregiving compared to a parent which is compensated with first smiles, giggles, first steps, first words, etc.", i love the perspective of sparking joy for her. thank you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nw9ebw/are_the_feelings_of_guilt_similar/,[deleted by user]
"hey everyone, this post is about my dad he’s currently 68 years old and this week has been a rollercoaster. my dad has always been normal and has never had any issues as far as memory loss but as of lately he’s been forgetting things. now he hasn’t been  diagnosed yet but i’m taking him to a doctor  asap. i’m 25 years old and i lost my mother to cancer already and i can’t fathom the idea of my dad not recognizing me anymore! this week he has gotten into two car accidents(fender benders)  in the same day(my dad lives in ny with his wife and i  live in nj) and that was very odd and then another issue is that he’s forgetting where my aunt lives and he owns two homes in ny and nj. another issue that i noticed is that he’s splurging on things and forgetting that spent bought them; my dad has already spent over 12k and paid 6k for the accidents that he caused. i’m just very scared of the idea of my dad not being well, i lost one parent already and i can’t imagine losing my dad to this!!! please i’m just looking for answers. is there a way to prevent dementia from getting worse?! how do i cope with this!"," my dad has dementia- he's 60, and late stages. he was always so stubborn so he wouldn't let us help him, but i've read articles that support the findings that an active lifestyle, mentally and physically, can help improve the lifespan of patients with familial frontotemporal dementia- frontotemporal is a rarer form of dementia (and worth noting, not always familial) but it's also more commonly seen in younger patients. article on the findings here: [i'd say go about getting him diagnosed asap, if a doctor says it's depression insist on further tests as some earlier forms of dementia are frequently misdiagnosed (my dad was misdiagnosed at first, and it's common especially for anyone with ftd). the sooner you know the better because you can spend time with your dad as your dad, while he's still fully there. we never really got that chance, unfortunately.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nw90gr/guys_im_literally_freaking_out_and_dont_know_what/,Guys I’m literally freaking out and don’t know what to do!
"my father-in-law lives on his own and has an aide that comes twice a week, my wife goes twice a week, his girlfriend one day, and his mom one day. so it’s a team effort. anyway, when someone is not with him, he gets busy calling companies that send him mail. he hired three separate landscapers, switched his landline number three times, calls to pay his credit cards that are on auto draft. he was a big deal, marketing guy at work when he had a stroke so now he is retired suddenly at 61. anyone would be anxious looking for things to do. he has a hard time doing the things he likes, playing drums, listening to music, using facebook. he wants to be “productive”, i just don’t know what kind of tasks we can give him that will take up his time and he can actually accomplish. i guess everyone is effected differently by this disease but any input is helpful."," verizon has a program where you can set up to 20 contacts and you can restrict all calls during certain times of day (24 hours in your case) where no one but those 20 contacts can call him and he can't call anyone but those 20 contacts too.  i haven't tried it myself but in theory that might help.  i tried a similar program by tmobile and theirs is faulty as it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  hopefully verizon would be better.  there's also kids watches and i think senior phones that do the same thing.my dad is just like your dad except i think worse.  he has zero interests at all.he seems willing to do all sorts of chores.  wash clothes, sweep, (i don't let him mop the floor cause slippery), wipe kitchen counters. organize things, make the bed.  he also seems willing to exercise too.none of this he would do while we were away unless he's told to by amazon alexa so i have alexa tell him what to do and repeatedly since he has the attention span of a toddler.  alexa also turns on the tv and plays a youtube exercise vid for him which he does every time.  he doesn't always do the chores but it's enough to keep him from texting and calling me a million times (only 10 which is a vast improvement).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nw7arg/fatherinlaw_needs_some_tasks/,Father-in-law needs some tasks

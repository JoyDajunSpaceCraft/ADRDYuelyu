anyone dealing with this and wish there was a sub on reddit for it?," i often wrote on dementia forum asking for support and realized that others are also dealing with their own hardship caring for their demented loved ones so the best i can get are words of encouragement from internet stranger and maybe links to helpful educational sites about the disease.my mil has bvftd and ruined my family. in my experience as caregiver for 8 months, the best support in this current healthcare system is antipsychotics with complete removal of the individual with bvftd as last resort.if you look at my post history, bvftd is complicated where on one side, you know they are capable of unbelievable amount violence and cruelty because of high levels of disinhibition that is the hallmark characteristic of this disease. on the other side because they are family, you want to still believe that they still retain some form of consciousness and humanity when in truth, the disease has erode it away. in final days before my mil was taken by aps, my husband finally agreed to administer antipsychotics. even with the high dose, mil still able to give me a black eye because she did not like that my husband looked at me when he spoke. her adrenaline rush overpower the effect of sedative and antipsychotics medications. it’s very hard to swallow the reality that she is indeed no longer human in the mind and a true danger.my mil is essentially now permanently housed in prison for the criminally insane after she sexually assaulted my oldest son, gouged eye of meter maid, and slammed home nurse head on our countertop that causes stroke and permanent brain damage.granted, not everyone with bvftd will be as violent and disinhibited as my mil, but the best support often found in tangible, preventative measures and actions such as social work support, mental health support, public health safety net for affordable care which we all know are nowhere near where it should be and worth advocating for had we not been driven almost to the edge of madness by loved ones with this disease.it is nice to have subreddit with others who are on similar situation to talk about it but the fact is: it’s still a nightmare every seconds when you have to care for loved ones who could at any given second assault you. the words of encouragement i got from talking about it still does not remedy the pain my mil causes my family and my body.what i would like is a dementia subreddit that educate us on how to advocate change in the system for each other to better health care system to support those with this disease and their caregiver. there are so much red tapes within the public health care system that’s time consuming and confusing policies. i’d like to see a subreddit that does a tldr on how to wade through the system for stressed out caregivers with lack of time and financial resources.as caregiver i was taught to deal with it myself when it’s very clear that it takes a village to care for the demented. my children are in intensive mental health therapy and both my husband and i are also seeing mental health specialists. we are the fortunate ones who could afford to seek help. this should not be the case at all had we all unite even with our limited time and resources to advocate for better public health care system.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i0cgqs/support_for_caregivers_of_people_with_ftd/,Support for caregivers of people with FTD?

"first time poster.i have been working at a bowling alley for over 7 years. we have different leagues that come in every day for most of the year, so i get to know these people very well. all leagues have been cancelled due to covid.one particular gentleman in his late 70s bowls in a large men's league with his son on mondays. over the last couple of years he would come in on the wrong day looking to bowl with his league. i have spoken to the other men in the league but no one seems to know him personally. his son does not live with him and comes off to me as mentally handicapped/slow. he comes in today maskless (we have signs posted all of the doors) asking about the league and claiming that no one told him it was cancelled. i'm really concerned because i don't know if he lives with anyone, and i do know that he drives here. i feel as if he's putting himself and others at risk.is there a way to anonymously tip a service? i have the customer's full name. i also have his son's name and address/phone number from locker rental information. i don't want to call the son due to past conversations about this where he would just dismiss it. i do not have a close relationship with this customer. i don't even think he recognizes me, so i dom't want to ask him personal questions about his home life.", depends on where you are. can you look up adult protective services? that would be a good place to start.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i0b3q4/regular_customer_possibly_has_dementia/,Regular Customer Possibly Has Dementia?

[deleted]," i'm sorry that your family is dealing with this & that it's causing such issues for everyone. first things first, if mom is struggling with grandma right now, this is a progressive disease & the loved one suffering with dementia can decline rapidly in some cases, so if at all possible, as soon as possible, it would be a great idea to sit down & have a conversation with mom about how she can get some more secured support. there are day programs (obviously covid-19 may have impacted those in your area) that provide respite for the caregiver & stimulation for your loved one. at-home nursing care is also an option to examine. can i ask what prompted the departure from memory care? i'm wondering if the specific place was not a good fit or if there were other factors that might impact what suggestions people might have for you. bottom line, grandma is going to need increasing support, & mom is going to need a strong support system if she is to weather the caregiver aspect, in part or in full.however, that does not mean that you need to give up your life to fill in the gaps. not everyone is cut out for this role & it's ok to know that this is not your forte. the lines will be blurred so long as you live in that home because it really does take a village to navigate this condition. if grandma is screaming through the night & defecating on the carpet, mom needs to be speaking with her pcp. i don't know if melatonin is something grandma is already taking, but it is often a front line choice to help regulate sleep - which is vital for everyone involved as lack thereof can worsen the cognitive decline & make it so much harder to provide the quality of care needed. a toileting routine & possibly some disposable underwear might help some with the bathroom issues, but there are going to be a myriad of these obstacles to problem solve & mom & you need to have a real talk about what you can & can't assist with as well as who can assist mom going forward. the kindest thing you can do is to figure out how you can help (ie// i can watch grandma on tuesday evenings so that you can go visit with your friend & i can commit to every second saturday, i'll do the laundry, help with the biweekly shower - whatever is both reasonable & something you can commit to) & then help mom to find additional support to help alleviate some of the burden that's left. parse it that you're looking at moving out in october & you want to make sure that by then, the other supports are in place so that the bottom, doesn't fall out when you leave because mom suddenly has to figure out how to do everything herself. you have an important job, one which (for obvious reasons) is heaped with additional stress at the moment & in order to be able to provide for your future & security, & to do justice to the role for the kids under your care, you need to be able to fulfill your duties. it sounds like mom is overwhelmed too. we don't think as straight as we might otherwise when we're making decisions from a primarily emotional place (and the decision to care for a loved one at home vs in-patient care is often fraught with guilt).  was the decision to move grandma home a planned one or was this a quick decision? have either of you contacted your local chapter of the alzheimer's society or your local office for the aged? they have great resources & will be familiar with local opportunities for assistance & support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hwsvdt/am_i_being_selfish/,Am I being selfish?

"hi. thanks for taking the time to read (and maybe respond) to this. 5 days ago i moved my mother, 80, into dementia care. she has alzheimers and had been living alone. she was kind of managing, with me doing everything, plus a cleaner to deal with all the food she'd leave rotting in the sink etc, but had no short term memory (eg we'd order food somewhere and 30 seconds later would try and order again) and very confused long term memory (couldn't remember her brother had died, or where i had grown up, for example). she was right on the precipice of getting lost; couldn't remember her address and would frequently ask how to get home from the one local restaurant she would go to—50m from her flat. she  often gets confused about whether she was awake or dreaming etc.so, based on that and advice from doctor and family (my aunt is a retired aged care nurse) moved her into a home. she thinks it temporary while work is done on her apartment. she is very unhappy and i can understand why. it's a really nice home in a modern building with a garden, hair dressers, cafe and quite a lot of residents; certainly not cheap. but despite her memory issues and confusion, she is still quite alert and in much better shape than most of the residents; lots of people in wheelchairs nodding off etc. of course, she thinks she is totally fine and looks around at all the ""old people"" who ""have dementia… or worse!"" and is very disturbed. she's refuses to try and talk to anyone and just hides out in her room.basically she is caught in the grey area between not being able to safely operate in the world, but not being so out of it that she just takes it all in her stride. with covid re-spiking in sydney (by 'spiking', i mean 12 cases yesterday), the homes have all gone back in to lock down so only window visits and no taking her out.my great fear is that i have put her in too early. the home and her friends say no. i'm struggling with a lot of guilt, grief and anxiety about what i've done. does anyone have any experience they could share about this issue—ie a parent being put in care who can't seem to find other residents at 'their level' and how to maybe make her life easier for her?thanks!", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hvjl8g/help_moving_mother_to_dementia_care/,Help!

my grandma has pretty severe dementia and incontinence has started to get progressively worse. she's starting to pee everywhere at night. she has a diaper but sometimes she takes it off and just pees. i am not exactly sure how to move forward as me and my mother are her caretakers at night. i was thinking of starting to get myself to sleep in shifts. so i'll wake up about 2/3am and wake her to go pee and use the bathroom. would waking her from a deep sleep be bad for her? she falls back to sleep relatively easy. any other solutions you can offer would be great.," is she getting out of bed to do it or taking her depends off then going? my grandma used to do this (though she didn't wet the bed, just took the depends off). i'd suggest getting a mat or one of those ""lifters"" they use in the hospitals to lift and move patients who cannot do for themselves along with the pads they use in hospitals to lessen messing up sheets and the mattress. if she's getting up, can you get an alarm attached to the bed to notify you when she gets up? then you can take her to the bathroom then. limiting fluids is a great way along with checking for a uti if this is new behavior.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hv6p3t/grandma_having_trouble_with_peeing_everywhere_in/,Grandma having Trouble with peeing everywhere in the middle of the night

"hey guys. i'm staying with my mom while my dad is in the hospital. i don't know how long he's gonna be in there but the doctors said anywhere from 3-7 days. when my dad is with my mom, she's totally fine, lucid, can do normal things, but you can tell there's something going on with her memory and if you ask her to recall things, you can tell she doesn't know how or remembers unless it's something from when we were kids or a long time ago.no one can have any visitors so her behaviors are that she'll fixate on my dad and when he can get out, why he's in there, why no one told her, but then we'll remind her and she remembers. though, there are times when she gets upset and she'll start crying just focusing on my dad being in the hospital and she thinks no one is telling her anything. sometimes things will upset her and we have to spent like 30-40 minutes just repeating the same shit to calm her down. for example, my dad called to complain last night before bed and mentioned something the doctor didn't do that upset him therefore it upset her, and so she was doing fine all day and then right before bed he upset her so it took forever to calm her down.i was wondering if you all had any links or resources on how to deal with the behavior and/or things to help calm her down, ways of talking to her, etc? my gf and i are taking care of her and i feel like what we're doing is good for the moment and calms her down, but i quickly realized that this is way harder than i thought it was going to be. we've been doing things that have helped like draw out calendars counting off days until he gets home or have learned when to tell her info and not tell her anything upsetting at all."," i’d suggest two channels on youtube. 1) teepa snow and 2) careblazers. both have been excellent with suggestions on dealing with difficult behaviors as well as explaining the possible reasons for said behaviors. the most used tool we use with my mil is “compassionate white lies”. we get constant questions about dead relatives as well as requests to “go home” (her moms house where she grew up).  at first we fought tooth and nail giving the facts to her showing her pictures, dates, etc. nothing worked it would end in huge fights, her getting really depressed, and we’d be completely frustrated. once we started the new technique the dynamic changed. also, we post notes around the house reminding/reassuring her of answers we give. you’ll hear/read advice to “live in their world” as their reality is different from ours. if you can deal with them on that level it helps alot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/huujh5/resources_for_dealing_with_those_who_have_memory/,Resources for dealing with those who have memory loss/dementia?
"my mil moved in with us in march. i've been doing my best to keep my sanity as the daytime default caregiver since i currently work from home. her behaviors have been more annoyances (narcissistic repetition) and inconveniences (putting opened coffee creamer in the freezer that then ends up in a lake on the kitchen floor). i've always told myself ""well, at least it's not poop."" whelp... it's poop. she is obsessed with her bowel movements because her dad died young of colon cancer. she can't explain fully explain why she is catching her poop with a toilet-paper-covered-hand (which gets everywhere). she mumbles something about screening for colon cancer. she is distraught about the situation as well. you can see the shame in her eyes, and she has cried over it because she knows she is too confused to meet her own needs. when we brought her into our home, my partner and i agreed that we can handle her needs until poop is involved. there is no way she can get in a home any time soon, so we need some tactics to get us through this. we are trying to be as kind about the situation as possible, but seeing poop in someone's hand is hard to stay calm about. i'm very grateful that my partner handles all grooming and bathroom stuff. i'm more cooking, ""mom""sitting type stuff. but, inevitably this will happen when i'm the only one home and i. just. can't.so here is my question, has anyone had any luck in changing bathroom behaviors? or does she just need to be monitored from here on out. like, maybe it's time for a professional caregiver for as many hours a day as we can afford?", has anyone had any luck with daily laxatives so at least you can control when the poop adventure happens?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hur9af/its_all_fun_and_games_untilpoop/,It's all fun and games until...poop

"does anyone remember a tv talk or news show in the mid-90s that featured an interview with a woman with early-onset alzheimer's disease and her family? i'm interested in this because i saw this program a few months before my own mom was diagnosed and looking into the eyes of the woman on tv was like looking into my mom's eyes. i'd love to be able to find it and watch it again.  this has been driving me crazy because i can't seem to track it down. in my memory, the format was more like a professional interview (think 20/20 or abc special report) than one of the popular talk shows (sally jesse raphael). but i really don't know",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/htjinn/help_me_find_a_19941995_tv_newstalk_show_about/,help me find a 1994/1995 TV news/talk show about early-onset Alzheimer's
"good afternoon all,&amp;#x200b;i'm hoping to find out about any items i can use on my grandma's damaged finger. she picks at it constantly and i fear it will soon have to be amputated. over the past few months, i've purchased pretty much everything under the sun to keep the finger safe (finger cots, gloves, paper tape, splints). she just ends up taking it off after 10-15 minutes. she has mild dementia so she doesn't understand what she's doing is making the finger worse. the mornings are bad since she's picking at it most of the night and it ends up bloodied by the morning. we (myself and my mother who both care for her) have tried taping the hand with a glove to no avail. is there anything out there that we can put on that will stay on? basically something that needs to be cut off to be removed. i don't want it to be too tight of course, but something that will fasten or lock. a finger cot that can do that would be great, but i've been searching to no avail."," i have no experience with these, but perhaps something like these would work?[especially the ones that tie up. if she has them on both hands they seem to be quite difficult to take off.or maybe something like tissue adhesive to cover it?

what is vascular dementia and what lies ahead? how bad is it going to get? what medication can be used to treat insomnia and nighttime restlessness? what medication will help in daily life? at what point would you make the decision to move a loved one to a dementia ward? sorry for 20 questions. thanks for your time guys.  hope it's okay i posted anonymously.," hello, we are nursing students who were displaced from clinical due to the covid-19 crisis.   we have been approved by the board of registered nursing to talk about health-related issues with the web community.  i found the following information very interesting and thought you might want to take a look at it.  the journal explains how dementia is expected to grow over the next fifty years.  vascular dementia is related to damage in the blood vessels of the brain and dead brain cells because of these problems; there will be a slow movement and metabolism in mind, and with time, the brain shrinks, causing cognitive loss.  the damage occurs because there are small infarcts and white matter damage in the brain.  the recommendations to avoid damage to the brain are the following: control over high blood pressure, elevated insulin levels, and cholesterol as well as following a dash diet and exercise.   the journal mentions the importance of retaining our brain functioning accurately over the years by staying busy in a job and doing utilizing our cognitive abilities to slow down the decline of dementia (liebman, 2016).	it is essential to be sensitive to those who have dementia because the communication and the level of understanding might be different than that of a normal person.  for instance, avoid long sentences, short to the point sentences are easier to understand.  it is better to avoid questions the person with dementia cannot answer, use touch to show care unless the person with the dementia is uncomfortable with it.  pay attention to the sense that dominates in the dementia person, for example, smell, vision, etc. and communicate using that sense more often.  promote safety by doing the following: it is recommendable to carry identification all the time, adapt the surroundings by providing enough light and free of obstructions so that somebody can walk freely and avoid accidents, check with a primary care provider to obtain the right treatment (lynda juall carpenito).  i am not a medical doctor.  please follow the advice of your primary care physician.  i can answer questions, but my knowledge does not replace what your primary care physician has stated.  please take care and let me know if you have any questions.liebman, b.

"one day i was in ikea looking for a good sofa to jerk off on. i hopped on each sofa and took my dick out and started to stroke it. i had my favorite porn playing in the background(not revealing what it was because it's kinda weird). i went up and down my cock until i was ready to blow my load. i managed to stop before the floodgates broke loose. the store wasn't very busy this day so i didn’t get kicked out. after my session, i went to the restaurant inside ikea and had some famous swedish meatballs. the meatballs were subpar and gave me a slightly upset stomach. i didn’t think much of it, and i went back to shopping. i sat on the couch beat my meat and got off. this routine went on for a while because had high requirements for my couch. it had to be under 5000 dollars and the seat had to be comfortable for my bottom. it couldn’t be too prickly or too cold. after hours of wanking, i finally settled on a couch. the sofa was perfect. the seat was made out of smooth and thick fabric. i decided that i should reward myself and let it all out. it turns out that a lot of teasing can weaken a man’s penis and allow for a quick and far cumshot. i got cum all over the floor and the table that was sitting in front of the sofa. at this point, i had mixed emotions. i did not know if i should be proud f such a large cumshot or if i should be ashamed for making such a mess. the store was nearly abandoned, but one old couple walked by as i pulled my pants up. they saw the mess that i had made but did not assume that the white liquid was cum. the couple called management over to clean the mess because the couple wanted to buy the sofa as well. a couple workers came over to clean it up and asked what had spilled. i beat around the bush until the workers noticed that there were no cups or trash cans present near the sofa. then one of the employees had a disgusted look on their face. the employees excused themselves to the corner of one aisle and had a discussion. the came back and asked, “sir is this your cum”. i was young and scared so i responded yes. then the employee ran out and got the entire staff into the store. they got gloves and a mask and cleaned it all up. then the manager came and checked the security camera footage. there i was with my phone on a porn website and beating my meat hard. the manager looked deeper into the camera footage and found that i had sat on all the couches butt-naked and jerked off. to make matters worse, one of the couches i had fapped on had a small turd on it that came from my meatballs earlier. the manager said that i had to pay for all the damn couches and that i was banned from all ikeas. i was invited to his office to discuss plans to pay off the couches. the bill was over 200k dollars since i sat on many couches and had to pay numerous fines. i did not have that kind of money available so, the manager made me pay 50k up front and took some land i owned to get the rest of my money. on the bright side, i get to keep all the couches that i sat on. my house is not that big and cannot hold that many couches so i had to get rid of them all.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hr83rp/ikea_management_not_caring_enough/,Ikea management not caring enough

"my dad’s dementia has progressed to the point where he doesn’t recognize his wife (my stepmom) and cannot dress himself. afaik, he is still able to handle other activities (eating, toileting, etc.), and he doesn’t wander.i’m looking at senior living facilities they might move into. any guidance on whether he would need to be in “memory care” or whether “assisted living” might be sufficient for now?

my 75 yr old brother was diagnosed with alzheimers last year. he has an unsteady walk but has mostly been able to carry on conversations as usual and is still driving. we’re both in lockdown in different locations so it’s hard to get a true impression but he’s telephoned me every day for the last week with exactly the same conversation. i’m always happy to hear from him and attempt to steer the chat away from his ‘fixed grooves’ but without too much luck. this is definitely a new development. please can someone let me know if in their experience this repetition is a likely to stay the same or get worse rather than hopefully just being symptoms a rough week? it seems to me to be a significant slide although he can still reply to most of my questions before returning to safer ground.thanks.," the only way to really know is to have him evaluated regularly. does he have someone he lives with who can provide you information on a regular basis? perhaps a friend or neighbor you are in contact with? there will be good days and bad days as alzheimer's is a spectrum disease and he will likely vary from day to day and week to week, while getting progressively declining.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/inz69d/75_year_old_brother_repeating_himself/,75 year old brother repeating himself.
"okay so i'm going to try and get to the point. she's been ""difficult"" as a younger woman and girl from what i've learned. not sure if there's a condition that worsens and develops into dementia at some point? but it's gotten worse over time. especially since she's alone now (grandfather passed in 2016 at 86). i did everything i could considering i live a couple of hours away now. i'd come to town and just fight through the negativity to help. every little thing she notices out of place makes her think someone is coming in the house just to mess with her. honestly there's a rat issue that still hasn't completely resolved, and they might be the culprit. she had been saying for almost a year or longer someone is coming in, even accused me and another family member. i insisted she got cameras inside the house to monitor anything unusual. i have access to her security system, and found her to do some strange things when she alerted me of someone coming in. like, she made coffee, poured it into a bowl, and just .. idk what she did with it? she insisted someone came in to cook food, another time someone left dishes she didn't recognize, left dirty rags, moved some things, put clothes on the floor, etc. the list goes on. security company finds nothing unusual, but she just gets angry and accuses people of trying to ""make her like she's crazy"". i always tell her she can call the company if she wants to review footage of a particular time, see if they see anything. she never wants to anymore because they will tell her nothing happened. she started covering the cameras so no one could look at her when she didn't want them to. of course i never checked footage unless she insisted something happened.sometimes i feel uncomfortable taking any action because when police came after getting an emergency call, they suggested calling adult services and i quickly learned how terrible it can be dealing with them. they came in a vehicle with a flashing yellow light on top and made her feel totally uncomfortable. she fears someone wants to ""take control"" of her. this isn't a lie actually, because 3/4 of her kids excluding my mom and one grandkid took advantage of her financially. long lasting family business basically went to shit over time and died bc of mismanaging funds and taking out loans under grandparents noses. i never did nor do i now want to take advantage, and i don't want her in a nursing home. i also understand she needs help, but a special kind of help abs support that won't stress her. my mom and aunt will not bother to call her or return calls (aunt lives next door in house grandparents financed and rented to her about 30 years ago). they are her only surviving kids (one uncle died in 2015 and the other earlier this year), and the other 4 grandchildren don't bother checking on her at all. it's just me trying and it's stressful (23) feeling as if i can't do shit. i haven't been able to emotionally take all of the things she's been saying (she can get quite verbal and personal unfortunately) without having to end the convo and i feel bad because i know she can't help it. but as i've seen, continuing the conversations have lead to health issues with other family members who have now passed (uncles, grandpa). there was a time i actually felt myself getting deeply stressed and unhealthy trying to save a failing business/deal with the fact that part of it failing had to do with her being irrational majority of the time (being rude/personal with customers and employees etc.) and had to step away and find my inner peace again. the business was dead by the time i tried to fix it all, and was financially drained. it started to work fine for a couple of months but ultimately the plug was pulled.she hasn't even been diagnosed with it and i know she won't get tested willingly. she's given me durable poa over properties, business, etc. (excluding health) about a year ago or less, but revoked it after a mischievous family member got involved (they disappeared when they found out grandma had nothing to give). she's mentioned that her doctor suggested having someone look after her, but of course she was enraged at the thought. so yeah.. probably hasn't gotten tested. my ideal circumstance is to have someone look after her at home where she's comfy, and not doped up on meds. also, she's in bankruptcy and having a difficult time understanding things but wants no poa activated out of fear she'll be put away (even though i never had health poa). she will end up losing everything and my fear of her dying from stress will still be a threat if i don't get involved.im sorry if it seems like i'm all over the place, i can barely think straight! i just want her at home, and to know the property etc. she wants to keep are safe so that she's happy. how do i get this ideal scenario for her? i know she'd still be furious about someone aiding her at home but it can't be as stressful as a nursing home. how do i ensure my poa is active again? this is hard.", call your local area agency on aging (if you are in the us) to get free unbiased info about your options.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/inx0j2/grandma_85_thinks_people_are_in_her_house_when/,Grandma (85) thinks people are in her house when she's gone (I made sure she has cams in and outside)
"my mom is the primary care giver for my dad. he has become really violent lately. he will be yellling at us (sometimes towards noody), throwing stuff at us, hitting us, and alwys using foul language. we feel very unsafe in our own home currently. he also has been trying to get out the house lately so we have put latches on the outside of our door to prevent that. our doctor put him on some new medications but nothing seems to be working. we are looking to put him in a memory care facility but they do not accept his medicare insurance and we do not have enough to pay for it, what should we do?"," i'm going to let you know what we've done for our dad after his dementia got worse because of the pandemic. hopefully something in here will help you guys out, but i know my dad may have resources not everyone has.before the pandemic, my dad was having some sleepless nights and sundowning, but was otherwise doing pretty well, all things considered. after covid hit, he became anxious, easily angered, and beginning to get violently. he was wandering almost every night and had even managed to escape into the backyard twice.we put a deadlock on all the doors that would give him access out of the house. it's not at all ideal - we try to keep keys everywhere in case of emergencies - but it was more likely my dad would wander outside and get lost than it was likely we'd need to run quickly. we only lock them at night or on days where his symptoms are really bad. we already had alarms on the doors - now they serve as back up in case someone forgets to lock the door at night. we talked to his neurologist about what to do about him not sleeping at night. it took a lot of tweaking medications, giving it about two weeks, seeing how he does, and tweaking more if needed. at the end, it did not cure his sleepless nights, but it did calm him down and make him less anxious. the neurologist also put him on an antidepressant medication (which is not meant to be used long term - more hoping to help us get through the pandemic isolation) and tweaked another medication he was on for anxiety.as for homes, most memory care facilities won't take someone who is violent. you may want to search for a home that will work with your dad. as for funding it, if you haven't done so already, you might actually want to talk to your local memory care facilities to see if they can steer you in the right direction when it comes to funding. when i was doing research, one of the facilities asked if my dad owned his home, and was satisfied when i told them he did. i didn't inquire further since i know my dad has funds in the family trust to help with those expenses, but it might be worth it to talk the care facilities about help paying for those things.also, the neurologist set us up with a social worker who has been able to give us some suggestions for his care. maybe they will be able to help you guys out for how to help your dad.i'm sorry i can't be of more help. i know how helpless you must feel right now, but i hope you can find the help you need.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/inu08h/dads_behavior_need_advice/,"dad's behavior, need advice"

"hello all, before i begin, i just wanted to say that this is a great sub, and i've learned so much just from lurking. thanks to all of you for the great advice and stories.background: my husband's grandmother (82) has moderate yes worsening dementia and broke her back in a fall a few months ago. she was in a rehab nursing facility for about a month. my father in law moved in to care for her full time, and i stay with her between 8-12 hours a day to give him a break and have time to do what he needs to do during the day. she spends most of her time in one particular chair in the living room. but can get around with a walker. she's on oxygen 24/7 so we have to make sure she isn't getting tangled up, but for the most part, getting to the bathroom hasn't been an issue.problem:  she uses depend, and needs help getting changed and doing bathroom things. as of yesterday, she will no longer let me help her at all. gets angry when i suggest we go. and only wants her son to help after i leave the house entirely. previously she was fine with my help, but now apparently believes she is at the nursing home and i am ""the mean nurse"" and won't let me do anything for her save bring her warm blankets and food/drink. even then, i'm threatened and scowled at (which is actually pretty funny tbh, but i really don't want to upset her). i'm the only one available to watch her during the day, but i can't let her sit in a wet diaper all day long! i can't physically force her, so does anyone have any advice on how to get her to comply? i've tried everything i can think of to appease her, but nothing works. she's stubborn and combative at times and on a boatload of meds, including antipsychotics so short of changing the dose, that's already a path explored. we have pt and ot's come to the house to try and work with her but she refuses as of late. she was a nurse back in her day and believes the healthcare people don't know what they are doing and are too young to have the experience they need to do the job. i don't know what to do. 🙁"," might she react differently to you if you changed your appearance when around her, making it look like you were someone else?  a bright, sequined ball cap, a neon sweatshirt, fake glasses- anything that you don't normally wear might be enough that you look different enough to accepted again might help.  i've seen it happen where my mother lives- all it took for one woman was a red sequined ball cap and she suddenly was beaming at the person she normally scowled at.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/imgtlw/seeking_advice_on_mistaken_identity_issue_causing/,Seeking advice on mistaken identity issue causing problems.
"ok, so, i didn't really knew how to talk about that, and especially where to talk about that. a good friend suggested me this subreddit, and maybe people here will be able to tell me if something is wrong (what i believe).the problem is going on for years and is literally driving me crazy. the rest of my family (not a lot) is only taking notice of this until recently, but i really never told them anything before, because i was afraid they would just take it personally and/or see it as disrespect towards my grandfather. i can't remember when it started, but i know he wasn't always like that. he has always been light minded (for example he would forget his cellphone everywhere, lost his keys, etc) but it seemed just like a personality trait, sure a bit annoying, but not problematic.he would always tell me stories of the past repeatedly though, again and again and again, using the same words order and the same phrases, the same rhetoric effects (if i may say so), etc. it was a bit odd and annoying, but well, whatever? it's just an old man drivelling.i would often search online about drivel, and way to cope with it, but to most people it was just something nice old men would do and something they could share during family time. but it's not really my case. what i should say to be understood, is that i have frequent contacts with my grandparents. when i was home (or when i'm spending time home), i can see them up to 5-6 time per week, i also have them on the phone every day, so it's just not family dinners' drivelling that i'll describe next. it is every day life.since maybe 2-3 years, my grandfather started to repeat things that were not memories, but rather recent things crossing his mind, and also, to speak in a weird manner in a way that just saying something like: ""the weather is hot today, i didn't liked it"" could take up to 4-5 minutes of him repeating it with different formulations and insisting on details, etc.to give some examples:— every time i would tell him i go to the gym, he'd ask me how far from my place it is... he would literally ask me this question multiple times a week. recently, my gym has closed (because of the coronavirus crisis, they just could keep up) and when i told him that, he just said to me that they should go fuck themselves (i'm not exaggerating, he literally said that) and would keep asking me during few weeks if i returned to the gym (and told me a second time only that they should go fuck themselves, the rest of the time he would just say that they were liars and just closed because they wanted to steal their customers' money).— he's literally obsessed by (some times imaginary) problems occurring with his computer, and for example, these last 2 months, he has been asking to me 3/4 times per week why a certain software cannot be uninstalled, he ask it to me using the same words and the same voice intonation, i tell him i don't know, but he keep asking again and again.— he has spent the entire months of july and august telling me every single day the same things when i would call him: that he can't stand how hot the weather is and that he can't stand the flies.— recently he had seen an old tv series called ""space: 1999"" during his evenings, he would watch 1 or 2 episodes. so, every day, when i'd call him, he'd ask if i ever saw it, he would tell me he was about to watch it and that it was good, and didn't remembered the title so he was something saying random and approximative things. now that he's over with it, he's watching something else from an old dvd we bought when i was a kid. so he told me for 3-4 days straight that he was watching it and that we never opened it since then, and ask me if i remember.— talking about film, he's watching a lot of film, and also reading science fiction books. he has a lot of books, but every time he's talking to me about the same 4-5 sagas and telling me to read them and explain to me the plot every time (with the same words and same descriptions again, it's important to insist on that). another thing that he do a lot: he say to me that he watched a movie the day before. and when he say that, i automatically know that he will say one of these two things right after: 1. it was shit, it was a science fiction movie with americans killing aliens and winning, it's always the same, i stoped it before the end. 2. it was a good movie, i don't remember the title, i won't tell you what it was about to avoid spoiling you, but you should watch it it was good.— as i said, when he's talking about a simple thing, it can takes minutes to just tell it. he's using odd formulations and repetitive sentences. for example, he tell something, then tell the exact same thing 2 or 3 times more by just changing the phrases/words order a little, or says things like ""it's annoying, it annoys me"" or things like that.there are a lot of other things i could talk about, but i think you got the idea. he's on a loop and i don't know what is the problem. he refuse to see a physician, now that the rest of the family took notice of it and want to do something.&amp;#x200b;what are you thoughts?"," waa, so sorry, that sounds really distressing - sad and tough.  for sure it sounds like something is going on - without doctors, it's impossible to know what exactly.  everybody gets old, at different ages - some people in 60's could have dementia, other people in 90's could have no dementia... many oldies have varying memory loss & sort of repetitive loops, or get particular favourite ""bee in their bonnet""  that they are preoccupied or obsessed about... idk... so sorry for you, it's sad & upsetting.  at least now your family are more aware of it, hopefully somebody can convince him to go doctors... many oldies, particularlly men, can start to refuse to go doctor, it's very annoying & silly but...  best of luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/imfurq/something_is_wrong_with_my_grandfather/,Something is wrong with my grandfather...

"a little backstory: my dad was diagnosed with white matter disease and early onset dementia maybe a year or so ago. with that diagnosis, we found it hard to regulate his blood sugar (also diabetic) and get him to quit smoking because he would constantly forget he had quit. for several months he was complaining of stomach pain but would not go to the doctor until it was so severe he was rushed to the er and immediately into life saving surgery. he has now been in the hospital for a month and a half. prior to being admitted, in february, they found out their boston terrier had cancer and not long to live. she made it 6 months longer but passed away 2 weeks after my dad went to the hospital. he keeps talking about how he can't wait to get home to see her and we have been pacifying him but now they're talking about sending him home (yay!!) but we have no idea how to tell him his precious baby isn't there. we tried reminding him she ""is"" sick, but the nurse said he cried for hours after remembering. how do we tell him that she's not going to be there when he comes home?", is getting a replacement pet an option? it won’t help his feeling of loss but it might be a good distraction.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ihreso/how_do_you_tell_a_dementia_patient_that_their_pet/,How do you tell a dementia patient that their pet died while they were in the hospital?

"my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease. he is living in an assisted living facility for residents that need memory care. he also suffers from depression. the facility contracts out evaluating each patients needs for medications, and the adjusting of medications to an external provider. those recommendations are then reviewed and modified if needed by the primary care doctor, which i think is affiliated with, but might not be employed by the facility.today, i found out my dad has been acting out and they want to prescribe him depakote. they hadn't been telling me about his misbehavior, actually they misled me into believing he was improving in how he was functioning at the facility - not getting better cognitively, but getting along with the residents and staff. they were probably trying to spare me; but beyond being his son, i'm his conservator and if i'm given the wrong information i can't effectively oversee his care.regarding depakote, i did some research and it is not approved for use in dementia patients. abbott labs paid a settlement of 1.6 billion dollars because ""abbott created and trained a sales force specifically to target nursing directors, geriatric doctors and other long-term care providers and gave doctors illegal kickbacks to promote off-label use to boost depakote sales.""  abbott labs’ own research had shown that depakote was not effective in treating psychotics and abbott had closed a 1999 study on dementia due to “increased incident of adverse events including somnolence, dehydration and anorexia in elderly study participants.” source - [i told them i needed time today to review the proposed changes to his medications, which was when i found the information about depakote, but during that call i was told that was fine but if he acted out again he would be sent to a hospital. there have been no incidences of covid in the facility, but i can't imagine that sending dad to a hospital now would be great for his life expectancy even though in our area the case numbers are relatively low.i left messages to contact the aprn that suggested the changes to my dad's medications, but i couldn't reach them today. the facility called me at 2 pm, so that wasn't much time given i don't imagine they are waiting around the phone to take my call.it seems like my best bet is to try to convince them to choose an alternative medication for dad. they tried to redirect his behavior without adjustments, but from the discussion today the staff has not able to avoid verbal and sometimes physical conflict with him. i am upset that they didn't tell me about the issues before. but then what would i have done? i'd like to think i might have found an independent qualified medical professional to advise me and determine what to do, even if it means moving him to a place better equipped to handle his needs. easier to type that execute. still, i feel very forced into trying to find a solution before he is forced into a hospital where his chances of contracting covid are significant.is there a way to bring this up that isn't going to negatively affect my dad's care? should i be looking for another facility? there is no amount of care that is going to fix his dementia. i'm not an expert in this at all, i have to trust them to keep me informed and to act for his health and well-being. i want to trust them, i need to be able to trust them, but what happens when i don't trust them?thoghts?"," i personally would try to find a different place. the staff aren’t working well with him, management aren’t communicating, and the doctor isn’t doing what’s right. if at all possible. otherwise i don’t know, can he see a different doctor while at the facility?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ihgblv/depakote_for_alzheimers_disease_behavioral/,Depakote for Alzheimer's disease behavioral disturbances

"in his life he's always been  able to maintain his independence, however the last year and a half things have changed for him.  he went from someone who only needed a little help from me to someone who needs me to take over shopping, taking care of his vehicle(finally got him to turn in his keys 5 months back), and also make sure his doctors appointments are scheduled and get him there on time.i noticed last year that when he needs help with something or wants something, its kind of like dealing with a small child. the way he asks, and how he asks don't feel like him . its become kind of regular now and recently his communication has taken some hits (as has his short term memory) and i also found a new pattern in his behavior thats odd.when he wants something, he loses sight of everything but the want itself.  like he told me his printer needed ink because 1 ink cartridge was running low. there are 4 cartilages total but he was specific about the one that was low so i went down and got him the ink a day or so later. no big deal, its not fun but its no big deal. so i gave him his ink when he asked ""when we were going to go get ink"" and he was happy but then said ""what about the other ones, did you get the other ones?"" i pointed out that he didn't say he needed  the set, he just said he was out of the 1 type of ink and thats what he needed to get. it didn't seem to register with him that he didn't tell me he needed all 4 cartridges the only thing that mattered was the ink. :/ i ended up making a second trip to get him his ink at another store(got the last one too) but i've been catching him asking me if i got him something that he didn't ask me to get him at the grocery store a few times. it makes me wonder if he thought he told me to pick up something that he didn't actually ask me for. i've actually been looking at setting up a notepad to go over stuff with him and enter it in the notepad and have him sign every entry that i write down. that way theres a small record of him acknowledging a conversation about health, or groceries, or car maintenance etc in case his short term gets worse.i've been taking care of him for a while, but ever since my grandmother died almost 4 years back there seems to be decline every few months or so in some way or form. i live with him so i see a lot of stuff i have to report back to my folks as well as aunts and uncles.while i've been suspicious that h might have some kind of dementia, i wasn't really certain of it until about 6 months back when his short term memory started to get worse and the child like behavior started to creep in when he needed me to help him with computer stuff.  he has a younger brother who is in an advanced stage of either dementia or alzheimers and isn't lucid very often and i'm not sure if thats the direction my grandfathers going to head too. his body has gotten weaker and he developed scoliosis  years back and i'm kind of expecting his body to give out before his mind does. stubbornness is a strong family trait and its kept him going a long time, hell he survived a 3 stage carcinoma growth on his colon that required surgery to remove at 93 and didn't have any long term effects(first 6 months after the surgery were a little shaky but thats all) but i'm kind of at the realization while hes still my grandfather, hes not the grandfather i grew up with or even helped take care of 5 years back.not sure how much worse things will get from here with him, but i'm hoping he can still be him for a little longer before more decline hits. i'd rather he passed away at home than at an elder care clinic. it'd mean a lot to him to be able to not have to end up there, regardless of what state his mind is in."," ""i'm kind of at the realization while hes still my grandfather, hes not the grandfather i grew up with or even helped take care of 5 years back."" that's the hardest part for me. my grandmother was pretty easy to take care of. she was easy going and she'd sit happily in front of the tv with a snack (preferably a sweet one) or in her bed and just call us to be nosy. we became her caretakers and it was so hard to see the grandmother that took me to the park, gave me baths and said i'd always be her big baby leave me but she was there in other ways. i would take him to his doctor and mention it. there are some things that can be done to test for it. i imagine at 96 he's not as mobile as he used to be which could work in your favor. you just want to make it easy on him and be prepared for the ups and downs of this disease. your grandfather is a hell of a fighter. i suggest reading through this sub, talking with his doctors for a care plan and possibly setting up home care so you can get a break and you can develop a good routine before it's absolutely needed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ihcea0/bleh_well_my_96_year_old_grandfather_i_take_care/,Bleh.

"my grandfather had only gotten into a care home less than a week ago. yesterday we got word from the nurse there that his breathing had changed and he may not make the rest of the month. he continued to decline and it became clear it could be during the night. he was still alive in the morning. my mom, brother and sister drove the hour to go see him. he held on for long enough to see him and then he slipped away. i'm so heartbroken that he is gone, and heartbroken i couldn't see him one last time. but i'm so glad he no longer has to suffer through this. i'm drinking a rusty nail now in his memory. cheers to him, he had a long good life.", my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ideprg/grandfather_passed_this_morning/,Grandfather passed this morning
my grandma is 80+ and almost totally blind. today she forgot the way to the washroom that is right next to her bedroom. she got off the wrong side of the bed and almost walked into a wall. then she couldn't even remember where everything was in the bathroom and needed help with everything. she even forgot how the taps worked. the same thing has happened thrice over the last year. she hasn't forgotten anything else including the family members and their names. it is currently very difficult to get a doctor for her so i was hoping maybe you guys could help me a little," yes, my facebook page is: facebook.com/senior.helpers.of.west.jacksonville. my staff is presenting editing it so it should be good by tomorrow.  you can always go to teepa snow to view lots of information.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/iddnsm/does_my_grandmother_have_dementia/,Does my grandmother have dementia?
i want to vote for him but i am afraid of how that would affect his decision making," honestly, both biden and trump have strong signs of dementia. i would say trump is worse, but still-- it's like which sexual assaulter with dementia and shitty politics do you want to vote for? if that's the deciding factor, look at kamala harris's history and consider that as shitty as the dnc is at least they are not as shitty as the gop. as a doctor friend of mine who treats seniors regularly said, ""i treat people in their seventies all the time. i really don't want one to be president.""let's hope we get some upper age limits imposed eventually because this is frankly, quite ridiculous.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/iddh48/is_it_true_that_joe_biden_has_early_stage_dementia/,Is it true that Joe Biden has early stage dementia?

i have seen so many post lately locally and globally about silver alerts with dementia. what are home safety devices/prevention to help with this? my father has very mild early dementia and i want to do everything i can to keep him at home and safe early on.," my current arsenal is several wifi cameras setup watching the internal  doors and exterior with motion detection alerts.  these warn me when mum approaches the door and let me see which way she went.  i aim to intercept by this pointthen she's got a gps tracker on a lanyard if the main plan fails.cameras were my idea, the tracker is provided through local social services.  if you're worried, look into what help you have available where you are",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/idc76k/missing_persons_with_dementiaways_to_avoid/,Missing persons with dementia-ways to avoid?
"i don’t even know where to begin. i’m on the west coast, and my grandmother is in the midwest. to me, this disease is extremely sudden but i haven’t been around to see the true progression. i started sounding alarms about her around christmas when i was home and i realized she was telling me a story that made absolutely no sense. i watched her, in disbelief, trying to make sense of what she was saying to me. it felt swept under the rug. my grandmother (77)  lives with her sister (81) - i feel like her sister (my great aunt) has denied this for a long time. i have never been close to my grandmother. she was mean to me my entire life - genuinely just cold and rude and i never understood why. she loved my older brother so much more than me enough to where she would directly tell me that to my face. as a kid, if i defied her, she would hold me down and pour hot sauce into my mouth. i genuinely only have anything to do with my gma only because she has been living with my great aunt who i do love dearly despite our differences in religious views. i’m watching her slip away, viewing the complete cognitive downfall and it breaks my heart. we were never close, she made it obvious how she felt about me and here i am telling everyone to back off and not confuse her so much. (i believe they think correcting her will bring her memory back). she gets really confused and mad when people tell her she didn’t do something she believes she did. (like run 17 miles and then 25 miles). i told her she must have been so exhausted to have ran that far, and she said she was, and “thank you for believing me”. she went on to tell me she really loved how i made that message pop up for her on the tv - it made her happy. (i texted her “hi grandma! it’s [my name] - i love you!”) i told her it made my day to know it made her happy. she was so mean to me my entire childhood... and now i’m left trying to do everything i can to make her comfortable. researching nurses to help, doing anything i can. right now the challenge is getting her in front of a doctor as she has her sister as the poa and my mother as a secondary - and her sister seemingly is convinced we will take her away and put her in a home so we are struggling to get her in front of a dr. anyone else left in a similar situation? are you taking care of someone who treated you like garbage? are you far away? how can i help beyond a gps chip, larger clock, grocery delivery? to anyone even remotely dealing with this: i’m sorry. so many movies make light of it, and i’m seeing it first hand and the first thought i had was “this isn’t funny at all... it only just sucks.”", i don’t really have any advice...i just want to commend you on being a beautiful soul to forgive the past childhood trauma and still be so caring and worried about your grandmother. best of luck to you,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/id3n9f/how_can_i_help_my_grandma_77/,How can I help my grandma (77)?
"i  need some help, my wife, 56, is rapidly getting worse, she stopped bathing a couple  months ago but was till getting by except for that, now she was in a car accident and did not tell me, i found out from insurance, i am planning to take the keys away. she had to give a statement about that accident, i sat with her and wrote it out for her. printed it with a large font and double spaced and she could not read it. got like every third word.i know i need to get her evaluated but in california i need her to sign a release as far as i know for me to able to talk to her doctors, i will also eventually need a power of attorney, i am not sure what resources are available to me in san diego and where to turn for help with this, she is argumentative and combative when we discuss getting her tested.she is a life long diabetic so am afraid many episodes of low blood sugar could have brought this on at a young age, alzheimers does run in her family but at a much older age. she does have medicare and tricare.", could you get her to go the doctor under the guise that her diabetes could be affecting her brain function? her inability to read may indicate that she’s had a stroke.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/id2hm1/need_help_with_where_to_start/,Need help with where to start

"if this has already be answered, i apologize i am new. my dad is almost 70 and exhibits many of the signs for dementia. we no longer feel safe letting him drive, he cant say more than a few words without losing his thoughts, my mom leaves notes all over reminding him to lock doors and close the fridge and shut off the water, etc. a lot of what he says doesn't make sense. my mom is in deeeep denial for a few reasons - stubborn, afraid and  she's ""not a good caretaker"" and ""not good at sympathy""  and ""isn't patient"" (those are her own words). also, she saw her own mother suffer with dementia and it was very hard for her. anyway - i have been pretty firm with my mom about getting my dad some medical attention and getting him diagnosed (fwiw - we live in the u.s.  and my parents have some combination of medicare and obamacare that costs them like $700 a month on their very very limited income).  she took him to a pa (physicians assistant) a few years ago who gave him some ""survey"" and declared he was ""fine."" he is not fine. when i try to discuss all this with my mom, she gets very angry, short, and snappy with me. she all but won't discuss it - its clear she doesn't want to discuss it. i am concerned that we are wasting time getting him some treatment if there is any treatment to be had. i just don't know what authority i have. i want to step in but i don't want my mom to stop speaking to me over this. really torn over what to do."," take your dad to the doctor. you don't need her permission. does he drive? does she care at all about having any semblance of her husband around? if she's already leaving him notes it's likely progressed beyond the help of meds- and even then those just manage symptoms of personality change, they don't slow or stop memory loss at all. her denial isn't going to stop it from happening, my approach isn't the nicest but i would literally hound her until she did something. or- try to separate yourself from the situation and not worry which, for me, would be impossible. for what it's worth i tried to tell my mom dad was going downhill fast (they lived apart by about 2,000 miles for 5 years) and she didn't believe me. he ended up being taken advantage of by junkies, became a ward of the state, then i became his legal guardian. because of the lack of care he's stage 4 terminal lung cancer and advanced dementia at only 78. keep pushing.

"my mother has some kind of dementia. the whole dementia work-up (pet,eeg,mri, ct, neuro-psyche and yes even a brain biopsy) failed to reveal what kind. overall, if this were ad, i'd put it at early stage 4, to give you some idea. very bad working memory deficits since at least the age of 64. her memory is so bad she often struggles to remember what her last meal was, for example. she engages in typical dementia behaviors (paranoia, perserveration, uncharacteristic swearing, lying, tantrums, doesn't shower, has forgotten how to wash herself if we actually get her in the shower etc), but she still e-mails and texts. it's really weird. her emails and texts are often reflective of her state of mind (confused, paranoid, entitled), and mostly include links to expensive gifts she wants, but it just is shocking to me. she can e-mail and text and google her favorite music/shopping interests...but she could not, for example, boil rice or do a load of laundry if her life depended on it. anyone have any experience like this?"," hi, what do you mean by preservation? like hoarding?

"so i've worked with clients who are developmentally disabled and also have different mental illnesses. there were some personal factors going on in my life that interfered with it so i ultimately quit. fast forward some months and i'm thinking that perhaps i'd rather work with elderly people. i applied at a company and they called me for an interview on thursday. then this morning they call me back and actually offer to have me working with someone who needs 24/7 care. i'm told she has dementia, needs assistance with most everything, not too well physically. i think ""ok this will be challenging but i feel capable taking this on."" my mil worked in caregiving so i asked her opinion and she mentioned ""well people with dementia may get frustrated easily and be mean."" but i don't feel that anyone being mean to me, or even physically hostile is a deal breaker. (my problem with my previous clients were that they were young enough, with goals to achieve, yet they did not actually want to change themselves.) i've been trying to ground myself about the situation. this is someone who just needs care and is not setting out to achieve goals or do more in life. i feel well enough to be able to assist this person with their daily needs and be there. what can i expect from a situation such as this? i'd be working three 13 hour days, which isn't entirely new since i worked a couple 12s each week at the previous company. also i have an interview/likely offer at another job that i'm considering taking for the other 4 days of the week. it's not healthcare, just barista work which i love. it's very relaxing and much like a hobby to me. i am concerned about burnout but i feel that having something that i think is fun to do will keep me focused (rather than having 4 days off to potentially do nothing.)"," just remember that even the most attentive family member cannot (and is not expected) to do things perfectly or make the irritable patient happy.  your job is mainly to safeguard them and follow whatever plans are in place.  as the top post says, routine is supreme.  just being a somewhat familiar presence is so important.

"i'm a former med/surg/hospice nurse and i've taken care of my fair share of elderly patients suffering from dementia.i found that the patients whose social histories i knew the most about were often the ones i could communicate with the best. when a family shared information about their loved ones (occupation, favorite type of music, fav foods, hobbies, etc.), i was able to provide better, more personalized care.now, i'm exploring the idea of a sort of social health record that stores social information about loved ones. families can upload and edit the social record and add links to youtube songs, add family pictures, videos, and stories. and all of this would be available via a private, password protected link that the families can share with facilities and caregivers. the goal would be to create a mobile app that could be played on a tablet while at the bedside.i think this would help nurses and caregivers such as myself provide better care, but need more feedback from actual family and caregivers to move forward. could you look at the demo i've put together and let me know your thoughts? being a former nurse i know a lot of times we don't have the time in our day to look at another chart or electronic record, so i'm looking for feedback from people who have been there and are taking care of memory care patients. the last thing i want to do is create another electronic tool that just gets in the way of actual care...so the main question is: would something like this be useful in the care of memory impaired people? and what, if anything, could be improved?thanks so much for your time and i apologize in advance if this is the wrong forum for this! i just don't know where else to go aside from my local support groups and contacting my former co-workers.you can see the demo profile here: [demo profile]("," i'm an slp who works with many dementia patients in a snf/ltc facility. that is a wonderful demo! yes, social history is critical! having this information available helps redirect treatment positively, especially as we work on orientation, re-establishing previously loved tasks, recall of specific information.  through personal experience, i've noticed families who are more involved in goal planning, treatment, and carryover of strategies yield better outcomes in the early to middle stages of dementia. dealing with the end stages are a completely different battle. it would be nice if every patient/family established a memory book. i often will establish these with families (when they are present to assist with photos and are reliable narrators). these continuously need to be modified or created in mind to fit the person's cognitive skills. being able to navigate the app/webpage eventually becomes difficult for the person with dementia to use independently and ensuring each person/family has the finances to have their own device to use this. many people with dementia's vision changes so scanning smaller screens can be come difficult. i can see how this can be added to another burdensome electronic file the staff and caregivers have to maintain. realistically, we have to consider: the snf/ltc management, how well staffed the facility is, and the amount of paperwork staff is legally required to keep up (e.g., medications, falls report, etc). usually if they are seen for therapy, ot/pt/slp obtain the social information to guide treatment. in my facility, we share that information with nsg, activity coordinators, and the aides to better their care. another limitation is the caregivers' abilities to access and modify these types of charts/websites should they need to add information/manage it. i can see this becoming less of a barrier as the newer generation of caregivers are becoming more inept with technological advances. edit- typo",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/51fe46/family_of_loved_ones_with_dementia_could_this_help/,"Family of loved ones with dementia, could this help?"

back last january our uncle fell and was sent to a nursing home.  he was diagnosed with wernicke-korsakoff syndrome because he was being detoxed (always a heavy drinker).  since he was all alone living in a retirement community by himself my sister and i decided to get guardianship of him and transferred him to an assisted living place.  it is much nicer there and they have been giving rehab so he could walk again after he fell right before he went in.  when we visit him he has been confusing my sister with our mother and refers to the place as his class (he used to be a teacher before he retired).  also at night he seems to suffer from sundowners syndrome.  i am starting to believe he has straight up dementia and not was originally believed that he has.  when cleaning up his house we found notes all over the place reminding him to do things.  this might have been going on for a while prior to his accident.  does anyone have a ruff idea of what stage he might be in at this point and how many more years he might be around?  i am trying to learn more about the disease so i can deal with the issue better.  thanks.," to answer your question about what stage and how many more years... it varies from person to person and you would need to get a diagnosis to find out what stage of dementia he is in (regardless of cause). they have tests to measure where someone is in their capabilities.he could take a quick downward spiral, or be around for more than a decade: a lot depends on his physical health as well. it just depends on so many factors, and i'm not sure even the doctors would be able to hazard a guess.

"hi,my partner's mother has recently been diagnosed with early onset dementia, and i'm looking for some advice/opinions as i'm worried that their family isn't dealing with it in the best way, but don't want to be pushy with my advice to them.she was diagnosed a few months ago, in her late 50s, and from my point of view is progressing quite fast. not very severe yet; i would say the dementia might not be noticeable to people who meet her at first. but she is increasingly forgetting tasks she has just done for example, and worse every few weeks when i see her.my concern is that her husband is still working full time and often long hours, meanwhile she is at home alone all day most days, usually just watching tv.am i right in feeling this isn't right? she isn't happy and i feel needs to have someone around. it's not that she requires constant care yet, but she gets really panicky when she forgets things or loses things at home and i can't bear the thought of there being no one to calm her down when this happens. i know also that her considerable inactivity is not going to be helping either the progression of the dementia or her general happiness and mood.my instinct is that her husband should retire to be at home with her (he is approaching retirement age and can definitely afford to), but it's not really my place to push this.any thoughts/opinions appreciated.."," has she been formally diagnosed? her husband sounds as if he's either in denial or is just oblivious. a formal diagnosis, in this case, would be for your partner, first, so a plan can be formulated. it would also really help to know what type of dementia is at play. my mom (in her mid-80s) has vascular dementia, which isn't particularly pronounced, compared a friend's mom who had full on alzheimers. things you can do now, without any formal treatment, is to keep the mother socially engaged. that's not going to halt the progression, but can at least slow it. it's not going to help her at all if she's left alone to her own devices everyday with nothing other to do than watch tv. if her husband isn't willing or is unable to step up to the plate, hire a caregiver. isolation is probably the mom's greatest enemy in terms of the progression of dementia. get that formal diagnosis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4z2v4t/progression_of_early_onset_dementia_need_for_care/,Progression of early onset dementia/ need for care at home

"i (f25) have always knocked heads with my grandpa (81) -- growing up, i watched him sit on his butt as my grandma (81) did everything for him, and make rude, sexist (sometimes racist) comments as if they were funny. my mother (his dil) was stubborn, and would fight back, so that's what i learned to do too. i remember many times getting in fights with him about things he would say, telling him how disrespectful and rude they were (he had a penchant for commenting on women's weight, and instead of saying ""i saw this woman walking,""  it was ""i saw this larger, husky woman walking,"" even when it was irrelevant to what he was going to say.a little bit of his back story. he was raised by his mother and a housekeeper, and was about 10 years younger than his older brother. his older brother and father were hard workers, up until they days they died. my grandpa, while he did work hard, became the manager type, that couldn't relate to the 'working class' that was under him. nothing overly bad happened to him, never got drafted/went to war, was able to attend college after he graduated highschool, the whole lot.i think all of that affects the way he treated people. he would imply that all the rude comments were just jokes, and when i was old enough, i would tell him they weren't funny, and disrespectful. he would invade privacy, all because ""its my money, you're here because of me"" sort of mentality. but of course any rude ""funny"" comment towards him deemed yelling and admonishment.anyway. i think you get the picture. enough of me rehashing my pent up frustration.his sister had alzheimer's and died relatively young. ever since, he always would talk about how he was going to get it. he even asked his doctor for preventive medicine for it (which doesn't really exist), instead of, of course, keeping his body healthy with exercise and eating right. this always frustrated me, as health was super important to my parents/immediate family, and i had always heard that its more likely to occur in females than males.so now, here we are, and he is developing dementia. nothing overly bad, as he has always mixed up my name with his daughter's (they sound similar), and never calling my male cousins by the right names. he does, however, ask the same questions that were just answered, which he didn't use to do. all of his old, annoying habits are just repetitive now.i know that patience is important, but over the last couple years of him developing/having dementia have been a struggle of him using ""being sick"" as an excuse, or if it actually is affecting his behavior.the reason i'm posting now is because this morning, after asking me if i was going to take a break from work to come eat breakfast, (i had said yes) ""oh! well you don't want to get fat! i almost said fat-ter (he emphasized this) -- but i could have!"" i told him that wasnt very nice, and he laughed, ""well, i didn't call you fat, i just implied it, i just wanted to make you smile at your old grandpa"" (what he refers to himself as now. and i was most definitely not smiling.) ""well, grandpa, i don't think it was funny. it's actually disrespectful and i don't appreciate it."" he laughed at me and told me i still have ""years of learning and need to grow up in time."" man. he hasn't done this to me in years, and i just thought i was going to explode. i mentioned this to my dad (his patience is beyond me), who must've told him to apologize, and it rang to the tune of, ""i was told i called you fat and that i should apologize. you must've said it, because i wouldn't say that. i may have implied it, but you must've taken it the wrong way. either way, i didn't mean to bother you."" and walked away.how do i balance frustration of his typical, not-new bad behavior, and his illness adding to it? again, i know that patience is key, but man does it run low."," i wish i could tell you that it was going to get better and that he's going to become one of those sweet old dementia patients that everyone enjoys taking care of.  my experience is otherwise--my dad has been verbally abusive for many years and is getting worse with the dementia because his impulse control is nil.what helps is finding some medical/psychiatric care for him and ensuring he stays on the medications they prescribe.  with these aggressive older men, they've been used to being in charge for a long time, and when they feel like they're losing control of their lives due to dementia, one of the things they try to establish control of is whether they take their meds or not.  *they really need to take their meds.*  it will help make you caregivers' lives easier.i'm sorry, i understand your pain.

"1) my granmda's always ""hungry"". but when she does eat, she crams her mouth so full that she can't chew it all so she spits it out. and she's always got her hands in her mouth (after digging in her nose or in the garbage!). a website i was on said this sounds like ""compulsion to put things in their mouth (not just food)"", and is common among people with frontotemporal dementia. since reading, i've started doing what the page said, and started staggering her food in meals (serve one food at a time instead of a main dish with two sides). any other ideas? anyone else got this going on?  2) reading: i've read that people with dementia/alzheimer's; sometimes their brain only registers half of something they're looking at (hence the clock test, with all the numbers smushed onto one side). because grandma's gotta be unique (ha!), i noticed that *she* reads things from the bottom-up. anyone else with some variation of these?"," i've had both the blessing and curse of raising up a baby(now toddler) while caring for my grandmother with dementia. the crossover in observable behaviors is a real head trip sometimes. both my grandmother and my son would do this, and luckily it was a relatively short lived phase for both. the only thing that worked that also mitigated the risk for choking was pre cutting all foods into manageable sized pieces and staggering the portions. what i mean by that is let's say you make chicken, green beans, and broccoli for dinner. i would give portion out one bite or one manageable mouthful on their plate. nothing more. when they safely finished that portion, i would portion out some more. the major downside to this was meals became an hour+ long event and i had to tailor meals to allow me to do this. it's really hard to do this with soup fyi. things that can be cut up work great. as for number 2, we call it dementia blindness. it gets worse and you may start noticing her reach past items to grab things. dementia not only affects cognitive functions like the executive command center and memory, it affects our brains ability to interpret stimuli like images, sound taste, even spatial perception. our brain naturally filters out like 90% of the stuff that comes through our optic nerve. a brain melted by dementia no longer naturally provides that same filter and suddenly someone with mid to late stage dementia has major issues with identifying things visually. i've been through the spectrum with gram in terms of dementia progression. in some cases, the brain registering even half of what is coming through the optic nerve is being exceedingly generous. gram is essential blind, though not blind in the sense that you or i understand it. she sees stuff, but she has no way of interpreting it on a regular basis. every once in a while a piston will fire and she'll focus on my shirt, but those instances are becoming few and far between these days. keep an eye out on that one and if you start seeing her cram non food items in her mouth, lock up items that she may mistake for food like dish detergent other cleaning products. gram once though a sponge was a sandwich. i had to quite literally wrestle it from her.

"," i battle with similar feelings as well. i've found that waiting until you feel capable of keeping your cool and being compassionate is a valuable move. i always regret being snippy, and even though she may not even remember that i was snippy, i still do and it adds to the pile of emotional stresses regardless. on the other hand, i've had my bad days and spent time with my grandma after/during, but somehow seeing her helpless in her situation and being able to smile at her while she smiles back, temporarily takes me out of my own issues and sticks me into that ""now"" of just being present with her. i remember that her world is different from mine and it feels like a privilege to add some sort of fleeting positivity to her day, if even for a moment. but again, sometimes we are just not at that point, and you can't take good care of anyone while you yourself are in a bad spot.  i find nothing wrong with not being chatty. a small smile goes a long way, but nothing wrong with zipping in and out for some food. or quickly exiting the room to ""go to the bathroom"". it all depends on how you're feeling in the moment, but i've definitely found that i sometimes feel better by talking to her instead of avoiding her. feel like i've done something nice or constructive for her situation. but again, it flip flops and i also definitely know when it is best to keep my distance. not sure if i've helped or resolved anything with this little rant but just wanted to say hang in there and it's is ok to take some time for yourself and not engage when you feel it is necessary. take it day to day and take care of yourself wherever possible, nothing wrong with recharging. all the best to you and your grandma :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4qpmnz/having_a_bad_day_myself_how_to_handle_being/,Having a bad day myself; how to handle being around someone with alz/dementia
"tl;dr: mother has been recently diagnosed with dementia. i need help and advice.**sorry for the long post. needed to vent. english is not my first language and my thoughts are all messed up, so if you find it difficult to understand what i'm saying please let me know**hello, i am 29 years old and my mother is almost 74. **story**she has been getting worse since 2010 (noticeably) and i suspect that it started in 2003/2002. even though she has been getting worse since 2010 we've only been seeking doctors since dcember 2014. this is due to the fact that she was taking care of her own mother (96 years) who had been bed ridden since 2010. she had a pretty strong stroke and later had successive micro infartions in her brain completely destroying it, spending the last 3 years in bed screaming non stop (really non stop) until her death in august 2014. we all believed that my mother was just suffering from depression, lack of sleep, unbelievable stress (i took care of my grandmother a few times ... i couldn't stand it for 20 minutes, let alone 2/3 years). then she started sinking .. fast ... really fast. i forced her to go to neurologists (she lives in a small town in a third world country, where she was a doctor (geriatrics and nephrologist) until 2010, for 41 years) and it took a really long time to take her to the doctor (500km away). he sent for a few tests and it took us a really long time to get back to him due to my mother's panic attacks making it impossible to travel. so, we looked for doctors in town. one of them never said she had anything, just medicated her with donepecile clorhydrate and memantine clorhydrate (both used in the treatment of alzheimer), which only made her worst and the other doctor said she didn't have alzheimer nor dementia and he'd consult his coleagues and get back to us in 2 weeks. 3 months later we had to track him down and practically beg to get our tests back so we could go to another doctor. after that i tried taking her with me to where i live, a large brazilian city and my mother lives in a small uruguayan city. i tried taking her with me but she went completely crazy after arrival and i had to take her back home immediately (after 1 hour in my city) by car, where she procceeded to freak out the entire 6 hour ride and open her door while a car was passing us. finally we go to a new doctor a month and a half ago who said it clearly .. she has dementia. at that time my world came crumbling down and i barely heard a few thing: ""she's probably had several microinfartions in her brain, which is certainly why she is always dizzy. she certainly has mixed dementia and is firmly planted in the 4th stage of dementia and presenting some symptoms from the 5th stage. her dementia has a vascular side to it certainly and presents some symptoms similar to alzheimer and another dementia. we need to perform a pet scan with the fdg and pib markers to get a better idea"". this destroyed me, but ok, i'm prepared i can manage. it turns out that i'm not prepared and i can't manage. after the doctor's visit she has been progressively worse very fast. until a week and a half ago she was taken by her brother to the emergency room because she stopped talking and was completely stiff. turns out she was severely dehydrated (probably a combination of medicine) and since then she can barely walk a little bit with help because she falls on her back if you don't grab her (her position is literally like the back slash \), doesn't take her medicine (we basically wait until they dissolve in her mouth), doesn't eat well, doesn't drink a lot of water and rarely ever makes sense or is able to pronounce all the words she wants. i checked [this]( link about the stages of dementia and i can certainly tell you that she is now firmly in stage 5 and hast at least 75% of the symptoms of the 6th stage of dementia. she went from 4/5 to 5/6 in just 3 weeks and i'm scared.ok. sorry for the long vent but i needed it. now i'll post some probably relevant information and ask you some questions and ask for some guidance.**info**-i'm an only son-she lives with her brother (71) and he has hired 3 more women to help him take car of her. 2 of them have been with her for a long time (one of them is a nurse and the other one helped take care of my grandmother) and they are absolutely wonderful with my mother and then a new one, that seems kinda useless (also a nurse my mother knows) because she's really quiet and i don't know if she can deal with my mother, but has planted herself as an ok care giver.- i don't put her somewhere to take care of her because in her city, many of the asylums are known for hitting/hurting their patients or keeping them drugged up. and if i took her to one in my city she would freak out. i also don't take her to one in uruguay's capital because of [this link](. - i live 500km away in brazil. she lives in uruguy. i have a job and if i had another boss i'd be fired already. instead this one lets me get back home whenever i need it and really helps me. this is specially kind considering the economical crisis that is happening in brazil. the past 6 months i've spent at least 3 here. and since she's been taken to the hospital until her pet scan i can't get back to work. i'd be fired anywhere else. i have a really great boss (no, he doesn't reddit).**current symtpoms**- can't walk without help.- can't do anything without help.- can't maintain a conversation.- confuses past and present.- talks to dead people.- confuses me for her brother and her brother for her father that died in 1977- confuses tv and reality- if we don't give her medicine that make her sleepy she doesn't sleep.- she starts crying non stop after all medications wear off and stays like that for about 6 hours. i don't want to give her too much because it could make her worse, but if i don't give her something she'll kill herself. she literally tenses up for 6 hours tried to fight, get up and all that until her next medicine**questions**- how accurate is the link stating the stages of dementia?- i know my mother has mixed dementia. i know one of them is vascular dementia, another one could be alzheimer. any suggestions? until we make all the tests it's impossible to know and they might take some time. even if it's wrong, someone giving me an idea is better than nothing.- how can i give her her medicine?- she's been getting really dizzy after she goes to the bathroom. waht could it be? i already tried talking to her doctor but he isn't here. he'll only be back by friday next week. any suggestions are welcome.- has anyone experienced such a fast decline in health? in january she was able to talk perfectly (was kinda forgetful and dizzy) and she was able to walk. the nurse we hired was hired back then because my mother had a tendency to do whatever she wanted, not take her medicine or take any other medicine in any doses (we didn't know it was dementia, i had my suspitions but i'm an engineer, not a doctor, and no other doctor said it at the time). in march she had a lot of difficulty saying some words and started creating memories (if i said a number and someone said bank she would get it in her head that she needed to go to the bank to deposit the number i said in her account .. she did that for weeks, every day at least 50 times a day and she would read a piece of paper put it down then pick it up again and read it again .. she did that for 30 minutes non stop .. i timed it once). an in the last 2 weeks she can't dfferentiate between television and real life, she has hallucinations, can't maintain a conversation, can't do absolutely anything without help and is getting worse. i can feel her getting worse and everybody else around her as well. **advice**- how can i make her feel better?- does anyone know how to deal with this? i'm kinda young and wasn't expecting to go through this at all, even though my mother had me almost at 45. she's always been a rock for her entire family and many people in the city (remember she was a doctor .. a beloved doctor to some a hated/loved/respected co-worker to others).- i live 500km away and besided going to her house every weekend and on emergencies i don't know what else to do**edit:** added a question and reformated some of the text"," this sounds really awful for you, and i'm sorry that you've got such a tragedy going on with your mother.do you think her sudden decline might be because she continues to have strokes?  it almost sounds like she may be regularly having little ones.  is the medication she is on available in any other form besides pills?  perhaps her caregivers could give her injections or something.i don't really think there is much you can do to make her feel better, to be honest.  i know that you desperately want to, but she is likely past the point where she could be easily soothed or treated for particular issues.  is there any kind of sedative or anxiety reducing medication in her treatment regimen?

"my dad has had a long and storied history of saying horrible things to people.  i think a lot of it is the traumatic brain injury he got when he was 13.  he doesn't have a very good filter for what passes through his lips once the thought has flashed into his brain.he's only getting worse with dementia.  last week, he said something awful to me and my husband and i immediately drove him back to his assisted living and i spent the next 3 hours crying.  i haven't spoken to him since that day.  it would be easier if he didn't have a past history of this since before the dementia diagnosis.  then i could just say, ""it was the disease talking.""  but the reality is that he'd have been just as awful before.my concern is how he's going to have even less of a filter in the days to come.  i understand the biology of it, but it doesn't stop the comments from hurting me, sometimes really badly.  i do see a counselor at times and she's well aware of what a rotten bastard he can sometimes be, as well as the fact that he's the only parent i have left and things weren't always bad.how do you care-givers and family cope with the rotten things they say?  can you just tune them out?  or does it always hurt no matter how far the disease has progressed?"," we tune them out. my so has bore the brunt of it for many years...he brushes it off. whenever one of those comments is directed at me, i redirect or simply do not acknowledge it.   we care for his grandparents. grandma is developing dementia faster than grandpa. grandpa has type 2 diabetes and refuses all treatment, is convinced that his doctors are all out to take his money etc. he has no self control when it comes to food, so i hide foods that i buy for so and i. he spends thousands on cookies and ice cream and things for grandma to cook.

"hello all. i'm new to looking at the sub, and have been doing my research this week. some back story.my grandma began having issues about 5 years ago. it started as a rash on her body that would blister and become sores. this was diagnosed as a small tumor that was causing her body to attack her skin. (i don't have all the information, i was not made privy to it as it was going on and have only learned bits and pieces afterwards.)fast-forward to about 2 years ago. she began having issues with her sight and coordination. this began progressing at a rapid pace. as of this past sunday, she is having full on hallucinations and delusions, can hardly hold a can of coke, can't see about 95% of the time, and when she can she looks in almost the complete opposite direction of where you are standing/sitting, shuffles when she walks, and forgets what she is talking about in the middle of sentences.she was admitted to the geriatric psych ward on sunday after a pretty intense bout of hallucinations. she accused my grandpa of putting huge posters of porn on the outside of their house just to rub it in that he is still healthy and can have sex, heard people screaming at her, and felt as though her life was in danger. she is now in the hospital, will not be released back home and is being set up with a spot in a nursing home for when she is allowed to leave the hospital.the dr at the hospital says that he believes that she is in the later stages of the disease and she doesn't have a whole lot of time left, he estimated about 6 months. my other grandma has full blown alzheimers and my great grandma on that same side died of complications from alzheimers. in these situations, i'm used to dealing with the alzheimers, complete loss of what is real and what isn't, no fear because of the loss of memory, etc... but this one in particular is difficult mainly because she knows what is happening. she is completely lucid through all of it, her brain is just distorting things and causing her to suffer.my question/concern is this. does anyone have any suggestions on what i can do when i go to visit her that will help her remain relaxed? i understand that this is scary and that her mind is causing her to believe these things are real and i have 0 blame for her on that front. i just want to be able to help her relax for the small amounts of time that i am there and maybe ease her anxiety for a little while, even if only a short amount of time."," i have worked full time as a recreation provider on a dementia unit for 7 years. i offer programming to 43 residents. the answer will vary, but three of the strongest things that might help her are music, and an old familiar activity/something meaningful to do, and tea.learn about what music she likes. try to familiarize yourself with it as well. when you visit with her, play the music. depending on the style, sing along, or even dance (a lot of my residents will go from anxious to joyously happy for the duration of a dance). if that's not her/your style, you could also try sitting beside her, and putting headphones on her ears so she can listen to it. hold her hand and just enjoy the moment together.another thing i try to engage my residents in is montessori for dementia - style programming. bring some laundry from home and fold it together. was she a knitter/crocheter? bring some supplies with you and try it. keep in mind if she's ever an aggressive type, consider what you bring her. she may or may not be allowed to keep that stuff in her room. knitting, for those who did it their whole life, and can still see well enough/have mobile enough hands, can work wonders. i have a resident that wanders in a panic for a good 80% of her unstructured time every day. i can get her to sit for a good 30 minutes and focus on knitting. knitting/crocheting might be too hard, but something to think about. i have residents who are really into coloring, flipping through magazines/catalogues, some who like to tidy up. another relaxer is a nice, hot cup of tea, if that was your grandma's way to mellow out. you can bring decaf in if you're worried about caffeine consumption. you can try different combinations. maybe come, visit with her, have a tea/cookie. try a different activity for a while then settle in and listen to music. if she isn't too overstimulated, the music can help as a mood setter, while you engage in other things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4pd39j/advice_how_to_ease_grandmothers_anxiety_lewy_body/,Advice - How to ease Grandmothers anxiety - Lewy Body Dimentia
"i'm so sorry for the wall of text... there is a lot to get out, i'm going to try to split it into sections with bolded titles for easier reading**background**my grandmother has been exhibiting signs of short term memory loss for a few years now. it began with asking the same question multiple times in short conversations, the inability to remember what she had done throughout the day, calling me by my aunt's name and confusing me for a younger version of her, and occasionally forgetting where she was. we dismissed this originally as just a symptom of growing older and not using her brain quite as much due to retirement. so we got her and ipad and some brain training apps, made sure she always has puzzles and crossword/wordsearch/sudoku books around, made sure that she was getting out and spending time with her friends (she now has a standing coffee appointment with a group of ladies 3x a week), and have been spending as much time with her as possible engaging with her, doing puzzles with her and just over all attempting to keep those cognitive juices flowing. but it seems as if none of this is working, she is still in a noticeable decline which has seemed to increase more rapidly the last 6 months. i moved out of the house i shared with my grandparents and mother growing up in december and have tried to see my grandparents once or twice a week since and i am noticing more and more how bad it is getting not seeing her every day and there have been a few instances lately that have me c concerned. about a month and a half ago i went out and took her for a walk (she likes to go for walks but it is getting to the point that we are no longer comfortable letting her go out on her own as she gets very disoriented and the neighbourhood can be confusing) where she introduced herself to some neighbours across the street who have lived there 10+ years. a week or two after that i went for coffee with my grandparents and as they were dropping me off at my new house (which my grandmother has been to at least once a month since i moved in) and she asked who i was going to visit and when i would be home. the last (well the last biggish seeming one that has me concerned) was when we went to the dance recital of a family friend last week, i sat beside her and she was turning to me and calling me by my aunt's name and talking me me as if i was her and when it came time for the little little kids (3-5 age group) to preform there was one that resembled me as a child at which point she got very excited and said ""*aunts name* look at *sosullied* isn't she adorable in her costume! we need to make sure to get lots of pictures!"". i had been gently reminding her of who i was every so often but at that point i just couldn't and let her have the happy moment of her being so proud of her ""granddaughter"". **the issue**so the problem is that our family gp will not acknowledge that there is any issue what so ever. my entire family go to him (my self, grandparents, mother, and 4 aunts and uncles) and at one point or another most of us have spoken to him about our concerns which he has either brushed off or ignored completely. the closest that we have gotten to a response from him was that we should ""think carefully before saying anything else as once we 'start this' it can't be undone"" and his biggest concern seemed to be that my grandmother might have her license taken away (we don't let her drive any more anyways - she gets frustrated with other drivers because she doesn't know what to do on the road or where she is going which leads to dangerous driving). he has said that her memory seems absolutely fine to him - she still asks him about his children and wife when she comes into the office - and i have a feeling that my grandfather has also been downplaying her symptoms and stepping in and prompting her for correct answers when they have their doctors visits together. **my question**has anyone dealt with a gp that has been reluctant to acknowledge symptoms of dementia before? how did you handle it? are there any resources that can be accessed with out a gp referral? (for reference we are in canada)thank you so much for any responses, my family deeply appreciates it.**side note:** i have looked up all medications/supplements/vitamins she is taking to see if there are any contraindications or interactions that could present as dementia and as far as my research has shown there is nothing.**tl;dr: my grandmother's memory seems to have been declining for some time but the decline has been more rapid the last six months. our gp does not think that there is anything wrong based on short visits with her and will not take further action or refer us to any resources.**"," you can take your grandmother to see a speech-language pathologist to evaluate her cognitive skills at an outpatient clinic. if the evaluation reveals a significant memory and overall cognitive decline, you can use the data from the therapist to support your claim. as a therapist, a large percentage of patients (especially in skilled nursing facilities) are diagnosed with dementia. we don't fix dementia, but we can assist with improving cognitive skills or her independence in her activities of daily living. patients with dementia have the capacity to learn new things (depending on when intervention is provided and the severity). unfortunately, these patients aren't referred for speech services until later stages. i hope this helps. i'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time with your healthcare provider.

"my mother is 73 and over the last 6 months or so, i've been seeing the following:  1.  telling me the same stories several days in a row with no memory of having already told me.2.  frequent falls with no obvious cause - she just seems to fall for no reason.  frequent might be the wrong word - like 2 or 3 tines a month.  she says it neuropathy in her feet from her diabetes, which i guess it could be. 3.  her driving has really gone downhill - i've seen her miss stop signs completely and turn left against a red left turn light a few times.   she has never been a great driver, but this is different.  she is very stubborn and proud and when i try to talk to her about it she gets tearful and clams up.  i want her to see a neurologist and she has tentatively agreed to, but i know her and i'm afraid she is going to downplay stuff to him and not be honest, but i don't think she would accept me or another person accompanying her, either.   this is a woman who once convinced the doctor and nurses that she was ready to go home after surgery when in fact she was out of her gourd from the medications and wound up bring readmitted the next day.   she fell today, and the first thing she did was snap at everyone who expressed concern that ""i'm okay!""    if someone younger offers her a seat she gets offended.  like i said, stubborn and proud.   any advice?"," i would do my best to get her off the streets if you see her as a danger to herself and other drivers. there is such thing as age related memory impairments. however, repetition of the same story on numerous occasions is abnormal. the frequency of falls place her at risk for a traumatic brain injury (tbi). tbi in geriatric patients can display similar impaired memory systems like dementia, specifically alzheimer's. you also mentioned she has diabetes. any patient with a history of uncontrolled diabetes is at risk for a cognitive impairment as well. personally, i would try to get an mri or ct to see if there are changes in her brain. additionally, i'd also seek a speech-language pathologist (slp) to evaluate her cognitive functioning. there are many assessment tools slps utilize to compare her cognitive functioning with that of others of same age and/or gender. slps can also treat the cognitive communication deficits (e.g, memory, executive functioning, language).

"who else has the privilege of caring for an elderly family member who is currently engaged in a war on foods of epic proportions? my grandma has consistently for the 10+ years (forget at this point) always made sneaking food one of her top forms of entertainment. obviously her alzheimers affects this behavior to a great extent but she's displayed plenty of actions that clearly show she's in full control and consciously making the decision to engage in these food sneaking attempts.some of the most notable examples are; highly motivated attempts at getting to the fridge in the garage (where all the good stuff is) where walking to the door and tugging on it to see if someone forgot to lock the electronic keypad has become a hobby, the rare failure to lock it usually results in a free tub of ice cream. she goes to such extremes like pretending she's doing laundry at the machines which are located right next to the garage door but is rather a facade in the event that she's caught checking on the door. she rarely gets to the garage fridge now as the families disciplined themselves to locking the door regardless of whether grandma is locked in her room or has her door open.as she's figured out the garage is set to nightmare difficulty she opts for the kitchen fridge which, unfortunately, seems to be set to beginner difficulty. it is currently never locked as the improvised zip tie + shower ring lock i macgyvered proved to be too much of a nuisance for even the family so it is regularly never utilized. even with a somewhat conscious effort on the families part to not put diabetic unfriendly food in the kitchen fridge, some amount always seems to end up in there. macaroni salad, bread, and carbs galore seem to magnetically return and inevitably on grandmas plate in a failed attempt at sneaking them or in her belly and a resulting 500+ blood sugar level (forgot to mention the diabetes). the nearby cabinets that are usually stocked with forgotten foods are of no particular benefit to the cause, especially since the same zip tie locks setup for them are never used or are by passable by grandma, an apparent master thief. so here we stand in this never ending game of foods, an unstoppable force (grandma) clashing with an immovable object (me on couch patrol) where the dilemma of providing her with the basic pleasure of not being confined to a guest bedroom results in having to watch her every move. she's made three attempts in the hour after her scheduled meal to loot the fridge with me casually denying her this great honor each time. i can't help but wonder what it is that drives her to make the partly conscious decision to engage in such controversial behavior, of course the alzheimers is the main culprit as is the diabetes but she's shown she's quite capable of making the choice of actively working past obstacles set in place to stop her which leaves me at the conclusion that the rush of the chase is too great for her to stop her impulsive behavior. i plan on installing such conveniently operable locks that their benefits are too great to not use, ideally something that doesn't require drilling to evade the misplaced value of my family members likeness of the cabinets. this is a war that i'd like to end in peace even if that means allowing grandma to make multiple trips to the fridge or cabinets only to walk away in defeat being unable to outsmart the mechanisms, at least then our consciences could be clearer knowing she isn't confined to her cell. seven blessings upon you."," we take care of his grandparents and they grew up during the great depression...haven't adapted to the modern world at all. grandpa is diabetic and obese, eats sweets compulsively. he also gets into our groceries, so we hide them.   however, they love my cooking. i make nourishing meals whenever it's my turn to cook. grandma cooks old fashioned southern meals that they eat.   i have also taken to simply offering a sample of my food. like say....shrimp. i offer, knowing that they probably aren't familiar with the things i cook. they are childlike and very curious. so why not?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4ohd2t/game_of_foods/,Game of Foods

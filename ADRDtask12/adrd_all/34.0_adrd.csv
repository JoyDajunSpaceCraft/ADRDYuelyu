"my mom came down with alzheimers about 4 years ago, and it became severe enough about 2.5 years ago that we moved her into an assisted living facility. the facility is 3 states away from where i live, and we chose it because my sister and aunt lived in the same city where we put mom, but my sister has passed away (unrelated) and my aunt really has no time to be involved, which she made clear after my sister passed away. there is no other family in this city now.mom's condition gets measurably worse every few months, according to the staff at her facility. the latest is that she can no longer dress herself, or use the toilet herself, she needs daily assistance from the staff at the facility. she can still speak, and even read some, and eat without help, but she doesn't know the day of the week, and can't remember names.she is only 74,  and aside from the alzheimers, she is fairly healthy (she's had regular checkups). people in her family normally live into their early 90s, but none of them had dementia/alzheimers -- except one aunt, who passed in her early 80s.i'm not trying to be morbid, but i'm trying to understand if people whose alzheimers is on a certain point on a scale... have some expected life span? if her condition is such that she can't dress herself, or use the bathroom by herself, what's next? i'm not able to travel to her city often to see her, so i feel a bit like she is warehoused there now with very little family involvement. i had considered moving her to a facility in my city, but everybody tells me that such a move would probably be very traumatic for her, now that she is used to her current facility.if she is expected to live for 10 more years, i feel like moving her closer to me might be worth the temporary trauma, but if she is only expected to last another couple of years, then maybe the trauma of a move would not be good for her relative to her remaining years."," although i suspect some would disagree, in my estimation, the part of the disease which causes faculty loss seems completely independent of the part of the disease that causes physical degradation.  at least this appears to be the case in my mom.  she's healthy as a horse physically, but she is about where your mom is cognitively.  i'm not sure there are any easy answers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a7dp2k/is_there_some_standardized_chart_of_a_persons/,"Is there some standardized chart of a person's life expectancy based on their age and current ability?

"i've been perusing this sub for awhile but i don't ever see what i came for, namely sons or daughters who've had a fuckin pin put in their awesome lives so they can just wither and die in their thirties along with their mom.  i tried to swallow a bottle of alprazolam last night and my husband choked them out of me (guess choked me out would be the correct nomenclature) and then punched me in the eye.  that was new.  so now i guess i have to pretend to be the chick that walks into walls if i decide to leave the house.  probably won't.i'm an only child and my mom had me in her forties.  she was extraordinary.  her life was a goddamn dream.  grew up in a house that's now a museum.  the stables are now a restaurant for some reason.  swiss boarding school, dalliances with current world leaders, summers on onassis' private island and a 65' schooner as a wedding present.  mom also had a gift for leadership.  she owned the best restaurant  in a state renowned for  its food.  i never once saw her get frustrated with any of her employees and she never that i remember, was frustrated with me or said anything to make me feel bad about myself.  this is why it hurts so much.  i look around and all i see are pictures of my parents smoking joints with famous people of the 70's like fucking rockstars or on their giant ass boat with the tie-dyed sails or riding around drunk on my grandfather's racehorses on his damn plantation and i can't help but note that my life is over.  i don't need to have that extreme, however, my husband and i used to really enjoy our life.  we're not rich like my parents but we didn't care.  we had an awesome bohemian lifestyle and these pictures are mocking me.  my sweet, lovely mom has become someone i don't recognize.  the person that allowed me to do primal scream therapy (self diagnosed ) on boring car trips now hurls terrible expletives at our three year old when she makes any noise.  when i try to bathe her she is frightened to the point of violence.  this beautiful debutante who went to finishing school walks around the house dropping turds out of her pajama pants as a daily occurrence.  my dad refuses to believe this is happening and i just weep, like daily so my husband  picks them up.  he also gets her out of the tub when i manage to convince her to get in.  my dad is also losing it.  i've been taking him to a spate of neurological appointments lately.  he's convinced it's ""alzheimer's by osmosis.""  ok dad.  he's as depressed as i am but he would never admit it.  is someone that you once loved, worshipped, adored still the same person when they daily insult you, yell at your baby who you named after her but yet she's never said her name, leave pieces of shit wiped toilet paper on the kitchen counter multiple times a day, just be terribly rude to absolutely everyone 80 percent of the time?  she is the complete opposite of everything i've ever known my mom to be.  she was fastidious and cultured and a consummate hostess.  she was everything i ever wanted to be.  but what i actually be is a depressed, semi-suicidal anti-social asshole because my life is already done.  i guess 30 ish is the new dead in my case.this rant wouldn't be complete without a shout out to aunt andrea.  fuck you.  there.  after my husband and i realized that my mom needed us we left our halcyon beach life and bought a house in a different state 10 minutes from my parent's.  we had 6 acres and chickens and despite the sadness over my mom's condition we loved our first real home.  ten months later my dad comes over for our usual sunday night dinner and announces he bought a house, sight unseen????!!!!! on the other coast of the country, because aunt andrea showed some support (over the phone kind of support- the literal definition of phoning it in.)hahahahah.  no problem, we'll just put our dream home on the market and pack twelve angry chickens into multiple cat carriers so i can give them to a guy in a walmart parking lot who promises not to eat them.so, here we are dear reader.  what a journey from the most liberal, free-thinking state in the u.s. to a place where there is literally a gun shopping mall ten miles in every direction.  oh but wait, auntie andrea, i haven't forgotten about you.  you were the harbinger.  and have you given even the most cursory care about my family.  no.  you haven't .  you haven't once expressed interest or concern.  you've never even asked me (or my dad, as far as i know) how this might be(obviously is) affecting us.  you're a con artist.  &amp;#x200b;my dad wants to have me committed today (to where??)  somewhere with white walls i guess.  all i can think of is who's going to take him to his mri and ct appointments?  i can see him through the window right now blowing leaves.  he blows them into the street and the landscapers blow them right back.  it's an all day activity.  very sysiphean.i wish quaaludes were still around.  that could get me through this hell that has become my life.  i've never ever experienced depression before this but jesus, it's hard to not go crazy when the greatest heroes of your life change shape right before your eyes.  sounds like something that would happen in the ninth circle of hell.  it's a sadistic disease as augustus burroughs said but that's actually not right because i'm not receiving any sort of pleasure from this.  i'm just trapped.  my mom used to say all the time ""ugh, just take me out back and shoot me if i get that old,"" in reference to what i can't remember.  she wouldn't want to live this way but there's no end in sight for her.  she's exceptionally fit except for the brain department.  someday her brain will forget how to chew.  her mom also died of alzheimer's (she was considerate and drank herself to a quick demise)  my mom didn't take care of her and i never met her- rich people are weird.i will never make my baby take care of me.  it'll be like that scene from still alice but i'll make sure i have the wherewithal to pull it off and that there's no one around to punch me in the damn eye.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a70y8b/so_how_awesome_is_it_being_a_caretaker/,"So, how awesome is it being a caretaker..."
"my 71 yo mother has lived alone ever since her husband passed away 5 years ago. i've been staying at her home providing care bc she had surgery last week to insert a stent for an aortic aneurysm. two days ago she woke up agitated and irritable, went to the bathroom and couldn't find the toilet paper that was on the roll right beside her. then she took a nap. later we decided to go for a drive because she was still irritable. chalked it up to cabin fever. while i was driving her around, she started babbling incoherent words and was frustrated because she was trying to tell me things but couldn't speak a complete sentence. back home, she became utterly confused and it took 20 minutes of hand holding to get her out of the car. inside, she was restless and would not sit still and kept getting up and stumbling around. when i gave her water she spilled it everywhere and then dropped the cup. when she tripped and fell i called the ambulance. i had the er run a ct scan on her head and the area where she had surgery. i had them check for uti and pneumonia, full blood tests, oxygen level, blood pressure, the works. everything came back fine. while there, she returned to normal and was fine. nothing physically wrong at all. the next morning she was released from the hospital with a clean bill of health, then as we were leaving, she asked me what were the orange squiggly lines on the floor but there were no orange lines anywhere. back home, she thanked me for decorating the living room for christmas, but the walls were not decorated. even when she's not having spells she may randomly see something that's not there. is this in line with alzheimer's and/or age related dementia? she seems a bit young to be this much unhinged and i am afraid to leave her alone.", my mum who has alzheimer’s also has episodes like you described other times she is quite with it. i would get her assessed by the memory clinic. also have they ruled out epilepsy? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a70cuj/71_year_old_mom_has_brief_spells_of_dementia/,71 year old mom has brief spells of dementia

"hi all. i have read so many posts on here due to my nan having alzheimer's disease. she has been slowly deteriorating over a period of about 4 years but in recent weeks she had a fall. my nan hadn't walked unassisted in months, we had just given her her dinner and pudding. she got up and attempted to walk but fell. she was in hospital for two and a half weeks and has been diagnosed with an acute subdural haematoma. (bleed on the brain) as she is 90 years of age and in late stages of alzheimer's, they were not going to operate. since the fall, trying to get her to eat and drink has been difficult but she perked up slightly close to her discharge from hospital. since getting her home, she has since deteriorated even more. getting her to eat anything is a challenge, drinking is challenge but can more easily be accomplished. over the last 24 hours, she has started spitting food out and also her medication (all of it is in liquid form so we get her to take it more easily). we also think she is now struggling with swallowing. we understand what this illness has done, doing and what else it can cause. by doing research i have managed to keep it together quite well. but that doesn't mean it makes it any easier to deal with. we want her to be under as little stress as possible. my question is: what do you do to get them to eat and drink in these last stages? are there ways to help them swallow? any other advice from people who are going through this or have gone through this would be greatly appreciated. thank you for reading my post. for all the others who look after family members or friends with this disease, well done to you all. it's a tough on all of us, but we each do what we can. big hugs to you all."," so the doctor has been a great help. we now have some thickener (as was mentioned in previous replies) as well as some shakes that contain vitamins and nutrients she's not getting. these seem to go down well, albeit it's a few mouthfuls here and there. we are having 2 visits a week from the doctor (wow! didn't ever think that would happen) as well as a weekly visit from the district nurses. we've also been given the ""end of life"" care package which contains the drugs (only to be administered by a nurse) needed to make her comfortable when the time comes. over this last week, the doctors have been a great help and have given us loads of information on what to expect. i discussed hospice options with the rest of my family and one of my nans wishes was to be at home surrounded by the people who love her. the doctors are happy with how we're doing. all in all, we feel better informed. i will check out that book though. every little bit of information helps. thank you so much.

"long story short. my mom has always been the sibling to take care of my grandma. she got diagnosed. has lived with us for probably 4 years now. she loves her to death. but things are so severe now that my grandma rarely sleeps, she pees in the carpet every night, and is just always up making a general mess. it obviously upsets my mom bc she literally doesn’t get to sleep at night. and she gets frustrated bc my grandma doesn’t remember doing said things and says someone else must have peed. and my mom starts ... not yelling but hatefully saying stuff to her. just now i heard my mom telling my essentially dying grandma that she is done with the bullshit of her not remembering anything and not sleeping. she left her bedroom (they were sharing one), locked her inside and said if she falls or makes a mess then that’s on her (my grandma). idk. it’s a lot harder to explain the dynamic over text. but i feel so conflicted and guilty bc i know how draining it is on my mom. it is annoying. i get annoyed too sometimes. but i never let it show bc i always think, she doesn’t really know what she’s doing and do i want the last thing i say to her to be negative? my mom just seems to lose it at night. and i get it. but god it sucks having to hear it and know that not much can be done that i know of. it’s terrible but i honestly feel so bad for my grandma that i almost wish she didn’t have to live like this. i couldn’t imagine living, not really knowing what you’re doing, or remembering it, and getting yelled at daily for stuff you “didn’t do” and having someone make you cry. that’s where the guilty part comes in. i love her to death and always try to remember the fun side of her before the disease, but her life seems so bland and miserable (at night) at least. it’s a terrible position. anyway, i just don’t know what to do or if there is anything to do. it just sucks seeing my mom treat her the way she does bc i know she means the world to her. i guess this is me just spewing my late night thoughts. i’ve never really had people to talk about this with that understand how intense it can be.", can you take the night shift once or twice a week so your mother can get a full night’s rest? can anyone else?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a5f1xm/my_mom_is_hateful_to_my_grandma_with_alzheimers/,My mom is hateful to my grandma with Alzheimer’s and I don’t know what to do.

"i recently moved back to my hometown and now get to see my mom every day, after being away for more than 2 years. she is pretty far gone at this point and speaks in nonsense sentences. she is constantly agitated and anxious about non-existent problems that she can't control. she spent her whole life making sacrifices to make sure everyone around her was happy and provided for. now her reward is to be constantly plagued by this formless anxiety. i wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, and it happens to the kindest and most selfless woman i have ever known. today at the nursing home i met a man in about the same stage of the disease as my mother. he was jovial and kept laughing and smiling. i hated myself for it, but i resented it. this disease is pure evil, and i'm so sorry for anyone who has it in their lives. i'm sorry for posting a long sad post with no real point to it, i just had to get some of these thoughts out. thank you to anyone who listened", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a0c852/struggling/,Struggling
"this year, neither of my dad's brothers called our family to wish us a happy thanksgiving. adding insult to injury, thanks to social media, it's obvious me, my sister, and my parents weren't invited to any of the local family gatherings. it wasn't like everyone was doing their own thing this year or it was a last minute event and we didn't get the memo. we were the only ones missing from the photos.on one hand, i get it, it's hard and uncomfortable and unsettling talking to alz people if you aren't used to it. he can get a little unpredictable and agitated if he's been out of the house long, but he loves talking to people and playing with the young kids. he has had some off interactions with his 2 brothers recently. of course, my dad doesn't remember these spats and doesn't understand why his brothers seem distant, and the brothers don't seem to have any compassion for the alz affecting his behavior while we get meds dialed in better. so that's complicated. with all the other possible holiday drama, i get why they didn't want to invite him and take the risk of him being obnoxious.but that means that they're also excluding my mom, sister and i and that makes me angry. the least they could do is pity invite us knowing we would decline, or just my sister, me and my spouse so we don't feel like we're being cut out and shoved in a dark corner, like lepers, like some shameful secret that doesn't fit in the perfect facebook family story because we have the unfortunate displeasure of being related to my dad. i hate seeing the pictures of my aunts and uncles and cousins smiling with their kids and spouses and having fun and knowing that my sister and i, their blood relatives, weren't invited. that *his own brothers* were so quick to wash their hands of him when things started getting uncomfortable. i know family isn't obligated to help but we've been fairly close to this point and we thought we could lean on them for support, since they told us as much.and i'm sad and bitter because at this point, it all feels so disappointingly icky that i don't think i'll ever be able to think of them again without thinking of how they have alienated us and abandoned us when we most need support. sure, i can stay off social media but that doesn't lessen the sting of knowing none of us are family event worthy anymore apparently. how they professed they wanted to help but when it really comes down to it, it's all empty fucking promises and selfishness so they can feel better and completely ignore how it's at the expense of the relationships of the next generation."," i don't do facebook so i'm completely unaware of what the rest of my family is doing.  i've had my father living with me for over two years. there has not been one card or phone call for him in all that time - yes, he's been a jerk all his life, but still. and no  contacting me, either. i don't consider myself to have a family anymore ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/9zw96p/bitter_at_extended_family_rant/,Bitter at extended family rant

"i’m a 28/f that cares for my grandmother (87) with alzheimer’s from home. it’s undeniably been the most important journey/lesson of my life. from what i read-grandma is in the severe stages, or just approaching. she isn’t continent (but rare bm accidents), her mobility isn’t great, she is silent unless prompted. i go through ebbs and flows of emotions, and i wondered if anyone had any advice for keeping my own spirits up. sometimes it’s difficult to even take care of my own remedial tasks at home, as i feel like all of my motivation and energy is spent. i have had depression, but this is a different feeling. it’s kind of like i feel as if i’m lingering around in between the times and routines i have in place for her. is there any self care routines, or anything that could jolt me into some form of hobby/action for myself? what do you do to bring yourself joy while caretaking? also-grandma is in diapers and has waterproof pads for the bed-but it seems like it’s just endless laundry and urine. even though, i help her to the bathroom throughout the day many many many times. is there any techniques that you’ve found to make the clean up or the entire process easier? everything online is basically what i’m already doing...thought maybe someone would have something more handy, even if it’s a brand of pads etc..thank you.."," the advice in this thread is already great. reaching out to local resources is one of the better things you can do. there are local groups that can be helpful to your grandmother in her care and activities and that can certainly help lessen the load on you.additionally, reach out to local resources that are there for you! find support groups and communities (this is already a great place to start!) that can help you make sense of this all while giving you the tools and support to help her. a lot of the focus is on your grandmother and it is often easy to forget to take of yourself and that is important to this whole process! i am the author of a book about my family's journey with my mother's alzheimer's that dives into caretaking. it covers what we did and how we dealt with all the weird situations this disease can put you while also trying to provide clarity and understanding for how different your life is during this process and after it is over. you can check out a description [here]( but i certainly don't want to force it on you!feel free to message me anytime for advice or to chat! keep fighting and remember we are all in this together!

"dad, julie, and i, attended the hospice of anchorage candle lighting ceremony in remembrance of those we’ve lost. it was a lovely little event at the alaska native heritage center - a couple of speakers, performance by a native dance troupe, decorating paper cups to put candles in - culminating in the ceremony where everyone gathers around a fire pit while names are read aloud and then puts their cups in the fire pit to burn. we hadn’t prepped him for this very well, and i was concerned that he would find it all very confusing and weird - half expected him to pitch a fit and walk out at some point - ‘who are all these people, and why are we here?!?’ - which was quite the opposite to what happened...  he was completely ‘present’ for the whole thing. he met people, decorated a cup for mom, enjoyed the dancers, and participated in the ceremony. here’s the best part: i was one of those reading names aloud, and realized belatedly that i’d not put mom’s name down to be read. at the end of the reading, the facilitator invited us to speak any names that hadn’t been spoken. i was just about to do that, when dad stepped forward into the firelight, and in a strong voice said, ‘sandra. duane. riley. my wife. she became mickey belden’. it was beautiful. standing tall, with the sparks from the fire floating around him - it was one of those primal, mythic, moments that take your breath, and i’m so glad to have been there. he stood there for a moment in silence - long enough for me to wonder if i might need to step in - and then stepped back into place in the group, having timed it perfectly for dramatic effect. he's good at that.  what we’re doing is working, and he’s responding to it brilliantly. i'm so grateful to be going through this now, when information is available that gives us hope. it's working so far!", i’m so happy for you!  i love those good days!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/9rjtk5/positive_progress_report/,Positive progress report!

"hi again folks.my mom has become eligible for medicaid, and has been received a medical prescreening that makes her eligible for long-term care services.  we live in virginia, and the state offers several waivers to avoid full time facility (nursing) care.  we are currently applying for something called the commonwealth coordinated care plus waiver, a consumer-directed care waiver.  the ccc plus waiver serves aged individuals and disabled individuals who would otherwise require institutionalization in a nursing facility (this waiver was previously called an edcd waiver before 2017). this will allow us to arrange for in-home care for my mom flexibly, at least temporarily.in the meantime, we have also put in some applications for facility care at several medicaid-accepting long-term care facilities nearby.  we've decided that putting mom into one of these facilities is required,  and if one of them had any beds today, we would try to get her into it as quickly as possible. but they don't and we have no idea when a bed will become available.  we are really only considering care via the ccc plus waiver as an interim.my concern is that, by accepting this consumer-directed care waiver,  it might delay or prevent us from taking a medicaid path that would allow her to quickly get into a nursing facility. that would be terrible.i know the answer is ""ask your medicaid facilitator or case worker"" but both of these people have given us wildly inaccurate advice in the past, so i'm hoping as a long shot to find someone who has had experience with both facility care and consumer-directed waiver care given to the same person, and how it worked out for you.thanks!", pm me if i don’t answer your question. i work in virginia in adult services / adult protective services. i do screenings for the ccc+ waiver as part of my job. also i am on mobile so i apologize for formatting issues. has your mom had the screening yet? the ccc+ waiver allows your mom to get care in the home or a nursing home. she has to meet the nursing home level of care however to be approved.it is a two step process. she has to be approved for ltc and meet nursing home level of care. i have seen families where they meet nursing home level of care but not ltc medicaid criteria etc.you are smart by putting her on nursing home wait lists - especially if she needs a memory care with a locked unit. some of those have log wait lists.by accepting the ccc+ waiver you are not jeopardizing her ltc (long term care) medicaid. or preventing nursing home placement. in fact once her ltc medicaid is activated families have 30 days for placement or in home care otherwise the ltc medicaid will be “re-evaluated”does this make sense? the person who did your mom’s screening should be able to answer some questions. like i said though pm me (or respond here) if you have questions! ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/9q549k/minutiae_about_medicaid_consumerdirectedhcbs_care/,Minutiae about Medicaid consumer-directed/hcbs care in Virginia

"my great aunt had rapid-onset dementia a few years ago, and rapidly descended into a state where she no longer recognised anyone, couldn't form coherent sentences anymore etc. she moved to a care home and has been there ever since. i went to visit a few times. the last time, she had no idea who i was, and barely said a word. when she did speak, it was essentially gibberish. i was a wreck after i left, and i realised that this is part of a greiving process. she doesn't need me there, she's cared for, fed, clothed and looked after, and there doesn't seem to be any notable remnant of ""her"" actually there anymore. she's gone. i haven't been back since - it's too hard to see her like that and i don't feel there's anything i can do to actually impact her life in any way. &amp;#x200b;sometimes i think i'm selfish or i'm a bad person. i don't know. &amp;#x200b;i recently had my first daughter. i'd love my aunt to meet her so much, but i know it won't mean anything to either of them. i'm terrified of going back, because even the slightest glimmer of the idea that she would know who i was, or realise that she was meeting my daughter just seems to good to be true, and i don't know how i would handle the reality when she just stares straight through us. &amp;#x200b;i don't know if this is me asking for advice or just venting at this point. it sucks.", my mother forgot me when i was late 20s and she was mid 50s. they can still feel emotions and touch. don’t forget who they were. that’s all i can suggest. i still spent time with my mum despite her not knowing me or even able to speak. they can still sense stuff.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/9obm39/what_do_you_do_when_theres_nothing_left/,What do you do when there's nothing left?

"i've been caring for my 91 year-old mother for several years now, and only learned about hospice about a month ago. mom has dementia and congestive heart failure, and so her physician set her up with at home hospice care. what a god send it's been! i'm now getting more than 3 hrs of sleep a night, and am able to go use the restroom now without my mother panicking and screaming for me. our home has become peaceful. this week i happily reported to the hospice nurse that after mom's latest checkup she had gained a couple pounds (she's underweight). the nurse commented they may have to graduate her from hospice. my heart sank. we've only had hospice for a month, but it has improved our lives so much. i'm actually able to get out to the gym 2 days a week now. mom is knitting again, she's commenting about things she sees on tv, about the birds outside, the sunset, the weather. it seems so cruel that because there's been an improvement in our lives, that they will discontinue hospice. i just can't face going thru this alone again. i was starting to feel human again, and now i feel absolutely let down...does anybody have any input, any experience, any advice? i just can't go back to the way things were, and i'm stunned that they offered all this help and care and can just as quickly take it away. was i wrong to talk about the positives, the good things in our lives to the hospice workers? i'm just so discouraged and hopeless now.", former hospice nurse.sometimes when all hospice services are put into place a person can do better due to the additional care and support. (ex. they gain weight because they now have an aide taking 1full hour to get them to eat which causes weight gain) sometimes they do so well they no longer meet criteria to remain on service. but they dont have to discharge her right away. they usually have 90 days to reevaluate patient. they recognize this improvement may be temporary  before declining again. if they only see improvement they usually will give you plenty of warning before stopping services. but you can always ask for another hospice evaluation if she begins to decline again.  we hate taking away support that we know helps but there are pretty strict criteria to remain on hospice.ps talk with hospice social worker about your concern. they can help you find other support services outside of hospice.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dw5041/caregiver_with_question_about_hospice/,,Caregiver with question about hospice
does anyone have any experience coping with the death of someone they cared for? my grandma passed away in february. i cared for her for 7 years and built my whole life around her needs. it was the most amazing experience and taught me a heck of a lot about life. it's just that now i can't seem to come to terms with her death. i miss her so much and i feel like crying most of the time and it's totally draining my motivation. i think its hard because she had dementia so i didn't really get to say goodbye to her.," i lost my grandmother two weeks ago after caring for her for 2 years and i feel completely numb. life on novocaine. i can only hope it will get better and i suspect that it will, but i’m doing everything i can to practice self-care and put myself in as many positive environments as i can find. best of luck to you, and i’m terribly sorry for your loss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dvidsi/7_years/,,7 years

"i’m not an “official” caregiver but i’m caregiving for my 87 year old grandfather with alzheimer’s and diabetes. i help him clean up/change when he has accidents, feed him, take him to dr appointments, play easy games with him, am with him majority of every day. despite not really knowing him due to the alzheimer’s, i’ve grown very close to him these past two years of caring for him. my family is small and very toxic and my grandpa is probably the only reason we’re all still bothering to be near each other. i came to be his caretaker (while in highschool) shortly after being kicked out at 16 (willingly though bc as i mentioned, toxic family.) and moving in to his two bedroom apartment he shared with my two brothers who took care of him. i knew he wasn’t the same old grandpa i knew as a child, but i had no idea how bad he had gotten until i started living with him. i started researching everything and anything about his conditions in order to care for him properly because i knew my brothers weren’t at the extent that they needed to be. one of them didn’t help at all and rarely ever does now. once i graduated, isolated and friendless as i was, my life started to revolve only around him and his wellbeing (beside the unwanted family drama). hes the first thing i think of when i wake up and before i go to bed. as emotionally tiring as it can be, i love to be there for him and want nothing more than for him to be as comfortable and content as he can be in his last years. now, i spend every day with him while my brothers work. we’re poor but my grandpa could very well pay for any old folks home. whenever it was suggested by one my of family members though, i’d tell them that i’d happily take care of him because after caring for him for so long, just thinking about someone else taking care of him makes me sick to my stomach. i feel like if it’s not me, i won’t know if he’s being taken care of properly. anyways, i guess i’m just scared because i’m waiting for the inevitable. and once it happens and he’s gone, i feel like i’ll be completely lost. i have plans to go back to school this year with a scholarship that i can only get if i’m enrolled in 2019 but i don’t know if i’ll be able to because no one will be with my grandpa while i’m at school and my brothers are at work. our mother is the only other available person that would be able to be with him and (somewhat) understands his needs but she is very unreliable with her untreated schizophrenia and narcissistic personality and just lack of actual care for her father. i know that taking care of him isn’t my sole responsibility but it feels like it is sometimes and it gets very overwhelming."," may i ask if there have been any updates in your situation? i came across this post today and couldn't scroll past- i'm 22m (and have been care giving since 18), so my  heart truly goes out to you, in every way. this is no easy space to navigate, even through the beauty that comes with getting deeply engrafted into the life of the person you're caring for.  i'd really love to hear more about your story, please feel free to message me, if you'd be apt to share/if you want the space to share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dqdmrz/caregiver_at_18/,,caregiver at 18
"my mom turns 93 today. i remodeled my walkout basement into a beautiful apartment for her, fully decked out with kitchen, bathroom, laundry room, living room and bedroom.  she moved in 5 months ago.  she is still recovering from that trauma. she gave up unpacking boxes months ago. she gets around with a walker, cares for her small dog, uses an ipad for facebook and email and grocery shopping from walmart. she has no dementia  but a (mechanically) sound mind.  still she struggles to maintain focus long enough to complete things. she has full vision in one eye, the other is 99% blind.  she suffers a lot of arthritic pain.  this is her greatest difficulty.  it’s caused her fitness to deteriorate to where she cannot participate in life. cannot or _will_ not, or both.  she sits in front of the tv and plays solitaire on the ipad.  she is really not in bad shape compared to many of the stories. my exasperation stems from the fact that she refuses to engage!  she doesn’t participate in the day-to-day activities of simple things, like involving herself in a phone call long enough to tell me about it afterward.  or upon seeing that she has no clean silverware to eat with, running the dishwasher.  her days are spent in a hazy daydream reliving old memories but without actively engaging in the life she has before her, which she clearly has the mental capacity for. and she doesn’t see why i get so exasperated.  what’s my problem?  why does it bother me?  why do i insist that she toss out the old catalogs.  just because the new ones arrive by the dozen every day in the mail!“don’t worry about it now.  we can do it later,” she says, about almost everything. life is too difficult. later. and everything she puts off becomes my next chore.  thank god my wife loves her too, and works to help her feel comfortable.  i’m not in it alone.  tl;dr: my 93 yo mom is mentally capable but refuses to participate in what little life she has left.  “use it or lose it”, the saying goes, and she’s not using hers.   - is she safe?  - does she feel safe?  - does she feel loved?all i must do for her is help answer those three questions positively.  my challenge is to be content with that.", have you talked to her doctor about depression?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dp4bez/alive_but_not_living/,,Alive but not living

"my grandmother has dementia, but has no diagnosis. for the last year that we've been caring for her, we've been pushing my family to get these appointments made so we can get a diagnosis. she was supposed to have this appointment two weeks ago, but the doctor's called hours before the scheduled phone appointment(which we were planning to be on) and changed all of her appointments. the big appointment is finally happening next thursday, my uncle will be taking her. however, yesterday she was supposed to have physical therapy for her arm pain and she tried to cancel it, but couldn't figure out how to get in touch with the office. instead she scheduled an appointment with her accountant, because she forgot my husband already finished her taxes for her. my uncle came to take her to physical therapy, but she made him take her to the accountant instead. as the big appointment approaches, she's been rebelling against care. when my husband goes in to cook dinner she says she's already eaten, which may or may not be true. she often heats up food in the microwave and forgets about it, we see food left on the counter, but we don't know if she's actually eating it. we're trying to keep her from driving, but she slipped out in her car the other day to buy groceries. there hasn't been an incident yet but my husband and i are just waiting for something to happen. i don't know what to do about these appointments. the doctor's know we're supposed to be on every call, but that doesn't mean they follow through. we don't have any power, we just live with her and we're financially stuck here because we can't afford to move out. if she decides she doesn't want us here anymore, we'll be homeless so we are terrified of pushing her too much. has anyone experienced this before? what do you do? my uncle has just advised my husband to sit by the phone in case the doctor's office call, so he can answer before she does. my husband is home all day because caretaking now takes up too much time for him to work or look for work (which is why we can't get out)."," i've been going through the not eating thing too, my parents are underweight.doctor explained that when you get elderly, the hormone that controls hunger can stop working properly. so even though they should be hungry, the brain isn't sending them that signal. which is both interesting and scary.our solution is to make a big plate of cheese, crackers, olives, nuts, stuff like that in the morning and leave it out...easy to just grab and eat. there's some waste at the end of the day, but they are eating it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/dkoh7r/grandma_changing_and_cancelling_appointments/,,Grandma changing and cancelling appointments

"apologies that this may be a long-winded post, but i’d like to get the details out if anyone can answer my questions.my maternal grandmother (85 y.o.) is currently beginning to exhibit what may be the earlier stages of dementia (short term memory loss, repeating things, anger over forgetting things) or possibly just old age. she still lives on her own (2 doors down from the house my dad and i live in), and is able to get through her chores, errands, caring for her cat, etc. as long as it isn’t something out of routine. physically, she’s as healthy as horse, still walks avidly, exercises, etc. mentally/emotionally, she isn’t so good. she’s been getting progressively more and more depressed (but in a mood-swings kinda way---some days she’s just a jolly, silly person). her husband died about 8 years ago, and my mother began looking after her (finances etc) after that. my grandma can be a stubborn, victim-mentality, hurtful person, and i watched her drive my mother into pretty regular binge drinking. this all came to a head when my mother suddenly died of cancer 2 years ago. the looking-after my grandmother fell upon me and my dad. the major issue we’re struggling with right now is how to manage her finances, especially the living trust. my mother had a good sense of the various accounts in which her money was located – but none of this information was transmitted to us before she passed. and my grandmother is 100% oblivious, as my grandpa took care of all the finances. so at this point, my dad and i are completely clueless as to the extent of her financial holdings. this is especially troubling given her mental decline – if she were to need some sort of specialized care, we would need to know where to pull the resources from. i am the executor of her/my grandpa’s living trust, but have no idea where to begin on collecting this information. many of you may suggest securing power of attorney. well… any conversation regarding my grandma’s end-of-life financial needs is either blown off, ignored, or met with hysterics and circular thinking. she carries this paranoia that we are out to take money away from her. i’ve attempted to have a calm, logical conversation with her about this several times, but the result is the same – dead end and increased paranoia/hysterics. we’re just really concerned that there is going to be no way to support her if she ever needs advanced care (and convincing her of this will be another struggle in itself).i’m currently trying to set up an appointment with the attorney of the living trust, in hopes of getting some kind of overview on the things i need to find out. can anyone share their experience on how to possibly deal with this legally / financially / interpersonally?much appreciated 😊 tldr: grandma's losing her mental capacity. dad and i have no concept of her financial holdings. will need to be able to provide for her care. she is uncooperative and paranoid. help!"," my grandparents had a living trust and i was the successor trustee and executrix of their estate. do you have the trust documents? it should tell you the attorney who set it up and my grandparents included the financial institution. my grandparents was set up at a bank with a trust department and they invested the money on their behalf.  the trust department was great and helped my grandmother manage her money and pay her bills. they helped me a lot and if your grandparents is set up similarly would be a great resource. do you have access to her mail? she should be receiving statements. i would also call the attorney who wrote the trust document. they should be able to ensure you have the most up to date version of any documents such as trust, power of attorney, medical proxy (if done). it sounds like your grandma is past the point of being able to sign legal documents but the attorney can advise you on that. you might need to file for guardianship, this will require that her dr declare her incapable of making her own decisions. i have never had to do that so i can’t provide any information on the process. did your mom file her taxes for her? if you have a copy of her tax return that can give you some idea of what she has for investments and any money she has coming in. i am happy to answer any questions you have based on my experience.edit: sorry i missed that you know the attorney and are going to meet with them, that is the best first step. i also use a financial advisor for my mom. they are worth every penny in helping reduce my stress and make life easier.  i brought them lots of random documents from various banks, stocks, and annuities and they did all the research for me and now manage all the accounts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/d5652x/how_to_help_an_uncooperative_grandma/,,How to help an uncooperative Grandma?

"hello, i’m a 19 year old female and i take care of my 76 year old grandfather with alzheimer’s monday-thurs from 7am-6pm while my mom is at work. i also help her with him when she gets home and watch him on the weekends while runs errands, wants to go out, or take my little sister to the pool, etc. my grandfather was kicked out of his house by his wife, who knew he had the disease but got mad he didn’t take his medicine so the two of my aunts had him at their house for a few days but said she can’t take care of him because they both are sickly or whatever that means. something is always wrong with them. they pressured my mom into taking him so she did. this is was in early january. since i was not in school or working at the time she took him in, i guess that meant i was going to be the one to start taking care of him while i was already watching my 4 year old sister monday-fri. i thought my mom would eventually put him in a nursing home and i’d be able to find a job and be in enrolled in some college courses by now but it’s been eight months of no progress. in these past eight months, he’s wandered out of the house four times, two of them being when he was with me because i overslept and cops had to be called. social workers then of course have to get involved and i almost got charged with elderly abuse. i talked with one of the social workers who came to my house and she told me they took my name off the and put my moms on it instead case because she would ignore their calls when it happened the first time. this angered my mom and we got into an argument about it because she thinks i’m being selfish for not caring that she could go to jail for elderly abuse when i was the one who was here when he left. i do care and i would hate to see her be charged. i cried and cried that day because i felt so guilty but i didn’t ask for her to put all of this on me. i can barely talk to the man because there’s a language barrier, he can’t feed himself, can’t walk, and is incompetent now. every time i mentioned how i felt alone to her and how taking care of him and staying inside the house all day was taking a toll on me, she just stayed silent or told me we wouldn’t be able to live if it was for him. i honestly think she doesn’t want to put him in a nursing home so she can keep his social security check to and his savings to pay bills that she says she can’t pay now even though she was before he moved in. i’m tired, i feel depressed, worthless, alone, and i’m starting to have some suicidal thoughts but i feel guilty for feeling that way because of my mom so i try to ignore them but i can’t anymore. all she does is make me feel bad about not wanting to take care of him anymore and wanting to focus on improving my mental health which i’ve already had problems with before him moving in. i don’t have anyone to talk to about it and i’m afraid i’ll just be told i’m being ungrateful since she feeds me and buys me clothes and maybe i am but i want to be in school, i want to work, and i want to have a social life, i want to feel alive. this is too much for me and i feel like i’m trapped in a dark hole. me and my mom got into another argument yesterday and i cried for hours until i fell asleep, woke up and cried again. i’m thinking about leaving and moving in with my grandma because i can’t take this much longer. caregiving has ruined me."," another update: i got a weekend job and i’m most likely starting school in january too! of course, when i told my mom that i had applied to the job she was was saying stuff like “is it really worth it?” and “i don’t think you should be working”. to me it is, i get three days out of the house and i get a little money to myself..the day of my interview she was already complaining about having to take me to work to when it’s not even a 10 minute drive.  now that i’ll have a little money i’m going to try and save for a car.  now as for my grandpa, he’s been on the waking up in the early morning, getting out of his bed, dirtying up the house, leaving pooped in diapers everywhere, turning every single light on, and one morning he left the sink water running while i was sleeping and flooded the kitchen. i need to fix my sleeping schedule, i’ve been waking up later than he does so i guess it is partly my fault for not being awake when he’s doing all of that but it’s still stressful. every morning i just clean, clean, clean and then my mom gets home and let’s my 4 year old sister dirty it up some more and leaves meto clean it the next day. i’m honestly just starting to feel like a personal maid. apparently, she’s going to puerto rico too next month and leaving me with him for five days, two of those days being days i work. i told her it was wrong of her to assume it would be alright and not ask and she got mad..said it was no different from me watching him while he’s at work. she’s saying my uncle is going to come help but he has to work. i just think it’s messed up. still no progress on the home health aide either. she doesn’t want to pay for it even though he gets a $800 social security check and has his savings which is a decent amount. every time i mention the home health aide she says “and who’s going to pay for that?”. somehow she can pay for a trip to puerto rico and california with his money but not assistance for him. i don’t know what her deal is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cy1tih/19_year_old_caregiver_for_grandparentmy_world_is/,,19 year old caregiver for grandparent...my world is falling apart and mom is stressing me out.
"im not exactly a caregiver as in living with my dad but i do take care of him remotely and when i'm there. my dad is 73 and is struggling with memory loss, poor self esteem, lack of control over emotions, lack of purpose, and loneliness. he's been diagnosed late is life with adult adhd but is very much against medications and very resistant to counselling. he loses his wallet, keys, and personal calendar almost daily and sometimes has to get a new wallet with all the new cards because he can never find it. he says it's been getting worse and his memory has been getting worse. i'm afraid he's getting dementia but it could also be adhd too although he's never sought further diagnosis or treatment. he just gets so down on himself and his disorganization and i notice how he's constantly putting himself down or being negative. i just feel so so heartbroken for him to be living his days like this.i recently moved for a job 3 hours away so i try to call often and give him tips or just listen to him tell me about what he lost today and how he's looked everywhere but everything is a mess. i've helped him clean up his mess of a basement and kitchen multiple times but he just has a main issue with lack of mindfulness and too much clutter. he's very concerned and hopeless about his life but he's also resistant to getting professional help so idk what to do. i just want him to be happy and not so hard on himself most of his days. btw, he wants to learn how to use the computer or phone but also is afraid and will often take hours to learn the basics only to forget it soon after. i once helped him buy glasses online and he spent eight hours only to have the wrong prescription sent. ugh i just feel so bad for him!!can anyone offer encouragement or tips?"," you'll need to carve out time to go with him to his doctor's appointments. it sounds like mild cognitive impairment, or he might be slipping into the first stages of dementia. i don't think the adhd is a factor here, this sounds like a memory and organizational loss issue. you can ask for a neuro cognitive assessment by neurologist, which will give you some insight about what you're dealing with. however, since he's resistant to meds, then chances are he won't take the medication offered. still, it's not a bad place to start.that he's resistant to taking medications makes all of this much harder!  i took care of someone just like this. it was a series of dwindling abilities, and things went down for her rather quickly. she and her family chose to move her into assisted living with a hired caregiver who comes in 3 afternoons a week.  she will probably be moved into memory care soon.you can ask the doctor for a referral to home health (covered by medicare), which will send out a nurse to visit weekly, as well as a social worker to do an intake at the beginning. however, home health won't cover the other parts of what he needs, which is housekeeping, errand running, and keeping his calendar up to date, as well as providing meals.  that part will be out of pocket, and on average, will cost anywhere from $15 - $25 and hour, with the $25 usually being from a caregiving agency.he might be resistant to either the caregiver help, or moving into assisted living or memory care in part because he's afraid that he doesn't have the money. so now is a good time to delve into his finances, and learn about his assets. i highly recommend working with a financial planner, if you feel you might need the help. chances are, if he owns his house, it's also his biggest asset. you might point out to him that staying where he is over the long run is problematic because of the challenge and expense of maintaining the house as his mental faculties are slipping. offer to bring him up to where you live, and go look at a few places, as well as finding out who the best doctors would be, and see how he can change his medicare providers.see if there's enough money to move him first, then sell the house once he gets settled. find a place near you. it'll make your life a lot easier if he's close by.  see if there's a senior housing specialist -someone who knows all the facilities and can help you match his needs and assets to the right place.good luck!  i know this is hard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cx9uu7/resources_and_emcouragemt_needed_for_dad_with_adhd/,,Resources and Emcouragemt Needed for Dad with ADHD

(pt is late or doesn’t come at all...  i don’t really understand how any of that can even happen but it has been.)are there any awesome resources you all can direct me to?  how to cope, what’s the right thing to do, should i get licensed in something so the dr can discharge him to me eventually?  we’re just really struggling to do the right thing for my fil and also follow the doctors orders."," check with his insurance to see if there’s another home rehab place that they contract with. i had to do that for my grandma because the therapist ignored her limitations until her legs buckled during a session. once you find that out check with whoever sent the referral for therapy to see if they can send it to whoever you chose. otherwise, you can try contacting the home rehab to see why the therapist never seems to show at the agreed upon time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cibcqu/looking_for_advice_on_pt_with_dementia/,,Looking for advice on PT with dementia.

"i am not a caregiver currently, but i have an ageing relative i believe is in the early stages of dementia, and they have no other reliable close support, so i can clearly see the writing on the wall that caring for her is in my not-too-distant future.  i have a very complicated family, with lots of estrangements and unaddressed resentments. i was raised by my grandparents, and their children have always resented me. my grandparents had a very toxic abusive and controlling relationship and separated badly. my husband and i were left to take care of my grandfather during a bad injury after a fall several years ago, because his children didn’t even care if he was alive (before you condemn them completely, he was terribly abusive and controlling) he inevitably turned that abusiveness on us, and began trying to cause problems in my marriage, in my relationship with my grandmother, and caring for him destroyed me emotionally. by the time he cut me out of his life  (once he didn’t need me to care for him anymore, of course) for refusing to break off my relationships, i was a wreck. during his last illness and his death, one of his children took over everything and basically blew up the family controlling information, visitation, and attendance at his funeral. they looted his property while he lay dying, and continued to steal from the estate and to stall proceedings to rob their sibling of their share, dragging it out for years while everyone else watched in horror.i know i’m in for a hell of a fight trying to get my grandmother properly cared for and i am scared to death to go through this again. i’m starting to see signs of her slipping cognitively and i’m nowhere near ready to go through this again."," i’m glad she’s still taking care of herself. this sounds like where my grandmother was several years ago. you are right realistically it’s not going to get any better. it can be super frustrating having to explain things over and over again, but, for me, it was worth all the frustration when she had her lucid moments. again i am so sorry that you and your grandmother are going through this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cg87tl/new_to_this_scared_to_death/,,"New to this, scared to death."

"hey, i'm looking for some ideas to help motivate/encourage a client of mine to stick to her shower schedule. quick backstory: i'm a behavior consultant, and i work on developing person centered behavior plans for staff to implement in their interactions with clients. my clients often have dementia, traumatic brain injuries, or other neurodegenerative disorders, so they often aren't competent or capable of being held accountable to their behavior, so we turn to how care staff interact with them to lessen unwanted behavior. &amp;#x200b;so i currently have a client that has a bathing schedule during the week, but she will often decline the assistance of her caregivers during her scheduled time slot. she is in a minimal assistance apartment complex, and care staff only help with bathing during the early part of that day. she will ask for help later on according to her own schedule, but the staff are often busy and unavailable to help (only two staff on shift at a time). when they can't help, she reports to her pcp that her caregivers are not showing up for her scheduled shower times, even though this isn't true. staff aren't sure why she declines her scheduled showers, but they believe it is an attempt to gain control and/or make them look bad to her pcp when she reports ""staff aren't doing their job."" i'm looking for any tips or ways you guys have found useful for encouraging your clients/residents you care for to shower. generally this will need to be something staff can implement and encourage. no punishment such as withdraw of any activity or service can be used because we focus on positive reinforcement only."," pcp=person centered plan, correct? if that’s true, then the person you are supporting should be the one deciding their shower schedule. think about it this way: you and i are both able to shower when we please. some days we might want a morning shower, some days we might want an evening shower, some days we might way both or neither. but we have the ability to decide and everyone has a different preference.this is an example of fitting the person to the plan, not the plan to the person. from my perspective, the best solution would be to adjust staffing to this individual’s goals and hygiene preferences, even if that makes it more challenging for you.in the field, it’s not about making staffing easy, it’s about enhancing the person’s life and supporting them how they would like to be supported.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cbxp6y/help_motivating_client_to_shower/,,Help motivating client to shower

"last september, my grandma was living in a care facility. the place should have been closed down, it was terrible. she deteriorated so rapidly, i fought and fought for her to come home. i said i would stay with her. we finally got her home and i have been caring for her 5 days a week since then. i feel blessed for each and every moment. it has been hard. i cried myself to sleep, praying for god to take her many, many times. i’m telling you this part for those of you that are struggling. there is an end. and now that i’m here, i wouldn’t change the last 8 months of my life for anything. i had to leave my husband and son during that time. it was so hard for all of us, but we got through it, having learned such valuable lessons along the way. at around 2 am on wednesday, i awoke to her breathing differently. i knew instantly it was the “death rattle” i had read about. i will tell you right now, for those who haven’t heard it, it was terrifying. our hospice nurse and i had talked about it before but i don’t think she did a very good job preparing me for what it was like. thankfully, by around 10am, we had given her some levsin and it’s been under control since then. everything else, however, is very hard to watch. she is breathing like she’s on a machine. just mechanical almost. we have to do all the things to keep her comfortable; eye drops, pain meds, lorazepam, moving her, etc. she has dementia and i didn’t think anything would be harder than seeing her during her fits, but this is. this is hard. not knowing what she’s thinking. not knowing if she’s hot or cold (she has been fluctuating between high fever and clammy). not knowing if she wants to tell us something. she is in a coma. some might say none of that applies but i just wonder, what if? my sisters and mom are here with me. my grandma is 96 but has more friends than i do😂. she has many visitors talking to her and telling her how much we all love her. but seeing her like this is almost more than i can handle. does it get worse? does she just slip away peacefully? does the (god forbid) death rattle come back despite medication? i’m terrified for what’s to come but also anxious for it to be over so she can finally rest. the last few months have been so hard for her. i’ve done so much research about death these last few months and feel like i’m so inadequately prepared."," it's been just over a week since you posted this. i'm hoping that whatever has happened since then, you're handling ok. my grandpa had to go to the er after he had a hard time speaking and fell. we thought stroke. turns out he had stage 4 brain cancer (9 lesions) and lung cancer. he was in the hospital for a few days, elected to have brain surgery to remove the largest tumor that was affecting most of his function loss. from there he went to rehab for 2 weeks to regain some skills while he waited to heal long enough to get radiation. the whole time he kept saying he wanted to go home. the day he got out of rehab, he went to my parents' house. the whole family was there, he had a home cooked meal, he played with the dog and we watched his favorite show. i believe he was where he wanted to be and was tired of being a burden to us. he went to bed that night, slept almost the whole next day except to eat, and the second morning after he was unresponsive. he entered hospice comatose and remained that way for 5 days until his death. i had never had any family members pass, let alone been there for it. but on the last day, there was a feeling that we all knew. i stayed despite only being there to bring my grandma dinner and leave. my mom drove back up around midnight. he passed around 1:05 am. some of the things we saw that clued us in: he developed a foot and eye twitch. his lips turned purple and began to curl under his teeth. his hands and feet were much colder. and his breath had a distinctly raspier sound, with more pauses. about 12:15 my grandma called the nurse because his breathing was slow and shallow. the nurse told us his breathing had moved from his diaphragm to his chest, usually an end stage indicator. she gave him more morphine, ativan and halidol ahead of schedule and told us that how he responded would be our biggest clue of what would happen. within 30 minutes, his breathing had gotten slower and slower with more pauses. his last few dozen breaths were very shallow and spaced further apart. and then the next one just never came. i have deep empathy for you. it's so hard i still don't fully comprehend what happened myself. but at least we felt it was very comfortable for him, as much as could be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/bvdxlx/my_grandma_is_dying_and_i_just_need_to_talk_to/,,My grandma is dying and I just need to talk to some strangers about it.

"at the moment, i have to live with my grandma.  it's actually kind of interesting getting to know her, since she is a spunky and outspoken.  growing up, my mom always felt she was slighting her, so i always thought of her as being mean.  and apparently she has grown a lot over the years.  i think she's only known work, and has not fully developed into herself.  she grew up on a farm, and her and her sisters always worked and had to work fast (she used to always rush things.  i think around me, she learned to slow down.)  anyway, she has some quirky behavior, and i think if she had a family that valued education and were a bit more socially developed, that would have been good for her.  anyway, it's just interesting to get to know her.  &amp;#x200b;the only thing that really bothers me about her is that she always randomly calls me to tell me something or ask me to do something, and it can be kind of rude and random.  for example, she used to always ask me for water, or she would ask me to turn off her fan.  that was in the past when i lived with her over the summer a few years ago, and i'd have to walk from my room to the living room (or even her bedroom!).  recently, just tonight, she asked me within 30 minutes to turn on her oxygen, and then i went to lay back down and about 10-15 minutes, she called me to ask if i watch comedy central and tried to strike a conversation with me.  this is all at completely random times.  i feel like i am always getting up to do something.  i can recall her roommate, an older woman her age, annoyingly say, ""what?"" when she yelled her name once.  my mom said when she was a kid, my grandma always asked her to get things for her and would forget to tell her things, so every few minutes or so she would ask her again to get something.  now that i think about it, and am getting to know her, maybe she felt she would be annoying and ask too much to get her everything as once.  anyway, it still is annoying.  i don't mind helping her, but how can i get to understand that she has stop randomly calling me for things?&amp;#x200b;come to think of it, the other thing that gets on my nerves is she turns the tv up really loud or talks really loud (right now she is laughing loudly in her room).  it's like i can't ever focus.  so any advice on how to ask her to turn it down would be nice.  i usually turn the tv down for her when she leaves the room for 20-30 minutes at a time.  i know it sounds like she has dementia, but she doesn't.  i think she sort just has been deprived of attention or something, and it showing in older age.  it's actually quite funny when i think of it, even as i write this now!  &amp;#x200b;finally, sometimes she'll ask me to do bigger things, like mow the lawn or help in her back porch, and i don't mind helping her, but not just randomly, out of the blue, when i am doing something.  so, i solved that problem by saying, ""let me look at my calendar and i will pencil it in.""  she gets the hint, thankfully.  &amp;#x200b;the good thing about her, it seems, is that she will respect you once you say something, but i don't want to seem too pushy.  it's like she's not quite getting it.  but, i would just like to be able to read or do something for hours at a time without being interrupted."," thank you for posting your advice request! please do your best to respond to commenters, as they take the time and effort to read your post and give you advice. they want to hear back from you!if a commenter provides advice that is helpful, please respond to the comment with the word **""helped""** anywhere in your comment. this will give the commenter an advice point, which will show that the commenter is a helpful member of this subreddit.you can respond to as many comments as you want, and we encourage it if they help you, even a little bit. ## [**see here for more details**](     *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bu93bc/advice_on_my_grandma/,,Advice on my Grandma
"on mobile, english is my native language. this story is about a close friend and i'm only tied to the story because i'm friends with both parties. i can only relay my male friend's side since the female friend's story change a few times that i can't accurately read her intentions. fake names will be used.henry has been best friends with amber for almost 10 years. they went to high school not together but around the same time. henry started college and got a house by the time amber was finishing high school. they went to the same college together and due to roommate problems opted to live together since they knew each other for so long.henry already graduated before amber and he's been helping her with classes, jobs and her vehicle until she graduated. since then she's been through a few shitty boyfriends and henry would just help her through them.henry knows amber enough to know that as soon as another guy comes around there would be problems. he practically saw her as a sister until some feelings developed after a few years. every time amber gets a new boyfriend, she'll alienate henry. (self-fulfilling prophecy) so he'd hang out with other friends. until she gets sick of her boyfriend and eventually comes back to hang out with him. amber is a home body and shy, so she'll only wants to stay home, watch netflix and can be hard to be around. (i met her through henry.) henry likes to go out and see people and do things so being her best friend, he'll ask amber to come along. she would always complain but enjoy the experience but would turn around and use it as an excuse to hate him for taking her out the house.their relationship got rocky when amber moved in with a boyfriend and force henry to move back home. (they live in the same town).henry helped his parents take care of his grandmother with alzheimer’s up til she died. amber breaks up with her ex and moves back home too. she tries to apply for jobs but gives up once she gets any rejection. (i understand that. it took me almost 2 years to even get a decent job in my field) they still hang out and even moved back in together but it's obvious that she's depressed and starts to blame henry for her problems.henry liked her for a while but knew she didn't see him more than that until she started showing signs that she liked him back. (even sleeping with each other) everything seemed mutual for them until henry met some new friends and introduced them to amber. she starts to have feelings for keith (one of the new friends) but lies to henry when he asked her for the truth. he's used to keeping creeps off her when they go to bars so he wanted to her safe knowing her history. i must mention that amber has slept with many of henry’s friends and ruined their relationships with them. not to be mean, but amber has used henry as a dick wrangler. his friendship circle has gotten smaller after meeting her.keith is younger than amber by a few years so he’s more interested in just sex than anything else. so keith and amber hit it off, but didn’t bother to tell henry anything. if amber had told henry about her and keith he would have moved out and left her to do her thing.the problem is amber didn’t do that. henry didn’t know about their affection for each other and just wanted to keep his friendship with the new people. keith’s best friend eventually tells henry that keith was dating another girl and didn’t bother to tell amber that she was the side piece. henry tells amber the truth (he’s her best friend and didn’t want her to get hurt again) so amber freaked out and seemed to believe him. the next day, henry went to work and was making plans with her to do something during the weekend until amber stops talking to him. when henry gets home, an argument happened.keith then eggs amber on about kicking henry out and it happens.i must mention that henry and amber were telling people that they were in a relationship, to get rid of creeps. once the argument started amber says that she could use the lie that they were dating to get people she didn’t like to leave her alone but henry couldn’t.after that henry leaves her alone and finds a new place. knowing amber enough to just give her what she wanted, which was to be away from henry. the only problem is that amber is trying to force me (op) to choose who i was going to hang out with. to be honest, if it wasn’t for henry, amber and i wouldn’t have anything to talk about other than watching netflix or youtube at her place. she doesn’t visit me and i go out of my way to meet her. i’m the only one that make plans to see her and i can’t invite henry since he knows her enough to get her talking but without him there, we have nothing to say.it’s been almost a year since the incident and henry holds no ill will. amber is openly dating keith but continues to blame henry for “taking her friend away.” all because i invited like 10 people including both henry and amber to an event which i know they want to go to. yet amber gave me an ultimatum, if henry goes, she’s out. i’m getting tired of being in the middle of this. henry is convincing me to stay her friend since i’m all she has left in her friend group other than her boyfriend and his best friend.i need some help figuring out who’s the asshole is this situation. it’s not getting any better, and someone is going to miss out on fun stuff because of a confusing situation. what should i do?"," thank you for posting your advice request! please do your best to respond to commenters, as they take the time and effort to read your post and give you advice. they want to hear back from you!if a commenter provides advice that is helpful, please respond to the comment with the word **""helped""** anywhere in your comment. this will give the commenter an advice point, which will show that the commenter is a helpful member of this subreddit.you can respond to as many comments as you want, and we encourage it if they help you, even a little bit. ## [**see here for more details**](     *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/advice) if you have any questions or concerns.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bu90xc/best_friend_at_ends_and_op_is_stuck_in_the_middle/,,Best friend at ends and OP is stuck in the middle
"hey all, this is my first post here, so please excuse how long this is. i am 24 years old and my mother is the primary caregiver for my 84 year old grandmother who has pretty severe dementia. my grandmother lives with my mother and father full time. she's lived with my parents for about 2 and 1/2 years. before that, she still lived in her home with my mom and i rotating nights staying with her. we did that for about a year and a half until we were both totally burnt out. for context, i also have two older brothers who are married with kids. i'm my parents only daughter. i'm married, but without kids, so i try to help my mom wherever i can with her caregiver responsibilities (drs. appointments, ""babysitting"" for date nights/vacations, etc.). my mom and i have always had a pretty close relationship, but it is starting to feel pretty strained lately. my mother is not in great physical health and hasn't been for quite some time. she is 63 years old, overweight and a heavy smoker. she is starting to have a hard time with mobility and having some pretty serious breathing problems. it's no secret why she is having these issues, with being overweight and a heavy smoker. we have a family business that we all work for and yesterday she was in such bad shape as far as breathing that she couldn't come into work. she was wheezing and gasping for air to the point that she couldn't walk more than a few feet. i feel like i have tried everything to try to get her to better physical health. i've offered to go on walks with her, help her with meal planning and give her advice on quitting smoking. i so badly want her to start taking care of herself better, but my mother is extremely strong willed and stubborn. last month, i ended up having to take her to the er because of extremely high blood pressure, like stroke territory high. she didn't tell me until we were at the er that the reason that her blood pressure was so high was because she hadn't gotten a refill on one of her blood pressure medications. she knew all along that that was what was going on, but didn't tell anyone in the family until i was in the er with her. i know that taking care of my grandmother has left my mom feeling extremely burnt out and that she is no longer taking care of herself because of it. after the er event, i told her that she needed to get to a gp immediately to get her bp medication figured out and to see about possibly taking medication for depression. i know that everyone is different, but we have a family history of depression (i take an ssri myself) and i felt like she should talk to her gp about her own mental health. the gp said that she sounded like she was dealing with caregiver burn out and prescribed her welbutrin; my mom told me that she would most definitely take it. last week i found out that she hasn't taken a single pill. with the pulmonary issues she was having yesterday, i told her that she needed to get in to see someone asap. i ended up having to call around today to try to get her an appointment because she said that she would ""call sometime next week"". everyone in our family is trying so hard to support her and help her, but she refuses help. my sil and i have offered so many times to take my grandmother for an evening during the week or for a weekend. we've suggested that she hire in home help a couple of days a week to help take some of the burden off of her but she refuses (and it isn't a money issue, my parents are fairly well off). because my mom is so burnt out, she is barely able to take care of her physical and mental health anymore. i am just so frustrated and at a loss because i don't know what to do anymore. i love her and she is my mother, and this may be terrible to say, but i am having a hard time being sympathetic to her anymore. she complains all the time, but doesn't take any of the help that is offered or bothers to help herself. her issues are starting to weigh on me and the rest of the family. i thought i would post here because i don't have the perspective of a fulltime caregiver. it is such a damn hard job, and i frankly don't have that life experience yet. members who are caregivers, what kind of help/support would you want in this situation? does anyone have any advice for how to help care for a caregiver?"," this is a really tough situation, when the caregiver is in denial about having pushed herself to the breaking point and seems to be committed to pushing even further.without knowing too much about your family, is it possible your mother (in spite of evidence to the contrary) is convinced that she’s the only one who can do it? is it possible that in some way she’s internalized her caregiver role to the point that she doesn’t know how else or who else to be? sometimes caregivers have codependency issues. that would be something i’d might read up on to see if it applies here (and maybe it doesn’t).in the meantime can you and your other family members sit down with your mother and share your concerns with her? it’ll be harder for her to dismiss all of you as a group. i’d ask her something like “mom, you know we’re all prepared to help [on these days with these specific tasks]...is there something that would make you comfortable enough to let us start? can we at least agree to doing this for one month and see how it goes?”i’m sorry, i know it’s so hard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/bp1brr/being_a_caregiver_for_a_caregiver/,,Being a Caregiver for a Caregiver

"hi,  i'm a newcomer so i apologize if i'm breaking any rules...i just need help. anything. i've been essentially been working and taking care of my grandma and mother. i was kicked out of the house by my grandmother due to her aging/dementia. i don't know....she refuses to ever go to the doctors to get diagnosed.  the house is hers, so we don't really have a say. i financially provided for my mother and my mother took care of my grandma. about a year ago, i almost lost my mom to an aneurysm; she survived. but as you know, she never came back herself. fallen further into depression, especially with now this numbness on her entire right side. i eventually quit my job was the commute total was 4 hours a day full time and just dedicated the past year to taking care of my mother.  we don't really have a good family so there's no help financially or emotionally. my grandma cannot take care of herself, but refuses help. she's very violent, and calls the cops to kick my mom out, but the police usually reject it cause...well my mom takes care of her. but since the aneurysm, she can't even take care of herself fully.  i had gotten her some ssi benefit, but now they are taking that away cause my mom saved the money. we proved now it was under the required limit and had 2 meetings. the guy at the ssi office said we were good now and we worked out a new payment plan; but a week letter, everything we talked about was not reflected in this letter and he reported something else.  this is a very brief gist of the situation and here's my question (if anybody is able to help).  we are in southern california, my grandma is violent, dirty, depressed, and unable to properly take care of herself. my mother lives there and is now disabled.  how can i get support for my mom and grandma. we've talked to social workers and they never followed through. forgive me if i don't have enough info or if this isn't the right type of post for this sub. but i'm pretty desperate for help.  i don't work anymore...it's been hard getting a job, but i worked hard on getting that ssi benefit for my mom and they're taking that away. i've been doing this for almost a decade since i was younger but without money or support from friends or family. i feel so alone and lost, and i know my mother feels worse. especially since she cannot even speak properly anymore from the brain aneurysm   if anyone can just point me in right direction to find a way to get my mom a safe environment, or just get help for my grandma, so my mom can be in peace for once.  i don't have money so i pretty much don't eat alot, unemployment denied me. i'm not even in my 30s, but i feel like i'm stuck. at this point, i don't care what happens to me, but if i can just get my mom the help she needs and my grandma; i'd be okay.   sorry it was long, but thanks to anyone to read this."," have you called the area on aging in your location? they can probably give you some ideas. they may also be able to make sure you all are getting all of the funding programs that you can. there’s also aps (adult protective services). they are a government agency. they will send someone out to see your grandmother, how she looks, acts, her house, if she can take care of herself, if there is someone else that can take care of her, if there is food in the house, etc.  if you go this route, do not clean everything up before they come. let them see how things actually are. in fact, maybe don’t tell anyone they’re coming. ask them to keep your name confidential. they may remove your grandmother from the house and take her to a nursing home. or they may send in some aides to help her. between these two agencies, i hope you can get some help. they may also connect you to some other agencies. i hope you get some help soon. until then, if it was me, i would go back to the house and stay anyway. what’s she going to do?  good luck, hun.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/bcj226/i_need_advice_or_help_with_disabled_mom_and/,,I need advice or help with disabled mom and mentally ill grandmothter

"my mother hasn’t left the house in 3 years. she was diagnosed with bipolar twenty years ago, in and out of psych wards until about 8 years ago when the immediate family got a court order to have her committed. it was a complete failure. she was there a few weeks, sent home with medication and immediately stopped taking it. she had left the house a few times after that but not leaving the property. the last 3 years not even a foot outside.  she is clearly schizophrenic as her mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the seventies and a schizoaffective diagnosis in the family recently.we haven’t tried interjecting for a few reasons.me and my sister both deal with mental illness and understand the awful toll it can take, especially when being held against your will and forced into treatment in a sometimes traumatizing environment.after the shit attempt at getting her help short term to help herself long term, we did not want to put her in that situation again since she is clearly separated enough from reality to where she has almost dementia-like symptoms and the schizophrenia is dominant over any prior bipolar diagnosis.this is a very shaky situation in that although she is in a very safe and stress free environment and taken care of extremely well, her husband is much older and can’t keep up with her constant psychological issues and needs. her physical health seems to be okay but her once perfect teeth are not. i’ve just learned that she is having some difficulty with incontinence and she may be hiding or unaware of worsening conditions like dementia. we have our own lives and do the best we can but enabling her is necessary and likely permanent. that’s okay but she needs to meet us halfway with her physical health and medication and that’s where the problem lies. she is not on disability although she was offered years ago but declined help. she is eligible for ss in two years but i’m not sure how long this  situation can hold in its current state. it’s  probable if we have her committed again the outcome will be disastrous or at the least, worse.is there a place that can help? i’ve talked about this in therapy and it seems if she were being neglected or abused then legally people would get involved but that is far from the case. my sister and i try to get together sometimes to form a plan. we usually give up from lack of information and emotional exhaustion so any help would be appreciated.", whoops. wrong post i think.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/b8bqre/looking_for_help_on_what_to_do_for/,,Looking for help on what to do for schizoaffective mother
"this is the first time posting here, so first, i just want to say hello to all you amazing and selfless people. caregiving sure isn't easy, but our loved ones are so worth it.so my question is, does anyone have any advice on how to deal with bathroom obsessions with elderly patients with dementia? my grandmother is 93 years old and had a stroke (occipital infarction) about a few  months ago. ever since, she has developed an obsession with needing to pee, with which she needs assistance. this happens in 1-3 minute intervals at bedtime, but 2 minutes is usually the average. so, after she ""pees"", i help her get back in bed, then she'll lie down for a minute or three, and then pop back up to repeat the process. it's like the movie, ""groundhog day,"" only instead of repeating the same day over and over again, we're repeating the same few minutes over and over. she will do this almost all night until about 4 or 5 in the morning before finally passing out from exhaustion. by 7am, she is back up and at it again. she doesn't even pee most of the time and when she does, it's just a few tiny drops. it's much worse at nighttime. during the day, she does it in 5-10 minute intervals. her doctor confirmed that she does not have a uti, bladder or kidney infection, so it isn't that. she is also taking bladder control medication, but it isn't working, so we're pretty sure it's just ocd/anxiety. i'll ask her if she remembers going to the bathroom just a minute before and she always says, ""no, i don't remember. i need to pee."" if we tell her she just peed and to lie back down, she will comply, but will pop right back up a minute later. she is fast too, so you can't take your eye off her for one second, because she will try to get up on her own and would fall without assistance. in the middle of the night, she gets extremely loopy from her medications. i'm sure she is also sundowning. sometimes, she forgets how to walk. last night, i had to pick up her and carry her back to the bed. i'm a 130 lb female with a back injury and the chronic pain is really starting to affect my ability to work. thankfully, we have a pretty large family, which means me, my mom, my grandmother's other two adult children and my uncle's wife all take turns  taking night and day duty, so that makes it much easier. i am grateful for that. her current doctor wants to increase her xanax dosage to three 0.5 mgs a day and i feel like it's just making her even more loopy. her doctor also gives her trazadone at night for sleep and anxiety. i worry that the lack of sleep is eventually going to take its toll on my grandmother's body and mind. the human body can only function for so long without sleep. it's also physically and mentally taking a toll on my family and me. i love my grandma so much and it breaks my heart to see her like this. just a year ago, she and i went on weekly lunch dates together. it's such a stark contrast to her current condition, post-stroke. she also helped me through the hardest time in my life when i went through an unwanted divorce a few years ago. i owe it to her to make her remaining time here on earth as comfortable as possible, but my family and i are grasping at straws over this bathroom issue. does anyone have any advice? i apologize for the length of this post, but from the bottom of my heart, i thank you for reading. tl;drmy 93 grandmother with dementia is obsessed with going to the bathroom to pee, which she needs assistance with. she does this every 1-3 minutes throughout the night and hardly ever pees and when she does, it's only a few drops. during the day, it's every 5-10 minutes. she does not have a uti, bladder or kidney infection, which is confirmed by her doctor. after she goes to the bathroom, she lies back down, only to pop right back up minutes later. at night, she is so loopy, she forgets how to walk and i have had to carry her back to her bed. i already have a back injury which is affecting my ability to work. my family and i are so worn out. any advice would be greatly appreciated!", diapers.  change them in the morning.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/b7qpzy/elderly_grandmother_is_obsessed_with_going_to_the/,,Elderly grandmother is obsessed with going to the bathroom every 1-3 minutes at night and 5-10 minutes in the day.

"sorry my first post is on a gross topic...my mom's been in assisted living for about two years. i've been doing her laundry every week, and it hasn't been a big problem. she's used the ""moderate"" poise pads for years, with regular underwear.over the past couple of months, though, she's apparently leaking a lot more and her underwear is getting soaked around where the pad is. some weeks i bring home 15 pairs of undies that are all damp and stained pretty badly, that i feel i have to wash in a separate washer load. it doesn't seem to be result of a uti--she's on preventative medication and is monitored for them pretty regularly. i'm thinking it's just the kind of incontinence to be expected with dementia progressing.i took in some disposable underwear for her to try, at least overnight when the leakage seems to be worst. but she's only used one, which an aide made her put on after a shower, at my request. we've talked about them several times, she seemed to think they were a good idea, she just can't remember to use them overnight instead of the regular panties. i thought transitioning her into them gradually would be a good idea, but now i'm thinking it wasn't such a good idea.maybe it's time to just take all the regular ones away, and leave only the disposable ones in the drawer where the regular ones used to be. if there isn't anything to remember and no decision to make, maybe that would be easier?or, am i being a big baby about washing the underwear?", i would try just replacing all underwear with disposables and also talking with her physician about bladder control issues. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/b71cgq/transitioning_to_depends/,,Transitioning to Depends?

"so, i took care of my grandmother who had dementia and was schizoprenic for seven years. it started when i was 14 and ended when i was 22.  six months before she passed i had a breakdown and asked my parents to put her in a nurssery home. it made me few a bit guilt, but i couldn't look after her anymore, i was always tired and she needed someone to be by her side 24/7. one the last month i took care of her i did not sleep at all because she would spend the entire night walking through the house, slamming doors and repeting some weird stuff that she had been saying for years (she no longer remember how to speak portugues, or native language), i had classes during the morning and during the afternoons she was awake and beeing loud. &amp;#x200b;during those years i was her primary caregiver, because my father had work, my mom was a mess with no patience that honestly made my job worst. she would scream and start fights with my grandma and i would need to interving so it wouldn't became somenthing phisical. my older brother never did anything. it was me who had to change diapers, bath her, give food, medicene, take her to her bedroom when she got lost and clean after her.  all of these while suffering the fact that my grandma did no longer recall who i was and seeing her looking less and less with her old self.&amp;#x200b;anyways, after she went to the nurssery home i was in a really bad place mentally, when i was starting to get better she died and everything went to shit again. a year later i am trying to get a job ( a internship actually, that i need in other to graduate college) and everywhere i go they focused on the fact that i have no fucking experience. but what about the whole fucking years that i spend being a caretaker? i can't put this on my resume and obviously it would be weird to talk about it on a job interview, but it annoys me so much that all the work i've done won't really count for nothing. &amp;#x200b;sorry for the poorly written rant, i find it difficult to translate my thoughts to english."," i'm sorry for the passing of your grandmother and what a stressful experience  you had dealing with her death and caring for her despite your family dynamics.i think it's valid to disclose you did caregiving--whether you mention that it's your grandmother or not is up to you, but as everyone else has mentioned, the skills and knowledge you pick up as a caregiver is invaluable and helpful for many aspects of any type of job that's out there. i tell everyone including my workplace that i take care of mom, which was a valid reason for me to cut down on my hours, but they also realize that when it comes to the elderly and caregiving, i'm an expert, which helps me in my job specifically because we are a medical information company.now, believe it or not, in another lifetime, i worked as a graphic designer (amongst many other types of jobs) and i can tell you right now, if you want experience in graphic design, it's pretty simple--just volunteer at nonprofits (or anywhere--it's just that nonprofits are usually hurting for help) specifically as a graphic designer. if you're at the point that you are doing internships, then you should've amassed a decent portfolio.however, even if you're going to do work for free to get experience, just think that probably most of your classmates are in the same boat as you, so you really have to ""up"" your game by having a great portfolio and have a thick skin (rejection is par for the course), writing/emailing to all the nonprofits or advertising or design agencies you want to get your foot in the door to. here's where you make sure you do a spellcheck and grammar check to make sure your email queries to find ""work"" won't be automatically moved to the trash folder because you didn't even bother to do that much--probably be good to have a friend or better yet, a teacher, give it the ""once over"" to make sure it's up to par because when you're writing, you're sometimes too close to what you wrote and can't see glaring or small mistakes. as other redditors mentioned, your english is fine--for here, but not when you're trying to find a job or internship (perhaps if you have a ton of outstanding experience with a matching portfolio to show for it, some misspellings and the occasional grammatical error in your emails or resume might be negligible, but better to be safe than sorry).with your expertise in caregiving, you might want to try different nonprofit facilities that care for the elderly (like there are some churches that do this kind of thing) and see if they would like to have a volunteer graphic designer for their newsletters and such (they're nonprofits, they usually send newsletters that double as a fundraising piece).but more importantly, look after yourself--keep sane... it sounds like you are a positive force in this world that could benefit from your skills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/b6oomy/im_23_and_have_no_working_experience/,,I'm 23 and have no working experience

(if she's on a wheelchair, you can situate the power end of the plug away from her so that she doesn't see that it's not actually plugged in. i don't have a clue whether it makes any difference if you plug in a fully charged ipad; it shouldn't but just in case...)it's gonna take a huge period of adjustment before you can embrace and be at peace with your role in this new chapter of yours and your mom's life.you are now your mom's advocate. even though her rheumatologist says she's better, you need to tell him/her everything that's going on because tests don't catch everything and doctors, i'm sorry to say, are not necessarily going to go out of their way to go outside the lines of what minimal options they're used to, but most of them are open to a little nudge here and there, but you have to be the one to suggest this or that. i don't know much about lupus cerebritis, but for my mom, whom i'm the primary caregiver of (my sister helps out when necessary, her husband and mine, thank god, are supportive), i was the one to suggest physical therapy, whether some meds were necessary, to get memory/dementia testing, etc., and luckily her pcp was accommodating.you have the power!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/b3elek/venting_feeling_helpless/,,venting. feeling helpless.

"i am a enneagram type 1 personality. i knew about my type before i stared caregiving but its taken me years to finally connect the dots of how 1) i became primary caregiver,  2) why i hate doing it, and 3) why i cant quit. plus 4) how i'm moving forward.1) my mom has early onset dementia. my involvement started when i moved to be near her (as did my sibling). i took her to doctors appointments, made sure prescriptions were being filled, dealt with insurance, taxes, appointments etc. as her disease progressed i devoted more time to her - taking her shopping, coming up with activities, arranging events with friends, taking her on vacation, etc. eventually i quit my job. eventully i lived on and off with her. eventually i stopped self-care (food, excercise, doctors) because someone needs to sit next to her always. 2) the enneagram type 1 is often called the perfectionist, or the reformer or the helper. i won't go into detail, but basically the personality type likes to get things done and done well. 1s are relentless and have high standards. this is why i enjoyed getting the paperwork done and finding the ""perfect"" outing. it was satisfying. but this was a role i had defined for myself. no one else in my family was willing to clarify what they were going to do [phrasing is very much type 1], so i ""needed"" to expand my role so my mother had the ""right"" level of care. so i took the reigns until someone else took them. no one did. even after a huge turn in my mother's health (and my perhaps not so obvious shattered mental health) has family actually commited to caring for my mother at even a compromising level of care. (i admit my level is too high, but you can't even lower a level if you're not present or leave whenever you want.) it's also hard because i expect my mom to do the things that will help her (ie listen to me). it is soooooo frustrating to tell her to stand up straight and she just lists to the other side. my most high anxiety is doing excercises with her. her pt is easy, but i get so angry when she simply cant straighten her arms all the way, or shortens the range of motion. i know she as cognitive issues - but it is infuriating that she can't even help herself. she cheats herself. she is capable of so much, but doesnt like to put in the effort.

"sorry in advance for the lengthy ramblings. i'm 25 years old and i have been living and taking care of my 90yo grandmother for 3 years, in the beginning it was just taking care of her when she broke her hip unexpectedly but then she had a blood clot and what i suspect is brain damage from oxygen deprivation. it honestly could be dementia but in the beginning she didn't know the date or anything but she was still her, could talk about subjects, and was interested in tv. all that changed after the blood clot and she transformed into what she is today. she calls her dead sister all the time, constantly says my name to the point where it seems offensive to me now, stares at the wall, won't watch tv, won't make eye contact and sobs all the time and abruptly stops. i cook her food, bathe her, groom her but she is still able to walk and dress herself (mostly). &amp;#x200b;for the most part, i watch her during the week and my mom, dad and brothers watch her on the weekends. but the situation is precarious to say the least, my dad is not the most patient person and has never gotten along with my grandmother, my brothers are selfish and lazy and won't help to the point which is needed and will only help when she asks to go to the bathroom etc (which she doesn't ask for she will just pee in her pants), and my mother is disabled herself and cannot handle the physical aspect if my gram was to fall. all of this weights on me and makes it hard for me to not stress about it on my time off from watching her. my sister lives with me and my grandmother and cannot handle my grandmother at all. they never had a great relationship and i don't blame my sister for not having a lot of patience with her on top of working a lot with a long commute. &amp;#x200b;overall, i just feel that the situation is getting worse and worse and that everyone is so frustrated with her (myself included) that we need help. unfortunately, there is no one else to help out, my mom is an only child, we can't afford a caregiver and the only other option is a cheap nursing home which i feel would be a death sentence for her. i feel the time slipping away and completely trapped with these circumstances. i want to go back to school to get my masters but i am very scared of leaving gram with my mom since i feel that the toll will honestly kill my mom. on top of everything, her doctor doesn't believe anything we ever have to say, when she was short of breath with the blood clot he told us it was normal for someone with her lung condition (interstitial lung disease) to have that happen. i genuinely think she would benefit from antidepressants or anxiety medication since she is so nervous all the time that she shakes but he doesn't ever see that in the 5 minutes he sees her every months so he refuses to give us anything. &amp;#x200b;honestly i feel that i'm at the end of my tether, i don't know what to do to help her, make her feel better and she frustrates me so much that i can barely hold it together. and today has been such a hard day that i felt that i needed to vent.&amp;#x200b;if anyone has any idea about anxiety medication and their effect on older people or tips, they would be greatly appreciated. also on a side note, i can't imagine how hard it must be for some of you not having any support and my heart goes out to any of you. you guys are my heros for doing this alone."," there's an option of a sort of ""day care"" for the elderly, where she can go off during the day and still come to the comfort of her home at night. if you feel a nursing home would break her, this might be a better middle ground.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/anuqsx/at_the_end_of_my_rope/,,At the end of my rope

"i was her primary caregiver for the past six weeks, with my brother helping when he could.  she had cancer. i thought we would have more time with her... until she started vomiting blood and hallucinating on thursday evening. long story short, my father has said she had six months when he meant six weeks (possible dementia... he has been getting numbers and values wildly confused in the past few months and my mother refused to know how long she had).the weird part was, she looked completely normal up until the last two days. she was tired and listless but still had color in her face and was somewhat lucid.then the hallucinations started. she kept the tv tuned to sitcoms 24 hours a day even if she want actually watching them, and started thinking they were in the living room and she was in the scene. she screamed at me to warn my brother about the bear that was loose in the warehouse (""last man standing""). she told me to call charlie sheen and tell him that she couldn't come to his wedding (""two and a half men""). she was worried about barbra jean (""reba"").  seeing her mind slip into madness was horrifying... knowing that i could do nothing to help her left me numb and bereft.the worst part was that not one of the three hospice nurses i called in the last week even attempted to warn me that she was near the end... not when her body gave out and collapsed after trying to walk just a few feet with a walker, not when she was vomiting blood... the nurse simply prescribed prilosec and went on her way. not one of them arranged for her to go back to the hospice house. they left it up to us to deal with it all.i did the best i could... i think... but i just can't help but feel that i could have done more to help her had i been a little more prepared and knew what to ask and how/when to ask it.now we are taking care of dad and he refuses to consider assisted living accommodation, despite the fact that he can't drive, is wheelchair bound and continually gets facts confused. i am more worried now than i ever was."," my deepest sympathies, and great admiration to you for your strength and kindness. yes; medical personnel likely have to have an emotional shield up, or maybe b.s.

"i have decided due to various factors, i need to get paid if i am able to continue caring for my dad. he lives alone, doesn't drive, has some dementia. so care is fairly involved, much of it being monitoring through phone calls and video. some weeks are easy, some not. i also do all the shopping/cleaning/meds etc. how do i determine a fair wage? one brother has sole control of money and poas. he is okay with paying me (it is preferable to an outsider or nursing home). my brother suggested paying hourly as contract labor.this would be okay...except...how do i fairly account for all the time i have to spend monitoring? it's not that each instance takes long, but more that it adds up plus i have to always be alert. i don't get a day off from watching over him. next, the day i go to clean/food/etc is a team effort. my kids and their dad help. if i did alone it would be far more hours. do i add their time in? i feel bad i have to even ask to be paid. i have been doing his caretaking for years now. however, my situation has become where i need to earn extra income. therefore, i have to either get paid for caretaking or stop it altogether. how do i figure a wage that is fair to all? do i consider also that i have to pay all taxes as self employed? thank you so much for any help. p.s. none of the other family is willing to help in his weekly care; sharing the care is not an option."," the work you do to care for your father is valuable and important.  please don't be ashamed to ask for payment for it.the formula above seems very fair.  the other thing to consider is a flat fee for the monitoring and then an hourly rate for appointments, hands-on care, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/9vov4k/request_advice_for_parent_caregiver/,,Request Advice for Parent Caregiver

"my mother (65) was diagnosed with cancer two months ago. we do not know specifically where it originated, because by the time it was discovered, she was riddled with it all over her body and is too far along for treatment. she is now at home getting hospice care by nurses who come by 2-3 times a week to bathe her and check her meds. we were told that she has six months to live, but she appears to be in a freefall at the moment and we honestly don't expect her to make it past christmas. her memory is failing her and she is now too weak to make it to the bathroom half the time. every day with her is a lesson in panic and fear... someone leaves the room for a few minutes, and she flails into a panic-stricken state, demanding to know where the person is, why they left and when they are coming back. the other day i told her i was going to buy her a new phone because her old one wouldn't keep a charge... i was gone less than 20 minutes before she started calling people in a panic trying to find me. no particular reason... i just wasn't there anymore and she couldn't remember where i went. two weeks ago, we got a call at 6 am reporting that my father (also 65 and severely disabled - cannot drive and is wheelchair-bound) had been rushed to the er... he had fallen and couldn't get up, was combative and delirious and non-responsive. he had a uti and high fever, as well as fluid on his weakened lungs. bacteria was all through his blood stream and ecoli was in his urine. this has happened before, apparently. nobody can figure out why it's happening over and over and over again.(notice that i said ""apparently""?... well, before my mom was diagnosed with cancer, she was my father's primary caregiver and shielded me from a lot of what was going on with him because ""she didn't want to upset me"". more on that later.)my father is now back home, but he has been signed up for home health care. at this point, he is about the same as he was before his latest er visit, but it's obvious to everyone that his mind is failing him. he was always a little goofy and eccentric, but now it is far more pronounced and he is making up wildly erratic ""facts"" and stories that have no basis whatsoever in reality. he shouts out strange noises for no reason, etc. he still knows who we are and where he is, but it's obvious that he needs to be evaluated for dementia or alzheimer's. his behavior is alarming all of us, and it's slowly gotten worse over the past few months. physically, he is helpless. he cannot drive and he can't walk more than a couple of steps and only has one semi-functioning leg. falling out of his chair while trying to get into his wheelchair by himself is a common event and requires multiple people to get him upright. he sometimes loses control of his bowels and soils his wheelchair seat as well.i live about 45 minutes away, but since my mother's diagnosis i have been coming over every single day and often staying the night. i am able to telecommute so i can work at their kitchen table during the day. when i first set up this arrangement, the understanding was that i would run errands for them on my lunch hour and do small things for them during the day while working - things i could do in a couple of minutes, like getting them medication or drinks. however, it has escalated to being asked to run errands across town while i'm working. they see me sitting there and assume i'm free - they forget that i'm working. my boss is very understanding of my situation but it's still taking a toll on my career and my sanity.add to the mix:1.) my brother - he lives with them but works 50 - 60 hours a week (manual labor). he helps when he can but he works the night shift and has to sleep during the day. he is just as strained and frantic as i am and his temper is growing shorter and shorter every day.2.) his ex-wife - they are on civil terms and she is still friendly with our family. she helps when she can but their custody arrangement is set up so that my brother gets their son every other week. this means that, every other week, he is over here and has to be taken care of, along with my parents. she sends him over here even when he is sick and contagious. 3.) my nephew (brother's son) - sweet kid, but he's 9, high-energy and caught in the middle of all of this.there have been instances of nasty comments and outburts - my mother screaming at us to ""stop kissing her ass"" when we do things she's asked us to do... but if we don't do them, she feels neglected and abandoned. dad accused me of ""picking at the family fortune like a vulture on a carcass"" when i gently suggested that he add my name to their checking account in the event that a bill needs to be paid and my brother is unavailable, or that he make me an additional power of attorney. i've never asked for a single penny from either of them in my entire life, yet suddenly i'm mercenary and after them for their (meager) fortune (rolls eyes). my brother is a power of attorney and has his name on the account, but i feel that putting all of our eggs in one basket is a bad choice. he has been known to fall asleep behind the wheel while driving home from a long exhausting shift, more than once.and then there's me... my husband is at home, trying to be patient and understanding while i try to sort out the insanity, panic, fear and constant medical crises. i'm in daily communication with their nurses and caregivers in a vain effort to restore the order of things, but still i dread falling asleep every night, because falling asleep means i need to wake up the next day to chaos, pain, fear, crying and insanity. self-care is a huge colossal joke at this point.tl;dr - dad keeps screaming that he doesn't need help, but his immune system is almost nonexistent and he's pissing in his wheelchair (on those rare times that he's able to sit in it) and rambling incoherently. mom is losing her memory and wasting away in a hospice bed in the living room. they're both hopped up on enough morphine and percoset to give a drug dealer a stiffy for a month straight. my only sibling is a workaholic who gets by on 3 hours of sleep and a 6 pack of monster drinks every day, routinely falling asleep behind the wheel of his truck as he drives to yet another 12 hour factory shift. meanwhile, my sil sends my nephew out trick-or-treating with a full-blown case of pneumonia and then sends him home to us to nurse. life is good."," you know, i just remembered something! is there a hospice facility nearby? it could be a great place for your mom to go to. they are usually run very well and all the one's i've been to (volunteered for hospice for five years) have been very compassionate and well run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/9ue6o0/rantvent_my_story_i_never_thought_i_would_find/,,(rant/vent) My Story -

"apologize for the wall of text. i am just very scared for the future.i visited my mom this week. i live one and a half hours away in a different town so i visit my mom every two weeks when i get the weekends off (rotating shifts). this week was terrible. they took her off her xanax four months ago at the pain doctors and her anxiety is through the roof! she didn't have toilet paper or nearly any food that wasn't spoiled. she hadn't eaten and she was wearing old clothes. there was cat vomit on the floor but the litter box was clean.my mom has complex post traumatic stress syndrome, anxiety, and depression, and i think i am beginning to see signs of dementia. i cleaned up the house, brought her some food which made her feel better, and looked at her medicines. turns out the norco she's taking makes her anxious and she's been taking 2 more per day that than she should because her lower back was hurting. you may be asking, haven't i seen a decline when i visited before? yes, i had. i moved away two years ago and since then my mom has been living but not thriving but she always seemed to have plenty of food and was able to take care of herself, now i am not so sure. when i would ask her how she was doing she would always respond that she was a little lonely but alright. i thought she was at least managing. i have always lived with my mom with the exception of these last two years.  she talks about how she wants to move because she is lonely where she is but will then change her mind because of how this will affect the cats. she refuses to go anywhere even though she can drive. she will do things like going to senior dances, and exercise classes if i am with her but i work so much just to keep me afloat that i am not able to always drive down and pick her up, ect. unless i am there she spends her day talking to the cats and watching 1940's movies on repeat. she told me that if she was getting bad she would come stay with me for a few days and i would even pick her up! she told me this weekend that she has been hiding how bad things were from me for the past four months, that she hasn't been eating (she's lost a lot of weight and will only eat medium to large meals if i am there with her), she has only been sleeping four hours a night (because the xanax made her sleep), she's been crying a lot, and she's been taking old pills to see if they help her that she's saved from the past.she refuses to go to specialized therapy even though i said i would pay for her to go. i was unable to convince her to go to the hospital that night but we went the next morning.  she has a minor kidney infection, and may have to see a urologist to make sure her kidneys are functioning. we are changing her pain doctor and she is seeing her general practitioner tomorrow. we are moving changing doctors to the one's in her home town because all of her doctors are an hour away. we are also looking at moving her into a senior community closer to me.i want her to get a memory test once she's finished taking her antibiotics because i want to see if she is having any memory issues without the infection because we all know how internal infections affect the elderly. i feel like i let her down. if she is starting to have dementia it essentially means my life is over. i am calling tomorrow to get her set up on meals on wheels, hopefully that will help her eat. she talked to my aunt and she is planning a trip down there to get some socialization. i highly doubt that she will go but i am happy that she is at least planning something,  i live so far away that i can't come down there everyday, in addition her apartment is so smokey that i get sick when i stay there, i also no longer have a bed and my old room is essentially the cats play room. i would have her up here but my apartment does not allow any pets. she has always been a great mom but she has never been good at caring for herself. when i was 14 i took over all the government paperwork and paying for everything. i also was the main cook and her main listener. she likes to go on and on about how she was mistreated to much in life, and i went into social work as a profession so believe me when i tell you compared to some of the cases i had to work on how she was treated was not even comparable. i feel like i did too much for her when i was younger and now she can't/won't take care of herself. add to this i have only three friends who can emotionally support me if i do need to be a caregiver. if i can't work how are we supposed to survive? do i just live off her check? i am so new to this caregiver thing and i am really resenting my mom for being unwilling to take care of herself, not to mention if she does have dementia (memory test pending) i know what is in store. how am i supposed to survive as a caregiver? how can i stop feeling resentment towards my mother? i am so sorry for the wall of text but i am feeling so overwhelmed right now. i am feeling very alone, and i want to do the right thing for the health of my mother. thank you!"," thank you everyone who responded! the last few days have been hectic. we have to change her primary care physician because this guy is useless. my mom had a sheet printed off from the hospital about how she had to get her urine tested for blood from her gp. the dude was so lazy that he didn't even look at the paper and instead told her to go back to the hospital. told her that changing pain med doctors was impossible and she wouldn't get her medicines. a half truth because i called the pain doctor myself and they told me to to change doctors without having the medicines affected. he wanted to send her three hours away to see a psychiatrist for her xanax where she would have to pay out of pocket because it was out of state. like we couldn't find a psychiatrist in our own state? he was beyond useless so now we are changing her gp, she is going to get her urine tested tomorrow at the hospital. she is still taking her uti meds and has been in a better mental state. we are also looking at senior apartments in my town or closer but many have wait lists. she doesn't want to move yet but we are looking somewhere in the next three months. i want to say thank you to everyone who responded! i am much calmer now and i talked to a few of my friends so i know i have support. my roommate and friends even agreed to check in on her if i have to work, ect. now i am looking at insurance options for when she needs an assisted living facility. thank you for everyone who told me to have patience and breathe. the world seems a little brighter today.

"first time poster here as i just found this sub. have to vent before going crazy.thanks before hand to anyone bothering to read my wall of text.i've been caring for both my parents since about four-five years back. had to move home temporarily (i thought) because of economic reasons. my dad was already somewhat physically and mentally broken from several strokes. a couple of weeks later i realized something was wrong with my mom. turns out she had successfully hidden the fact that she was slowly fading away in to dementia. took about a year of soul crushing arguing and daily fighting to get her to both acknowledge that something was wrong and to get her to see a doctor. after that i basically dropped everything to try to hold their situation and life at an ""ok"" level. after a couple of years, my mom got a place at an assisted living or whatever it's called in english and ofc shortly there after my dad started to deteriorate.. so here i am today with no end in sight.since then i've lost my youth, the love of my life and all my friends. my friends have given zero support (besides saying get a job. yeah thanks buddy, i already have more on my hands than i can handle) and basically sees me as a failure. calling me a looser both to my face and discussing what my problem is behind my back. my girlfriend got sick of me being depressed constantly with no end of the shitty situation in sight. so here i am, 31 years old soon. no life spark, no friends, no future. like, i've given everything for my parents and what have i gotten out of it? nothing. i don't even know how to get myself out of this fucking hole. nevermind getting a job. sometimes i think about giving up and ending it but never seriously enough to do it fortunately.any thoughts or maybe similar life stories would be much appreciated. thanks."," like someone mentioned here, look into government assistance programs. they do exist for family caregivers! i know a few people that did. good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/95y1n0/caregiver_for_two_parents_life_destroyed/,,Caregiver for two parents.

"i apologize in advance for the length and formatting(mobile)of this post. tl:dr at the bottom. not sure where to start with this one. it has been so many years in the making and it just gets more and more complicated. i have left out details to prevent this post from being even longer. first off, i would like to say that my brother and i are not money grubbing children. **we love our dad and we're trying to look out for his future health and well-being as best as we know how. that being said, we didn't want him to be taken advantage of.** my father (divorced) retired to mexico after selling his business in canada about 6 years ago. he made a decent amount of money off of it but is by no means rich. he bought a condo in mexico (technically a trust bought the condo as foreigners can not own property near beaches in this state.) shortly after retirement my brother and i (as well as many concerned people who knew him) began becoming concerned about the potential onset of dementia. i won't bore you with the details but **he was eventually diagnosed with a type of dementia that affects long term planning and decision making.** while he was in the process of getting tests (difficult as he was only in canada half the year), **he met a lady in mexico**. he was introduced to her because someone said he was looking for a wife. she seemed very nice but my brother and i had concerns about my fathers ability to understand what marrying a lady from mexico meant for his condo and his assets. **she was also quite attractive and 20 years his junior.** my father was pushing 70 and a could be a difficult person to interact with when you both speak the same language fluently. it just raised a few question marks. with his suspected dementia, he would likely need a high level of care for many years. **we urged them to wait to get married until after all of his tests have been completed for both of their sakes**. there was a wedding date set in mexico that would allow for more testing. he needed to see very specific specialists and it was difficult to set up with him being away so often. **they ended up getting married in secret** before the wedding date and before his meeting with the specialist. on his next visit to canada he saw the specialist. **they confirmed our suspicions of dementia**. (i cannot remember the exact timing offhand but i believe the official results were after the wedding) the diagnosis has since been confirmed by other medical tests and a second opinion.**my father did not understand the consequences of his marriage**. apparently there are two types of marriages in mexico. he believed that in the event of a divorce he would take his stuff and she would take hers. **but she had chosen to get married in such a way that they combined their assets**. with multiple conversations he still did not understand the type of marriage he got. his wife was a tale of two people. every time we met her she seems very lovely, warm, and like a very nice person. but many actions (like this one) that i will not go into show very different side. my father 100&amp;#37; assured us that the condo was safe. it would always be passed to us upon his death. i pressed him on this issue but with the dementia it was hard to explain to him. at the time we were mostly concerned that he would be able to sell the condo to pay for his future medical care when it came time.**my father recently passed away while in mexico.** he was ill for a while and she took care of him. this was the first time in their 2 year relationship where we actually thought she cared about him. we developed a more positive relationship with her. we were able to go down and say goodbye, although he was still convinced that he had 10+ years. it took him very quickly.in my dad's will, both most recent and previous, the condo was to be left to my brother and i. he had stated that he would not be leaving anything to her from the will because he was going to make her a beneficiary of part of his life insurance. he never got around to doing this. **my brother and i wanted to ensure that she was not left without anything**, especially since she cared for him for the last few months. when we went to go and transfer ownership of the trust, **we discovered that the ownership had been transferred to her** one month ago. at this time my dad was **in and out of the hospital**. he was hardly able to hold a conversation due to the sickness, let alone understand what was going on.we have some evidence through texts that show that **he did not understand what he was signing.**my brother is in mexico now. he is planning to get a lawyer and figure this out. i feel helpless up here and i was hoping that reddit could provide a strategy to help us out.what is our strongest case? contesting it on grounds of dementia? **what should we do?**the testing was done in canada, and she took him to a doctor friend of hers in mexico who said that he was fine.tl:dr my father, who married a lady in mexico while he had dementia, recently died. his $500k mexican condo was transferred to his wife a month before he died. he has multiple tests confirming the dementia, he was very ill when he signed, and did not fully understand what he was doing.what can we do?(i apologize for any confusing tense issues. he only passed away this week and it's still difficult to talk about)"," speaking with a lawyer is going to be your best course of action. since he was debilitatingly mentally ill when he signed, it could be a good point in your case. good luck, friend.

"my parents divorced when i was 3 years, they werent a good fit for each other. my dad is a douche and my mother was horrible too. after they decided to move away, i went to my mom, they never spoke to each other or were even in the same room when i was present. my dad used to tell me about how horrible my mom is and how much money she was spending on herself.my mom has my bigger sister too, who is 10 years older. she was more of a mother to me. yet they both didnt help me growing up, my mom hit her and when she got older, they beat each other up. after an argument i used to be the one that mediated, told both of them to like each other again, when i wasnt even in elementary school yet. i dont know why no one ever called the police on them. when i was 5 my mom put my sister into a foster care and picked her up a week afterwards. because she was angry, she did that two more times and one time into a mental wards. always she told me that i would be next if i dont behave. even though i can talk about this now alot of my memories have been lost, like they are in a mist and i just forgot.i was the perfect child, my mom needed a best friend and i sure was hers. i didnt complain, my marks were always good, i was quiet and shy. books were my addiction. i could flee from my relaity and it gave my comfort.my sister mived out early and it was better for all of us. when i was 8, my mom tried to commit suicide. i found her in the bathroom and all the blood around her. no one in my family knows it. who does this?

"i’m 32 and i have been taking care of my now 91 year old grandmother for about 3-4 years now. i left my previous job because of health related issues. while looking for a more suitable job, my grandma’s mind went downhill and she was diagnosed with dementia. she also had a stroke and could no longer live alone. so i, not knowing how hard it would be, stepped up to the plate as caregiver. don’t get me wrong i don’t really regret it. i gave my grandmother my room, and i now sleep in a recliner in the living room. i have lost a lot of sleep, and most of my me time is late at night in-front of my computer watching youtube. i no longer have the want or desire to paint or draw anymore. it’s not laziness either. my mother says it is, but i don’t think i’m lazy if i take care of my grandma 24/7, cook meals for the family, and clean the house everyday. i haven’t been diagnosed with any mental disorder, but i have never gone to speak with a doctor about it. being unemployed makes it hard to afford or even get health insurance. so... no doctor and i have no idea why i am the way i am. i am almost positive i have anxiety. i am always worried and nervous, and panicking when the smallest things go wrong or change. my chest gets tight and i feel like nothing is ever going to go right again when this happens. my mood also seems to change at the drop of a hat. i go from chipper and happy, to angry or panicking, or i get really really depressed. not wanting to do much, feeling hopeless, useless, and with “dark thoughts”. i’ve also been a bit paranoid lately. i’m not going to go into it, but sometimes i’ve come to the weirdest conclusions, and believing them until my mom talked me out of it.lately i’m sitting at depressed because my mom’s legs are doing bad. she has an infection on her skin and it looks terrible. i feel helpless, i don’t know how to help her. grandma has changed so much now and it hurts to see her that way. my dad doesn’t really want to be involved, and the only other family members that could help ran away. lets just say aunt a and uncle b ran away  to another state because they were pissed that they weren’t given my grandmother’s house after she built them one, and bought them another property after they sold the first. sorry this is tmi, but i really haven’t had anyone to talk to... there is so much more, but i don’t know where to continue. i just feel like the girl who is slowly disappearing. i will be nothing when all of this is over. just the woman who lives with her parents, and looks five years older than she actually is..."," i feel these ""dark thoughts"" and depression you're experience is acclimated with lack of quality sleep and not having the freedom to do what you want (i mean, you're young, having fun should be what you do). what you're describing (chest pain and panicking) sounds like anxiety to me (i have it as well).it's unfortunate when siblings runoff when their parents get sick. i'm willing to bet, almost every family will experience this. i'm currently experiencing this with my client. she has alzheimer's and lives with her daughter. but her 3 other kids couldn't care less. however, the daughter, who has power of attorney, is fixing this by giving herself more when her mom dies. which i think you should do. if people cannot take care of their sick parents when the time comes, it shouldn't be split evenly, if 1 kid takes the burden, while the others are mia.now, is there any way for you to leave the house and have your mom watch your grandmother? you need a break. do you have any friends you can stay with, just for the weekend? just so you can get some r&r?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/8drizy/i_need_to_vent/,,I Need to Vent...

"hello fellow caregivers, i'm glad to have found this sub.  it'll be nice to have other people to talk to.  the story up to now:i am now 42, i have epilepsy and am on disability, my daughter lived with my mother as her guardian as i couldn't provide as well for her.  my mother has been an rn for 40some years, she works in upper management in insurance and has for about 20 years.  she is single.  my sister and her family live in town close to ma's, as does my mother's brother, who we have calculated has spent .1% of his time with his parents since this all started.at this point, due to ma working 70 hours a week or so and having a 50 mile one way commute as well as many business trips, we have yet to finish cleaning out their old house.  my uncle went to help us once early on, we had to keep pulling things out of the dumpster that were important, he also sold some possessions to his brother-in-law for next to nothing and tried to do the same with their truck and boat so we can't let him up there alone.  utilities are still being paid and someone maintains it for them.  he's proud of it, he literally built it with his two hands, but his memory of it is foggy now.  they take him by whenever they go up to that town, sadly that has mostly been for the funerals of grandma's and his sisters.  mentioning this also bc of him still having all of his accounts and property, so he has to pay directly for someone to take care of him.7 years ago in january my grandparents needed to move in with my mother for medical reasons.  grandma had nearly died from blood loss due to an ulcer and papa's memory isn't good enough for him to live alone.  ma had been building a house at the time with a room and accommodations for them and driving to their home 80 miles away weekly to check up, but the emergency occurred a month before the house was finished.  so we moved them temporarily into the house she had at the time while grandma was in the hospital.  about a week after she was released, papa had an appendicitis attack in the middle of the night, in the middle of a blizzard, seizing on the floor while grandma tried to walk over him with her walker to get to the bathroom.  we don't do things easy in our family it seems.  papa has a bit of dementia, but he still has a pretty good grasp on things, just short term memory issues, and grandma had a few mini-strokes which caused her to be a much different grandma than i had grown up with; she was suddenly racist, grumpy, and a bit spiteful.  papa would ask about every 10 minutes for a week why he was wearing sweatpants and why his side hurt.  when i'd tell him about getting his appendix out, he'd just say, ""well that's damned silly at my age."" and chuckle and let it go.  he knows he can't remember, but he remembers the important things and so far hasn't gotten depressed about it.as my mother works full time out of town and they could not be left home alone, i became the caretaker when she was gone.  initially this was meds, meal prep, putting the foot rest up and down for grandma every couple of minutes and assisting her with cleaning and bathroom duties.  she was incredibly specific about what she would eat (for months it was thin hamburgers, instant mashed potatoes, and brown gravy from a mix; and god help you if that hamburger patty was too thick or too large) and we had to correct her sudden racism and political rants in front of my daughter and my sister's children.  grandma also drove my mother to calling me on the phone in tears a few times at first just being spiteful about things.  my sudden absence from home for extended periods of time gave my then so an excuse to start drinking again after 6 years of sobriety, so my home life went to shit. we finally got them moved into the new house and after a few months of pt grandma was able to get around with a walker and papa was there to help with physical things, she was his memory, and she owned the remote control.  at this point, with a new cell phone, they were okay to be left home without supervision as long as ma got home at night and anytime she was on a work trip i stayed so they felt safe.  granted, i can't drive, but my sister and daughter both could and my sister lived nearby and were always on call.  my uncle lives less than a mile away but until this past may hasn't had a cell phone (which we gave him and forced him to use) and it could take days to get ahold of him.things were pretty good with grandma and papa for the past few years, she even got her sense of humor back somewhat.  i got rid of the so after many years of misery and now am with someone who appreciates family and isn't a drunk.  he puts family first and loves my family.  pretty much as soon as he moved in with me this feb though, a bunch of shit happened at once.  grandma was at an md appt and the pa didn't lower the bed or steady the step when she was getting grandma off the examining table and she ended up falling and shattering her ankle on one side and her knee on the other side.  they didn't notice the damage immediately so she ended up in a wheelchair but still taking some steps, incredibly painfully and with assistance, on them for a few weeks.  we hadn't had hhc in yet and as a full lift she was draping herself around my neck because that's how she felt safe and killing me.  when we finally taught her how to properly get up from the chair to rotate to bed or toilet, the weight and sudden stops for when a bad twinge of pain would hit her ended up causing me to hurt the hand she used to put her weight on.  it still isn't right, but at the time i assumed it was overuse so if i fractured anything, it's too late now. one night she tried to be tough when i was there and didn't call out to have help in the bathroom, while papa was in the er with ma for a coughing issue.  she fell ofc.  we ended up with both of them in the er within a week, she had been coming down with a cold as well.  at this time she was 85 and he was 92.  papa was so worried about her, they were a room away from each other with ma and i bouncing between, and i witnessed my papa cry for the first time in my life, he was so scared he was going to lose her when she was right next door and he couldn't see her.  she wasn't as bad off as he was except for the knee and ankle, but he couldn't remember that part.  we had to keep assuring him that she was fine and one of us with each of them at all times.the mds came to their senses after new x-rays on grandma and put her in a chi pt rehab facility with a no weight bearing restriction.  as often happens, she developed pneumonia, got transferred back to the hospital, and we lost grandma last may.  we made sure papa got in to see her every day in the hospital and finally to say goodbye before she passed.  i'm crying again, i hadn't done that for years before grandma died.  we promised grandma that we would keep papa at home.  so since march they have needed to have someone there 24/7, and now papa needs the same.  we'd had hhc for a bit and asked the rn we thought was the best (never talked to papa like he was a child, etc) if she could suggest someone like herself for taking on a few days a week of papa-sitting and also taking care of the dogs and doing up meals and dishes.  there's a lazy mini dachshund named daisy and ma's ""i need something happy in my life while everyone is in the hospital"" rescue puppy, peanut who is half mini d and half, wait for it, mini jack russell.  she's been chewing her way through every item in the house since a week before grandma passed (my sis and daughter snuck her in to see grandma in the hospital and got a smile out of her, then got kicked out.)  so it's a wee bit more than just sitting around with a nice old man who naps quite a bit and likes nature and cooking shows, but not much more.  she suggested her daughter who is a cna that was taking online classes, we met her and tried her out and she is great.  she even bakes and cleans the bathrooms.when i'm not there ma sleeps in a recliner in the living room so she can hear if he gets up.  with her job, stress levels, and thyroid issues, she maybe gets 4 hours of sleep during the week, and as he gets up to go to the bathroom and get a drink 5-10 times a night, those hours are interrupted.  when i'm going to be staying with him the next day, i sleep on the couch so she can sleep in her own bed.  at home i get 10 hours of sleep or more easily, there, not much and that causes me seizures after 2-3 days in a row.last month the girl told us she'd only be available tuesday and thursday for her next semester of school, which is a shit schedule for me but, trying our best.  today, the first day of classes, she texts me an ""oh shit!"" and lets me know she has class every day during the week and wants to set up something like me doing t/th mornings and then she'd drive me home at noon and take over, but then also m/w/f she wanted to come in at 3, but wouldn't be able to take me home. so basically she can barely work and lately she'd been picking me up at 5 on some of her days bc she had plans for before my mother got home, which is often late, though she tried to be home early for her.  all of these trips involve papa having to ride along with.i spend over half of my life at ma's.  papa keeps forgetting that i don't live there.  i've caught myself at my apartment saying, ""yeah, i'm going home at 5:00"" referring to their house.  now i will be staying there sunday night through friday evening until we can find someone to replace her.  were it closer to summer my sister's kids could, but for now, we're just floundering.my mother is working past midnight when i'm there and going in at 3am on nights she gets home before that.  she's under so much stress that i think she should get a hotel room some of those nights instead of driving home - last week once with her windows down, singing to stay awake.  my daughter is in her last year in uni and is doing as much as she can, and my sister works full time as well but she and her husband and kids do everything they can to help too.  i actually got my uncle to spend a few hours there the other night when the gal had to leave early yet again and i was still catching up on sleep from a 3 day stretch.  but even when he does come to do something, he doesn't give ma long enough to do anything, maybe 2 hours.  she takes him out to meals regularly, she takes him to every farmer's market, we went to the zoo a few years ago, he's a constant fixture on our whole family's facebook pages, everybody loves papa.  my uncle doesn't facebook so he's not even seeing any of this.  there are probably 50 people out there who could tell you his breakfast order by heart, they know all of the stories he's told that we faithfully record, and just generally know *him* better than his son does.  in addition to housing, med prep, paying for meds, food prep and paying for food, setting up and driving to md appts, laundry and housekeeping, and being a good daughter, she also spends time with her grandkids and daughters and buys extra groceries every weekend that she ""drive by drop off""s to my daughter, me, and my sister's family as well as my sister's ex as he has joint custody and is nice and she wants to make sure her grandkids and their father both are able to eat well.  i swear my mother is wonder woman.  she's set to retire in 2 years and is looking for property down in the gulf to have a winter home at for her and papa and the dog and the menace of a puppy to go to.  she's taking my niece to italy for a school function this year and trying to find time to take papa down to look for property, but he won't fly so it's a long bit of a drive.  she's on thyroid medication, and she forgets it at times, so i worry.  she's burning herself out hard, and i can't pick up all of the weight, i literally have seizures if i can't spend at least one day at home pretty much sleeping straight through after 2-3 days in a row at her place.  my sis and daughter try and are great for weekends, but i'm going to start being there every week day starting this upcoming week and i don't know how i'm going to handle it.  i miss spending time with my so.  i miss my bed and my cats and my comfy chair and my laptop.  i love papa and don't mean to sound like i don't want to be there, and i won't let anyone i haven't spent time with together with him be a new caregiver for him, but i'm exhausted.  then i look at my mother and wonder how in the hell she's doing it. she's done the driven work ethic thing for decades, and while i could work, i was the same.  now i need 10 or more hours of sleep and a lot of pills a day.  but she's doing that and everything else on top of it.  i fill the pillbox but she has to order the scrips, i can cook, but she has to get groceries, and i can't drive (and we don't have a vehicle so my so can't drop me off) so she generally has to pick me up and drop me off.  and then, there's the puppy.  the puppy that will literally go from dead asleep to bouncing off the walls (after sliding into them from the ottoman leap) and running a slalom path through the table and chairs, scrabble in the turn on the kitchen floors, and start doing laps at breakneck speed for about 10 minutes with a water break in the kitchen once or twice.  the puppy that has eaten papa's slippers, most of her toys, anything cloth she can get her teeth one, the rungs on the chairs, part of the floor of the deck, the bottoms of the cabinets, 4 dog beds, multiple pens, and -when he doesn't hit the door all the way shut and she can sneak into his bathroom -papa's razors from the trash.  the puppy that is scared of snow shovels (we had to give her 3 days of immersion therapy with one in the middle of the floor) and snow and needs to be on a chain to go potty, but only if the weather's nice enough, thank you very much.  the puppy that will not sleep anywhere but on me when i'm on the couch for the night, that got the lazy dog moving again, that makes ma smile, and gets papa to play (and remember her name, yay! new memory!)  yeah that puppy, peanut is sweet, but she's a handful.i've gotten way off into rambling land.  i'm sorry.  having all of this to say, i wanted to explain things before i complained about the new schedule, and i guess i got caught up in a stream of consciousness. anyway, that's our current situation.  i don't know how long it's going to take to find someone new that's suitable.  i don't know how long i'll be functional doing this.  i don't know how in the hell my mother does what she does and what i can do to help her more.  i'm frustrated with a puppy.  i'm resenting my uncle.  i'm missing my so and my home.  if you made it through this, wow.  thank you for reading."," hang in there, sounds like you are in the mix! rest, eat, try to laugh, even if its stupid cat videos

"warning: turned into a bit of a vent!hey everyone, recent lurker and first post! 29/f/east coast us here. i’ve been caregiving full-time for my mom’s younger sister (62), who has early onset alzheimer’s, for 2 years since i was 26. my mom and i recently gave up the reigns of caregiving to her kids because i was experiencing pure burnout. i was also juggling caregiving separately for my dad (divorced from mom) who is suffering from end-stage cirrhosis and awaiting liver transplant. he now needs full-time care. i graduated college and left part-time work to take care of my aunty and my dad. personally, i also struggle with major depressive disorder and anxiety, exacerbated of course with caregiving. (favorite coping mechanism? lol. getting lost in other characters’ lives on netflix binges like everything sucks and on my block.)i’ve been struggling lately with a very heavy sense of being left behind- professionally, mentally, socially. many of my friends and peers have graduate degrees, are already years into their careers, are getting married, buying houses, having kids or just able to go out to dinners or meet up over drinks and talk about things they have achieved or are pursuing. their lives may not be perfect, but their lives are at least progressing.  i feel stuck and left in the dust. i feel like life has paused before i even got a good chance to start. my own sibling who decided to move far away is established in their career, bought a house, got 2 dogs and is getting married in a year.  there’s a lot of family tension and rifts because a lot of people on different sides feel some are contributing while others aren’t, some people are getting praised for what they do while others aren’t. (i have my share of resentments, but i won’t delve into that here.) you all know the deal.anyway. bottom line is it’d be great to have more of an understanding, empathetic support system. i have a couple of sweet friends and an amazing partner, but i often feel like the “negative nancy” or that i’m repeating the same issues. are there any other young, unemployed unmarried caregivers who are experiencing similar stuff that would want to create a chat group? talk to each other throughout the day when we have pockets of downtime? vent or complain about the day? but also talk about light, fluffy things so we’re not a complete pool of misery lol. things we’re watching on netflix? hobbies? articles we read? maybe plans or goals? i know the issue of feeling left behind or stalled isn’t solely for young, unemployed caregivers, that’s just where i fall! if you feel you relate to anything and would also benefit from a support chat group, please comment or message!"," believe me i also know what you mean. i’m 32 and i have been taking care of my now 91 year old grandmother for about 3-4 years now. i left my previous job because of health related issues. while looking for a more suitable job, my grandma’s mind went downhill and she was diagnosed with dementia. she also had a stroke and could no longer live alone. so i, not knowing how hard it would be, stepped up to the plate as caregiver. don’t get me wrong i don’t really regret it. i haven’t been diagnosed with any mental disorder, but i have never gone to speak with a doctor about it. being unemployed makes it hard to afford or even get health insurance. so... no doctor and i have no idea why i am the way i am. i am almost positive i have anxiety. i am always worried and nervous, and panicking when the smallest things go wrong or change. my chest gets tight and i feel like nothing is everything going to go right again when this happens. my mood also seems to change at the drop of a hat. i go from chipper and happy, to angry or panicking, or i get really really depressed. not wanting to do much, feeling hopeless, useless, and with “dark thoughts”.lately i’m sitting at depressed because my mom’s legs are doing bad. she has an infection on her skin and it looks terrible. i feel helpless, i don’t know how to help her. grandma has changed so much now and it hurts to see her that way. my dad doesn’t really want to be involved, and the only other family members that could help ran away. lets just say aunt a and uncle b ran away because they were pissed because they weren’t given my grandmother’s house, after she built them one and bought them another property. also i’m not married, don’t have kids, and i feel like my career is gone. with that, my self esteem is down the tube. sorry this is tmi and a bit depressing , but i really haven’t had anyone to talk to... i tend to hermit a lot. i’m terrified of talking on the phone sometimes, and it’s hard to get out of the house. i have to force myself ti take my grandma to the doctors some days. there is so much more, but my mind won’t work anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/87sv1l/just_curious_how_many_young_caregivers_2030s_are/,,"Just curious how many young caregivers (20/30’s) are there in here who are unemployed, unmarried, no-kids and struggling with their own mental health? Would anyone be interested in a supportive group chat?"
"not a caregiver, but i could really use some advice on how my family can deal with the issues caused by my great aunt and uncle right now (both in their mid-80s).just a quick background: my parents, sisters, and i are the only family my aunt and uncle have, we all live 1+ hour driving time (one way) from their house, and obviously we love both of them very dearly.my aunt and uncle have each had their health problems over the years, but we are now at the point of no return. my uncle can no longer take care of himself, and even though he knows it, he refuses all help unless it's coming from my aunt. that last part might sound like a good thing, but it's not. my aunt is not capable of taking care of him for a variety of reasons, with the most difficult being that she refuses to see the reality of the situation. i cannot imagine the pain she has endured watching my uncle deteriorate the way that he has, and i understand that she is being faced with some unbearably hard truths, but that does not change the fact that she is allowing (and a lot of times forcing) my uncle to put himself in dangerous positions. she will still send him to get something from their basement even though he's had trouble keeping his balance lately. she asks him to fix stuff around the house even though he loses track of what he's doing and makes things worse. the most extreme example i have, which i only mention to show the gravity of this situation, is her letting my uncle lie face down on the floor for hours after having a stroke because she ""thought he was sleeping"".i feel like normally my family would be in a good position because my aunt and uncle are very well off financially and could afford any type of help they needed, but both of them refuse to acknowledge that it's necessary. we have tried everything we could think of at this point, but it wasn't much. my parents have more or less given up because they've tried things over the years (begged my aunt and uncle to move closer to us, spoke with them about independent living and assisted living facilities, etc.) and nothing has worked. they also say that we cannot force them to do anything they don't want to do, and that they don't want to anger them and ruin the time we all have left together. i went over to their house recently and had a heart-to-heart with my aunt (told her how sorry i was for what she is going through, told her my perspective, offered my help) but that didn't lead anywhere either. if i was able, i would be their live-in caregiver in a heartbeat.  anyone in my family would do that. unfortunately, we all have full-time jobs or are full-time students, and it wouldn't matter anyway because my aunt and uncle wouldn't want that. i just don't know what to do about what's coming...my uncle isn't going to get better, and i'm afraid he will die in terrible accident around the house, which my aunt will have to witness, if my family doesn't do something. but what can we do? edit: in my rant i forgot to mention that my uncle has recently been diagnosed with dementia (though we've suspected it for years)"," in my experience, it has to be their idea to get help.  they fear losing control and so hold onto it fiercely.   all you can do is to keep gently nudging them to accept help.  usually the elderly don't want to accept help because they don't want to be a burden on others.  what they don't understand is that by refusing help they are a bigger burden.  there are lots of in home services like home instead, visiting angels, etc.  there is also a referral service called ""a place for mom"", you tell them what you are looking for and they'll have the right people get in touch with you.  also check into your area wide aging agency.  they also have loads of information.

"i keep meaning to come here and dump our whole situation out, but i’m too exhausted most of the time. basically my husband and i are doing 24/7 live in care for his grandmother. she has alzheimer’s and parkinson’s. it’s getting really rough. among all the abilities that have fallen away, we saw self feeding going soon. we’ve been either feeding her or letting her drop most of her food on a towel.last night i spent an hour in the toddler section and picked up some things for kids just starting to self feed. bowls and plates with high, swooped sides, and utensils that are small but light with big handles. and some cups with lids and straws that are small enough for her to grip, don’t spill, and don’t hold much at once, so they are light.  even a metal sippy meant to keep drinks cold that we put her hot tea in with a koozy on.it’s just day one, but it all worked for her! she fed herself and in record time. plus, they’re much cheaper than adaptive equipment. please feel free to hit up the children’s section if it helps the one you care for."," great work, keep it up. keep her helping her self as long as possible. it’s good for her motor skills and mental stimulation.

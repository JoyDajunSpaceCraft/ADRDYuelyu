my dad is out of town. she keeps forgetting and asking me where he is all the time. so i just started telling her that he‚Äôs out with his friends and he‚Äôs coming back later. my siblings thought i was being insensitive but she literally keeps forgetting everything so i don‚Äôt see how that can be harmful.," as others have said, it's therapeutic lying.  it won't feel great, but it is what she needs in the moment.  don't be too hard on yourself.  i've been caring for my grandma for almost 7 years and right as i feel like i'm getting the hang of it, she starts exhibiting a new tick.  consider keeping her calm, even if you have to lie, a win.  there are so many times we as caregivers lose.  big hugs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/re12os/is_it_okay_to_lie_to_my_grandmother/,[deleted by user]

"my grandmother has dementia and it‚Äôs breaking my heart. we have strong connection as she was the person that raised me and was taking care of me.my mother and father weren‚Äôt involved in my life at all. never took me to the doctor, never took me to school, rarely even talked to me or asked me about myself. everything that was done for me was by my grandmother on my mother‚Äôs side. so i feel responsible and obligated to pay my debt to her by taking care of her instead. until one year ago i was living with her and almost all of her bills were payed by me, most of the shopping was done by me, cleaning, etc. i moved out with my boyfriend and then i started to notice her decline. i thought that it was because of her age and it‚Äôs normal, but in the past few months she stopped cooking, she started to feel confused about things that she easily did before. last week she got lost in the neighbourhood so the police called us to pick her up. she can‚Äôt go to the doctors alone anymore, we‚Äôve forbidden her to go out so she doesn‚Äôt get lost. i know that it only will get worse from now on and i worry how would we manage to care for her.she has three daughters that couldn‚Äôt set in life well. they have low income, one of them is alcoholic, and all 3 of them avoid responsibility for my grandmother. since she worsened they kind of woke up and started to help with more things like bringing her food or taking her on some doctors appointments, but do it on force as they are always agitated around her. the other day one of my aunts took her to the doctors and my grandma complained of her bad attitude. they just don‚Äôt want to deal with her. but i think that it should be their responsibility mostly, i will always help and care whenever i can, but i don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs right that the main responsibility is on me. not only financially, but i initiate doctors appointments, searching for caregivers, vaccinations, etc. and constantly worry about her because i don‚Äôt feel that i can rely on them. it takes a toll on me physically and i‚Äôm a mess.i often think about that i‚Äôm looking after my grandma since i was 21, women in our family have a long life span so at least 10 more years my life will evolve around her. then my aunt (the one that doesn‚Äôt have kids) and my mother would require help too when they grow old. and where am i in my life and when i am going to take care of myself, be happy even? my teen years were awful, we were always poor and had problems. just recently i started to put my life together and this happened. i feel agitated, despaired and feel so many feelings i can‚Äôt begin to describe. i‚Äôm just 26 and i feel like i‚Äôm 50. i don‚Äôt think i can go like this."," no, it's not fair. my father cheated his way through three marriages. he abandoned my brother and me (his only children) because getting some pussy was more important. he doted on his step-children in order to make sure he kept getting laid, and he flew around the us for work, cheating on all his wives with anyone and everyone he could. to this day he'll look me in the eye and say, "" stop calling me dad. i never had any children"". but he'll still ask me where he can find a woman, and he still follows my wife around the house hitting on her.but.... i have to take care of him now, because all those wives and all of their kids have no real ties to him (except that they call on occasion asking about what they might inherit). his care fell on me because i just happened to live in the same town as him when his last wife passed away.  so.. he sits around my house, pisses on my floor, constantly demands that i take him back to his home, and never hesitates to tell me that he hates living with me. yeah, it's not fair. not fair at all. i would say reach out to the alzheimer's association and find a care facility that takes medicaid patients, and/or a lawyer that specializes in elder care (if you can afford it). but also it sounds like you need some help in terms of a support group or maybe a counselor? please, get help for yourself. otherwise you'll sink. and you don't deserve to sink! i might be rambling, but i've been through some ugly shit. sounds like you're going through ugly shit. if i can help you through ugly shit, i'm all about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rdvk8a/its_not_fair/,It‚Äôs not fair
my mum has vascular dementia and lives alone. she's still quite independent but needs some help which i am happy to do. my brothers have never asked how she is or acknowledge what i do but they do visit her once every couple of weeks. turns out she's been saying really horrible and untrue things about me to them for a few months and they've never told me until couple of weeks ago. we had a zoom call and seemed that they accepted i wasn't at fault but now it's all kicked off again and they say i must be doing something wrong if mum so angry and scared of me. i don't know what to do. i know mum needs help so seems cruel to walk away but i feel if i continue to interact with mum she'll keep saying terrible things and if my brothers believe her i'm left very isolated and also vulnerable. i don't have a partner to support me so i feel very alone and not sure what to do.," this happened in my fam too. over the years it has been getting worse and worse. my mom was saying such awful things about the three people whom were doing the most to assist her. i believe this happens a lot with dementia patients. they get really ugly to the ones they're closest to. almost tore the family apart. they still record a lot of interactions with her even if just audio just in case. this year there was finally a formal diagnosis and that really helped bring some trust back between siblings. i agree with some of the other comments, that the other people in your family need to spend a  couple full weeks providing care so they can see.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rdn1zg/my_mum_is_saying_nasty_things_about_me_to_my/,My mum is saying nasty things about me to my brothers and they believe her

okay so i came to visit him for the night and he literally will not leave me alone. i think i'm going to go ahead and leave. i've heard of shadowing their caregivers but damn. i can hardly go to the bathroom. he will stand outside the door and wait for me to come out.do you ever feel like telling them to go away? sometimes i have to fight the urge to tell him to fuck off and leave me alone. he can still walk on his own and go places but he literally does not leave me alone when i'm here. i feel terrible but i'm also an introvert and i can't stand having people in my face. how do you deal with this?," i'm so sorry you're going through this as it's so incredibly frustrating. i definitely fight the urge to tell my grandpa to fuck off everyday as well, so know you're not alone! something that's worked pretty well for me with my grandpa is that when he starts to follow me or is just standing in a room staring at me i'll ask him questions about things that in another room, such as what he's been watching on tv or if he's done anymore on his puzzle. this usually leads to him answering the question, and since he's thinking about that activity he goes back into the other room to continue doing it. if there's something you know that really engages him, utilize it as much as possible as well. i second the other comment with getting him to talk to someone else, it works wonders. however, it also leads to him coming and relaying the entirety of the conversation to me after he hangs up. also, don't be afraid to take small breaks outside of the house when you need them. obviously the person doesn't know what they're doing and how it's impacting the people around them, but it doesn't take away from the strain it puts on us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rdk7at/having_to_fight_the_urge_to_tell_granddad_to_go/,Having to fight the urge to tell granddad to go away

"so i've seen a post from about ten months back that did a great job of gathering resources into one post, but i'm looking for something specific.dad is 73, still working as a janitor, but forgetting names, repeating himself and so on. he's been quite open with me about it (often a few times in the same conversation) and recognises it as dementia. he says he's finding 'strategies to deflect conversation' when he forgets stuff. i guess i want to know from those further down the line what they wish they had done sooner, or different, so i can make a good job of helping him.if it helps, this is in the uk (so nhs), he divorced my mum decades back and i'm one of the few from that family who still see him (no rancour from me, we get on well). his new wife is ten years younger, lovely and good to him but not very bright and aside from their house they have no savings or pension. i see him monthly, at best, so am not a daily carer and he doesn't need one yet. i just love him and want to help but i don't know how."," when my grandpa was in the earlier stages the best things we did was have both power of attorney, as well as power of healthcare. power of attorney was great when my grandpa ended up in the hospital for a few weeks and multiple bills were due that he couldn't handle. my grandpa also has a variety of underlying health conditions and as his dementia progressed he hasn't been able to fully understand medical conversations to make decisions by himself anymore. also talk to him and his doctors about any end of life choices, and get those in place legally. if he does have any underlying medical conditions, get his medical history thoroughly documented: allergies, medications, surgeries, diagnoses. we had such a pain trying to figure that out because everyone had different timelines that didn't match up. id' also recommend seeing a doctor and getting a diagnosis as soon as possible. medications be be started sooner, as well as doctors getting a baseline for his cognitive abilities. having that baseline can be crucial to know the progression of dementia, as well as helping to catch any anomalies, such as strokes/utis later in the disease. i know how overwhelming this can all be at first, but you're doing a great job trying to get ahead of it all now. it may be useful to start making a to do list, organized by priority, and start going from there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rdfo6n/dad_has_early_stages_looking_for_advice/,"Dad has early stages, looking for advice"

"so my grand mother (84) has a few mental illnesses (depression, anxiety...) and takes medication for each of them, and also has undiagnosed (early?) dementia, her memory is horrible, and she always fabricates memories. for example the other day i asked her if she knew when were some sausages cooked and she said that morning, and they had been cooked 2 weeks ago. when i told her that, she said she remembered the sausages being cooked that same morning (fabricated).but yesterday something bad happened. my parents just arrived from vacation, and my dad went to the room were his computer is, that is also the guest room, were my grand mother was staying (she lives on her own sometimes). my grandmother went to the room, and then she said that my father looked at her under the skirt and tried to touch her leg. which i know it's obviously false, as i was hearing everything and the conversations she quoted never happened.it was quite late and i suppose that she was startled that someone was in her room i don't know.we tried to explain to her that it must have been a hallucination but she said that we were calling her a liar and she was telling the truth.how can we handle this situation?thank you", redirect her attention to something else. just change the subject. you should also speak with her dr. about fabricated memories like this.  my mom was able to play my brother and i for at least 5 years because she was pretty independent. it wasn‚Äôt until we spoke with her dr when he ‚Äúcalled‚Äù her in to run some tests. and from that moment forward one of us was always at her appointments. with a proper diagnosis of her condition proper treatment can begin.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rcjrgs/early_dementia_grand_mother_hallucinates_sexual/,[deleted by user]

"tldr: neighbor has taken power of attorney from family friend, is stealing from her, gave her covid, and has turned her against usfor close to 20 years the family has watched after our elderly neighbor, who has no living family.let's call her beth. we've taken her meals 4-5 nights a week (thousands of meals in total), took care of her yard, and countless other small things. since she's gotten older we have checked on her every single day for years. she's considered part of the family, and is very loved. mom considers her like a second mother. my brother (before he moved to college) used to go over 2-3 evenings a week and talk with her for hours.she's been having memory trouble for a couple of years, but starting about 3 months ago she started thinking someone was breaking in at night and moving things around, and that she's being watched through her tv.another neighbor (courtney, whom beth has never liked), started telling beth her suspicions were true.

"&amp;#x200b;most people don‚Äôt realize that one in three people dies with dementia. within 10 years, care costs will double; within 30 years they will triple. that‚Äôs $3 trillion worldwide, so it‚Äôs a huge ticking time bomb that not only affects the people that have dementia but also impacts on the whole healthcare system across the globe.if you look at carers, they have a 50% depression rate and it‚Äôs not the type of depression that your gp will look after, it‚Äôs major depression that requires a psychiatrist. people end up leaving work to become carers, so you have lost hours of productivity and you have the general suffering around it. dementia raises enormous questions around social care and economics ‚Äî how do we effectively deliver health care with an increasingly ageing population?recently, i worked on a short film with one of my friends who is a former bbc director. she wanted to make a piece of work based around the experiences of her own father. he was an iraqi immigrant who lived most of his life in the uk but then died in a british nursing home where they gave very good care but nobody could communicate with him because he had lost the ability to speak english. we felt this was an aspect of dementia ‚Äî and of caring for dementia patients ‚Äî that was really important to highlight in our multi-cultural society.more recently, with my clinical work, i‚Äôve become even more interested in finding innovative ways of treating people with these types of problems. about three years ago i met somebody who specialised in augmented reality. we got together and built an iphone interface for his grandfather, who was suffering very badly with confusion caused by dementia. it was put together in a way that somebody with dementia could still read it. we felt that quite a lot of people might benefit from that because you could, for example, locate your grandfather within short distances. we then received a small grant to test it out in a care home.the really nice thing, even though we were just doing basic stuff, was that the people using it were able to find their own rooms for the first time and we have some evidence that they were even able to walk a little bit further. one of the things that really attracted me to the project was that it was able to integrate with patient‚Äôs real lives. if you think about how monitoring happens, it might involve putting a new device, like a watch, on a patient but those in later stages of dementia won‚Äôt always tolerate putting something new on their bodies or will get very stressed by the introduction of new things. being able to instead put an ipad on people‚Äôs existing infrastructure (using existing walkers they already used) meant they didn‚Äôt fall over, they could tolerate it, and, importantly, even if they didn‚Äôt use it directly, we could still monitor them. or they could point out what they needed to carers.the other thing that you are able to do when you‚Äôre monitoring somebody is to stop things happening before they get worse so you want them to tell people their needs. we can prompt patients to, for example, drink water, or let a carer know they need to go to the loo, or brush their teeth. this also really benefits carers and reduces their stress and depression as it puts them more back into control of the caring process.## what are the key stages of dementia?we first have to start off with saying that everybody is an individual. even in the recognised stages of dementia, there is fluidity and people can move into and out of different stages. in the usa and other places you‚Äôll see the seven stages. in the uk we use a simplified set of 3 stages: mild, moderate, and severe. severe really means you need to receive extra care, moderate is where you need a bit of help, and mild is where you need a very tiny amount of help, so you might need someone popping in once a day, that kind of thing. roughly-speaking, people fall into those categories. again you might have somebody who has risk factors, for example, they might be wandering off, but otherwise, they might be okay. or they might be getting lost all the time and quite vulnerable, which would move them from a very low level into a much higher level.what you might find is that because people are very individual and they have their own needs, it may be something very individual that has caused them to become much worse. so, for example, it might be that they have physical pain, or it might be that a familiar person suddenly isn‚Äôt around. so it‚Äôs a very difficult thing to say what stage a patient is in but what you can say is that the earlier we identify dementia, the more that we can do for people. we can give the right medication, we can put in the right support systems, we can make sure things don‚Äôt go downhill as quickly as they might. for example, we could stop somebody from becoming lost because we‚Äôve already put the things in place to stop them becoming vulnerable at that time.it‚Äôs also important to remember that dementia is not one condition. it‚Äôs an umbrella term for a range of conditions including alzheimer‚Äôs, parkinson‚Äôs and lewy body dementia. lewy body and parkinson‚Äôs dementia are cousins of each other. somebody who has parkinson‚Äôs has a higher chance of also getting a form of dementia. it‚Äôs the same disease process but in a different part of the brain, if you like.## are there any measures that we can all take proactively to mitigate and decrease the stages of dementia?the first thing that you should do is to get power of attorney because one never knows what will happen tomorrow. the next thing is going to be recording and sharing what your favourite songs are because things like songs, smell and environment have a real effect on people‚Äôs wellbeing. and you can‚Äôt tell people that information later on once memory is more badly affected.research from the dementia commission looked into all the reversible causes of dementia. there are some things (around 60%) that we can‚Äôt change but if you look at the other 40% and how it‚Äôs divided up, the biggest part of that 40% is actually hearing. so if you have hearing problems in midlife and you don‚Äôt get a hearing aid, that‚Äôs 10% of your entire risk of getting dementia. the other key parts include smoking and socialization ‚Äî you must socialize and keep talking to people, try to avoid loneliness ‚Äî all these things are so so important. if you can learn something new when you can, that‚Äôs also really important because you‚Äôre exercising your brain in the same way as we all know you need to exercise your muscles.the second part of that question is about what you can do¬†*after*¬†you‚Äôve got that diagnosis. people fall along a spectrum. so, if you‚Äôre quite early on, you‚Äôre still able to say what you want, so make sure you sort out power of attorney. it‚Äôs never a nice time to think about this but think about end of life care planning because you might or might not want a picture of your dog next to you when you‚Äôre in hospital, or you might not want resuscitation, or you may want other specific things to happen when you become incapacitated. so you need to speak to your doctor and your family about that.you do need to go for a walk every day so that the brain gets all this new information, including sunlight, because one of the things that quite often happens is this thing called ‚Äòsundowning‚Äô where the day and night cycles flip. but if you get your melatonin, that can really help, and you‚Äôre then tired at the end of the day which means you sleep better. so make sure people get out, make sure they‚Äôre talking to other people (and sometimes that person might be you because you‚Äôre the only one that speaks that language) but make sure a dementia sufferer is talking to people, ideally new people.make sure people are eating well and make sure their pain is controlled. people with dementia don‚Äôt always express themselves in the way that we might. they won‚Äôt tell you they‚Äôve got pain but there might be behavioural impacts, so it might be really difficult for people to speak about that pain but they might scream, they might shout, they might become very agitated. so make sure to also get regular checkups by the gp and get a medication review. some medications can make people more confused on top of their current level of confusion. so it‚Äôs always better to minimise that, for example, we always tell primary care practitioners to minimise opioids, because treating dementia is about looking at the whole person. these are all actually really simple things that can help to slow the progress of dementia down."," wow, fantastic read.  my

"i just want to apologize for how long this is i just want everyone to have a clear picture.so i am very concerned about my grandmother's state atm. i will try to give you a quick rundown of the situation. my grandmother has always had slight memory problems all my life(i lived at my grandparents and currently am now) anyways she has had some medical problems she had her bladder removed years ago cuz of cancer and more recently(1-2 years) has had some kidney issues. anyways a few months ago she got real sick and was in the hospital and ended up having to have a major high risk surgery cuz something happened with her pee bag(sorry don't know medical term) and basically urine wasn't leaving her body. so everything went great and we were happy but we did notice her memory problems dramatically increased and got worse. not to the point of anything significant but definitely noticable. i will say before that my mom had taken over doing the bills for her because over time she was getting more and more confused with them and accidently putting herself in negative. (a few months before she got sick) so my mom took over money and bills but she was still involved and aware. fast forward to like a week and a half 2 weeks ago she had randomly started getting extremely tired and slowly over time had to do less and less.(she's always been very independent like washing clothes grocery shopping and loved playing her computer games) we get her to the dr and he does a blood test and calls back the next day and says it's something with her kidneys so we get her apt for 2 days from then. well we had to call an ambulance cuz she was so bad off we didn't think she would make it that long. it ended up being a uti they said and she had lost alot of weight. so they get it under control and she comes home and her mental state has dramatically gotten worse and changed. she never knows the time, wakes up crying randomly in the middle of the night thinking everyone just left her alone and it's day time so i sit with her and keep her calm, and is confused and always wants to sleep. what i worry about most is she is not eating.. i don't understand why she won't eat.. i got her some high calorie boost drinks that i can once in awhile get her to drink. i try to explain to her the importance of her needing to eat and tell her that's probably why she is feeling so bad and tired. we make sure she gets her meds on time and i just don't know what to do. she is able to walk and use the bathroom on her own and knows who we are etc, but her not eating is scaring me and her memory. she don't remember conversations we have even if it's just 5 minutes later. every day she seems worse and gets up less and less. today i went to check on her at like 11 pm or so and she seemed completely normal asked what time it was and if my grandpa was watching tv when i told her if was 11 at night she was totally surprised. we talked for a minute and i had an idea and told her i had to go to the gas station and asked if she wanted any cookies or anything like that(she loves sweets) and she just said no she wasn't hungry but thank you i again tried to tell her it was from her not eating and she just kinda gave me a blank look and didn't really say much then asked for a mcdonald's coffee. so i left the room got my shoes on and got her night meds and went back in(5 mins tops) and she had no idea that i had just been in there and no recollection of our conversation. i still got her a coffee and when i brought it to her if was literally the same convo as the first one but she wasnt the same she was confused and literally just from sitting up she said she was so tired but couldn't figure out why. i am so emotionally drained i don't know what to do anymore i've been closero her then anyone my whole life and i can't help her or get her to understand or remember. my family says there's nothing we can do and it was only going to get worse and to try to prepare and enjoy the time with her but i guess i just don't want to accept that and still have a hope she may be at least a little better soon and that it was probably just from the infection she had. she hasn't even mentioned bills or money or driving or anything. she hasn't been officially diagnosed with anything but i assume and my family has to for a long time now(3-5 yrs) that she has dementia. i guess i always thought it just made people forget stuff and not do this.. any advice or thoughts or anything. why would she decline so rapidly to being basically fine other then minor memory problems to how she is now? i'm sorry for how long this is."," i‚Äôm so sorry. it must be so hard seeing your grandma go through this. unfortunately, it sounds exactly like typical dementia behavior. i go through this every day with my mom. she has a uti every other month. each time her dementia gets a little worse. mom has days where she sleeps 20 out of 24 hours. this can go on for days. then she‚Äôll have what i call, ‚Äúwoke‚Äù days. she‚Äôs awake most of the day, she talks (a lot) and wants to eat every couple hours. her new thing now and this is really hard, is asking me to take her home. she is home! she wants to go back to the home where she lived as a child and she can‚Äôt understand that she has been living in this house, her home that she bought, for the last 5 years. mom can‚Äôt remember anything that happened 5 minutes ago even on her woke days. it just hard and heartbreaking to watch. i do my best to keep her hydrated and clean. i always make sure she takes her meds and is comfortable and warm. my own doctor told me i am earning ‚Äúsoul points‚Äù by taking care of my mom. you are too. this isn‚Äôt easy and your grandma is so lucky and blessed to have you loving and caring for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r8lx0v/very_worried_advice_needed/,Very worried advice needed

"hi all, i'm looking for any suggestions on ways to increase my grandpa's engagement with activities, outings, or generally anything. i'm sorry it's long, but i'm getting a bit worried with winter around the corner that it'll be hard for him, and am looking for any advice, help, or suggestions that anyone has!my grandpa is in his 80s and has vascular dementia, and is largely in denial about having it or having any significant declines, other than his mild physical declines from a stroke earlier this year. he can do most things an 80 year can do by himself, but due to the declines we make sure to supervise physical activities like walks and yardwork. this has led to a lot of frustration on his end, claiming we don't let him do anything and he could do these things if we would let him. the area most significantly impacted is his cognitive abilities.my grandpa spends his entire day in the living room watching tv, occasionally working on jigsaw puzzles, and doing laundry every few days. however, more and more frequently he's been making comments about how he doesn't do anything all day and comments implying he doesn't like to just sit and watch tv, but i'm at a loss of what to do. we give him a handful of ""worksheets"" in the morning that were given to us by his rehab nurses when he was discharged, and he used to enjoy doing them, but lately he's started to complain about not knowing why he has to do them still. i would love to do more things with him during the day, but whenever i try it just doesn't really work. my mom and i have both planned outings with him, and every time it's been a shit show. he insists he's not going, finally agrees but complaining the whole time, and then on the way back he's happy and says it was great and he wants to get out more. due to my grandpa having intense paranoia/anxiety from prior to his stroke/dementia we tell him the day of or the day before for these outings. i know that his behavior shouldn't stop us from taking him places as he does eventually enjoy himself, but it takes so much patience and ends up ruining the experience for us. the same thing happens when we try to suggest us setting up a time for him to see his friends or family in the area (he doesn't drive so we would need to take him). he says he doesn't want to go, or agrees to go but he only wants to stay for 15-20 minutes, but when we pick him up he's happy and talking about how great it was. when it comes to activities, he refuses and doesn't change his mind. directly after his stroke he was really motivated and engaged, so my mom and i did research and bought things specifically for people with dementia. but over the last 3 months he's slowly stopped wanting to do them and when we try to get him to join he just says no and goes to watch tv. it's a struggle to get him to even go out for a walk anymore, and with the winter months and cold weather coming so soon i know he's going to be stuck in the house even more. he's also withdrawing from any social activities within the immediate family. for example, for thanksgiving it was only my mom, me, my grandpa, and two additional family members he's comfortable around, and he was trying to eat by himself in the living room while watching tv rather than sitting with us and after dinner we tried to get him to join us for a game and before we had a chance to even say what game it was he was up and walking into the living room saying he didn't want to and that he was going to go watch tv.the only activity he seems somewhat interested in are his puzzles, but that's starting to decrease as well. when he finishes one he starts talking about how he thinks that'll be his last one for a while and he sometimes gets upset when my mom and i give him another one. at first i thought that it was because my mom and i were buying them online and he wasn't able to pick out the design, but when we've been out shopping i've tried to have him pick some out and he says he doesn't want anymore and walks away.i've been reading up on dementia and one of the things they say is to try to bring the hobbies the person once had to their level, but i haven't really found anything about how to increase engagement once you do that. my grandpa loved gardening, so my mom and i bought his favorite flowers for him to tend to on our porch. he did it for a day and then never touched them again, leaving them to me and my mom, and when we try to get him to, he would say maybe later and when we'd remind him he would say he would do it tomorrow. my grandpa loved card games so i've tried to get him to play war or go fish, but he says he isn't interested right now and goes to watch tv. the worst part is that he has a long list of specifics for the movies/tv shows he'll watch, so the content out there for him is dwindling, and he has started to even complain about not having anything to watch. i'm starting to worry we'll run out of things for him to do this winter!is this lack of engagement normal? could it be caused by depression, as my grandma passed away a few years ago in winter? as sad as it is to say, my grandpa was always the sick one and we suspect that he never thought he would outlive her and that he isn't sure what to do without her. are my mom and i doing something wrong or going about it the wrong way? we've talked about forcing him to turn the tv off and do things, but that feels mean and wrong. is he embarrassed to go out or do things because then his declines become that much more apparent, as we think he's aware enough to realize there's been changes, but not aware enough to process how significant they are.**tl/dr**: my grandpa has vascular dementia with mild physical decline and moderate cognitive decline but refuses to do anything other than watch tv but complains about doing nothing but watching tv. doesn't want to go out, see people, or do anything else, withdraws from any and all social activities, and complains the entire time when we do take him out but eventually admits to enjoying himself. is there anything that i can or change to help increase his engagement in things?", i got my dad an adult ‚Äúbusy board‚Äù also called activity board. there are a bunch on etsy if you want to take a look. it may be another tool in your puzzle toolbox you can use. i also picked up several active minds jigsaw puzzles that are specifically geared towards dementia patients. i found with my dad i can only hold his focus on something for a finite amount of time so just needed to be ready to shift gears when that happened.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r7f605/ways_to_increase_engagement_with_familyfriends/,"Ways To Increase Engagement with Family/Friends, Outings, Hobbies?"

"my dad's father is 84. he is developing early stages of dementia and it has accelerated quite fast since february 2021 but he started showing signs in late 2020. he started living alone after my nana who also has alzheimers needed to go into long-term care. he has trouble with his short-term memory and is often unaware what day it is. he also struggles to cook for himself. he eats tinfood for every meal (creamed rice) and a meat patty, no veggies or anything else, old food that's been in the fridge or freezer for months, and he doesn't drink water he only drinks cola or coffie and biscuits. and sometimes puts his clothes on backwards etc. so he is slowly deteriorating. he also has a personality disorder: narcissistic personality disorder. he is always in need of excessive admiration and is prone to playing mind games and manipulation. he is extremely good at lying and a master of deception so it's not until you spend time with him that you see him slip up. his long term memory is amazing and fully intact but it's just his judgement and thinking and planning skills and short-term memory are deteriorating. my grandad is a very smart man who used to hunt, fish, live in the hills deer hunting alone for months at a time, ride horses, create art and furniture, fix vehicles, and create things. he is also well adept at engineering as he used to manage a engineering company. but now he can't even understand how to work a phone or turn on things he has this fixation with taking things apart. he has taken apart phones, machines etc. because he thinks they are broken but in reality they are just flat or not even switched on in the first place. we also took his guns off him because last year he threatened to commit suicide but he is cunning and able to manipulate others and friends of his to give him guns to ""borrow"" because he owns some sheep and he lives on a 4ha farm. he he is now in early stage dementia and both of his brothers had and have passed. we are thinking of getting him in home help and meals on wheels so he can relax and not be so stressed and begin eating properly. does anyone have any thoughts on this? he also lives very far from us but we are going to visit at xmas."," i'd say you're on the right track:  in-home help with meals, making sure laundry is done, trash is attended to / not piling up, etc.  those are good first steps.based on the terminology you're using i'm guessing you all are somewhere in europe.  i am not sure what the laws look exactly but i'd endeavor to make certain he has an official clinical diagnosis from a neurologist or some other specialists.  gps/internists/family docs can generally do a first-level neuro exam and a neurologist can confirm.  this can then facilitate powers of attorney (personal/medical and financial) and potentially conservatorship and guardianship, which it sounds like he's headed to quite quickly. given how it seems to be going for him already i would seriously start thinking about how to ""downsize"" his life, rapidly.  him being alone and away on some distant farm house for long periods probably is going to be very bad for him.  how will you know if he has a serious medical incident or does things that are dangerous for him on a daily basis?  he probably already is - given all you're saying - and is likely frequently doing things that are not good for him, his home, his personal possessions, etc.  assuming he owns his property i'd be pushing as quickly as possibly toward conservatorship.  well regardless i'd be doing that.  it can be quite a while for those wheels to turn in the legal world - though emergency conservatorship assignments can happen pretty quickly.  depending on his financial situation i'd look toward getting him into a situation that makes caring for him as direct and straightforward as possible.  my mom had been living on her own in an apartment when she started declining and was in and out of the hospital frequently when we were basically forced to deal with the situation.  long of it is she ended up in a small retirement community where all meals are provided and she has her own room, tv, etc.  the whole process took nearly 2 years start to finish to get her moved in with us, get the exams and the poas setup, get the conservatorship going, then get her moved into her own place again where she has a moderate level of daily supervision (not true assisted living, but ""independent"" living.  it was incredibly difficult having her live with us so i'd suggest doing as much as possible to get his affairs and life in order so that as the decline worsens you're best prepared to deal with all outcomes and get him the care he needs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r70atm/84_yo_grandfather_with_narcissistic_personality/,84 y/o grandfather with narcissistic personality disorder developing alzheimers.

"my mom has been suffering from vascular dementia secondary to crohn‚Äôs disease since about february of this year. her decline was very rapid, which i recognize as a blessing in the grand scheme of things. we had her on home hospice after two months of hospitalization, but due to her ostomy bag and bedridden status, she needed round the clock care in order to be comfortable. so, we did what she told me never to do and had her go to a nursing home (still in hospice care). her time at home, though chaotic and uncomfortable for a variety of reasons, was a gift because her six grandsons were all able to come see her one last time. obviously they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to in hospital or a facility due to covid restrictions.she spent two weeks in skilled nursing, and her depression lifted and it was obvious she was much more comfortable. i really thought she may live several more months at least, maybe enough time to get her into a wheelchair and out of her room. but it was not to be.this morning i walked in around 10:15 and immediately noticed she had had a stroke. the right side of her face was drooping slightly and she was leaning to that side. but her arms and legs could move evenly and she was lucid.we had a good hour visit. we laughed, watched some cute animals on tv, talked about family, looked at pictures. i fed her a yogurt drink, a baby food pouch, and gave her water. noticed she was having trouble with the straw. my dad was there, too. but i noticed her fingers and around her mouth were purplish and she was cold to the touch, so i asked the nurse to get vitals. i wanted to be prepared for end of life signs, but i also suspected her oxygen sats were low and she would need comfort care with oxygen.her o2 was great, but her body temp was 85! so i thought, okay this is a sign her body is shutting down and i should be prepared for her passing in the next few days. well, after her vitals, my dad got really anxious and made way to leave. he said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you have to pick up (your youngest) from preschool?‚Äù i said ‚Äúyeah in an hour. i‚Äôm going to stay with her a little longer.‚Äù he packed up and gave her one last kiss goodbye, which she reciprocated. that was the last lucid thing she did.i kid you not, the second the door closed after him, she turned to me and her breathing was labored. she had a glossy look come over her. i prayed over her, told her i loved her and she was a good mom, and said to go with the angels. i know people tend to stay in this state of agonal breathing for hours and even days before death, but for her it was only five minutes. she was waiting for us to come, to say goodbye to my dad, and for him to leave. i‚Äôm honored she felt comfortable enough with me to succumb in my presence. her facility has had a covid outbreak, and pending one more confirmed case, they were going to shut down visitors.i feel incredibly lucky to have been able to be by her side and usher her through with dignity. i know our journey was incredibly short compared to most, but i wanted to share that in the end, it was intense and beautiful. thank you for all your support these past confusing months, and know i pray for you all.", i was a daddy‚Äôs girl with. 6 day hospice story to tell i sleep there as well. his last night i talked him into going..it has taken me a long time to be able to coherently retell the experience and i sincerely appreciate your clarity and thank you letting us share it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r6wz9p/my_mom_died_today/,My mom died today

"i just needed five minutes. i went outside for 5 minutes, and left my grandma inside with my grandpa, husband, and three children. not even 2 minutes later my grandma, who has vascular dementia as of august of this year, was screaming and yelling at my middle child, a 10-year old girl. because my grandma told her she could watch tv and then decided that she had stolen the remote and was screaming at her about how dumb she was and how she didn't want to be around her. we just sold our house and bought their house and moved in, we are financing everything, and yet she continues to treat my daughter the way she treated me when i was that little. the difference is that i was conditioned to accept it and my daughter is not. she was crying so much, and is having trouble understanding why grammas being so mean lately. of course i stood up for my daughter, told my grandma she cannot talk to her that way, told my grandma she cannot give permission for her to do something and then take it away just because, but at the end of the day it just felt like i was bullying somebody who doesn't know any better. it felt like she did know what was going on, like when i was little, and she was only acting confused when confronted. but then i reminded myself that she has an actual mental disease affecting her brain, and i cannot assume that her behavior is normal when it is constantly going to be impacted by her dementia. but what do i do? how do i protect my children, and protect my grandma from the disease that is eating away at her brain? how do i tell my children to ignore her, when their entire lives have been about listening to her and behaving for her? i really need some advice, i don't really have anyone to talk to about this."," you say you want advice.move grandma out, now. do not subject your children to her. your job as parent is to protect your children, and you've just put them in harm's way, deliberately.fix it. grandma is sick and has to go away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r65ack/ramtventadvice_needed/,Ramt/Vent/Advice needed!!
"my husband advances with ftd ppa every day since his diagnosis 5 years ago. never once have his grown children ever called, emailed or texted to ask how he is. the youngest one demands to see the will and wants to know how much money she will get, and went so far last summer to point her finger into his chest and yell dont you dare ever sell this house. i have been married to their father for 17 years and took care of them most of the time when they were teenagers. i am so sad that they have never asked about his well/being. i hate that they are selfishly demanding some entitlement, and not even caring about their dad. thoughts?"," and you‚Äôre right, i do expect them to tantrum about the money when he goes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r659di/a_rant_family_who_dont_care/,[deleted by user]

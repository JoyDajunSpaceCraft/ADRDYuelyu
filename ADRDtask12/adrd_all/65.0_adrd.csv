"my father has been diagnosed with possible parkinson's and one thing that has become very obvious is that he's increasingly paranoid, thinking everyone is lying and disrespecting him. he's always been a loud complainer but now it's getting worse and worse. problem is that he's a successful businessman, used to being the boss and has been running out family for years. he's in complete denial too. anyone has any experience with such a situation?", yes i have noticed that my dad’s challenging personality traits have become more pronounced and he’s absolutely more irritable. i think the loss of control is especially difficult for people who are used to being in charge. also there is a loss of impulse control that comes with pd that results in less interest in getting along and being polite. is he on meds yet? that does help a bit.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rm40zd/powerful_patriarch_unreasonable_rude_and_in_denial/,"Powerful patriarch - unreasonable, rude and in denial"

"my dad and some of his brothers have it. i guess it’s something that runs in the family. i really fucking hate that one day i can wake up and become virtually useless and forget everything and basically become helpless. it’s the worst feeling knowing that can happen to you. i’m only 18, so it really sucks knowing this. it actually really possess me off that i could have any thing i ever wanted life and basically lose it because of dimensia.now maybe my dad and brothers developed it due to shitty life of drugs and smoking/drinking/degenerate lifestyle. but regardless its still in the blood.is there a way to test if i would get it from genetics? i’m not joking, i’d rather die at 50 and live a great life than make it to 90 spending the last 20 years of my life with dimensia and being helpless/ cared for with nothing but a shell of my former self. please guys, even my 11 year old brother is afraid to get dimentia when he’s older. it’s such a rage-inducing feeling knowing i could get that. i’m not trying to suggest anything , but if i knew it was coming, i could end the suffering before the symptoms started.", sorry you have to deal with this! there are others going through it too who you may find comfort in ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rlze21/im_pretty_sure_dimentia_runs_in_my_bloodline/,I’m pretty sure dimentia runs in my bloodline :/

"hi:i’m a new member and wanted to say hello. i am concerned that my 80 year old mom is showing signs of cognitive decline and memory loss. i’m not sure how to proceed. just a little background.my mom and i are not particularly close, and we are both independent women. our relationship has had its ups and downs and we’re definitely not the mother/daughter types who are constantly on the phone with each other. i’m (for all intents and purposes) an only child. i live two hours away from where she lives and i grew up – a small town in northern michigan. throughout her work life she was very sharp and good with computers. she worked as an executive assistant to a city manager, and then later part-time in a nonprofit office. she enjoys and is very dependent on technology like email and streaming services. but lately she’s been struggling with it. i got her a smartphone for christmas and it’s not been going well. mostly i got it so that we could text with each other, but she’s keeping it shut off most of the time. i visited this past weekend and we walked through placing an online grocery order. i’ve been placing orders for her during the pandemic, but she’d like to do it herself. i saw that she keeps a folder of word documents with step-by-step instructions on how to do things. we went through the steps of placing the grocery order six times, while she wrote down notes. she would forget things she did just a few minutes prior. she also seems to forget things we talk about in our weekly zooms. i guess i’d like some advice on when it’s time to broach the subject of talking to her doctor about testing. also, when is it time to take a more active role in things like finances, etc? these are all so delicate. thanks for listening."," these issues with tech do sound pretty typical for an octogenarian. nevertheless, you should talk to her about arranging poa and advance directives. by the time you actually need to use either of these documents, it’s already too late because they must be signed while “of sound mind”. talk to her about getting her assets into trusts so that she will qualify for medicaid, without draining the entire estate (if she cares about you inheriting anything), by the time she actually needs it. another one of these legal documents that have to be written long before it’s needed. there is a 5 year look-back period for example. some conditions have symptoms that similar to dementia but might actually be reversible or at least stop progression, rule these out first ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rknjk9/starting_the_journey/,Starting the journey

"if you take the time to read all of this, i appreciate it. i just needed to take time to say it all, hoping that being able to read it later will help me understand my place in this better.the story begins about 2 and a half years ago when my father's doctor let on that my father was showing definitive signs of cognitive decline. looking back we realize that we had actually been seeing signs for a few years prior, but were in denial of what it could mean.my father is second youngest of 9 children. at, now, 80 years old, he has only one surviving sister. he has lost three sisters, one brother and his mother to various forms of dementia/alzheimer's.things took a hard turn in september of 2020. my dad is a former truck driver(medically retired in 1999). since retirement, he has done side work for various companies that allowed him to continue driving long distances and allowed him to do what he loved most, bring on the road.september of 2020, my mother received a phone call from the man my father worked for most often. he was returning with my father to florida(home) from arkansas when my father became despondent and was having difficulty driving. they stopped to eat, he noticed my father shaking as if scared, and had trouble drinking his coffee. he said my dad was complaining of severe pain in his leg, but couldn't see anything wrong. they safely made it back close to home where my cousin was able to meet with, and drive my father home.the next day, he seemed weary from the drive, but otherwise fairly ""normal"". he did continue to complain about a pain in his leg, that now seemed to be pink, but not alarming, like he had been scratching at it.the next day we took him to his doctor, because we were still concerned about what had happened. his doctor, not a neurologist, but specializes in cognitive decline, tells us that the episode on the road was another ""step"" in dad's progression. doctor tells us, and my dad who denies it, that he should no longer drive. i took this especially hard. my dad was always a big, strong man. he always provided for our family and his keys were his freedom. the doctor might as well have told me that he was taking superman's cape cause he couldn't fly anymore. very hard day.dad continued to complain about his leg, but to summarize that portion of the story... he had been bitten by a brown recluse spider, which led to a three night hospital stay, a surgery to remove necrotic mass and a skin graft. this also came along with 3 weeks of home care visits to clean and redress the surgery site.we began to notice severe changes in his mental processing from this point. he began to have constant issues using his cell phone, though he never was good at it anyway, and had trouble using the television remote. he also began to complain about being cold all of the time. it was real rough for about three months, but seemed to get better in february this year. our biggest issues were his insistence that he could drive and the god damned sweepstakes mailers that seem to come every fucking day. (pardon my language, but this item is still one of our biggest hurdles)mid april, my wife of 22 years informs me that she no longer wants to be married. we were in the process of finding a new rental to move to with our two children (17 &amp; 13). as things shook out on this front, i moved my wife and children into a small apartment and i moved in with my parents. at roughly the same time my mother retired from her 50+ year career as a hair dresser.my separation from my wife was very hard, but not ugly. we made the kids the priority and that has kept things fairly smooth, but my life was suddenly thrown in a blender. not seeing my children every day and having to help care for my father and help my mother financially was a cold hard kick to the face.recently we've had to do some substantial work on the house which required repainting the entire common area of the house. this has presented summer new challenges with dad. he no longer recognizes it as home. it's familiar, he knows where everything is and had no trouble finding things where they have always been, but he is convinced that it is a hotel built just like ""our old house"".i'm tired. physically, emotionally.... mentally. not to mention financially.my mom is a strong woman, but years of standing on her feet have left her with bad knees and hips. she suffers from fibromyalgia and lupus and is now care taker for her husband of over 50 years. they have a very limited income, and like most lower-middle-class families, some unsettled debt.the house is in a state of diminishing returns unless we experience some sort of financial windfall.all of this had been extremely taxing on my mother and i. and i have taken the brunt of it to honor the woman my mother has always been and the man my father raised me to be. but it hasn't been without it's hits to my mental and physical will being.i've put so much into helping my parents, my wife and kids and my full time job, where the livelihoods of 7 other people feel like they are my responsibility. i've pushed myself so hard that my mom has begged my best friend to drag me out of the house if necessary, just to have a break.my oldest brother is constantly reminding me that i don't have to do this alone, but he is starting a new chapter in his life as he is getting married to a wonderful woman. his first wife passed nearly for years ago. he deserves to be happy for the 8 years he took care of his first wife as she began to slip away.my other brother is a self absorbed alcoholic who prefers to act like it's not that big of a deal.all of that said... i'm not sure what the future holds. i realize now that i never knew how much my dad meant to me until i realized the man in front of me is not the same man.i worry my mom will kill herself trying to continue to love the only man she has ever loved.i worry, one day, my children will be writing this same message.i know i'm not the only one out here, but it is such a lonely place to be. the people who understand why you do it, don't know how much you do. the people that see how much you do, can't comprehend why you do it.i know tomorrow's another day, another challenge, another smile, another tear. but it's also one more day i get with my dad.thank you for reading.maybe i said something that someone else needed to hear."," that's a lot to handle at once and sounds like you're managing to be the man your parents raised you to be.  i'm doing my best too, and some of your story sounds familiar to me.  i'm just trying to do everything i can to help my parents and knowing that caring for my dad is very taxing for my mom and i'm afraid it's going to kill her too.&#x200b;this will be my dad's last christmas at home , he doesn't know it yet but within the next couple months he will be in a long term care facility,  so i'm really struggling to try and focus on all the good old times rather than on the fact that the good old times are over.   i like your perspective ""one more day i get with my dad"" because that's how i need to be reminded to look at it... sometime soon there will be no more days with my dad",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rkf2tf/my_story_long_read_but_i_need_to_get_it_out/,"My story.

"apologies if this ends up reading as stream of consciousness-y. i just need to get this off my chest.my father has had health issues for most my life (i'm 29m; health issues really began when was i six). when i was 21, he started experiencing what seemed like mini-strokes, and eventually started experiencing signs of dementia. that year, i came to terms with the fact that my father could die at any moment.what's come to surface almost a decade later is how painful it is to lose someone who's still alive. i mean, we can talk sometimes, but his dementia is only getting worse. i frankly hate going to my parents' home because he's often so out of it, and with my mother being his caregiver i feel as if i'm inhaling her fear and despair. i know this makes me selfish, and i feel like i should be around more, but it's...so frightening. i just want to run it from it. and i often find myself wishing he'd die soon before the dementia totally consumes him, and also so my mother can be free.i've spoken with my father about the dementia; we're able to joke about it. i'm glad his sense of humor is still rich. he's aware of his delusions, that they are just that when i reason with him, but he's incapable of keeping himself from leaning into them. he's made it clear he often doesn't know where he is, but is nonetheless comfortable, so at least there's that. i've also spoken to him about death, and whether he fears it. he says he doesn't, which is comforting at least for me.  when i was 21 i just had no idea how persistently painful this would be. i came to terms with him dying physically, but coming to terms with his mental death is a fucking mountain to climb.", i feel the same way. trying to enjoy the months or couple years my mom has left but it's overshadowed by the fear of not knowing how long she still has some of her mind. what sucks the most is there's nothing we can do and the parent has no idea that they're losing time.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rjn38p/coming_to_terms_with_losing_someone_whos/,Coming to terms with losing someone who's currently alive

"so my grandparents have always wanted to retire to puerto rico, which is where they were born. 20 years ago they went. about 10 years ago we noticed memory issues with my grandmother. about 3 years ago it started to get bad. i’m not sure what type of dementia she has, since medical care down there can be a little odd. what is the most frustrating, though, is that they refuse help. they have places to live in the northeast, but they won’t go. they have offers for aides to assist them, but they refuse. even something as simple as someone to take care of their large yard or clean the house is met with resistance. my grandfather is nearly 90. the situation is not getting better, and is an endless source of worry. at any time this could become dire and our ability to help in any way, besides my mom literally retiring early and moving in with them, is restricted by their stubbornness."," first of all, this is from a european perspective. i recently talked with my aunt (85) about getting old and about expectation of old people at her age. (she is the opposite of dementia and i think i have to consult her experience some more)she told me, old people grew up in a world, where they witnessed that their family did care for their elders and had the spare time to do so. this expectation is often still present, while the world has changed.but back to the stubbornness of your grandfather. if they wont accept the help you and your family is offering - you cannot force them but you should observe (i.e. neglect of the house(hold), and his wife). i'm quite certain that there will be a point in time where he'll realize that he cannot handle anymore. worst case he's already in some kind of depression that he ""doesn't care"" and is overwhelmed already.personally i do not agree to give up your life to take care of someone. on the other hand, even if temporary, living with them might present a better chance to understand why he's refusing help, time for constructive straight talk with one goal in mind, offering all the help available and choosing the best options. as always, everything helps. then go forward and implement these changes. but be clear about it. if they expect your family to bear the burden alone, this ain't gonna happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rizyob/just_need_to_vent/,Just need to vent

"for context: i'm (23f) and the caretaker of my paternal grandmother (88), who has argueably mild symptoms, but requires a lot of my care and attention.  it's just me, my father (63) and my grandmother in our family, as the rest has passed away or been astranged for sometime now. he lives 8 hours away and visits on holidays and calls 2-3 times a month. he knows absolutely nothing about the how difficult it is mentally, physically and financially to have to deal with this and no matter what he says i am truely doing it completely alone. my dad calls and tries to order me to do this and that around the house. he wants a full bathroom renovation and he wants me to go through the basement and attic and get rid of old junk. my grams has basically become a horder in her dementia and won't throw away even a used napkin and hides them around the house. she has full panic attacks i.e shakes, cries, collapses when i try to throw things away and also when i have to call the plumber or whatever to fix an actual issue that needs to be fixed. this has happened multiple times a month and it takes hours and hours or her asking the same questions and bursting into tears over nothing over and over again. i am kind and i am patient with her and i also make sure that the house stays sanitary and i throw away actual garbage during the night and naps. a full bathroom renovation??? i mean its not the best looking bathroom in the world, but its functional, clean and has nothing mechanically wrong with it!!! my grams has begged me multiple times to wait until she passes to do any big renovations because she says she can't take it and i quite agree. he legitimately screams at both of us, telling us we don't know what we are talking about and that we are putting off the inevitable and itll be more money if we wait. that doesnt matter to me though. its my grams house and when she passes, we can use that money to renovate, its not needed now! her inheritance is being split between my dad and i 50/50 and he knows that i don't want to sell the house, so does he think its not coming out of his wallet if its fixed before she passes? i have no idea but i wish he would fuck off legitimately. he's coming for christmas and honestly i wish he just wouldn't. he's left me to take care of her over a year ago and moved far away and regularly questions my decision making when it comes to her and i can't stand it. i'm perfectly equipped to handle it without his help hey dad fuck off thanks for coming to my ted talk"," it never ceases to amaze me the amount of stories i read here from grandchildren who are expected to take care of their parents, parents. i would never expect that of my kids, and i'm my moms caregiver right now.sorry but your dad sounds like a selfish prick. he's making you prep the house for sale while the person living in it is still alive. nasty.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/riyyaa/my_father_is_in_denial_and_it_makes_it_all_much/,my father is in denial and it makes it all much worse (a rant)

"hello people of r/dementia. i hope that you are all coping as best as you can. i have been here watching this sub-reddit and the parkinson's one for a few years. i've found them a source of some comfort.this isn't a call for help, or advice. i just need a place to write in the company of people who can relate.&amp;#x200b;i have recently been confronted with my dad's startling decline with dementia. he was diagnosed early 2021 with dementia with lewy bodies. he initially refused to even consider the diagnosis. he had an existing parkinson's diagnosis for around three years at this point. i definitely noticed a change ahead of the dementia diagnosis though. he could not operate things like remote controls or telephones at all. even with a painfully obvious lists of instructions with diagrams.the level of incomprehension was astounding which led to his appointment at the memory clinic and subsequent diagnosis.&amp;#x200b;in june he spent a month in hospital after being found alone on his kitchen floor. we armchair consultants suspect a minor stroke occurred, but we'll probably never know.during his stay at hospital his condition was severe. i was confronted with the ""would you be surprised?"" question. this is a tool used to by doctors to gauge confidence of prognosis. such as, ""would you be surprised if my dad passes away in the next 12 months?"". the doctor said she would not be surprised. this left me a little scared but somehow comforted that we would not have to wait long. i'm perhaps most afraid of the lengths of time that someone can last with this condition.&amp;#x200b;now he has been in a care home for five months, and has no idea what is going on. thankfully, he does not appear to be too alarmed. his sores from the floor have healed and i thought he was stabilising. having rung the home today they think he is in rapid decline, frequent falls (i get a phone call for each), unable to be left alone in room because he tears it apart (flinging clothes etc all over).visits are short or cancelled because of coronavirus or some vomiting bug. phone calls are interrupted or difficult because they take place in a communal setting on his end. he regularly says ""i'll call you back"" and hangs up. of course, i then have to ring back. last time someone was just screaming their head off in the background.&amp;#x200b;i often think back to the last time we went out for dinner roughly two weeks before his fall. we always went out for pizza, ever since i was a child. that day i called him that day and we agreed a time for dinner. independent of me he arrived at the restaurant on time his jacket *almost* over his shoulder. he ordered his food, he drank his drink, he ate his own pizza. i mean it wasn't perfect, but i did not help one bit. we talked about the usual things we would talk about - music, london, when i would be visiting again.&amp;#x200b;i wish i'd known that you could sort out power of attorney online for 85 quid. we were endlessly going between him and his solicitor. he even consulted a financial advisor who said ""of it's just a bit of paper that you file away for later"", which did nothing to assist us with the urgency. he finally made an appointment with the solicitor but sadly made it into hospital two days ahead of that. poa online here - [i wish we could just talk about what we used to enjoy talking about. instead, i'm now asked to follow up on a recent delusion. sadly, he remembers that he has asked me to do this, so i need follow up answers.i wish i could know the prognosis more clearly. i have no confidence with dealing with his possessions. i am an only child and he is a single man.i wish i wasn't keeping a spreadsheet tracking his [seven stages of dementia]( and each fall.i wish i'd known that pizza was our last meal out together like that.&amp;#x200b;i could not have asked for a better dad. i just cannot believe it has turned out this way."," dementia/alzheimer’s is a cruel disease.  eventually the patient doesn’t know what’s going on around them but we loved ones deal with all the stress and anxiety.  every time my mom’s memory care unit called, my first reaction was “f*ck” and my heart would race.  it was often a fall, or she needed her meds tweaked, or best of all, simply that she needed more supplies.  i’m sorry you are going through this.  you are lucky you had a wonderful relationship with him. my mom passed away in early november and while there is a definite void and loss, i am also relieved.  i am sleeping better and not stressing when my phone rings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rimfyv/rambling_thoughts/,Rambling Thoughts

father with moderate dementia/early onset alzheimer's for nearly a decade.  still mostly functions on his own.going for a second opinion due to suspicion of lewy bodies based on pet scan.  what kind of questions should i be prepared to ask new neuropsychiatrist?   don't think he will become our regular doctor. thanks in advance," some things you said are a bit concerning.  lewy bodies do not show up at all on a pet scan or any other scan.   also the average span of real dlb is about 4 years as it is a very aggressive disease. your father is well beyond this and can still function so that's a good sign.also, dementia should not have a person able to function on their own after nearly a decade and especially not an early onset alzheimer's disease as it is much more aggressive than late onset.  even 3 years of early onset ad would be devastating.  is it possible he was misdiagnosed? all this is to say, it may be a good idea to seek another opinion as you are doing.  questions i would ask would be about how long his course had been without losing his ability to function, if a misdiagnosis is possible, and what other tests are available to clear up his picture. if he has had neuropsychological testing in the past, repeating the same tests to compare would be helpful as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rgp2ow/2nd_opinion_with_important_neuropsychiatrist/,2nd opinion with important Neuropsychiatrist.

"hi everyone, i'm a bit torn about this so i thought maybe someone here had some helpful advice.my grandma (92) lives in a nursing home, and has dementia. she hid it for a good while, but it became apparent just how bad it is when my grandpa died last year. she thinks she is temporarily in the hospital and wants to go home, but by home she means the family farm, where she hasn't lived since she was a teen. she sometimes recognizes my dad and aunt, but often she doesn't, since she thinks they are kids. other than them i don't think she recognizes a lot of people very often.and here is my dilemma: my dad recently mentioned to me that she might be getting close to death and if i would want to visit her a last time i should do so soon. my grandma was a lovely part of my childhood and it pained me so much that i didn't get to see my grandpa before he died. but on the other hand, she will most likely have no idea who i am, but she will fake it since she has gotten used to that after hiding it for so many years. so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? right now my last moment with her was at my granddads funeral where she in a clear moment marched over to me, took my hand, looked deeply into my eyes and said ""he loved you very much you know?"" which is quite lovely.so yeah, i'm torn about if i should go see her or not, thoughts and advice is appreciated"," you should go. sometimes, when the end is close, dementia patients have moments of clarity.been there",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rgk9zg/visiting_grandma_with_dementia/,Visiting grandma with dementia

"my dad was diagnosed with dementia a year ago but shit has gone downhill suddenly and a lot has happened in the last two months. my niece and i have fallen into the position of caring for him from two different cities. i decided to start doing some personal writing about it on my blog. for reddit purposes, i'm copy/pasting. also i think all of you would understand it better than publishing it on facebook with people i know but don't really want to hear from. here's my first post...thanks for reading.&amp;#x200b;a few days after thanksgiving, my dad ran away from my niece’s home where he was staying after running away from his home in kentucky. he wandered the streets for a few hours until my niece found him and tried to take him home. unfortunately, his dementia has progressed to include “behavioral disturbances,” a very clinical way to name uncontrollable emotional — often violent — outbursts. he threatened to hurt my niece or smash the windows. on their way to the local hospital, he ran away again.throughout his life, running away has always been the ultimate solution. he has run away from his marriages. he has run away from his children. he has run away from his landlords. he has run away from his jobs.said another way: my dad has been trying to escape his own life.throughout my childhood, i can remember a lot of the excuses for leaving jobs. they usually revolved around broken promises; the job was harder than they said, a promotion was not coming around the corner, employee housing was not available after all. his most recent job, which he took at age 71 in early 2021, wasn’t the right fit because he didn’t need “fat women” telling him how to drive — he had driven professionally since the 1970s.he had the job for three weeks before quitting. he probably didn’t need it anyway.the excuses for leaving other things – women, children, landlords – were similar and sometimes more abstract. he left us in las vegas in the ’90s because the gambling was too much. he left other women because they were too controlling or whatever. sometimes he would just wave his hand at a problem and say “naaaaah” and that’s all it would take.he has been in the hospital on a legal hold since nov. 28. it occurred to me that he is technically homeless now. he literally has nowhere else to run. he’s scared. he’s sad. he’s suicidal.we’re a few days away from getting him into a group home. the family feels a deep sense of foreboding. what if he doesn’t like this place? what if he finds an excuse to hate it? what if he runs away again? everyone has asked the same questions.two months ago he finally said he was fed up with his home life in kentucky. he didn’t like how his wife was treating him. he had threatened her a few times, too. he packed up a barely functioning 2007 honda odyssey and started driving around on his way to las vegas. he got lost. went home. and tried again the next day.he made it to new mexico where my brother and niece tried to meet him. he forgot he was meeting them. the new mexico state police found him instead. my brother and niece took him home to las vegas.in las vegas, he stayed with my brother and sister-in-law for a week or so. but he didn’t like their house, he said it was too loud. he made threats there too and bailed again. this time my niece picked him up at a gas station and took him in. he liked it better there. for a time.when i visited during thanksgiving, my dad pulled me aside several times to discuss his plans to escape. he grew paranoid people would steal his money. this is apparently super common with dementia victims. once the gate broke on the gated community, he found a way to escape. that’s when my niece picked him. full circle.i never put the escape mentality together until now. my brothers have always thought of it the same way. as a kid it felt like one-offs; often easily justified to a pre-teen. as an adult, now i see it as an underlying theme.where does it come from? a feeling of rebellion? the ultimate expression of independence?it’s fascinating though. because his need to run, to be free, to escape, has been his ultimate prison.when he runs from marriages, it brings along alimony. when he runs from children, it generates court-ordered child support. and when he runs from that responsibility, it creates mountains of debt. when he runs from landlords, it destroys his credit. when he runs from jobs, it leaves him impoverished.there is no money to steal from him. and if there was, it would already be spoken for.he built a prison of bad choices. there is no way to truly run away from six wives and five children. most of us are still here. but now he has dementia. and he’s locked inside his own brain; a place he can never escape from. the walls will just close in tighter every day until they crush him.it’s inescapable.", thank you for sharing this.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rfz18q/my_dad_has_been_trying_to_escape_his_whole_life/,My dad has been trying to escape his whole life

"hi everyone, i'm really hoping you could offer any perspective or experience related to this issue. my mother-in-law has been in the hospital for about 10 days with advanced dementia. we brought her into the hospital following her return from a short stay at respite care - she is normally nonverbal and requires significant physical care, but it was different - very difficult to wake her or give much food or drink to her. she went in to the hospital able to eat and drink minimally with assistance. the doctors thought she had an infection and she was given one course of antibiotics - the antibiotics were stopped prematurely and the infection returned. she was then given a second course of antibiotics. now the infection seems reduced and under control, however she seems to have lost interest in eating or drinking. the doctor feel that her dementia has progressed because of delirium from pneumonia and the infection. he believes that she has lost her swallow reflex and it will not return due to her advanced dementia. his recommendation is to move her to palliative care immediately and is not considering anything else to prolong her life. when discussing a feeding tube, he feels they can be uncomfortable and since her illness is terminal, there is no sense in putting her through the discomfort. our question is whether anyone has experience using feeding tubes with advanced dementia patients? is this common? is it morally questionable or wrong to use them for patients that do not have an ability to communicate their discomfort? we would truly appreciate any and all input. thanks so much."," hi! first of all i’m sorry you’re dealing with this, we’re getting close to dealing with a very similar situation with my grandma. i hope this doesn’t come across as harsh, but to me, putting a feeding tube in a pt who doesn’t know what’s going on or who anyone is might be cruel. we aren’t planning on doing that to my grandma. she never knows who any of us are, ever. think of it this way: are you considering putting in a feeding tube for you, or for her? most of the time end stage pt’s have little to no quality of life. they may not know who you are most of the time. we’re not doing that for my grandma because it wouldn’t be for her and we don’t want to prolong her discomfort. if i were you, i wouldn’t do it in your situation either. god bless<3",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rfox7u/feeding_tube_vs_palliative_care_for_advanced/,Feeding tube vs. palliative care for advanced dementia

"i am new to this sub and have been reading through all of the post for the past week. this is my first time posting so please forgive me if my questions seem unresearched or silly. my 76-year-old father was having urinary retention with a lot of pain and confusion and was sent to the hospital in an ambulance about two weeks ago. we suspected he had a uti however they ruled out any infection and have told us that he has no medical reason for the issue. they inserted a catheter in the er and transferred him to a medical unit. after ruling out medical issues aside from uncontrolled blood sugar (was 420!!!), he was discharged to a geriatric psych unit where he has been for about 9-10 days. prior to his admission (when he was at home) we had noticed a marked change in his cognition and ability to communicate. he seemed to walk weird and shuffle. he did have some confusion and needed help remembering things. he has been noncompliant on his medications for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and high blood pressure for at least a year. there was depression and he was no longer taking care of his hygiene. he had become 100% urine incontinent. he is legally blind with glaucoma and cataracts. despite all of this, however, he still was able to let us know that he did not want to go to a nursing home or life saving measures and he could more or less be independent at the house with my mom helping him. he gave me poa and an advanced health directive the day before he ended up hospitalized. since being admitted to the hospital he has become very confused and delirious and is in a vicious cycle where are the antipsychotics are not helping so they must sedate him. when he wakes up he becomes angry, he is confused, lashes out at the nurses and has even punched two of them in the geriatric psych unit. he is now having hallucinations and extremely weak because he’s not consistently eating or drinking, tears out his catheter, rips his clothing off, and rips out any ivs they place. this unit does not allow visitors so it seems that he’s only getting worse once they discharged him from the medical unit to the gpu.  the intent of putting him on the geriatric psych unit was to help with the delirium but it only worsened his vascular dementia. the doctor has now said that she feels we need to transfer him back to the medical unit (where they can restrain him) so that he can receive iv hydration. once hydrated she agreed that discharge to home hospice is the best chance for his survival. he will either become calmer at home and can potentially get back to some form of independence (with help of course) or will die. she also felt that transferring him to a rehab hospital or skilled nursing facility was likely a death sentence given his delirium and combativeness (given how his hospital stay had gone thus far). i’m not sure what i am really asking now…. only that i am wondering if i am doing the right thing and wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation.  i live out of state from my parents and neither are capable of taking care of themselves as my mom has alzheimer’s dementia and requires care as well (although less than him). she obviously cannot care for him (much less herself). i am so overwhelmed- this has happened so fast. if he comes home and continues having delirium - abs pulls out his cath- how is that managed? how long does he have left?  i don’t even know what to tell my mom who is currently set up in their home with a “granny nanny” from 8a-5p. what does home hospice look like? thanks for your insight.", can he afford full time care?  it sounds as though this would be necessary if he were to go home.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rfnyib/home_hospice_persistent_delirium_post_hospital/,Home Hospice & Persistent Delirium post hospital stay for urinary retention

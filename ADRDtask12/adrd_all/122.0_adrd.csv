"i would appreciate any  advice or insights you all might have on our situation. i apologize for the length. my husband’s mother just moved in with us, moving from ca to ok. she has lewy body dementia, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, and blood clots. she’s in her mid 50s. based on the ken keane videos, i'd say she's approximately in stage 5, with a few hints of 6. i do most of the day-to-day care, while my husband will be working outside the home. she has been on ssi and medical. we are in the process of getting my husband listed as her representative payee for her ssi.  she has lived with us before, i was the one who originally saw symptoms of dementia, but she wasn't diagnosed until she moved out of our home last time, in 2015.biggest issue (to me at least) first: she's in denial about her dementia, she talks about not being able to see because a doctor screwed up her eyes (not true). how do i address this with other people while she's around? i definitely don't want to make her feel stupid (which she does often when she can't find or do something) or argue with her, but at the same time, i need to be able to communicate with people (doctors, people at church) that she's not well. i don't see any help in trying to convince her that she's ill. what do i say in situations where she says something not true or inappropriate? financial questions: * where do i go to get health insurance for her?(i assume healthcare.gov, but i don't know where to get medicaid) * will her living in our home change the subsidy for my family’s health insurance, since we buy it through the exchange? * should we include her as a dependent on our 2019 taxes?* i understand her ssi is meant to cover her living expenses, can i use that to pay a utility bill or do i have her write a check directly to myself and my husband to cover her “rent”? we aren’t trying to take advantage of that money, obviously, but we will have higher utilities from an extra person in the house. * should we apply for food stamps/ebt for her? or should she be using the ssi for groceries?social questions:* what do we do when we can no longer provide enough care for her in our home? we have decided our boundary is incontinence or violence to ourselves and/or our children.* how do you know if she's able to be left alone in the home and for how long? she can't prepare food for herself, or get her own medicine, so i assume if ever, for a max of a few hours.* do i need to be stimulating and entertaining to her? she sat on the couch doing nothing (tv not on) for nearly two hours tonight after dinner, is this normal?* she's talked about meeting up with an old friend here in our town. should i try to contact this person? i don't think mil has any contact info for her, but i could find her on fb. would this be inappropriate? should i warn her of the lbd?* does it do me any good to put her things back where they belong after she's ""rearranged?"" she's moved some of her socks to her bedside table, moved her razor stash to her bedroom from the bathroom, etc. * does anyone have any advice for having her in the same home with my toddler? it seems all the baby proofing is too much of a hindrance for mil (cabinet and toilet locks, baby gates).also, if you have any other advice (or could point me towards the appropriate sub) for having a disabled elder living with you, i’d greatly appreciate it! thanks!"," my uncle has had lbd for 7 years. he's mostly non- verbal at this point unless you prompt him or he's yelling at a delusion. maybe ask around for eldercare agencies or services... they know how to lock into getting the right ssi and benefits. you likely also qualify for a set hours of in-home help per week.  it's a godsend. it's a cruel disease and you are a great asset to your spouse. as far as other things go, you might want to make some sort of id bracelet in case she wanders off.  or get a door alarm (we've done both) or a baby monitor (for other rooms) my uncle almost burnt our apartment down by turning on a burner and putting  cookies into a skillet around 2am. also, if she has any paranoid delusions, have the non-emergency town number to call if she gets too agitated.

"i’m 20 and my dad is 60. at first i thought he was a narcassist who didn’t care about his kids and only cared for himself. now that i’m getting older, i’m noticing little things he does that confuses me. he makes faces when he’s talking to me as if i’m 5. he stomps up the stairs and laughs to himself. he smirks at me when he imiates my grandma who walks with a limp when she’s not paying attention. speeds when he’s driving on the highway ramp to pretend he’s going to kill me (just to name a few things). the more and more i think about it, i feel like this has to do less with his personality and more do so with his actual mental state. i don’t know for sure if he’s just naturally a narcassist, aspergers, dementia etc. but i’m reallystruggling to maintain my sanity. i’m afraid of him putting himself, myself and my family’s lives in danger and i don’t know what to do. any advice you have would be appreciated. thanks."," i was admitted to the hospital for low sodium or something. next thing i knew a room full of doctors from neurology were there asking me questions. they seemed to be able to talk to me and tell. i was working in a tech job just a few days earlier and then this. next day i woke up and they were back. i got out of the hospital and had a battery of doctors to see. the last one was a psychologist who put me through a battery of test. i thought i did well but when they were through, she told me to get my affairs in order, quit driving, etc. that was at 56 and i am now 59. they must have put in the paperwork bc i was on disability a few days after. it was a whirlwind that i can't remember exactly (i'm having a bad day brain wise).maybe it is my tendency to ramble like this (i didn't try to parse this down to let you see what it is like from the patient end).anyway, as has been said, get him to a gp and have him referred to a psychologist. he is trying to mask his problem but believe me, it is as scary to him as it is to you.wish you well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/av51z1/how_do_i_get_my_dad_officially_diagnosed/,How do I get my dad officially diagnosed?
"hi everyone! i'm looking for some help regarding something that has been on my mind for a little bit in regards to dementia. if this isn't the right place for this, then please delete it.&amp;#x200b;my dad will be turning 60 in a couple of months. his side of the family has a history of dementia (his dad suffered from it before he died). i have noticed over the last couple of years that his demeanour/behaviour has changed. years ago, he used to be a very relaxed, chill and calm person that did not let many things bother him. nowadays, his behaviour has become more volatile, getting upset and flipping out over the tiniest of things, becoming super aggressive and argumentative both online and in person, and generally unmotivated to do things other than sit around the house and watch tv. his level of paranoia has also increased noticeably, to the point that if the doorbell rings he presses his foot against the door like someone is going to try and break in. i've done some research into this kind of behaviour, and the results that i have come across point to frontotemporal dementia as a possible cause for his attitude/behaviour change. this change has taken an affect on my parents marriage from my point of view, as they are fighting more now than ever, with my dad's behaviour being one of the topics of their fights. my father is not a very easy person to talk to when it comes to discussing feelings/emotions, as he feels that anything you are feeling should be kept to yourself. i worry that if it is in fact dementia that is onsetting, his behaviour will only become worse, but if i bring up my suspicions to him he will tell me that i'm just imagining things and that he has always been like that and will refuse to see a doctor. i'm not sure what i can do to help him.&amp;#x200b;thanks for any help/advice!"," no one here can diagnose your father. you need to see an actual doctor. mods, can we start deleting posts like this, please?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/autmp0/59_year_old_dad_is_it_dementia/,59 Year Old Dad - Is it Dementia?
"i really don't know where else to go with this, as i feel there are so many ethical &amp; moral issues going on here, so i searched ""dementia"" on reddit &amp; found this group. i've been reading your posts, &amp; i see you all have a very positive support system. i hope maybe some of you could help me get some perspective on things.my sister &amp; i recently brought my mother on a family trip to disneyland. she's not well traveled, so it was definitely overwhelming to her in many ways, but there was a lot of behavior that became quite noticeable &amp; difficult to ignore. in discussing it with each other, it's been like pulling a string that is starting to unravel a much bigger sweater, each of us noticing things that may have seemed a tad weird at the outset, but with more information seem much more troubling.firstly, our mother is single &amp; lives alone. we have all had a strained relationship for years, to varying degrees, as my mother can be very passive-aggressive, very codependent, &amp; in my unprofessional opinion a certifiable narcissist. everything is about her, &amp; as we've grown up &amp; gotten our own lives, it's been more &amp; more difficult for her to insert herself into our lives, as we've become thriving independent adults with families. that said, my sister &amp; i have been in therapy for some time (separately) &amp; have vowed to try &amp; maintain the best relationship possible with our mother, while not giving in to her dysfunctional behaviors. in an effort to paint as complete a picture as possible for you, i am going to just list some of the trouble behavior from this past year, in hopes that you may see what we're seeing as familiar to your experiences.\- about a year ago, she lost her job ""due to cutbacks"" that she had for 7 years. i put that in quotes because my sister knows two people who work for the same company that say she was let go due to poor attitude &amp; an unwillingness to learn a new computer system that was being implemented, but we have not confronted her on this, as we feel its not really worth the humiliation or the argument. she has told both of us differing stories about two other jobs that she has since secured but quit due to the employer changing the job description after she was hired. (same excuse for both jobs) the first job, i believe was a complete lie, as she couldn't recall or tell me anything about where the office was when asked. (sign or just bad behavior?), &amp; she on one occasion told me that they were very strict about using social media or phones during work hours, but would then send me im's &amp; be seen on facebook for long stretches of time when she said she was at work. the second job, was supposedly near my sister's house, &amp; she would drive by the office, never once seeing my mother's car in the small parking lot. she once drove by my mother's home when she said she was at work, &amp; she was home in the middle of the day. again, not confronted. a month later, she told us she was putting in her notice, but at that point we both knew she hadn't been working for weeks.\- at christmas time, i was home (i live a few hours drive away) &amp; at her house, &amp; remarked that she had all of her pictures down from the walls in her kitchen &amp; living room. she said she was preparing to repaint those rooms. it seemed weird because when i asked her what colors, she couldn't give me an answer, stammered, &amp; changed the subject. ten days later, she called to say that her friend, a realtor, had been over for coffee that day &amp; told her that people were asking about her home, &amp; if she'd consider selling it, &amp; that she agreed, so that afternoon she sold the house. i know how real estate works, &amp; i find it hard to believe that a house can be sold within two hours of deciding to sell it. i looked up the mls listing &amp; it had been on the market since the first of december. she has no reason that we know of to lie about selling her house. we didn't grow up there. she purchased it 3 years ago. it's a weird thing to be shady about.\-on our trip, during our 6 day visit, i found her packing her bags on three occasions. when i asked her nicely what she was doing, she said ""i'm packing to make sure we're ready to go."" i would tell her, again, as normal sounding &amp; nice as possible, that we weren't leaving the next day, to which she would pause &amp; then say ""oh, well, you know, just in case then."" it was awkward as she was clearly putting things away &amp; staging her luggage next to the door, ready to go.\-we noticed that she does not eat much or healthily. she has lost a lot of weight (maybe 25 lbs on a frame of 150 to start) that was kind of hidden by her wearing loose clothes &amp; layers. she would, on average, eat a half a muffin for breakfast with coffee, the other half of the muffin for lunch along with a couple of chicken nuggets or fries she'd share with one of the kids, and one or two cookies or a handful of raisins for dinner. she would go to bed around 7pm, reading until about 8pm, &amp; then be up at about 5-6am. we think she has an eating disorder, but she dodges any discussion about food. she got upset a few times when we'd say ""oh, i think it's time to break for lunch"" or the like, saying things like ""i can't believe how much you all eat!"" she is very uncomfortable eating in front of others, &amp; often will just say things like ""my body just isn't used to eating so much food like you kids."" we eat a normal three meals a day. i don't know if calorie starvation or eating disorder plays into this, or if one is causing the other.\-she seems confused often, doesn't understand the concept of normal everyday things, or becomes dismissive if she feels she is being asked to clarify. examples: (1)we went on pirates of the caribbean twice, once on two different days. later in the week, during our flight home, she told me that she thought it as nice they had two different pirate rides, so the line wouldn't be so long. confused by her comment, i asked her what she meant, &amp; she reiterated that she thought there were two different pirates of the caribbean rides. i told her that it was the same one, just on different days. she got slightly indignant &amp; changed the subject.(2) while on the trip, she came into the room holding her charging cord for her phone &amp; asked if i had an adapter for it. i asked her why, &amp; she said that she couldn't get the end to fit in the opening of her phone. she was holding up the wrong end of the charger, so i pointed out that the other, smaller end went into the phone, and the usb end went into the plug-in. she literally stared at it for probably 15 seconds before saying ""oh, this must be a new cord!"" &amp; going back to her room. she's had that cord &amp; phone set up since we got her the phone over two years ago. (again, not trying to humiliate, but seeing a pattern of confusion)\- i recently changed jobs (in september) &amp; during our trip she asked me on two different occasions if i was seeking work since being let go of my job. i told her i had work, had not been let go, but rather moved jobs on my own volition, explained what i was doing &amp; where i was working, &amp; she said things like ""oh, that's right, sometimes i forget to listen to the details."" i think she's confusing what happened to her &amp; her job situation, with me changing jobs.i know that these may be very anecdotally trivial, or perhaps there's a logical reason for all of the issues. where my sister &amp; i are concerned is how we can approach this with her, given that she is already very secretive, lives independently, &amp; is in denial that anything is wrong. her mother died from alzheimer's related complications about 12 years ago. she began developing the symptoms around the same age my mom is now, however, went undiagnosed for some time, as the doctors originally thought there was a circulatory problem that meant she wasn't getting enough oxygen to the brain. i can understand if she is terrified this is happening to her, &amp; probably doesn't know quite what to do herself, but if we bring up anything to do with health, or her forgetfulness or confusion she immediately becomes defensive, &amp; shuts down communication. again, we've not had the best relationship over the years, so sometimes it's hard to tell a cruel snarky remark from honest defensiveness over something she may be aware of. my sister in particular, is starting to be concerned about leaving her children for any unsupervised time with my mother, as she has admitted recently that she got lost driving to the store, which is in a neighborhood she's lived in for decades. (the apartment she recently moved into is in the same neighborhood as was the house she just sold, &amp; the same neighborhood we grew up in)so my ultimate question to you all is how do you feel we should approach this? be direct with her &amp; confront her with our concerns? ask her to see a doctor? ignore it &amp; wait for her to talk to us about it? slowly limit any unsupervised time, check in more often, hope for the best? it's just so complicated because of circumstances &amp; past, we really both just don't know where to begin. i'm hoping this resonates with anyone here, &amp; can at least give some advice on what worked for you.thank you for reading this!tl;dr how do we confront or not confront our mother about possible dementia?", teepa snow on youtube is a godsend.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/aus7qr/wondering_how_to_confront_not_confront_mom_about/,Wondering how to confront / not confront Mom about issues
"my mom started showing clear signs of cognitive decline 2.5 years ago - word loss, trouble with directions, odd personality changes.  over the last 2.5 years she's gone from there to dementia stage 6 or 7 - she doesn't speak, is incontinent, and can't do anything on her own.  we just moved her into a memory care unit over the weekend, and it feels like something we should have done much sooner.  i suspect she'd quietly been in the first stages of dementia for a while, and then when she got lyme disease in summer 2016, it precipitated a quick downturn.  at first we thought the lyme was causing the word loss and stuff, but she was treated for late-stage lyme and didn't improve, so we had to embrace the reality that it's dementia, and not something curable.  i know that the earliest stages of dementia are often imperceptible to family and friends, and only in hindsight do we get the sense that something might have been wrong.  but i can't remember enough to really say when my mom might have started down the dementia road.  in the few years before she became obviously ill, she was uncharacteristically unkind toward my brother, and had some other lapses of judgement that i wonder about... i feel like i can't figure out what was ""the real mom"" and what was the disease.  as i try to remember the old her, it would be so helpful to be able to sort out some of the emotional stuff from her time before she got sick.  does anyone have experience with this kind of fast-moving dementia?  how long do you think the early phases last when the disease then progresses so quickly?"," i think my sister had alzheimer's for several years before it was diagnosed, and then she had a rapid decline. i still feel bad that i just thought she was getting weird and didn't realize it was the disease.

(apparently, the results also stated that she does have dementia, but he didn't say what kind or what stage, and completely glazed over it.)after the appointment my grandma said, ""it'll be a cold day in hell when i use a cane. just because i'm 90, everyone thinks i'm old and stupid, and they do things behind my back."" and my parents doubt she'll start using the pill box, since she doesn't really remember how it works.is it normal to take things slow with a patient who has been diagnosed with dementia, and not break it to them right away? is the doctor testing the waters to see where she's at and what she can do on her own?my mom is really stressed out about this, and wants to take my grandma to another doctor. i don't think my grandma would like it, but i also want her to go to a doctor that would give her the support she needs."," doctors don’t need to deal with the daily fallout of having a relative with dementia, so they can afford to go slow. you can’t. my mom was “fine” for a year and a half after her diagnosis... except she wasn’t. she was adamant that she could handle her medications and didn’t need help. she was furious that we even suggested help. she said to me once, angrily, “the day i can’t manage my own meds is the day you should put me in a home.” then she passed out a few weeks later in her driveway with a heart rate of 15bpm and everyone was shocked... shocked... that she was prescribed eight medications that either lowered heart rate, reduced blood pressure, or both. in a hospital that was not her usual one, the head doctor on her team was insistent that someone else needed to manage her meds from now on. i took on the job, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare.  three pill boxes with all compartments filled, but no two days were the same amount or kind of pills. any prescription she had ever gotten, even if she was no longer on it, seemed to be on auto-refill and she would diligently keep taking all of them. every specialist (there were many) would prescribe her new things and she would take them. her pcp added prescriptions for the side effects of other things and she took them. every hospital visit (also many) would add new dosages or more pills, and she would take those too. she lost about 50 lbs, and no one reduced dosages to compensate. no one oversaw the whole picture until she was so overmedicated she almost died from it. even if the med situation seems fine, it’s worth checking on.

"i wanted to share my experience for those who are struggling with how to move a loved one into a memory care facility when they won’t voluntarily go. i struggled with how to do this and i hope this helps someone. quick background: my grandmother is 92 and has been diagnosed with lewy body dementia. she is in great condition physically, but has severe mental decline. she was living on her own until 2018 when my mom and i finally convinced her to move closer to us so we could care for her consistently. we didn’t realize how much she declined mentally until we were caring for her daily. about a month ago, she found her spare car keys (that we didn’t know she had) and drove away without us knowing where she was. she made it about 30 miles before “running out of gas” (she wasn’t out) and asking someone for help. we realized then that she needs 24 hour care and we are unable to provide that. the mental toll of caring for her also became too much for my mom. we took her on a tour of a very nice mc facility that same afternoon and she became very angry and adamant that she was not going to move there. we explored the option of sitters but her paranoia is too bad and she insists on keeping her central heat at 85 degrees because she’s so cold. we couldn’t ask a sitter to endure that. we both have poa and she is under hospice care. the hospice doctor authorized her move to the facility and we set up everything. the facility is costing $6k a month. today was her move in day. my mom took her around town to run errands and get her hair done while my husband and i rented a u-haul and moved her furniture and belongings. my mom arrived at the facility at lunch time and we told her that we were all going to eat lunch there. i think she remembered where she was and at first said that she would wait in the car. i convinced her to come inside with me and we made it to the group dining room. she didn’t want to eat and we sat there for a while waiting for some indication of what the “game plan” was on their end. this was the most stressful time because i expected her to insist on leaving any minute. this was the only part i wish i had been more direct with the staff about. i asked a few times how we were supposed to get her in the facility because i didn’t think she would go willingly. while i know it’s not their job to get her inside, i wish there was a better regimen once we were there. finally the head nurse came and we walked her to her room so they could do their assessment. she realized as soon as we walked into the room that her furniture was inside and started insisting loudly that she was not going to stay. she kept repeating this over and over. the nurse, who was great, distracted her by asking questions about a painting inside the room and motioned for us to leave once my grandma was away from the door. i was so tired once we left. it was like the emotional toll just hit me and i could have just laid down and fell asleep. part of me half expects them to call any minute to say that they can’t handle her and we need to come get her. my mom is stressed about going for a short visit tomorrow and is going to check in with the nurses first to see how she did and if it’s even a good idea to see her yet. i’ve found a lot of support reading posts here and i hope this helps someone as well."," was having her live with you or your mother not an option? if so, why not?

"my mom has form of corticobasal degeneration. she was diagnosed last year and her health has been in decline fairly rapidly. she still has her wits about her but she’s not taking care of herself and falls a lot (when she backs up or takes a step backwards) and does not make the best decisions. she declines help, lies about her health and really just acts like nothing is wrong around people and her friends. we have a home health aide coming by twice a week to help with my mom. me or my sister come by once a week, sometimes twice to check on her or help out. she also has the best neighbors who really look out for her, spend time with her, help care for her  and take her grocery shopping with them.  she recently stayed with my aunt for 2 weeks out of town. well my aunt noticed she has bruises on her bum(from falling?), noticed she wets herself and doesn’t do a good job with hygiene. she also noticed how skinny and frail she had gotten. she says she didn’t really eat unless food was placed in front of her. she was concerned about her diet and was wondering if getting her to see a nutritionist or dietician would help her eat more. so she called one of her friends and shared all of this and her concerns with her. well this “friend” is a registered nurse. i’ve never spoken to this friend of her once. she called me today saying my mom needed 24/7 care and talked about the bruises and how she is frail, etc (just like my aunt said above). she said she wanted to call adult protective services on my mom. that since she is a nurse she has an obligation to say something.  i had no idea really what she was referring to, i am learning as i am going with this disease and i am really unprepared and ignorant on how to care properly care for her or what i should be doing to care for my mom. i had no idea she was thrusting to call the state because she thinks my mom is being neglected. i realized she was threatening that after talking about the phone call with my wife. i was so offended and caught off guard by this lady. now i’m just stressed, sad and don’t know what to do. what do i do?me and my sister are making the best decisions we can while respecting my moms needs, wants and dignity. we haven’t had a lot of guidance and this has all happened so quickly. she can still make her own decisions and we can’t really make her do anything. we took away her car, we got a home aide in there 2 days a week, we installed cameras, we visit her (my mom lives an hr away from us). i’m just venting and looking for any advice. what are we doing wrong? are we neglecting my mom? we don’t think so.  i am so angry at this lady for inserting herself into this so abruptly and forcefully. i don’t know how to handle it."," i agree calling aps on you is wrong and also agree you and your sister are doing your best in a sticky situation. however, i agree with the nurse that it sounds like your mom needs more help than she is getting and is probably no longer safe. the in-between with my own mother that i have right now is daily in-home help. i have a lady come in about 3-4 hours a day who cleans, shops and leaves a meal out. this person is referred  to as a “housekeeper,”  not a caregiver. this avoids offending my mother’s dignity. she also takes my mom to an exercise class and picks her up.  my mother also lives around the block for my sibling. if she was on her own as you described with your mother i would describe it as an unsafe situation. i don’t know what services your mother qualifies for or what you guys can afford, but i think at this point she does need more than what she’s getting from what you described. best of luck to you.

"hi friends.  my 64 year old dad has bvftd and i recently placed him in a memory care facility.  lots of what i read about ftd is that memory often remains pretty stable.  dad's short-term memory is very poor.  the best way to describe it is like someone is hitting a reset button on his brain every 30 seconds.  he can't retain any new information and just simply repeats himself every 30 seconds or so.  he stopped eating completely (brain never told him he is hungry) which is what necessitated a ltc facility.  what is strange is that dad's vocabulary is strong (no aphasia), his motor skills are strong (skill independently showers, brushes his teeth, gets dressed, eats, etc).  should i be considering an additional diagnosis in conjunction with ftd?"," that sounds somewhat similar to my grandmother. her dementia does not fall nearly in to any sub group and on a good day she just seems like a lady with a short memory. the other day while she was eating a sandwhich she paused for a moment, stared at the half eaten sandwhich and then asked me what it was...not the kind of sandwhich, she literally forgot what she was eating and that she was eating while she was eating.her mri shows white matter vascular disease but no sign of major injury or stroke, she has enlarged ventricles, too ambuguous to determine if it's normal pressure hydrocephalus but the doctor says she's too old to shunt anyway, cortical atrophy...kind of in the opposite pattern to alzheimer's, and signal changes in the pons and brain stem. she can be a little socially inappropriate...she occasionally mocks her neighbor and was bad mouthing the nurses in front of them, but not horribly so, and she can still read. she seems to have difficulty discerning when she is hungry, thirsty, or needs to be cleaned up. she sometimes fails to recognize people but still knows who the person is if she is told. for example, if i walk in she might not recognize me but if i say ""hi grandma"" she will recognize my voice and then know who i am.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/apu3z6/dad_with_ftd_and_extremely_poor_short_term_memory/,Dad with FTD and extremely poor short term memory.

"my mother is 90 years old. she started showing signs of dementia about two years ago. it started with short term memory loss but has now progressed to long term memory and sometimes volatile behavior. my 92 year old father is her caretaker and is able to manage most days. she is very frail and has had two bad falls in the last year, compression fractures in her back and most recently a fracture in her neck. she refuses to wear the braces for both. her pcp has it noted on her chart that she has dementia, but my mom denies everything and is usually behaving okay at her doctor appointment. until her last. i finally had a chance to talk to one of the doctors in private and was able to provide more details about her behavior at home with my dad. she is very verbally abusive to him and says terrible things to him, accusing him of trying to kill her. she hasn’t bathed in almost two months and denies this if i ask. she has moments of sheer terror and confusion. she is not on any meds for the dementia because she refuses to take her normal meds for blood pressure etc.. i live over 200 miles away but try to be there every 4-6 weeks. there is very little i can do when i am there especially since she is now treating me the same way she treats my dad.  we are trying to figure out a way to get her to sign a power of attorney document but we haven’t done this yet. she still seems to trust my brother so i’ve asked him to help, but i don’t feel confident that he will. she is constantly accusing us of wanting to put her away, but this is so not true. my dad is adamant about keeping her at home, and i agree as long as she is safe and allows him to care for her without risk to himself. she jokes about suicide and she also threatens to call the police and tell them lies to get her out of the house. i don’t think she would actually follow through on any of this, but she is so unpredictable. i’ve been thinking about recording her when she’s at her worst so that we have something to show the doctors. has anyone done this? if yes, do the doctors take it seriously? she needs to see a dementia specialist but her doctor has yet to give her a referral. i know i’ve rambled a bit, but any advise would be greatly appreciated."," i am so sorry. my mom is behaving similarly with my dad, but they're in their late 60s, i know how distressing it is.i don't know if your mom calls often, i talk to mine daily but on a bad day she'll call up to 7 times, and i'll let voicemail get some of them when at work. if she does leave messages that show the dementia, i save them. you can hit forward and email them to yourself on iphone. i am sure there are similar options on other phone types. it's a ""just in case"" thing, any unfounded accusations ever come up against my dad, etc.as far as the doctor... my mom is seeing a neurologist and he isn't prescribing her anything other than an antidepressant. she can't show signs/capability of taking that regularly/consistently and he will not put her on other drugs that require regular dosage unless she can prove she can do that, or we put her in home. the medicine cannot make her any better, could only slow the progress of something that came on pretty quick and has been getting worse by droves, and despite all of it i we all know it would kill her to be away from her dog and home. the point of me telling you this is i am not sure even if you could prove it to doctor they would do anything at this point since you mentioned meds problems... but doctors are different so you should definitely do what will give you peace of mind.if there is any diagnosis on medical charts of dementia your father does not need to get her signature, he can get power of attorney without it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/aple8q/recording_behavior/,Recording behavior

"i'm keeping things a little vague here for anonymity.  i'll try keep it short, but it'll probably be long.tl;dr: my partner has always had a good memory, now he's been randomly mis-remembering or forgetting stuff, now he's decided an important life event was entirely different from the way it really was.  any advice?i've been with my partner over 20 years, he's in his late 40's now.  for a long time, he had a fantastic memory, he could tell people what they said or did in a certain situation from several years prior with total clarity.  he was known among his friends for this.i know as we get older things change, your memory and capacity for retaining things also changes.  but i'm actually starting to worry now about his memory and if it's the start of something bigger.  i don't think i'd be so concerned if i hadn't had the history i have with him and know he was always good with his memory.small things mostly, like we will have a conversation about something that needs to be done around the house, or a place we need to go.  it's all sorted then and there, then a day later he's asking me what is happening with it ""just to make sure we're on the same page"" and we have to go through the whole thing again. sometimes more than once.  i'll admit it's happened often enough that when it occurs i do get a bit annoyed, but it's not happening every time, just every now and then. apart from that he'll randomly just decide things that aren't true.  for example one time my ds was getting ready for bed, when partner asked him to come do something with him.  he got agitated when ds said he shouldn't, as it was his bed time, and repeatedly tried to tell him it wasn't for another half an hour, specifying a time.  ds had had the same bed time for almost a year.   there have been more than a few instances of very similar things over the last year, but again they're not over hugely important stuff.last night i really had to do a double take though.  we were chatting about various things, and he mentioned he told a work colleague of his how we originally got the money for a deposit for our first house.  it was so far from what we actually did i couldn't believe he was serious.  the incident he talked about happened a year after we bought our home.  i know exactly what happened with it as there were several key events tied to it that i had to keep a very close eye on.  he's actually mentioned the incident to someone else once a few years ago and told them something else he reckons was done with the money which again was in no way what happened, but it wasn't a time to bring it up and i let it go.i did stop him briefly and say, no we did x to save for a home, because y was also involved with it.  z didn't happen until way after we moved there.  he looked at me, literally said ""whatever"" (not in an angry way, just like i was interrupting his story) and moved on to the second part of his story.he's not an angry person but he's very.......pedantic about being right, and really doesn't like when anyone points out to him that he's remembering incorrectly or that we've been over the conversation before.  he's said that he thinks his crazy work schedule affected his sleep and memory a while ago, but that job finished a few years ago and he's had a normal routine since then, and has no trouble sleeping.has anyone else had a parent or partner start showing signs of changing like this relatively young?  how do you cope,what steps did you take to find out whether they're just a bit forgetful (and maybe it is still related to his work from years before??) or if it's something serious?"," please, go to a neurologist. it sounds so similar to what started with my mom years ago. we talk daily even though we live half a country apart. she started repeating stories, then changing them a bit, then it got to the point what she was saying didn't remotely happen, some of which i attributed to boredom from an early-ish retirement. she's always been a tad neurotic and a bit scatter-brained though, so my sibling and father were convinced nothing was wrong. i stopped bringing it up. she lost a bunch of weight, which we attributed to her really joining dad on is diabetic diet a little too intensely. until this past march when she just took a sudden and sharp downhill turn. she now basically lives in a hallucination, auditory and visual, and is absolutely convinced it is all real. there is no talking her out of it. and they are not nice hallucinations. we lost her in the woods for a day this past winter when she took off to escape someone ""trying to kill her"" in the house. we were lucky she wasn't frozen to death when they found her.the thing is, you can't cure dementia, but they do have drugs that can slow down the degeneration. she's so far gone at this point the neurologist can't even get her to consistently take an anti-depressant, so they don't think more intensive treatment is possible.i am not saying this to scare you. well, i guess i am a bit. it's a scary enough disease that if there is a remote possibility get it checked now. if your partner is still somewhat rational and themselves, this is the time to start medication to keep them that way as long as possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/apd1yt/not_sure_what_to_do_anyone_else_had_similar/,"Not sure what to do, anyone else had similar experiences?"

"sorry if my post is a bit incoherent and long, it is 3am here and i'm in bed with my phone as i can't sleep. just going to write whatever is on my mind and edit later.  i'm not sure what replies or advice i'm looking for but there is no one i can talk to irl and i guess i just need a listening ear. so i am an international student and i'm not home often. yesterday, i got a message from my sister telling me that she is going to take my mom to the doctors for an official diagnosis. this news can't come at a worst time as i am not home when all of this is going down during the biggest holiday of the year (chinese new year). growing up, my mom always had bad memory and a hard time processing what is being said to her (she has adhd, depression, dyslexia, bpd and other learning disabilities). we would tell her a story and it would take her several tries to get it or to follow the storyline and there's a high chance she will forget most of it later, at least the details anyway. she has a hard time pronouncing words as english is not her first language and would quickly forget whatever is taught to her, even something as simple as learning to use facebook even if we taught her repeatedly. so for a long time, we always thought that it was just her normal self. but the past year (according to my dad and brother), she actually forgot her way home a few times, made late credit card payments or paid bills more than once, lost her phone twice in a week, swears she brought her wallet out only to find it at home later.despite all the difficulties she has, this is not normal behaviour even for her. my mom is trying to chalk it up to side effects of her anti depressants and bpd meds but i'm extremely worried and so is the rest of us. i know that our family do have a history of alzheimer's which is confirming my worst fears. if it is officially true, i don't know what i am going to do. i love her so very much even though we are apart a lot due to my overseas education from when i was 16. even if i say it very rarely or don't show my love often, i do love her and i wouldn't know what i'm going to do when things get worst. i don't want her to be alive but not mentally present, i don't want her to not remember me, i don't want her lose her memories of us. i don't want her to forget that we love her very very much and that she love us too. i don't want to put her in a home, i don't want to watch my dad watch her slip away, i don't want her to forget that she love to cook, to drive, to paint, to do all the things she love doing now. i don't want her to lose all of that. i just love her so much and i'm not sure if i can handle it. i'm lucky that i have 2 other siblings but as the oldest i would have to take charge. i love her but i love living where i am right now and i know i will have to move back and i don't want to secretly hate her for making me give up my life for her even she did sacrifice everything for me. i don't know what my sister will do if she loses her memories and language skills. they already have a hard time communicating as my sister is english educated and my mom knows a limited amount of broken english.before her diagnosis of bpd, she would go into episodes of crying, screaming and risk taking behaviour. she drove into a road divider once. i was 16 and scared. my dad was in denial and having an affair. i escaped overseas using education as my excused to run as far as i could, abandoning my younger siblings to take care of her. i'm not sure if i will be strong enough this time for them and to take charge. i might possibly hold a grudge that i have to go home. i'm feeling so confused, upset and guilty....  for my possible resentment, for being selfish for not spending more time with her.  i love her very much, i'm just not sure if i'm strong enough to handle it."," you're not alone. i don't live in a different country from my mother, but i've made a life thousands of miles from her, that i am starting to wonder if i am going to have to give up. she's got a form of dementia (lewy body) that is full of delusions, hallucination, long story short, there's not much of her there anymore and i cling to the parts of her that are in our nightly conversations. if i can.there were signs we missed for years, and the ""real bad"" came on fast. i don't have any idea how long we have with her. she's lost so much weight, she's down to 104 lbs, and even with my father cooking nightly for her we can't get her weight up. he still has to work. she's getting really close to the point where she will not be safe alone. we already had to put a tracking device on her after an incident of her wandering off.i am trying to weigh rationally what is an extremely emotional decision. i know dad can't care for her by himself 8 more years, but would my moving closer help enough? i'd only be there on weekends myself as i'd have to work (they do not live anywhere i could possibly find a job, i'd be living about 3 hours away). the move doesn't make any rational sense if she's not going to make it much longer but the thought of that is unacceptable to me, so then i go back to wondering when i should move. i walk myself mentally is so many loops about it i make myself dizzy. so i decided i needed to give myself a date by which i would actually start considering the move. i am going home for a visit in august, and it will be then that i decide if i am going to start working towards moving there, or not. it feels like a decision even though it's a decision to not make a decision, and gives me some comfort.good luck with all your decisions, only you can decide, and i know that's a terribly lonely feeling.&#x200b;",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/aohx5i/not_sure_how_to_deal_with_the_fact_that_my_mom/,Not sure how to deal with the fact that my mom have early onset dementia (possibly)

"so here's the summary of the situation:* dad (80s) has late stage dementia. he is able to walk and eat by himself but that will end likely in the next few months. he has no other major health issues.* my mom (70s) is his primary caretaker, but she has back and other physical problems and can't really lift anything more than a few lbs.* life savings were destroyed before we discovered what was going on.* on paper, they make good incomes. however because of bad management for the past 10-15 years and some ill-conceived purchases/debts, about half of it has to go into fixing problems, so the amount left for spending is ok, but not great. they make well above what the medicaid limits are in our state.* the income sources and assets are all mixed together with both their names on most of it. so any kind of asset sale would be enormously complicated and the leftover situation would be bad for my mom after he's gone.* he does not do well outside of the home. he gets extremely stressed out and basically stops eating. i have no doubt placing him outside his home would kill him.ideally we'd like to keep him at home but my mom is not capable of lifting him or doing the physical work that we know is to come. i found out that medicare will not cover home bound care unless they need a skilled professional or therapy (which he doesn't. he will just needs help moving around, bathing, feeding, etc). medicaid is out of the picture because they just make too much.right now we have a part-time home health aide for a few hours a week but the amount of hours that will be needed will quickly overwhelm the finances and deplete the savings in a few months. i've talked to local resources but overall it comes to the same problems: he's too healthy physically, they make too much money for aid, but out of pocket expenses are too much. making him a ward of the state also seems like a bad idea due to the mixed assets and the loss of control.i've gone through old posts but didn't see anything that pertained directly to this situation. am i missing something? has anyone else gotten benefits for this kind of situation? we simply need home health aides for several hours a day. we don't need anything else."," i hope you find some answers, so sad",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ao7lwu/assistance_available_in_this_case/,Assistance available in this case?

"i live in northern europe, finland, and my mother has alzheimer's. since 2008 the economy over here hasn't been what it used to be. at the same time the share of the old people is increasing rapidly - and thus is dementia. the problems are going to be huge.at the moment my mother lives in her home. a nurse, appointed by the ""county"" (a smallish town), visits her twice a day, for about 20 minutes, costing 180 euros (about 200 $) a month. if her pension was bigger she would have to pay more. the nurses see to it t that she'll take her medication, eat well, and that everything is ok.she has been offered an opportunity to visit a daycare center twice a week for free (but she won't go). for a reasonable fee, 5€ per delivery, she would get her groceries delivered to her (but she doesn't need that because i do all her shopping). for 40 euros a month she has a basic emergency surveillance system which is subsidized by the ""county"". seeing a general practitioner is almost free. special operations like surgery cost more. the medication, on the other hand, is pretty expensive, because just the truly essential medication gets paid, mostly, by the state. when the disease progresses, she will be offered a place in a nursing home which can be private or public, either way the cost will be low enough so that she can afford it. the standards aren't necessarily good even now, let alone in a few years if the economy doesn't pick up.the situation - that of my mother's but also that of the whole system - has got me thinking if something could be improved, made more efficient, for example. or could we make it nicer for the patients without making it more expensive?surely there are all kinds of innovations that different states, companies, or other actors have come up with now when the ""dementia crisis"" is looming over almost all nations."," man, i love finland. you guys have it together. i wish just a quarter of this was available here in the united states.

"im not sure if this is the right place to be posting this. i thought about writing to r/advice, but its late, and i feel as though it wont be taken seriously there. i googled for a dementia subreddit to hopefully get some input from people that maybe have some experience dealing with dementia patients, or know where i could get some help.&amp;#x200b;some background:my grandmother is in her 70's and smoked cigarettes for the majority of her life. over the past many years, it has had detrimental effects on her health and brain, and what doctors have described as dementia caused from literal brain death. along with about 10 other health issues.as far back as i can remember, she has lived with what i guess you could call her common law marriage husband of 30+ years (not my grandfather) lets call him dean. they lived in the next state over, and my family and i didn't really get to see her as much, over the past few years after she got diagnosed. we made visits when we could, but it got really tough to make the travel a regular thing. we knew that dean was taking care of her to the best of his abilities, getting her back and forth to her doctor visits, and making sure she had food, care, and company. my mom spoke to dean on the phone multiple times a week. just for updates, and to keep that connection with my grandmother, because we knew that one day she would be mentally gone. but dean also had some serious health issues, so from what we've learned recently, the care for my grandmother took a nosedive. needless to say, we didn't know how bad that living situation had actually become.&amp;#x200b;current situation:about a month ago, calls stopped being returned, and contact with dean had completely dropped off. about 3 or 4 days went by like this, until we didn't know what to do. my mom called the county police out there, to stop by the house and check in on the situation. we feared the worst.dean was found on the floor, unconscious for what was assumed do be about 48 hours (still in the hospital, and i personally haven't been updated one what exactly happened to him). the house was covered in filth, pet and human excrement, broken glass, mold... like it was some horror type shit. some of the worst living conditions imaginable, and we had no idea. like i said, the visits became less regular over the past few years, because phone contact was pretty much constant, and we thought things were on the up and up. my grandmother was found wandering the house, scared, unstable, and practically emaciated. so since then, shes been removed from that house, brought to a local care facility near us, gone through rehab and doing much better physically.but unfortunately, she is mentally lost. she doesn't recognize anyone and cant hold onto a thought for more than a few seconds. the dementia has advanced rapidly to the fullest stage. we are extremely distraught over the reality that she is just mentally... checked out. its been one of the hardest things ive dealt with in my entire life. i have countless memories of visiting her over summer vacations as a kid. the inside jokes and traditions that we shared. the 2 years that i lived out there during middle/highschool and actually got the chance to see her when i wanted to. the moments that i feel like are lost. she was one of my favorite people in the word and its so fucking difficult to see her like this.&amp;#x200b;where i need help:since going through rehab, the care facility has basically said, shes physically recovered, has been checked by a doctor and it was decided by them that shes ready to be released to the family's care. but she has very special needs. not only with the dementia, but with other medical issues, such as the disorders and bad habits shes developed from basically the anxiety of not knowing who she is. anyway, seeing as how she has only her 2 children (my mother and uncle) and me as her grandchild, we have no other options, but to set aside everything and care for her. which of course we are more than willing to do. but im afraid that we dont have the means to do so. unfortunately she doesn't qualify for any kind of proper mental care facility. not to the extent that she needs. and we are still trying to get enough money together to get some sort of aid to come in on a schedule and help her get to the bathroom, feed her, and everything else that is involved.so heres where we have ended up.she is living with my mother and i, in a small 2 bedroom apartment. we prepped for weeks. got a hospital bed, safety locked all the drawers and cabinets, put extra locks on the doors, got rid of all of our living/dining room furniture so that she could have space to live in the main area of the house. like we are all in on this... but like i said, it still just isnt enough and i dont know what to do. i work a 50 hour/6 days a week schedule, so really 95% of the responsibilities have fallen onto my mother. its only been 24 hours of my grandmother living here, and we have had multiple incidents. she tried to walk out of house on her own twice, shes peed on the floor and bed, injured herself a few times (she has developed this weird habit of picking and peeling her skin, until she draws blood. we noticed it in when she was in the hospital, but its scary and very worrying. apparently in dementia patients, ""picking"" a somewhat common anxiety related disorder). she has terrible mood swings, and threatens us. she has lung issues, also from the smoking, and has to have regular breathing treatment throughout the day, or else she goes into these choking fits. she wakes up every 2 hours, which means the rest of us wake up every few hours. its just.... its bad.&amp;#x200b;tonight after being woken up to the sound of pee hitting the floor, my mother was on the floor in tears. we had a long conversation about this whole situation and were scared. because so much of this is on my mother, im afraid for her sanity, and quality of life. being a 24/7 caretaker to my grandmother in a completely unforgiving, and life halting lonely, depressed situation. she basically said that if this first day or so, is what the future of this situation is going to look like, that she doesnt want to live anymore. thats what scares me the most.&amp;#x200b;without any other help, not enough money to get her outside care, the only thing left is a state run facility or 'home' through medicare, and they are awful, disgusting places, that do not help the patients who live there. we visited some of them in my area, and we were appalled. my grandmother needs constant aid and attention. not a place that is going to put her in a room to fend for herself. she cant do that. and if it one day comes to that, the guilt of putting her there would kill my mother!&amp;#x200b;so i need real advice. or maybe a miracle. idk... something!&amp;#x200b;edit: i know this was really long. at the very least i wanted to get it all out and give a full picture. thank you to anyone who reads the whole thing. any and all advice is appreciated so much!"," i think an absolute key to dealing with people with dementia at home is medication. get a doctor on board as soon as possible who is willing to assess and monitor her behavior while trying out various medication  to control whatever aggression, anxiety, fear and terror, pain, and so on that she is experiencing, and who is willing to chop and change the meds to get the best outcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ammnsc/not_sure_where_to_turn_desperately_need_advice/,"Not sure

"hello all. long time, first time. my mother is 66 years old and was diagnosed with unspecified dementia with behavioral disorder about 2 years ago. i haven’t been able to work, because the way things shook out, out of the 3 kids, i was in the best position to take care of her full time. 90% of the time we get along, thanks to the mixture of psych meds she’s on. i love my mother more than anything and am happy to do this for her. about 6 months before her diagnosis, we got into a verbal argument that escalated into something so ugly, she called the cops and said i was out of control. i had gotten agitated and was throwing couch cushions around the room. there is a police report on record that says as much. i now have a record for domestic violence, because my own mother told the police i hit her, and they believed her, because she’s really good at manipulating people when she needs to. a year before this happened, my mother fell down the stairs and broke her wrist. my sister was here when it happened. they were both sleeping in the same bed and my mom had gotten up to pee in the middle of the night and slipped on stairs carpet. cut to 3 days ago, my mother keeps (out of nowhere) saying that i pushed her down the stairs and broke her wrist. she keeps thinking that the reason i was arrested was because i “pushed her down on the front porch and broke her wrist”. she is conflating the two events and doesn’t realize that all of the details are wrong and don’t add up. she has been raging nonstop. she’s broken over 1000 dollars worth of electronic equipment and right now i’m writing this because i’m in my room hiding from her, and i don’t know what to do. here’s where i need advice. she obviously needs to have an ambulance called on her and perhaps be put in some sort of inpatient facility while they readjust her meds. when she’s so out of control that i don’t know what to do, i tell her that if she doesn’t  calm down, i’m going to need to have someone come and help me.the first words out of her mouth are that she’s going to tell them i pushed her down and hit her. now there hospital records, police records and family that can testify that i’m not lying, but that didn’t work before. i live in kind of a ghetto area and the cops aren’t super concerned with the truth. my own sister is a prominent local figure, and even her word wasn’t good enough to keep me from getting the charges dropped the first time. where i live, a second domestic violence charge is a mandatory year in county jail. my brain is torn between getting her the help she needs and keeping myself from going to jail. what should i do?", i just posted an update to the whole situation. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ami74i/threatening_to_call_the_police/,Threatening to call the police
"my grandmother has been in a nursing home since she fell and broke her hip three months ago. most of the time she is cooperative but twice now she has demanded to go home. she doesn't know that she has become a long term care patient or that she is being evicted from her apartment (her insurance ran out before she was in a condition to even think about going home, and she could not afford to pay both the nursing home and her apartment rent) and we are packing up her stuff. we hate having to keep her there. the staff are nice and do their best but they are understaffed and it's not a memory care facility. it's actually a rehab place and they keep the memory impaired patients in the rooms near the nurses' station. sometimes in their beds, sometimes in the hallway in their wheelchairs (none of them walk) and sometimes behind the nurses station. but in any case, grandma thinks it's a hospital, hates hospitals, and perpetually thinks she is waiting for something. that being said, my mother says that grandma also thought she was waiting for something when she was at home. i feel bad about going through grandma's things even though i know she doesn't remember most of it. she had her entire life in that apartment and i have deconstructed most of it, but it was in disarray when i got there.i also learned that my grandma was exactly the person she appeared to be. she spent her free time reading and praying for people and though she was on a meager fixed income, she made donations here and there to good causes. but a timeline of her decline also became apparent. her memory problems started maybe 5 years ago but up until about three years ago, she was still a fairly functional person and then she could no longer keep her finances straight. then she could no longer cook. and then she stopped caring for herself. we hate having to keep her in the nursing home but she needs 24 hour supervision, particularly at night, which our family is unable to provide. i just wish there were some way to make her more comfortable in the last years of her life."," that's so tough. i went through the same thing with my mother. i feel your pain. it's so sad. i think the only thing we can do is go visit often and pick them up and take them out. take them out to eat, take them to the park occasionally. i know we are busy but she probably doesn't have much time. i don't want to give you false hope, but depending on her age you might be able to help her. there is some emerging science that diet can help her.  but she would have to agree to do it and most people with alzheimer's refuse to participate. i tried to get my mom to do it but she refused. do some research on this topic. i think it has promise, not as a cure, but maybe slow it down?

"hi, all. i live with my 73-year old grand aunt while going to grad school. for the past 2 years, i’ve noticed behaviors that have made me want to move. this is my first time posting though, as it wasn’t until this past monday that something she did really got to me. here are the behaviors:- telling the exact same story on one day, then the next. the story is always about something that happened 2+ years ago (before she retired). this happens about every other week.- getting mad at me, my fiancé, and my cousin (all three of us live with her) and accusing us of waiting for her to die and thinking she’s stupid. also, accusing my cousin and i of plotting about her behind her back. oh, and accusing me (24) of not being loyal to her because i don’t agree with everything she says (my fiancé does—not because he actually agrees, but because he has found that she doesn’t get mad when he does so). what’s strange to me about this behavior is that, 5-10 minutes after the outburst, she’ll behave as she normally does: she’ll be civil, maybe even nice and definitely doesn’t mention the outburst.- not leaving the house for days and sometimes weeks on end. i should note, though, that she doesn’t drive and has a bad knee that prevents her from walking long distances. but, she doesn’t even check her po box, which is a 15-20 walk away, so mail (bills too) just piles up. (we check it, but we can’t all the time because we’re in school and quite busy.) almost all day, every day, we can find her watching tv.- not being able to comprehend what me, my fiancé, and cousin are saying. this doesn’t happen all the time but fairly often. for example, my fiancé and i were telling her a few nights ago that we were throwing out a kitchen tool because it wouldn’t work anymore. we had to say 3 times, “grand aunt, we’re throwing out kitchen utensil,” before she finally understood.in any of your experiences, does this sound like the start of dementia? any insight would be helpful."," i got tingles reading this. especially this part>- getting mad at me, my fiancé, and my cousin (all three of us live with her) and accusing us of waiting for her to die and thinking she’s stupid. on the nose. she literally says ""you think i'm stupid"" or ""okay, i'm stupid"" sarcastic and passive aggressively. or snarky ""i'm not dead yet"" kind of things>also, accusing my cousin and i of plotting about her behind her back. oh, and accusing me (24) of not being loyal to her because i don’t agree with everything she says on the nose again. my husband,  kids and i moved into her house in the summer (partially out of concern) and if we don't do every idea she has, it's ""ok i'm stupid!"" or she thinks we're mad at her, so she would pre-emptively get mad at us first, and then pout for days full silent treatment. stuff as small as asking her to wait until after dinner to offer my son a treat, or reminding her that it's not a good idea to give a toddler a bunch of liquid at night. and i bent over backwards to make sure i said everything in the happiest, friendliest, most sing-song voice possible to make sure she knew i didn't hate her. any disagreement or action that was different than what she originally wanted was taken as a wholesale rejection of her as a person, motivated by your pure hatred of her, which she'd be sure to reciprocate.>what’s strange to me about this behavior is that, 5-10 minutes after the outburst, she’ll behave as she normally does: she’ll be civil, maybe even nice and definitely doesn’t mention the outburst.for me, she'd be sure to sulk silently for days, but if she brought it up later, she'd have details confused. there's other things too (forgetfulness, occasional disorientation while driving familiar streets), but those things you said were especially uncanny, and i've known for at least a couple years that she had something wrong. she has no diagnosis but it is 100% some kind of dementia or maybe a result of possible strokes. she's offended and mad all the time, and after a while cannot even tell you accurately why, and makes less and less sense. i think it's behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/alrazv/help_does_this_sound_like_dementia/,Help!

"hi everyone, i’ve been reading the posts here for a few weeks and i thought i’d make a post of my own finally. i’m 30 years old, female, only child. my situation involves mourning both the loss of my mother, who died very unexpectedly at 61 this summer, and the gradual loss of my father (72), who was, in the aftermath of my mother’s death, diagnosed with dementia, potentially alzheimer’s and potentially ftd. he’s still in the early stages but progressed a lot the past few months. my parents had been divorced since 2005. this double whammy has left me a shell of a person.as is the case with the loved ones of so many, i’m sure — my whole life, my dad has taken care of everyone. his parents. my mom, even after they divorced in 2005 he helped her financially. his girlfriend for the past decade whose existence he hid from my mom as to not damage her even more (whole other insane story for another time). i remember telling a dear friend about all this, her response was “well, childhood is over.” her mom has had alzheimer’s for years and she was right.we started noticing changes in him in fall 2017. my mom, who saw him occasionally or talked to him on the phone, would drop hints to me that she was worried about him. i didn’t want it to be true, and i avoided her phone calls because of it. this is exactly what i was doing when she passed away. i hadn’t talked to her in weeks because i was avoiding the truth of my dad’s situation and now she’s gone. dealing with her arrangements was the hardest thing i had ever done. she died without anything prepared. normally my dad would have swooped in and helped with everything but suddenly everything was different and he didn’t know how. in the aftermath of all my mom’s shit, i shifted into high gear and got a bunch of stuff settled for my dad. this was before his diagnosis. drew up a will, got durable poa financial/health care. just powering through everything, numb. months later in december i, with his help, started to take control of his finances. spent days getting all the passwords for his online accounts, got added to his checking/savings, automated most bills, took away his checkbook.  i’ll be doing his taxes this year. the only thing i have left to do is figure out how to get added to his fidelity account as poa (they make it surprisingly hard to figure out) to make sure all of that is ok because he still thinks he’s ok with stocks. on top of everything, my dad is juggling a house here and a condo in fl. he is currently in the same state as me, but is insisting on going back to fl soon. he was supposed to go back after christmas but car repairs kept him here. no clue what’s going to happen once he gets down there. yes, he’s still driving. i’m choosing one battle at a time. on one hand i know he’ll be happier when he goes back to fl, on the other hand i don’t know how i’m going to deal. this two-states fiasco has made it hard to get him a neurologist, as it seems everywhere is booking two months out. with that said i did have him evaluated by a neuropsychologist in august, and he got an mri and eeg in late december. but nothing has come of it so far. the best i think i’ll be able to do is get him a neurologist down in florida and fly down for his appointments. i just want to discuss the results of his tests with someone and maybe get him medication. and on top of everything i am still dealing with so much regarding my mom... her probate isn’t finished because my pro-bono lawyer had a stroke, i have to figure out how to sell her condo and pay (from the estate of course) the apparent $45,000 in debt she left. and now i have my own credit card debt because i didn’t know how to comparison shop for funeral stuff. my mom and i had a complicated relationship too, she was a hoarder after my parents divorced, and i’ll never know whether or not her death was caused by an opiate overdose. that plus all the bureaucratic stuff left to do for my dad (in addition to the fact that dementia is just the most tragic disease known to man) makes it hard to adequately mourn her. and him. everything. all of this has been so draining. i know i’m preaching to the choir. i have gotten no help from my mother’s 3 siblings with her stuff, no help from my dad’s shitty girlfriend (who got her ass back to fl the minute stuff got weird) with his stuff. i resent her so much. she hasn’t seen him since july and she got drunk (also she’s supposedly in “recovery”) and told a family friend that she has a “real” boyfriend in fl. said she’s with my dad only because she cares about his health. if she cared she would be helping. definitely just using my dad at this point because she gets to live rent free. i’ve always disliked her, for good reason, and much like avoiding my mom’s phone calls about my dad, i avoided spending time with my dad for years so i wouldn’t have to see her. my dad and i were always so close and my disapproval of her character was the one thing we rarely have seen eye to eye on. that part hurts and there’s no going back. my sweet boyfriend has been a big help, as have my friends, though few of them know what this is like because we’re still fairly young. i know to contact the alzheimer’s association for anything i need. i know this post has been incredibly long winded. i guess i’m asking, how do i get through this? am i missing anything with my dad? what can i do to make things better for all of us? thanks for reading and all the best to everyone."," your story strongly resonated with me as i have recently endured a very similar situation. i too am an only child with divorced parents who share a similar relationship to the one you described. even down to the uninvolved siblings... i completely align.  in short, my father is an alcoholic paired with a dipping addiction who gave himself basal tongue cancer. he lived with and then near me in a skilled nursing facility for \~9 months while receiving chemo/radiation/surgeries. my mother in turn has been that 'voice' that you described in your testimonial and i have strongly encouraged her to get her end of life priorities in order even though i hope she'll be with me for many more years.  this experience was the hardest thing i've ever lived. keep that in mind as you rise each day. it can be lonely, hopeless, and incredibly frustrating. you have to remember that no one else is going to do a better job than you (even on your worst day) as their lack of involvement for the patient or the caregiver (you) shows that. &#x200b;here are some things i did that helped me through my darkest days and i hope that they are of us to you too:* **put your own oxygen mask on first.** your dad needs you but he needs you at your best. take time to detach and focus on yourself (be it reading, napping, a spa day, lunch with a friend, etc.). if you have to turn off your phone to be present and not worry, do it.* **find an outlet.** one day i woke up and realized my husband couldn't handle more than i'd already asked him to carry. i proactively sought out a counselor whom i still see biweekly. i vowed not to treat my anxiety, fear, and grief with medication and opted to talk out the things in my head. i also realized that this part of my life was bleeding into everything else. my office didn't need to know the gritty details of my struggle, nor all of the people at a wedding reception. telling someone who isn't listening isn't a quality way to feel better. tell someone who can hear you and help you.* **find a mantra.** for me that was maya angelou's *still i rise*. i made a small bracelet and wore it daily. when life got hard, i chanted the mantra until i could find calm.* **be vulnerable.** your counselor may talk to you about this, but if you aren't ready to see someone pick up brene' brown's book titled the [gifts of imperfection]( it's a small book but you should read it slowly. also, buy it versus renting from the library as you will undoubtedly want to re-read it.* **create boundaries**. this is something else my counselor and brene's book helped me to see. you have to create boundaries to protect yourself. this includes your sanity, finances, heart, etc.* **look at resources.** i found a caregiver advocate who was able to be me when i couldn't (while i was working, taking a much needed vacation, tending to my own needs, etc.). see if you can find someone like my friend jean at [kaybee]( to help you. also take advantage of:   * dementia support groups (in-person and virtual)   * medicare-covered in-home health visits (if your dad continues to digresses)   * free transportation services through local cancer/dementia agencies for your dad's appointments so he doesn't drive. uber/lyft also allow you to schedule pick-ups for appointments that he may have when you can't take him. that way you know he arrives/leaves appointments.   * get to know the staff who man the phones/scheduling at your dad's doctor offices. oftentimes they can arrange to have the nurse/doctor call you when he's in the appointment and it's like you're there (assuming you're medical poa\* and your dad has given permission to have his medical info disclosed to you)! that way you can still advocate for him and not pay a plane ticket.       * \*keep in mind that medical poa isn't enacted until the patient becomes incompetent (as you're attempting to prove) or unconscious. this is different than your legal poa which is more easily recognized.    * do you have friends or friends-of-friends who are nurses? it's good to make a list so that if you take a vacation or aren't around you have people to call on to visit him who have a trained eye.   * you're learning this with your lawyer handling your mom's probate, but you should look for a new attorney asap. you'll def want to find an estate and elder law attorney like my friends at [hunter law office]( **best of luck on this journey - you are not alone.** remember that no one will know if you do everything yourself and although there is pride in doing so, you've got to work smarter versus harder.

i need help with my mental health. i’m still having a really hard time accepting my mom’s decline and need to get a grip. this doctor also deals with dementia patients so i am taking a few of her old neurologist notes and asking him some dementia related questions and hoping for guidance on how to deal with her behavior and needs.how do you all cope? is anyone else drinking more alcohol than normal? not a healthy coping mechanism i know. please wish me luck at this visit. i need to do better. ," hey everyone, i wanted to give a little update. i also want to say thank you for the suggestions in the responses, and also that i can relate to so many of the feelings posted here. when we talked about my mom: first he had some background. my first visit to him was in 2014 when my mom first had her stroke. this time i had medical records with me from her old neurologist. so glad i did because this shrink is an md who also treats patients with dementia. so he read what i had from her mri's and explained some of the processes. i then asked him ""am i dealing with vascular dementia?"" he did not hesitate for even a second and said yes.so, there's that. we talked about her upcoming neurology appointment and he agreed that talking to the neurologist before hand was a good idea. he also gave it to me straight and said this really sucks and this will progress.which led to talking about how i'm doing. at one point i couldn't help myself and cried for a bit. just continuing to talk to him for awhile helped. a real life person. made me realize i need to find a local support group which so far i have been unable to do. anyway, he gave me a script for xanax and also trazodone for sleep. has anyone ever tried that? so... time to move on and cope. today i made plans to go to lunch with my mom and a casual friend i have in the building. she's a bit closer to my mom's age than mine, and is nice, so hoping my mom will make friends. who am i kidding, i know she isn't going to put in the effort to forge a new friendship. my efforts to introduce her to people hasn't resulted in that yet, but she'll still enjoy going out to lunch. if she is polite and appropriate i'll consider it a success. i hope all of you have a decent day. this sucks and anyone reading here feeling pain and frustration know that you are not alone.

," i am not a doctor and i don’t have a lot of specific experience with this drug, but we do talk about aria in our research group a lot. essentially, these drugs are antibody therapies target toward amyloid beta, the main component of amyloid plaques which is one of the hallmarks of ad. the idea is, by targeting amyloid plaques with antibodies, it will help break up or prevent aggregation and improve clearance. however if someone has a significant amount of amyloid in their brain, high doses of antibodies toward amyloid can cause brain swelling due to the increase in antibodies and immune cells. we can see this swelling during imaging, causing abnormalities. so far, i have not heard of it being treated as “serious” or “life threatening”, but again, i am not a doctor. and if you do sign up for the trial, they will explain the risks in a lot of detail. please remember, that during a drug trial, you are not always guaranteed to get the drug. there is always a chance you could be put in the placebo group. so it’s important to decide going forward if you are prepared for that possibility. the other possibility is if this drug fails to meet the outcome measures, they will likely quit producing it and allowing people to take it. even if it seems to be helping people. we process samples for several ad drug trials as well as do basic research. if you have any questions i might be able to answer, please feel free to message me.

"one day i was in ikea looking for a good sofa to jerk off on. i hopped on each sofa and took my dick out and started to stroke it. i had my favorite porn playing in the background(not revealing what it was because it's kinda weird). i went up and down my cock until i was ready to blow my load. i managed to stop before the floodgates broke loose. the store wasn't very busy this day so i didn’t get kicked out. after my session, i went to the restaurant inside ikea and had some famous swedish meatballs. the meatballs were subpar and gave me a slightly upset stomach. i didn’t think much of it, and i went back to shopping. i sat on the couch beat my meat and got off. this routine went on for a while because had high requirements for my couch. it had to be under 5000 dollars and the seat had to be comfortable for my bottom. it couldn’t be too prickly or too cold. after hours of wanking, i finally settled on a couch. the sofa was perfect. the seat was made out of smooth and thick fabric. i decided that i should reward myself and let it all out. it turns out that a lot of teasing can weaken a man’s penis and allow for a quick and far cumshot. i got cum all over the floor and the table that was sitting in front of the sofa. at this point, i had mixed emotions. i did not know if i should be proud f such a large cumshot or if i should be ashamed for making such a mess. the store was nearly abandoned, but one old couple walked by as i pulled my pants up. they saw the mess that i had made but did not assume that the white liquid was cum. the couple called management over to clean the mess because the couple wanted to buy the sofa as well. a couple workers came over to clean it up and asked what had spilled. i beat around the bush until the workers noticed that there were no cups or trash cans present near the sofa. then one of the employees had a disgusted look on their face. the employees excused themselves to the corner of one aisle and had a discussion. the came back and asked, “sir is this your cum”. i was young and scared so i responded yes. then the employee ran out and got the entire staff into the store. they got gloves and a mask and cleaned it all up. then the manager came and checked the security camera footage. there i was with my phone on a porn website and beating my meat hard. the manager looked deeper into the camera footage and found that i had sat on all the couches butt-naked and jerked off. to make matters worse, one of the couches i had fapped on had a small turd on it that came from my meatballs earlier. the manager said that i had to pay for all the damn couches and that i was banned from all ikeas. i was invited to his office to discuss plans to pay off the couches. the bill was over 200k dollars since i sat on many couches and had to pay numerous fines. i did not have that kind of money available so, the manager made me pay 50k up front and took some land i owned to get the rest of my money. on the bright side, i get to keep all the couches that i sat on. my house is not that big and cannot hold that many couches so i had to get rid of them all."," what’s your problem, do you seriously think this is the place to share your stupid joke? not tasteful, not funny, not beneficial to anybody in any way. get a life if there’s still any hope.

"my dad is in his early 60’s and i’ve been noticing some weird stuff in the past few years that i didn’t really notice before. he has, what i can only describe as inappropriate reactions to serious situations. i posted this on another sub, and the replies suggested dementia. my dad and i do not have a good relationship so before i bring it up to anyone i am hoping to have some internet people weigh in. anyway...here are some examples:first example: my sister in law had everyone over for dinner and made an announcement to tell us that she has cancer. everyone got really concerned, sad, teared up, etc. except my dad who was making silly faces and my 1 years old nephew while she made her announcement. i know he heard her. another example is my grandfathers funeral. my moms dad passed away. she has a large number of siblings and all her siblings and their spouses processed in/recessed out together during the service. kinda like a wedding but a funeral. my mom and all my aunts/uncles/their spouses were very somber looking, crying, looking down, normal sad funeral stuff. not my dad. he was smiling and looking for people in the pews to wave to. like he was a proud dad at a wedding or something. most recently, my younger brother and his wife just found out their having their first kid. exciting for them. exciting for everyone! you’d think. well they just bought a house and set a crib up in a room and gave my dad a tour. he acted like he didn’t even see it. he apparently thought it would be funny to not say congratulations or acknowledge the news. he just finished the tour, went downstairs hung out with the rest of the family pretending nothing happened. now this is his 8th grandkid, but it’s my brothers first kid. the normal response is to show you’re happy and excited. there are other situations like this. seems to be getting worse as he ages. like he’s totally oblivious to what the normal, socially accepted reactions are to things. he’s not a mean guy. he’s a goofy and sometimes annoying guy. a proud parent, pretty loving."," this sounds like a serious situation. i’m not a doctor, but this happened to my aunt who ended up having a tumor. she would say and do strange things . ex: my mom and grandparents and her were sitting around the table eating, my mom finished and got up to go smoke, my aunt said to her “sit down, not everyone is finished” ! now, my mom was 58 at the time and my aunt was probably 62 and in her right mind she wouldn’t say that!         another consideration could be that he may have a uti? in elderly people it can be serious and cause strange reactions and doing strange things. it can mimic dementia. get him to a doctor. if he isn’t always like that something is wrong. my best to you and your dad.

"i apologize if i'm about to come off as selfish, but i'm really at a loss...long story short, i moved into an apartment a few months ago where my bedroom shares a wall with the bedroom of my next door neighbor, who has dementia. my neighbor lives with a home attendant, who she frequently screams at. the screaming is sometimes accompanied by loud crying and the sound of objects falling to the ground or being thrown. she screams things like ""get out of here,"" ""i'll call the police,"" ""someone, please (help? hear me? this part is unintelligible to me),"" ""go away,"" etc. the first few times i heard her screaming, i honestly thought she was a victim of domestic violence/abuse. i ultimately asked the doorman if there was anything i could do about a noisy neighbor and told him the things she had been screaming (i didn't call the police out of fear that if she was a victim of abuse, and i called the police, she may suffer further consequences at the hands of her abuser). that's when the doorman told me she has dementia and ""just gets a little confused sometimes."" he mentioned there have been a few other complaints about her, but seemed to imply that nothing could really be done. her screaming and crying come at all hours. sometimes early in the morning (6 or 7am), waking me up long before my alarms go off (and i'm a heavy sleeper; i've quite literally slept through earthquakes before). sometimes around 5-7pm. sometimes until midnight, again keeping me awake and making it difficult for me to sleep. the screaming is harrowing. it leaves me feeling unsettled, anxious, and uncomfortable. i do use sound-isolating headphones, both during the day and at night, but the screaming is loud enough to cut right through it all unless i'm blaring my music/videos loud enough to give myself hearing damage.of course i can't even begin to imagine how she must feel. how confusing or scary it must be for her. and by no means do i mean to downplay her own circumstances and mental illness. but her screaming and banging is making me immensely uncomfortable and quite honestly leaving me a little distressed. and i'm not quite sure what to do. is there anyone i can talk to? i've seen some people online say they talked to social services, but tbh i'm not quite sure how to do that, or if it would have negative consequences for my neighbor (or for me, if she decided to retaliate). any advice on what steps i can take to handle the situation?tl;dr my neighbor has dementia and screams at all hours of the day, and it's leaving me anxious and uncomfortable. would appreciate some advice on how to approach the situation."," if those things are happening in all due respect that person should more likely than not be in the care outside of an apartment building. like a dementia care unit. my mother, before moving into a care center, walked out of her house and into the house of another down the street - walked up the stairs and laid down in a bedroom. if that home belonged to someone who owned a firearm i’m confident she would have been killed.if at any point she laid a hand on someone i’m sure she would have been sued.long story short, a person will acting dementia shouldn’t be in an apartment building it’s a lawsuit / problem waiting to happen.

"my grandmother has dementia, i’m not 100% sure as i don’t think anyone has officially had her tested, it’s just “dementia”. i don’t think my family really understood until recently how bad it was.  from my research, she’s a late stage 5, early stage 6 alzheimer’s. she’s been “a bit forgetful” for about 10 years now, but in recent years we learnt that she doesn’t shower, doesn’t cook, has regular accidents etc. when she’s stressed or anxious she has difficulty with names/faces, but is generally good with her family or people she’s known a long time. my grandfather recently passed quite suddenly and we had to move her into an aged care facility as she can’t live by herself.  this also revealed to us how much she relied on him to not look sick. her condition has significantly worsened since being there, she’s always confused, upset, angry. it’s not a dementia friendly place at all and the nurses aren’t the best at handling it. there’s no cues as to what time of day it is, the building is confusing and hard to find the dining/lounge room, etc. she has regularly said that she may as well not exist anymore as she has nothing to live for and she’s mad at the family for dumping her there. a couple of times i have found notes in her room with her name, my grandfathers name, their address and phone number, kids names, and usually the words “help” or “take me home”. my parents have a “guest house” that they currently use as an air bnb, and are considering moving her in there. from my mum and my research, it’s a dementia friendly space and there are slight modifications we can make to make it more enabling for her.  we’d also get home help, a morning or overnight nurse etc. we could bring her furniture from home, give her simple tasks, take her out for activities. more important than that is that she’d be around family more, have more independence and get her self confidence back. from my research she’s a late stage 5, early stage 6 alzheimer’s we’re aware that as she moves through stage 6 and into stage 7, she will get worse and will need to go into a dementia specific care place. is it worth moving her now, to my parents, only to move her again in a year or so?if she does move in to my parents (it’s actually a separate unit, self contained but with easy access to their house), what extra care would she need that we might have overlooked. or should we look at sending her straight to a memory care unit?"," thank you, that’s a great resource. at the moment she can still make coherent decisions, so i agree that we need to ask what she would prefer. if she were to decide to move in to my parents guest house, we’d take her to her old home and have her select furniture etc. she hates not having a say and resents when people make decisions for her, so that’s really important to us. she’s only happy if she’s with family, the current care place have told us that when she’s alone she gets panicked, angry or depressed almost constantly if we’re not there. it’s a tough decision, and as someone else mentioned, having in home care would cost around the same as a dementia care unit.. i guess the family will just have to come to a decision.

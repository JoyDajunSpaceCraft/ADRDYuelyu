does anyone have any experience or information on this clinical trial? we are trying to get my mom to participate but are a little concerned about the amyloid-related imaging abnormalities experienced in some patients. any insight would be great! [aducanumab trial](," i am not a doctor and i don‚Äôt have a lot of specific experience with this drug, but we do talk about aria in our research group a lot. essentially, these drugs are antibody therapies target toward amyloid beta, the main component of amyloid plaques which is one of the hallmarks of ad. the idea is, by targeting amyloid plaques with antibodies, it will help break up or prevent aggregation and improve clearance. however if someone has a significant amount of amyloid in their brain, high doses of antibodies toward amyloid can cause brain swelling due to the increase in antibodies and immune cells. we can see this swelling during imaging, causing abnormalities. so far, i have not heard of it being treated as ‚Äúserious‚Äù or ‚Äúlife threatening‚Äù, but again, i am not a doctor. and if you do sign up for the trial, they will explain the risks in a lot of detail. please remember, that during a drug trial, you are not always guaranteed to get the drug. there is always a chance you could be put in the placebo group. so it‚Äôs important to decide going forward if you are prepared for that possibility. the other possibility is if this drug fails to meet the outcome measures, they will likely quit producing it and allowing people to take it. even if it seems to be helping people. we process samples for several ad drug trials as well as do basic research. if you have any questions i might be able to answer, please feel free to message me.

"my father is 69 and was diagnosed with this about, meh, 10 years ago. he probably had signs of this before they found it, however. when this happened to him, every thing went to shit. my dad got sick, my life-long animal friend rocky the cat died, this led to my father being fired / forced into somewhat early retirement. my mother never worked and was a stay at home mother. a few years after this, my radial nerve in my right arm was destroyed by a rather uncommon virus, which took away my function of my right hand (which was the dominant one) from my elbow down. this caused me to lose the ability to do my favorite things, such as use a keyboard and mouse at the same time (i wanted to be an electronic engineer), drive my cars for tuning and racing purposes, because they are all stick shift. i couldn't shoot hoops anymore. this led me down the path of substance abuse, which led to legal issues. i want to start my life on my own, as i'm in my mid twenties, but have already been taken away recently due to things out of my control, and don't want to miss any remaining time my father has out on my own only to lose him shortly and regret not being there. i live with my parents and my girlfriend of three years. my mother is on medication for having a botched back surgery, and is in pain and can't move too well. she is always in a bad mood, having to see her loved one fall apart, and from the daily challenges of having to play ""where's waldo"" with 10000 different objects that my father misplaces every day. each day it's a hunt for a wallet, a flashlight, a can of cat food, whatever. my dad was always the ""cool dad"", never scary. oh, heres 20$, go see a movie and get a meal. mom said no to a sleepover? well i don't see why not. is your girlfriend hungry, too? heres extra for her. lets go get you that new game even if i'm behind on bills. i was always way closer to my dad then my mom. he was always the one on my side. now, he's on no ones side. he never got angry, ever. and now, he's angry all the time. no matter waht you say to him, he gets mad. most times, he just stares off into space while i talk to him. then, when i'm done, i will get a ""hmm"", and then he will walk away. i want to talk to him, but i don't know what about. he taught me most everything i know about computers and electronics as well as cars, which i take great pride in. now, when i talk or ask questions, it feels like hes not even paying attention. where i say a statement or ask a question, i basically get the same response, which is nothing. even things i know he knew, or at least should, he won't. his sense of time is greatly distorted. for example, he loves and basically only eats ice cream. hey dad, do you want strawberry ice cream? yeah sure, that sounds good, i haven't had that in 10 years or so, when in reality we had it last month. we have pet cats that he absolutely loves and adores and spends most of his time with, petting or conversating, if you can call it that. i'm glad he has something that makes him happy but it's almost like they are more his family then me. he will buy phone after phone after phone, because he can't figure them out. he thinks that by getting a new phone, he might find one he can actually use. the issue, however, is that they are all android based, and therefore, almost the same. i'm an adult and need to look out for myself but am in a down time recently and could use a small win somewhere. i've been pining over the new cod since it came out, as i thought if i got myself back into something i loved before i turned to substances, it could help with my overall sobriety and keep my head on straight. in the past, he would surely let me pay him back for it. now, i can't even ask because he can't recall what his finances look like and won't take any chances, which i can't blame him for, because in the grand scheme of things, me getting call of duty isn't going to change anyones life, however, it would go a long way towards making me happy. i just don't know what to do. i have no acceptance of this. i don't want to treat him like i see other sons treat their fathers with this illness, treating them like little children, building lego sets, etc, treating them like a baby. i don't want that kind of relationship with him, and would be faking it to him as well as myself if i tried. i don't know if this is terrible to say or not, but some times i think i'd rather him have something that wasn't so drawn out and character ruining. at least if he went quicker, he'd still be who he was and remember the things he did in his life, such as race cars, fly planes, build communications equipment on war boats, build computers, care for all animals, instruct skydiving, do amateur radio for 40+ years, and so much more. now, he's just...some one else. when i talk to him or see him watching tv, it's like hes not there. it's a constant hunt for lost items every day, which he claims were stolen, when no one has been here. he will say something a long the times of "".....did you hear that xxxxx happened this week?"" three or four times at one sitting for dinner. i don't even know the point of me posting this i just have no one else to talk to. my girlfriend, at least partly, thinks that i am just playing off this situation to try and draw pity and that it's not really that big of a deal, or at least that's how i feel. i never see eye to eye with my mother, we butt heads at every opportunity for a reason i will probably never know. most of my irl friends have grown up, moved on, left, or we just don't talk. some left because of the reputation they heard about me and some legal issues. my online friends who i've gamed with for 20+ years in some cases, aren't very close to me any more. some stopped gaming, others swapped games to ones i don't own or can't afford. some grew up, went to school, got married, and are gone. most of my online buddies treated me better then my irl friends. they would come to visit, take me on a vacation, come stay a week here or there, gift me a game so i could continue to play with the group, treated me very well. but they are all basically gone. i don't do social media of any sort so i don't have a way to find people / have people find me, and after losing / switching phones last year, lost the only gateway people had to find me. i enjoy playing league of legends with my male cousin whos a few years younger, as he doesn't judge me and knows most of what i've gone through, but became a full pharmacist and has seen his free time / time to game almost completely diminish. i love sports, but uh, yeah. cleveland. no lebron anymore. rats. i know i'm not any different then any other child of a parent with this illness, but i just hate change so damn much it makes me sick. i literally feel like i wasn't supposed to be born at the time i was, that i was meant for something else. i just can't wrap my motivation (what small amounts their is) around getting an underpaying job, struggling to afford anything i want/ need, having no free time, and then coming home to a depression factory. i don't want to do it, and don't even think i can. so once

"let's deal with the realities of observing dying - the hard reality...my mother who has end stage dementia and probably had a stroke, has stopped eating. she is unconscious.she has now had her first dose of iv hydromorphone, administered by a 'butterfly' in her left shoulder so no additional injections require pricking of the skin. the nurse tells who administered it tells me that it is cold going in (the butterfly or the fluid?) and she reacted with a wince. apparently it took about ten minutes for any effect. the dosage is 'very low': 0.13 mg, and it can be repeated every two hours if needed. judgement calls by the nurse although i can ask for it presumably.her breathing is oral (very little nasal), a lot of heavy breathing and snoring - much worse than her normal. she occasionally raises her arms high. sometimes i clasp my hands in hers when she does so. periodically she burps or  shakes her legs.because she must have a  very dry mouth i asked for one of those foam lolipops that my dying father (lewy's body dementia, shriveled up in a ball in his bed shaking as a shrunken man) was given in his last days. 'we haven't used those for a long time'. she recommended that my idea of moistening my finger with gelled water would be safer.  her tongue is extremely rough, as if severely blistered. she accepted the gel, still unconscious.i also tried using chips of ice and holding them at her mouth and letting the water drip extremely slowly down her throat. but i dropped one and figured this was too risky for aspiration (choking).i asked the mature nurse with 22 years of experience how long this lasts and she said that without food 2-3 weeks, without water 2-3 days. then i realized that i could be instrumental in killing my mother. not something i welcome.looking up online the subject of end stage dementia hydration i found...[it reads that dehydration is not painful and hydrating (even by iv) can be dangerous and cause suffering. i asked a care aide about somehow hydrating my mother by iv. she told me i would have to talk to the nurse practitioner during office hours (there are so few physicians in the people's republic of canada that we have taken substitutes in nursing homes). i have to be brave and witness her suffering and sit with her throughout this prolonged last gasp of life. i have to not flinch from witnessing death, straight in face. the other day i imagined the yamadhutas (angels of death) approaching and at another time i felt a huge hole in my physical body as if her dying would leave me not whole. i do no mean emotionally. i mean literally. i do not believe in any of this supernatural stuff, but this is what i experienced in my involuntary imagination.", thank you for posting ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/aeh3rf/looking_dying_straight_in_the_face/,Looking dying straight in the face

my mother and i are taking care of my father with a part time helper. he just came home from a nursing home a week ago and they did not feed him much or do almost anything else. he lost 20 pounds in 19 days and has a large bruise on his ribs and a swollen elbow because of his time there. he had not had a bm since bringing him home. and today i go to get him out of bed and is covered in feces. i couldn't even do anything but sit and sob for ten minutes before even attempting to clean him up. i had to shave his head to get the dried excrement out of his hair. all while he is is twitching uncontrollably. he fights every step of the way in the shower and getting dressed. this is just the start of my day and i am really getting burnt out.i just had to get it out there because if i say anything to my mother she will just try to give me advice or explain that she is tired too. i don't want advice or to be commiserated with i just want to vent sometimes and she makes it impossible. i am taking advantage of the situation by going back to school but i don't know how much longer i can do it., vent away all you want!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ae9abw/somedays_i_just_want_to_leave_and_not_look_back/,Somedays I just want to leave and not look back

"dying isn't easy and fast like in the movies! **my mother has been dying in slow motion for a decade and now has end-stage dementia**, but doctors say that she will die probably from some infection or inability to breathe. within two weeks she is expected to die. without going into details as to why she is in a nursing home, here i will just say that she is and it causes me great shame that she is there instead of in my home being looked after by private nurses (i have no spouse or children to assist and it is very expensive). while my work (and purely selfish interests) kept me away from her for up to half of the year for the first six years, for the last two and a half i have been remaining here, visiting 3-4 days per week. for all of her years in a government nursing home i hired a companion to visit 5 days per week and when i was back here had her come in 1-2 times. in the last two years her dementia has worsened and i visit 3-4 days originally and in the last weeks, every day. for the most part, my siblings did not contribute time with her.here is my anguish...when the person most important to me in my family (and who was most loving and generous with me during my childhood especially) was about to quickly die from a terminal disease i used the excuse that i wanted to remember him as he was when he was well and rather than staying the unknown number of weeks i returned to my business overseas that needed my attention. on his death bed he asked for me several times and i was not there. this is the only terrible thing i have done in my life but i was young. now that i am a mature man i view the care of my mother very differently, even though i was much closer to my grandfather. trying to make up for this error has involved years of spending time and money. my attitude has been 'this is payback time for all those years of taking care of me as a child, all those welcoming returns to home as an adult too.' but always this giving was out of shame, as if i had put my mother in prison. when she was first moved to the nursing home she cried and said 'but what have i done wrong?' as if she was being punished. but she was not safe at home without 24-hour care even ten years ago.    in the last two years among other statements of being lost she would always say, every day, multiple times over, 'i want to go home' and it was like a knife in my heart for i have no home, i just rent a room. now i see why asian families work so hard -- it is not for the children, we don't have to be disciplined to take care of our children, it is our old and sick parents that require the work, building a house, having savings -- for the years of elder care. children might repay this, but a parent cannot. it is our debt to them.  so ashamed of this not being with my beloved grandfather when he needed me, when my mother became ill i promised her (and more importantly myself) that i would not let her die alone, that i would be there physically and attentively for the last weeks and hours. i would literally hold her hand or embrace her as she died. i would comfort her and do all that i could. as good as the professionals are, this is my responsibility and promise. it is the only way i can make up for my ingratitude to my grandfather. and i became very attached to my mother, advocating for her with the medical team, monitoring her care, etc. i don't know how it happened but by serving my mother i became so very attached to her. i did it out of a sense of obligation and cleaning karma but it has become as if an obsession. my brother-in-law said many years ago that when she no longer recognized me as her son i would stop going in to visit her, stop taking her out to the park, stop sending her letters, and i knew this would not be the case. it shouldn't and it hasn't made any difference. she is the person who worried over my health as a child, who nursed me, who gave up the bed so i could have cheap rent in order to go to college.  so, for months i fed her by hand but now i must face her death personally. as an unmarried and retired man with no children this is not difficult time-wise. but i am truly terrified. i weep and wail visiting her and tremble that she will die when i am not there. i cannot be there 24 hours. but i want to keep my word. i can barely talk to staff. i am overwhelmed.  **it is not the being dead that i find so troublesome, it is the dying process itself.**aside from the ethical problem there is the challenge of how to help her die. the other day one of the few things she said to me (she has lost the ability to speak now) was ""i don't know how"". perhaps she meant '...how to die'. my tears might upset her. intellectually i understand death, for ten years i have been devastated by anticipatory grief that has affected my ability to work and be healthy. and now it is the end.third problem is i do not want her to suffer. here in canada, without a directive while mentally competent assisted suicide is not legal. it would be murder. and even though i am not conventionally religious, i consider matricide one of the most heinous sins. she told me many years ago that she wanted a lethal injection rather than suffer, but her suffering is mostly mental: sadness, anxiety, confusion, fear.  she might also have cancer or be suffering from a stroke. we do not know her inner life now. she looks at me in despair. all i can do is sing for her, caress her face, carefully give her moistening 'food', keep her in a comfortable position. and be there at the final hour. i do not care for funerals and such rituals after she is gone, i want to do all i can now. if she becomes very agitated or despondent or is in great pain they have promised to give her hydromorphone. in her state the drug could kill her if given for long duration, but her suffering i cannot bear. when she is truly near the end i will go sleep at the nursing home. but even then, i need to sleep and i might not be at her bedside the exact moment that she dies.i want to help her die and do not know how. simultaneously, i do not want her to die. this is despite the 'her' being hardly even there - the body, the mind, the behaviour - there is only a shell of the woman who cared for me. yet it is still her. and my promise still applies - to reduce her suffering and be there at the final hour.**how do you help a person with alzheimers die peacefully?**"," thanks for all your comments. actually, the residential care facility in bc has some very good employees despite being under-staffed. they change her position every two hours, continuously ask if there is anything i need, and are careful about her safety and welfare. among the few full-timers that they have many have developed a relationship with her over the years

"i tried a mind palace with my grandma who has alzheimer‚Äôs. for those who don‚Äôt know, a mind palace, also known as the journey method or method of loci, is where you imagine a place you know very well such as your home, create an imaginary path throughout it, then imagine what you want to remember in locations across this place (e.g. your shopping list spread across your house). you can use it to learn and recall high amounts information very quickly.i was curious if these techniques would work for my grandmother (currently at roughly stage 5 on gds scale). so i used 5 spots in the room and had her imagine 5 objects in each of those places (banana, apple, grapes, chocolate, scarf), usually she will forget most non meaningful things very quickly so i thought i would see if this could make something stick. it is worth noting she doesn‚Äôt actually know she has alzheimer‚Äôs and won‚Äôt accept it, so i phrased this by referring to it as an ‚Äúimagination game‚Äù and while first ‚Äòplacing‚Äô each object she seemed agitated because i think she was self conscious she wouldn‚Äôt be able to remember.once i had her imagine all the objects i went back to each one to test her and she got all correct, i then left it there. 10-15 minutes later she nudged me and said ‚Äúwhy am i remembering banana, apple, grapes, cheese, and scarf?‚Äù, so she could only vaguely remember me asking her to imagine objects, but she remembered 4/5 objects 10 minutes later. earlier today (27 hours later) i pointed to the locations and asked if she knew what the objects were, she didn‚Äôt remember doing the ‚Äúgame‚Äù yesterday but still managed to get banana and chocolate, i found 2/5 objects still to be impressive though due to the time that had passed.there wasn‚Äôt really a point to this other than to satisfy my curiosity because she won‚Äôt remember how to memorise lists or know to use the associations unless prompted, but i found it interesting and thought it was worth sharing.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/abpzum/mind_palace_test_with_my_grandma/,Mind palace test with my Grandma

"my mom's short-term memory has been declining for about five years. i'm 20 now, and my mom is 63, but i remember that she would have little lapses in my high school days such as when i'd need to be picked up from school. i know there were more tiny things, but i can't recall any more examples. since i left for college, she has lived alone, and my siblings don't live near her, so most of our observation has come from breaks and holidays.two christmases ago, i got her a sweatshirt. she tried it on, said it was a bit small, and put it on the back of a chair. the next day, she picked it up and asked whose it was, and my siblings and i told her that it was her present. she tried it on again and had the same reaction, as if it were the first time she were trying it on. this was the first time something more substantial seemed to be completely gone from her memory (but incidents like this are still few and far between).towards the beginning of this year, there were a couple times that i came home from school for a weekend, and i had called her in advance and told her when i'd be coming. when she got home from work and i was there, she asked if she knew i was coming home.a lot of times she doesn't remember details well the first time unless it's something particularly extraordinary or shocking. it often takes her at least two to three times of hearing something before she remembers it, but sometimes my siblings and/or i will repeat the same information 20+ times until she remembers. some examples of things that she has asked about or forgotten multiple times during the time i've been home this winter break: the gender of my pregnant cousin's baby, the gender and name of the dog my sister just got, who duchess is (my roommate's cat, and i talk about her frequently), whether i've watched a madea christmas, and when i'm picking my partner up from the airport.i know it'd be best to bring these concerns to a doctor, but i don't think she's ready to accept that it could be something serious. when she knows she's forgotten something, she usually gives an alternate reason for forgetting (it's winter, i told her after dark, etc.). my sister suggested she visit a doctor, and she said she was just having empty nest syndrome.this got a bit long, but is this similar to anyone's experience of alzheimer's in its early stages? she doesn't seem to have any other concerning behavior besides short-term memory loss (i.e. no issues with motor skills or anything of the sort). does this look like any other condition besides alzheimer's, or maybe even normal age-related issues?"," i would just make the appointment for her.  tell her you are sure it is nothing, but please do it to make to make you feel better.  make a day out of it, go to lunch and make it fun.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ab3u3w/does_this_sound_like_alzheimers_onset/,Does this sound like Alzheimer's onset?

(they weren't taking into consideration the sugar of alcohol, so they were surprised to find out they had diabetes when they didnt have a habit of eating sweets) if she does have a history of heavy alcohol use, does the alzheimers diagnosing doc know about it?  remember alz diagnoses are made in part by eliminating other possibilities.i only know about the werneke korsakoff one because apparently my dad was diagnosed with that some time before i was born, but i guess it resolved..? he was diagnosed with alzheimer's later in his 60s and i always wondered if the wk contributed to it.both of these brain problem causes are stoppable/reversible/managable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/aaqebw/mom_got_diagnosed_with_early_onset_alzheimers/,Mom got diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers last december.

"i will make my first point brief. my mother has an unknown dementia (vascular? ad? combination) and except for drugs (including more those to control her behaviour than her state of mind) no treatment is administered. the residential care facility in british columbia designed for people to live in for 3-6 months, has numerous residents like herself - who are living there for closer to a decade. most also have dementia and are in wheelchairs. she doesn't get better, she doesn't die. and the reality is that both herself and co-residents are there not so much out of medical need as social/financial need. it is the 21st century equivalent of the poor house.i moved back to canada in order to be very close to her. i go in 3-4 days per week. i monitor and advocate of her behalf with the wholesale doctor who appears once a week and its a constant fight with the employees (not so much the nurses, instead the care givers union), some of whom should not be in this line of work but they can't be fired. constantly changing staff. way too many part-time and casuals. understaffed too. its like the woody allen line about a low standard hotel: 'the food is horrible here. and such small portions!'if children received this kind of mediocre treatment there would be law suits and cries of 'something must be done!' it is easy to blame the government (that we elected) but i say the fault lies with the man in the mirror. it is shameful that  we (modern man in developed countries, at least)  institutionalizes aged parents. only in my own 'young old age' do i realize that the achieving of financial stability is not about the discipline required to raise our children (that comes naturally) but rather the sacrifice we need to make in order to look after our parents. today (always?) what it requires is family cohesion (another thread), funds from working hard, avoidance of both recreational and unnecessary pharmaceuticals, a strong community and a commitment for the long road ahead. no one and nothing prepared me for this. my only excuse is that in the 1970, people died relatively suddenly, certainly not so much in slow motion. and that we lack stable community structure. thus, i question the medical model of old age and reliance on the state.but, the bottom line personally is the appalling fact that i have failed my mother."," nursing homes are pretty much universally bad. in some us states there are publicly funded programs to provide in-home caregiving instead of nursing home care because it is still cheaper and better to pay a caregiver or nurse to take care of an individual at home than to have one caregiver and nurse assigned to a dozen nursing home residents.&#x200b;for my generation, caring for our parents is going to be even more of a disaster since most of us will never own homes to move our parents in to or be able to afford to take time off work to care for them...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/aalsfk/89_year_old_in_public_care_in_canada_very/,89 year old in public 'care' in Canada - very disappointed with standards

"my mom was doing faily well. she knew us. bathed herself. went out everyday. did her crossword puzzle. she needed help with most thing, amd accepted. communicated her desires and annoyances. our family has done our best to give her a stable, comfortable life as the disease progressed. she knew this, and although it could be frustrating for her she accepted and thanked us for our help.then one day she thought we were trying to murder her. a few days earlier she had gotten into a mood - not wanting to do anything, brooding. we just noted and kept going. she tried kicking my dad. knocked some things off the table. we proceeded with caution, but thought a family meal at a mexican restaurant would help. she attacked my dad in the restaurant. we had to put childlocks on in the car. she calmed a bit, but said nasty things to me and my sister while we watched tv that evening. it only got worse the next day. more broken things. scissors snuck into a slipper. she attempted to run away several times. we decided to take her to the er to look for infections. it took 4 hours to get her in the car, and only after the sheriff convinced her that we werent trying to murder her. yes, we called 911 because she ran into the road and stopped a ups driver saying ""theyre trying to murder me.""spent 8 hours in the er. she was calm for 6 of them. then she attacked me and the nurses. she had to be sedated. they didn't believe us when we brought her in. but that sun went down and it was like a shadow fell on her. no signs of infections. we got our transfer to a behavior facility, the geriatric unit. she's been there for 3 weeks as they've tried different meds on her. for the first week and a half nothing worked. they had to isolate her from other patients because she was attacking them. the nurses (older than mom) brought aides from other units to help her. finally, haldol three times a day at 5mg worked. but it's effected her body. she can't sit up. she's stiff. she cannot talk. her eyes wont open. she is seeing things. she can't walk well. she needs help with everything. we skipped a few steps in the progression of the disease. instead of the rocky, winding path down, we're blindly base jumping to the unknown.i'm hoping part of her physical ailments are due to her body's fatigue from that week and a half of rage, paranoia, and fear. maybe those parts will get better. they're testing different meds on her now. maybe that will make her body better. we are taking her home next week, although the facility is advising against that and suggests we find memory care for her. my dad won't hear it.truthfully, all we can do is maker her feel comfort and support.", stay strong and hang in there!  i second the thought about getting an elder care counselor to help you through.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/aa2ezf/base_jumping/,Base Jumping

"my dad passed away a week ago and we buried him on friday. he was 67. was diagnosed with alz at age 59. he was my best friend. ivy league grad and phd in clinical psychology. my mom took care of him herself for way too long. we donated his funeral flowers to the memory care unit he was living in for the past year. hopefully the people he would introduce himself to 30 times a day enjoy them. my only word of advice is, unless you‚Äôre a millionaire and can afford home care, which we were most certainly not, there is no solution and no easy road to this disease. it will tear your heart apart and will put your family under immense stress. i am glad my dad is now finally free of this horrible disease. i feel free as well despite how much i miss his smile. anyone here who wants to pm me for advice, feel free. if you‚Äôre just starting out along this journey, there are things you should be prepared for. i willnot be giving you good news because there is none. it only gets worse from where you are now. but i wish someone had prepared me for what this experience is like.", getting mums to step back when it‚Äôs no good to nobody is the hardest thing. i wish she handed it over earlier but who am i to decide how that should roll.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a91o3i/its_finally_over/,It‚Äôs finally over
"hi, my grandma, my mom's mom, passed away a few years ago due to alzheimers disease, so my mom is genetically predisposed to have the same condition, and shes 55 years old.recently, ive been noticing (and she has to) that shes been exhibiting symptoms of early dimentia/alzheimers. ive decided to grow lion's mane mushroom for her as research has suggested it has neurogenic effects.do you know anything about this or have heard of people using lions mane for this purpose? ive read a few encouraging articles.any tips to help combat this disease (if it is actually beginning to effect my mom), besides traveling, exercise, and diet?im a little scared to be honest. ok a lot scared. i dont want to have to have to watch my mom dissolve for years like my grandma did. its pretty scary to me.thank you all in advance."," lion mane ""dual extraction"", keto diet, coconut oil 3-4 table spoon, exercise, not much sugar.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a8xmo0/treating_alzheimers_with_lions_mane_mushroom/,Treating Alzheimers with Lions Mane mushroom
"hey all, i'm posting here asking for advice because i'm getting tired and stressed out. i'm currently 16 years old, will turn 17 soon so i kind of feel like i'm sort of pushed in the middle of this whole thing. just some background information, my grandma is currently 88 years old. she spent most of her time in the philippines, working as a teacher. she only came to america to take care of my older sister and i. she was most likely 62 when she came to america, since my sister was born in 1992. my grandmother was put in a nursing home, so obviously she is taken care of nurses and they also focus on making sure she gets rehab for her weak knees and such. my mom visits her everyday, because her alzheimer's affects her so much and so often. however, this reoccurring behavior, which is hard to control, stresses out my mom greatly. the things my grandma claims are pretty ridiculous, which i know is common for those who have alzheimer's or dementia. specifically tonight, she told us she didn't want to sleep or go on the bed because the nurses put snakes under the bed. she's always afraid that everyone will leave her, including us; she says that the nurses gossip and plan about it, and tell her that we're leaving. she told us she saw people marching outside, and that i think something was burning in the room next to hers. other times, she's claimed that she saw starving people who begged her for help, and said that the nurses were the ones not helping them. i assume all the military kind of stuff she sees are because i believe she was involved in a war in the philippines, since she was born in 1930. anyways, because my mom is stressed but also cares for my grandma, she tries to reassure and convince her the visions and voices aren't real, that it's all in her head. she would usually say stuff like, ""just remember those are all in your head, it's not real. you need to rest because if you don't it'll continue to bother you. we'll never leave you."" mainly stuff like that. tonight, she snapped and started arguing with my grandma. my grandma was obviously in denial; her claims that the nurses were plotting against her still stood, even though my mom went around the nursing home and asked the nurses about it. she argued and told my grandma she was in denial, that it was fake and she shouldn't believe it, she stuck her hands and feet under the bed to prove there weren't snakes under the bed. i understand that my mom is frustrated because she's the only one who visits her everyday and has to deal with her alzheimer's, and tonight was just the time she snapped and couldn't control it. however, i really do think she's approaching this in an incorrect manner. i don't think telling her that it's all in her head and that it's fake will work out, but what do i know? sorry about this wall of text, but i really don't know who else to turn too. hearing them arguing for almost an hour was extremely stressful and frustrating, and my mom doesn't want me to get involved because i'm still young. if i am correct and if my mom isn't approaching this in a right manner, what should i do or tell her?"," i completely agree with what the other commentors said.. find support groups, use hotlines, all that.. also that white lies are a good tactic to use to try to calm them down. maybe if theres music she likes you can try to have that on in the background to see if itll help her calm down faster.but also if you can manage it, forgive your mom for doing things "" incorrectly"" or appearing to be stubborn or repetitive in the way she approaches things. tell her how you feel yeah, and of course share suggestions with her, encourage her to go to support groups too.. but sometimes it can be so frustrating for the primary caretaker. its like your brain gets trapped and you just do what you were going to do to deal with the situation. i tried to show my mom different ways of dealing with my alz dad and grandma too, and for some ideas that worked, she didnt always do. i think its hard to do it ""right"" all the time. sometimes i think she just went on autopilot just cuz mental exhaustion. so i didnt argue about it. let them take care of a problem how they wanna do it. share suggestions, but maybe be gentle about it.if your mom permits, jump in and help too. but i dont blame her for wanting to protect you from it.

"i hope this is an appropriate place to discuss this, but i'm wondering if anyone has tips on how to talk with someone with alzheimers. my grandmother has recently progressed pretty fast. she has gotten very stubborn, and argumentative with the disease so i'm just wondering how to effectively talk to someone when they're in this state? unlike some of my family members, i know getting frustrated and raising my voice won't work, and will probably only make things worse (said family members are not going to be looking after her too much anymore though, so that's good). last time i was in this situation, i just sat there awkwardly wanting to deescalate the situation but had no idea how. i am also not going to be a long term care solution or anything, but i would like to what the alternative is to getting frustrated? is there anyway i can deflect a situation? for example, she has a habit of thinking she needs to go somewhere, and has even tried to walk out of the door. or is set on going the wrong way to get out of a house, and you can't tell her otherwise. the very last thing i want to do is get upset with her as i understand it's just the disease. i really appreciate any insight anyone has. "," i agree with all the above! remember that most alzheimer's patients deal on a daily basis with anxiety. whatever you do, you need to go about it in a calm, loving manner.also remember that they progressively have a hard time following conversation. keep it short and simple. the same goes for written communication. they cannot follow a long paragraph. break it down into smaller ""bites.""good luck üòÅ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a8kq1w/tips_on_approaching_loved_ones_with_alzheimers/,Tips on approaching loved ones with alzheimers?
"okay, so my mil--who's 4 1/2 years into her diagnosed alzheimer's journey--cannot sleep tonight despite her nighttime meds. i also have a chemical imbalance that at times keeps me from sleeping as well.  i suppose maybe god has me awake tonight because he knew my mil wouldn't be able to sleep tonight either (eastern standard time). this is going to be a looooonnnngggg night...."," there was a period during my mom‚Äôs progression with this where she wouldn‚Äôt sleep at night. there was one stretch where we went for about 96 hours with little to no sleep, all the while still taking her sleep medsthere was a period of time before the sleepless nights where she would sleep all day. the upside is it seemed like a phase that passed after a while and she returned to her normal sleep cycles ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/a8jbkq/not_sleeping/,Not Sleeping
"i‚Äôll give some back story. my mom was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer‚Äôs about two years ago. we aren‚Äôt super close but she‚Äôs my mom and with christmas coming up i saw something that i thought if i were in her position i would want. but then i thought what do i really know about being in her position at all. anyways, i‚Äôm looking for advice on how to even broach the topic of her alzheimer‚Äôs without her feeling like it‚Äôs something wrong with her. i want to give her a gift that i think will help her, in admittedly a minor way but to me sometimes the small things make a big difference. [for context the gift is shoelaces that turn shoes into slip ons, she‚Äôs a very outdoorsy person and she‚Äôs confined to slip ons now so i thought it would be nice for her to not have to restrict which shoes she wore]. should i even give the gift? just wondering on people‚Äôs experiences or advice. thank you.

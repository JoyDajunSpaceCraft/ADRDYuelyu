"my father in law passed away in 2019. he set up a trust that contains a lot of money in various things. some pay out monthly or every three months. my mil already had a pseudodementia diagnosis. unfortunately, it seems more like real dementia because she declined crazy fast after he passed away. we moved in to take care of her. this has been a huge strain on us emotionally because we also have a toddler and she is sort of erratic. she keeps doing stuff with the money. she pulled out a good bit of money and now we won't find out until tomorrow how much in surrender fees and taxes will be lost and if it impacts any of the money left in the account. this particular thing was set up with my son's future in mind so it doubly hurts. she did this all behind the back. she gets money every month, and between her and us we are probably bringing in over 6k a month and have no mortgage, and she already has a sizable amount on hand in savings. she said she did it in case she ""needs more money"" but she doesn't need anymore money! so the reasoning makes no sense.  if we try to talk to her about it she explodes on us and tried to leave the house (which we don't want because we don't want her to drive) this is not the first time something like this has happened. early 2020 a financial advisor had her sign over everything to him in a sketchy agreement. my husband had to go argue with him and talked to a lawyer. the lawyer agreed it was financial abuse (or something of the sort, i don't remember the exact words) buy later called back and said they it was to small of a case for him. and she also closed out another account that was giving her 1k a month because it was her inheritance from her mother and she wanted it because ""it was hers!"" so we just let her do it because she was going crazy over it and it technically was hers. but the money in the trust is supposed to be for her, my husband and my child's future and they are all in plans with that in mind. i want to call aps and have them force an evaluation if they deem it necessary (i think they would) but my husband refuses and we can not get her to cooperate. i can't keep living this way though. i want her to have an official diagnosis because she is always threatening to call the law and senators on us and i can't take this. i already have really bad anxiety and had ppd before moving in here that i never recovered from. please help"," first of all, regarding the benedryl, it is an anticholinergic and it actually increases the chance of getting dementia if taken for extended periods of time. many meds such as xanax, valium, and some antidepressants are also anticholinergic. i suggest you to review each of her meds. i also urge anyone to review what they are taking and try to find a substitute if it’s an anticholinergic. secondly, i found it best with my husband to present him with a document such as a poa or living will to get him to sign it. it’s pointless to have a theoretical discussion, it is beyond their capabilities to grasp the concept. i think that he is now no longer competent to sign but i got durable poa back when he was competent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ovrxs8/money_issues/,Money issues
"every time it is mentioned either by myself or another family member the conversation gets changed, and that person is now accused of wanting ""all of it"". no, we just want affairs in order and the person safe. she constantly talks about dying wants everything to go to the right people, but thinks we are either going through her paperwork or stealing it. the five phone calls a day of her ""emergencies"" are taking a toll. but i can't do a damn thing.", it helped me to show my husband the rules for attorneys and let him know if his attorneys broke the rules they would be taken to court and in a whole lot of trouble with the law. it helped reinforce that this was to help everyone protect him and there were repercussions if anyone tried to do anything to take advantage of him.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ovnjig/seriously_how_do_you_bring_up_poa_assisted_living/,"Seriously, how do you bring up POA, assisted living, or Advanced Directives to stubborn people?"

"hey guys, new to the community, and just curious if anyone has any resources or experience with cbd and help for dementia? my father in-law has been diagnosed with dementia, still very early in the diagnosis but i’ve been curious on if cbd oil might help him. he is starting to lose his speech a bit, knows what he wants to say just trails off and gets lost, he forgets newer memories asks a lot of the same questions but still has those old back end memories from years and years ago. just for context. my googling on the subject has been limited and didn’t give too much help.thank you guys!"," i'd like to start by saying that i am not a doctor, so take my comment with a grain of salt and continue to do your own research and check with your physician. cbd can be beneficial for helping to promote relaxation and ease anxiety and pain, sadly, it won't reverse the effects of the disease. israel has been doing a lot of research regarding cannabinoid use for alzheimers and dementia patients, as well as other conditions. as someone who has worked for medically endorsed cannabis dispensaries, i have worked with patients who use low dose thc at night to promote sleep and around meals to stimulate the appetite. i have also worked with folks who use cbd during the day because it is non psychoactive but still provides emotional and physical relief.if you live in a legal state, please check out your local dispensaries. if you can, it's best to buy product that has been regulated by your state as this generally ensures a  cleaner and safer product. don't be shy about shopping at the weed store as most budtenders are more than happy to take the time to show new users the ropes and help them find something that works for their specific needs. if you simply must buy cbd from the gray market, request to see test results before you make your purchase. never ever buy any cbd products without asking for test results. if the company cannot provide those to you, purchase elsewhere.anecdotally, my mom has mild dementia and a drinking problem, so i am trying to turn her onto low dose thc edibles as an alternative. i noticed whenever she takes them, she is so much happier than she is usually.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ovk0xo/cbd/,CBD?

did anyone else have elderly relatives who started to forget things or acted differently in any way as they got older? i have heard that the beginnings of dementia can present similarly to “normal” cognitive decline in the older population. how can you tell the difference between just normal aging and possible early dementia?," for me, the first sign that something was off with my mother cognitively was her retelling of stories/memories. she completely forgot my childhood but seemed to clearly remember my older sister's and her before kids years. her memories seemed to be stuck in a certain era. when i showed her pictures from my childhood, she didn't remember what our house looked like, and barely recognized childhood me. the second big flag that i overlooked was her poor story telling/random ramblings when she would talk. that woman couldn't tell a story to save her life. when she tried, we were all left confused as to what happened. a major one was her trying to tell me about a man who she dated. according to her he tried to jump off a bridge because he stole a sewing machine, and she borrowed books from different men so she could study with another?!? but when we called her out on her nonsensical plot line, she acted as if she never said that at all. when left alone, she will ramble on about random subjects. but lose complete awareness of what she's saying.  on ""good days"" she seems to have it together. she'll boss me around, and act like she has a handle on her finances. but her executive functioning skills are gone. she loses sense of time, gets distracted easily, gets overly obsessed with random events, and overall just lives in the moment...",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ovfc32/distinguishing_between_normal_aging_and_dementia/,[deleted by user]

"i’ve known for a few years that my dad was starting to get forgetful. it was me who suggested he see his doctor. i had to put extra pressure on my mom to make the appointment for him (i think she’s still a little bit in denial about it, understandably) and i had to go with him to make sure the doctor knew all the things my sisters and i had been noticing.well, i was at the doctor’s office with my dad when the doctor told him the news and gave him a referral to a neurologist. i knew it was coming, so i initially felt some relief that a professional was seeing what i was seeing and i wasn’t just being paranoid about my parents getting older. but then as i drove home i was hit with overwhelming sadness. i’ve been crying off and on for the past two days. although i knew this was coming, now it’s actually here and it’s real and i’m not as emotionally prepared as i thought i’d be. i’m able to put on a smile at work, but the second i’m alone, the tears start falling again. it feels like i’m preparing for my dad to slowly disappear, and i’m already grieving it. it feels like the sadness and grief will never stop because i know he will never get better and there’s nothing i can do to stop it.i got married last year, and my husband and i wanted to wait a little while to start having kids, but now i want them as soon as possible so that my dad can meet his grandkids while he’s still aware. fuck, i’m just really really sad."," brain health decline sucks, and denial is often the easier path. 10 years ago my mom was repeating and forgetting things. even got lost in a familiar area. we didn’t give up hope and i want to share our path in hopes it helps your dad. my mom 9 years ago started every day reading out loud, doing hand writing, and simple math quickly. within a month her symptoms went away… and 9 years later her brain health seems stable. i would encourage you to see if this approach may be helpful for your family  it’s free and has no downside. good luck! keep hope!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ov51r1/dad_was_diagnosed_two_days_ago_im_having_a_hard/,Dad was diagnosed two days ago.

"so earlier this month mom was “diagnosed” with dementia the hospital assured me they wouldn’t send her home or release her without having a placement.  well they went back on that stating “those assurances never should have been made”. putting us back at square one.  the only difference is she’s not being allowed back to the house per the way the family feels because we were told she admitted to being manipulative about her behaviors. she clearly needs placement which medicaid will pay for because of her mental health care waver. what’s causing the stress is knowing she’s early crazy and not being able to get her the help she needs. this being a locked down facility. i wish it was legal for the hospital to just drug her up and put her in a padded room because of the constant “suicide attempts”.  she’s always been emotionally abusive but no one ever stepped up and helped. she constantly threatened to kill herself in front of my siblings and i. one time she held a knife to her chest and threatened to stab herself in front of us.  she’d threaten to rear end a tanker truck at full speed, or drive off the side of a mountain. a couple times she sped towards a building at full speed then would slam on the brakes. i often wish someone would have called cps. i just know this is going to cause me to have a heart attack. i think i had one earlier this year when my heart rate spiked to 240 bpm. i also have stated to faint.  i’m also angry as fuck at her because i have very serious health issues of my own. i have tumors in my spine, neck, pelvis, brain and last year they spread to my eyes, from the research i have done the tumors will spread to the lungs and liver next.  the awesome news is i have a doctor that’s willing to put me in a clinical trial as an emergency use case my so called mother knows and is well aware of how sick i am.  the tumors have been in a state of constant state of growth since 2017 when we tried radiation. i’m going to end up in the hospital if something doesn’t change", how are you doing? i hope you're ok.  i'm really sorry about your tumors. i have non cancerous tumors on my spine and if you wanna talk i would love to.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ov0cgt/i_can_literally_feel_the_stress_on_my_heart_this/,I can literally feel the stress on my heart.

"i'll preface this by saying i know that only a professional can assess and diagnose her, but there's a waiting list for any assessment and i'd just like some advice before the, please.    a little background, first. my gran is 91 next month. in her life she's lost her husband, one of her two children when he was in his 20s, three years ago her other child, (my mother), and just over a month ago, one of her grandkids - my brother. i'm now the only family she has left, and i moved halfway across the country last year. she's been through a lot, in the last few years especially. about a month ago, just after my brother's funeral, she had a fall at home. her neighbour has a key and checks in on her, and she's the one that found her. by the sounds of it, she was on the ground alone for nearly 24 hours. an ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital. a few days after being admitted, she fell out of bed in the hospital and hit her head on the hard floor.    since then, she seems to have been in and out of confusion. she doesn't eat or drink a huge amount, but she seems to be aware of where she is. she recognises people that visit her. but she does have moments of confusion. the other day she asked me if i'd spoken to my mum, her daughter, despite her passing away three years ago. she's adamant i was there when she was admitted to the hospital, when i wasn't - and again, she thought i was in the room when i was on the phone to her. she also said my brother visited her the other day, which he didn't as he also passed away recently. yet since saying this, she's spoken to the nurses and even said that both my mum and brother have died, so she must be aware at least some of the time.    the nurse told me that she was struggling to remember how many great grandchildren she has, and she's convinced she has at least three - she has none, and never has done. she also believes that at the weekend she went to a town about 45 minutes away to visit a cousin, but they were at work so had to come home. obviously this didn't happen, and as far as i'm aware she's never had a cousin in that town - or if she's ever even been there herself.    it's all come on quite suddenly since the falls - does this sound like it could be the onset of dementia or something else? either the falls or the mental weight of everything that's happened in the last few years, etc.? she has seemed quite unusual since my brother passed, and she's the most stubborn and independent person in the world, so being stuck in a hospital won't be doing her any favours.    thanks for any insight you could give while i'm waiting for a proper assessment!"," before my moms dementia got worse, whenever she would be hospitalized with either a urinary tract infection, heart issue or fallrelated, she would kind of hallucinate and dream on the hospital. sometimes it’s all the voices they hear around them like nurses, other patients, visitors and doctors and sometimes they are listening to the tv and dozing off and have a distorted sense of reality. my mom would always believe the voices she was hearing were mine or my wife’s. she was very confused especially when medicated. your grandmother may have pre-dementia but god bless her at age 91. my mom is only 76.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ou93ff/does_my_grandmother_have_early_signs_of_dementia/,Does my grandmother have early signs of dementia?

"my(29f/disabled) mom (56f) has ftd (frontotemporal dementia). for the longest time i’ve been her “person.” if she needed to do something i’d be more likely to get her to agree. over the past five years her decline has been steadily increasing. she’s still very much herself and may not remember exact dates when asked, but i’m still her person. i normally go to visit my partner in england for a couple of months at a time. she misses me but seems to be okay while i’m gone, and is always happier when i’m back. since the pandemic i haven’t been able to visit him. it’s been since 2019 that i wasn’t gone for more than a week or two at a time. recently i’ve been spending time in my childhood hometown. i have a social support community here. i can be a little more active in my life style here. for the longest time i’ve always said the two things keeping me at home are my mom and the dread of finding new doctors. now i’m at a point where i’m ready to switch and move back to my hometown. this unfortunately leaves me stuck on the position of my mom. i love her and know that her mental health would only rapidly decline if i permanently moved. my dad is at work or drinking (he doesn’t watch her like she needs, he “hangs out” meaning she will not eat or drink if he’s not home or too drunk to go get her food.) before the pandemic we were having an in home aid come once a week. she needs more than once a week, and it is very expensive and not covered by insurance. another reason why living at home benefits not only her but my fathers wallet. i have kind of tasked myself as being her protector and caretaker. which i have no regrets about, i love her and only wish i could be of more use to her. i can’t get her to do basic self care, she won’t take her meds for me. because of my physical disabilities and mental health i can’t often spend the time with her she deserves. i’m really only around to get lunch with her or run her to a store here and there. make sure she eats something. i also have trouble setting boundaries. i know this move would be great for my mental health. but i feel so guilty for leaving my mom in my dads care. tl;dr: do i move and work on growing myself and my happiness or do i leave my mom in my inattentive dad’s care, and miss out on what little time we may have left at a cost to my mental health and happiness?"," i think you should move as it sounds like it will be an investment in your future and will be good for you. any decent, loving parent would want that for their child. your dad will have to step up without you and do his duty as a husband. if you feel able and willing you can still offer support from afar and help out verbally with any practical or emotional advice they might need without needing to be there physically.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ots0gx/need_advice_about_a_life_choice/,Need advice about a life choice..

"my grandfather has dementia and me and my grandmother take care of him. last march i came to live with them since my school went virtual due to the pandemic. since i've been here i have been looking after him while my grandmother goes to work. at the end of august i will be starting nursing school so there won't be anyone here with him. so, we are looking for an in-home caregiver to take care of him while i'm at school and my grandmother is at work. however, it will cost $20/hr for the 3 days a week we need her, which works out to be around $2,100 a month. my grandfather's social security money is $2,000/month and, my grandmother has been using some of it to pay for the water and electricity bills.  my grandmother has a better idea of her financial situation, but she has expressed to me multiple times that that is expensive for her. so, we have been brainstorming things to let go of (e.g., cable boxes that aren't used often, subscriptions, gym membership, etc.). my grandfather does not qualify for medicaid because of my grandmother's income. and even if my grandmother were to divorce him so that he would qualify for medicaid from my understanding, she would still be expected to pay money towards him. i feel like there should be some other option available so that my grandmother can feel financially secure in paying for his care. she already pays my mom's rent while my mom is working on her dissertation, which is $2,300/month (hopefully this will be the last year that she will be paying for it). and my grandmother doesn't want to just cut my mom loose, but that money really could make a big difference. on top of that, my grandfather didn't save any money before his dementia and, if he had, that could've helped pay the remainder of the money we need for his care. my grandmother also is still paying off the house mortgage. part of the reason my grandmother still works is because of my mom's rent. and my grandmother has expressed other things that she'd like to do with her money that are solely for herself, which she definitely deserves since she really is the head honcho of the family. she is the one who has helped finance things for her children, her grandchildren, her schizophrenic brother, and now her husband. so, i am eager to know of any avenues that we can take so that the home care costs aren't as expensive. thank you.", you can also check into adult daycares in your area for the days when your grandmom has to work.  they may be less expensive than paying for private care.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/otgvv5/does_anyone_know_who_to_contact_for_help_with/,Does anyone know who to contact for help with paying for in home care?

"i post here around 2 months ago asking people how to cope with a loved one who has dementia. i just want to thank everyone who took their time out to comment on it, it really warmed my heart that it seemed like so many people cared, and could relate to my situation. it made me feel less alone which was really comforting. my grandfather who was diagnosed with dementia for a year now passed away three days ago. two days before his death we all had to say our goodbyes due to him waking up with blood in his mouth, and the nurse giving him 2 weeks if he was lucky. everyone took turns saying their goodbyes; holding his hands, kissing his forehead, etc. he never knew who i was for the week that we stayed there. as i got to his bedside and reached for his hand, and looked at him he withdrew his hand, and said something mean (i couldn't exactly hear what he said since he was deaf, but his tone was all i needed to hear.), he then leaned a little bit away from me. once i realized that he didn't know who i was, and he didn't want me near him i broke down in tears and ran out of their assisted living home. i don't know what to feel, but i blame myself. i could have still said goodbye, but i retreated instead. he had no idea who i was, he didn't remember me..."," don’t blame yourself. it was no longer him. your intentions were not ill spirited. if there is something beyond this life, he will understand the situation. all the times you did say good bye will out number this one. my grandmother often says mean and untrue things about me and my father. it is really hard to remember that it is not really her in those moments. i often leave post it notes for my family (little “have a great day, i love you”, etc. notes). i have a post it note that my grandmother left me that says “i will always love you with every beat of my heart”. whenever the dementia says something horrid about me, i look at that post it to remind me of the grandmother i love. find your own post it note, moment/memory, story, etc. for when you feel that guilt popping in to your mind.it’s also totally normal to mourn that you didn’t get the chance to really say goodbye. it’s something this disease often robs the living of. we spend so much of this disease thinking and working around the mechanics of the goodbye that when it does eventually come, it’s rarely even the loved one we knew anymore. my condolences to you and your family. i hope you find peace and comfort in the memories of the love you shared together.eta: like your grandmother (i went back to read your other post) my grandmother also loops in her conversations. it can be so tedious to attempt to have a conversation with her. i feel guilty for how often i’m like “do we have to include oma?” in our family evenings on the deck. i feel better after trying to talk to her though. i have to remind myself of that feeling of “at least i tried” when i’m feeling anxious about talking to her. it’s not always a good conversation, but it’s often something comforting in her day that makes this end a little more bearable for her - even if i have to hear about the men building condos in the trees for 1000th time (in narrator’s voice- they weren’t building condos in the trees). in the long run, we will be glad we tried to have conversations with them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/or3ka8/i_am_guilty_i_didnt_get_to_say_goodbye/,I am guilty I didn't get to say goodbye...
"first time poster here. i’m one of four children and we’re all adults. i’m in my 20s. my mom has always been our rock. when i was little i remember thinking of her as being strong and fearless; whatever goal she had she’d always accomplish it through hard work. now she’s 57, turning 58 this year, and she’s been exhibiting some behaviors for the last few months that have made me very concerned. to begin with, she’s become very forgetful. like, super forgetful. i’ll tell her something (a story, some instructions) only for her to ask me about it again (and again). here’s a recent moment that sticks out to me. when we first moved to our current apartment in april, i showed her how to adjust the thermostat (and how to put it on permanent hold). she picked it up and that was the end of that. however, a few weeks ago when i was in ny she randomly called me one night asking for help on fixing it. i was super confused and i even pointed out that i had previously taught her before, and the process was the same. needless to say that it took me about 30 minutes to reteach her the process through the video chat, something that she had previously picked up quickly the first time around.another behavior i’ve noticed is that she’ll sometimes change up what whatever she originally said to me. at first i thought that maybe i’m the one who kept mishearing things, but my sister has also pointed out in the past that she has a tendency of completely changing up her words… and therefore creates arguments where we’re pointing out what she originally said. at first i thought she was doing it on purpose to get out of things, but it looks like she actually believes her own story. my mom used to be a great driver. everyone would always tell her that. while of course your skills are bound to change as you get older, she has rapidly declined to the point where i feel very unsafe being a passenger in her car and would rather take an uber somewhere before asking her for a ride. not to mention that she seems increasingly paranoid about driving, and have seen her driving extremely slow in streets where you’re supposed to be going 60+ mph. i’ve tried to address this, but she attributes her now bad driving skills to having diabetes.while her memory has had me very concerned, it’s her ability to understand things that have made me realize she needs to be tested in order to be safe. it’s like trying to get a 10 year old to comprehend what you’re telling them without making them feel dumb. she’s also become exceedingly sensitive, and the smallest disagreement/argument makes her tear up/cry or get very upset. she didn’t used to be like this, at all. i’ve also gotten into big arguments because she’s become financially irresponsible. call me an asshole and selfish, but she fails to understand that she shouldn’t be giving money away to other, non-struggling, family members (including my two oldest siblings who are in their mid/late 30s, who work and have their own partners) when we are not financially stable ourselves. then she’s complaining about not having any money. i work, she doesn’t but she receives benefits. i’m literally the only one that provides for her and it frustrates me to no end when i’m working my ass off to make ends meet while she gives her money away a-la-mr. beast style. i don’t know how else to tell her that this is wrong and that people are only taking advantage of her.this morning she swore that she gave me a bag to put some things away, but the reality is that she never gave me any bag and the one she had she used for something else. i damn near lost it, and told her that she never gave me anything. it’s come to the point where i’ll even question myself sometimes, but i know for a fact that she didn’t give me any bag at all.i told my sister who is currently visiting to help me convince her to take a test just to make sure she’s okay, but like my other siblings she’s just as selfish who do nothing to care for my mom and minimized my concerns/made me seem like a bad person for even bringing the idea up. whether it’s a result of her taking diabetic medication that messes with her memory, like of vitamins, or something that’s more serious, i know something’s off and need her to get tested. for her sake, and for mine too. i apologize if this post is all over the place, but if anyone has any tips on how to convince her to get tested please let me know. i love my mom and i’m very worried about her. i want my old mom back."," you'll need to think hard to find something that can get sufficient agreement from your mum to go to a neurologist or psychiatrist for testing. just enough agreement to get her to physically be there, some emotional reluctance like her being cranky is fine.i hesitate to ask you to tell a white lie or use some level of trickery, because i don't know how forgetful your mum is. if she is really forgetful to the point where she won't remember having been to the doctor at all, then i think some kind of ""creative lie"" might help you in getting her agreement.and i know it will probably feel really terrible to lie to  your mum, but if she does indeed have alzeheimers and memory loss, then you'll have to consider telling lies when dealing with her in the future anyways.as for your siblings, you'll really need to let them know how important an early diagnosis is. it will allow for her condition (if she really has dementia) to deteoriate slower with early medication. there's also the financial and legal side of things. early intervention means your siblings and you can sort out lpa / will matters, and future care plans for your mum if the diagnosis is positive. lastly, an early diagnosis means your siblings and you can set aside more time to spend with your mum now, before it is too late. let your siblings know that this is an urgent matter.having to take care of 2 dementia parents myself, i really hope everything works in your favour. all the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/or00fp/i_dont_know_how_to_convince_my_mom_to_get_tested/,I don’t know how to convince my mom to get tested.
"first off it was figuring out why my 91 year old mum had the scissors cutting up one of her hand towels into circles.

"for the past year we suspect my grandma has dementia. hallucinations, confusion, etc. pretty much all the signs. the problem is, we cannot get her to the doctor's for an appointment. not only does her healthcare provider basically dismiss my mom and aunt when they attempt to get her help, my grandma probably wouldn't even get in the car to go to an appointment to get an actual diagnosis and perhaps get some kind of medication that might help. i really don't know what there is to do. i wish my mom and aunt would advocate for my grandma more, demand that she be seen, demand that they take them seriously. but they are both tired and just do the best they can to take care of my grandma.the thing is, her memory is sharp, she still knows lots of things. but what she is confused about is she thinks it's two months ahead than it actually is. her birthday is in september, and she thought that everyone forgot her birthday recently. stuff like that. it's really hard. she hallucinates that there is fish in her water, she thinks everything is poisoned, she thinks that there are people up in the attic who want to harm her. it's so hard to be around her when she is like this and i just don't know what to do anymore. i should also mention that she doesn't speak english very well; i do not speak an ounce of chinese so sometimes she goes off and starts yelling and i have no idea what she is saying and i can't help her. when she has an episode she can't speak english at all. another issue is we can't get her covid vaccination. she won't go in the car. i don't even think she would allow someone to come to the house to give it to her. i have tried asking her several times if she should get it for me, but she claims that her doctor told her that she doesn't need it. my boyfriend works with a lot of people in close quarters and i live with him, so i pretty much cannot help my aunt or mom as much with ""babysitting"" her but i would like to be able to give my mom and aunt a break, but i am so scared to get her sick, even though i'm vaccinated and wear a mask around her. i just wish there was a way i could get her to agree to get vaccinated; i would be able to help out more often and for longer periods of time if she were. &amp;#x200b;i know my situation may not be that different than many other people's and i realize that she may not be as bad off as some other people's loved ones here. i don't really know what i'm posting for. advice? words of encouragement? venting? maybe all of the above. &amp;#x200b;anyway, i've just been very sad and stressed out about all of this lately and it just weighs so heavily on my mind. i decided it was finally time to write some of my feelings out and hopefully talk to others who may be in the same boat. if you've read all of this, thank you for taking the time."," a last resort is adult protective services. it would probably scare the hell out of your grandma, though. but you do what you have to in order to get the required care. as far as memory goes, long term memory is the last to go as the condition progresses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oqix7s/having_a_hard_time_with_grandma/,Having a hard time with grandma :(

"apologies in advance for the jumble of backstory info and my venting. i have so much to say and am simultaneously having a hard time putting this all into words.my (22f) grandfather (84 next month) is living by himself, and showing a consistent decrease in his ability to care for himself. in all honesty, he really is probably at the point where he shouldn't be living alone. he can't remember how to use the microwave he's used the past 7 years, nor sometimes his tv, his checkbook was nearly $1,000 off before my aunt took over his finances (more on this below).thankfully my grandfather lives 2 minutes from me, 5 minutes from my aunt and 10 minutes from my uncle whom only keeps in touch with my grandfather. he has people close to him who are there to check on him consistently. this is the first time anyone in my family has been in the position of caring for a dementia patient, and in all honesty i feel like nobody has any idea what they're really doing. when my aunt took over his finances, she tried to upend his very particular routine, cancel credit cards, etc. because she deemed it unnecessary and told him as such. his finances were always a huge deal to him, i understand that it’s no longer imperative that his credit score is consistently perfect, but he is still having a horribly difficult time relinquishing this responsibility to her. her attitude and being irritated with him asking constantly if his bills are paid bothers me, because she just can’t realize that he doesn’t want to accept that he can no longer care for himself. i feel crappy for even thinking this, but my mom &amp; aunt’s callousness to this situation makes me feel like they just can’t wait to ship him off to a home with having done no research, for him to die there alone and rarely visited by most of the family. my mom and my aunt have decided they're going to ""sit down and figure out what we're going to do with him"", and this makes me nervous. they both seem to have very little patience and understanding of the fact that his moodiness and irritation is a symptom of his cognitive decline. he was easily one of the most intelligent people i've known, his biggest fear *ever* was developing this disease- i know he's terrified. regarding this discussion on his future care, i was not invited in on this, nor was my older sister, even though we are the two who visit with him the most, do his laundry, help with his grocery orders etc. my grandfather was more of a father figure to me than any other person in my life, so i’m quite honestly pissed. i’ve decided that i would do as much research on symptoms/what to expect as well as potential in-home nurses or assisted living facilities to the best of my abilities and basically force myself into the decision making. i don’t want their lack of desire to care for him to overrule his happiness, comfort and dignity. at this point though, i’m not even sure where to start, most times it feels like i need answers and advice to questions i don’t even have yet. it’s hard because he is still essentially “all there” in regards to his ability to communicate, have opinions, interests, reading etc.  to those of you who have family members in the same boat, where did you begin your search for care? what do you think are the most important things to ask a potential care provider? more importantly though, what can we do to make sure this is as easy for him as we can make it? what should i begin to expect? i know no two people are alike, but i feel like i’m grabbing at straws trying to wrap my mind around how fast everything is probably going to happen. am i being too “nice” about this, making excuses for his behalf or babying him? thanks to everyone who got through this wall of text. i have nobody to vent to who has any kind of experience or knowledge with the situation, i’d greatly appreciate any insight you may have."," i'm in a similar situation, being the financially responsible party and having done the most legwork relative to my grandmother's care while dealing with family members who want to have input.this is probably going to be hard to hear, but i think you're going to have to accept that you don't have a legal right to make decisions on your grandfather's behalf. if i were in your position, i would try to empathize with what your mother and aunt are going through - navigating a scary thing that they don't fully understand that's happening to their father - and try to support them by sharing what you've learned and encouraging decisions that you think are right. if you truly believe that they are not doing what's right for him, you could try to have him assign you as his poa but this would almost certainly cause significant damage to your relationships with your mother and aunt and may not be legally valid if they were to challenge it considering his current mental state.there are a lot of articles online about what to ask a assisted living or nursing home and what is/isn't important in your selection. i found that helpful, but even still i ran into numerous surprises along the way. i made decisions that i thought were right at the time only to find out that i didn't have a full understanding of the disease, insurance coverage, medicaid rules, etc. and i may have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of my own money for her care that i shouldn't have.now being on the last leg of guardianship of a loved one with dementia, i would recommend you start with an attorney who specializes not just in elder law but in estate and medicaid planning. a consultation shouldn't cost much at all and should help you with your planning. you are not an expert and you will not become one on the internet. i made bad decisions because i didn't understand the extraordinary complexities of the costs, regulations around, and intricacies of dementia care. find someone who does that's trustworthy and pay them for their help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oq4meg/i_need_advice_whats_next_how_can_i_help/,"I need advice, what's next?

"they say my mom has dementia but it just doesn’t seem normal for what i know/knew of it. she started having issues finding her way to her house (that she lived for 40+ years) and would then spend 3-4 hours in a grocery store that would take her an hour before. she stopped wanting to cook or do things like send out christmas cards, or other habbits she had. she stopped wanting to be alone, so she would go along with my dad wherever he went.  there was definitely things going on. in 2019 at christmas time she seemed to enjoy it with little issues. her other son she never gets to see was visiting for the holidays. after he left, my mom went from functional to non-functional in the span of 10 days. as in, driving, dressing herself, acting relatively normal, to standing naked in the doorway arguing about how she was cold and needed to get dressed, but saying there wasn't enough time to get dressed, and getting stuck in a logical loop. this happened for about 3 hours the first few days when we didnt know what to do. seroquel is the magic drug that helped her get back to her new normal. it allowed her to function to be able to dress herself (for the most part) and join us in normal life again. but she doesn't act the same. she acts like a 5-6 year old. my dad has a job he can take her with him, so he does. when he doesn’t i take her with me. she can be by herself for 5-10 minutes tops, but she’ll forget she or gets too wired to stay still and starts wandering off to find where me or my dad are at. rather she’s at home, in the workshop, or in a car parked in a parking lot. she remembers about 4 people, and has forgotten other people she should know very well (did things together, etc.). at least once a week, she will ask my dad or me who we are (if one of us runs to the store and she hasn’t seen us for an hour or something). she will frequently ask whose house her’s is, or mine when she’s driving by. or where the bathroom is where she’s always gone. maybe she’ll ask how she ties her shoes, or how she gets a glass and fills it with water to drink. or how does she put her clothes on. she always wants help. but if you “force” her she can do it, albeit with a lot of questions along the way.the thing is, she seems to know most of the answers, but it’s like she’s anxious she’s going to do it wrong or she has the wrong answer she needs constant confirmation. if you drive for 3 minutes to the store, she’ll ask you 20 times where we’re going and what we’re doing, though if you press her she can tell you the answer. she needs constant verification for every action she takes in life. a neuropsychologist has given her two annual tests that are standard in their industry and said she has dementia and has demonstrated reduced mental abilities. her pcp chalked it up to dementia too, so that's what we call it. it's just so strange. she has a history of heavy depression. she's always felt lost her whole life and like she wasn't accomplishing anything. she's had few people she could make meaningful connections with, and the last people she did died off in the last few years. her father died when she was young and she's commented it on frequently throughout her life, so i believe it's really changed how she sees the world. it’s like she was having dementia-like symptoms, and then she just had a mental break. it’s like having a 5-6 year old you have to watch. she needs constant verification for everything, and its hard to determine how much she can do herself. she can’t be left alone. she doesn’t ask like herself or matronly anymore. i always thought dementia would be you acting normal, with memory, anxiety, increased symptoms until the end. that’s not how this has preceded. she’s just this new person now, with no real build up or change, it just happened one day. i don't know, i'm just looking for some guidance or answers if this stuff is normal, because it seems so odd."," my husband exhibited something similar. he went from going to work as an engineer to not even being able to remember words and carry on a conversation.he looked like a zombie. it started with some gi issues that he became fixated with insisting he needed a colonoscopy. like that day. hadn't been to a dr. in 20 years. total insanity with this fixation. just had to have a gi and only a colonoscopy would fix his problems. then he refused to go anywhere in case he had to use restroom. when i started scheduling dr visits, he obsessed with timing them around his perceived bathroom breaks. first dr. was a gi, who took one look at my husband and ordered an immediate head ct. looked at me like ""how could you let this happen""? i explained that onset was literally days between stomach issues to progressive mental decline. no stroke, nothing abnormal on ct. he did eventually had colonoscopy which was normal and only diverticulosis found. very odd that stomach happened first then mental went downhill over 2 weeks. he says now he remembers almost nothing for first 2 months. have since had eeg's, mri which revealed diminished frontal cortex activity, but neuro said even rapid onset wouldn't have occurred this fast. husband couldn't even reply to work emails. also experienced severe low blood pressure that was random.(this is no longer an issue) have read either head could affect pressure, or pressure could affect head. no definitive answers ever.  now 1 1/2 yrs later, he's far better than at first, but not 100%. thank god the obsessions have stopped, but cognition is still suffering. i've given him b complex, prevagen, upped fruits and vegs, so who knows? oddly, brain fog and sun downing (although it occurred in a.m. instead of at night) has majorly decreased, and he says he feels better outside. i wonder about mold exposure, but most dr.s have no idea how to test. i'm not in denial, but like you, we went from 0 to 100 in weeks (then back to maybe 30,40). even confirmed with his employer that no signs of impairment were indicated prior to the ""meltdown"". i even went so far as to obtain good hearing aids, as this can have an effect on the brain. something systemic happened, i just don't  know what's controlling what and i can't find a dr. that will treat this as a whole instead of parting out to individual specialists. very frustrating .",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oq0lku/can_dementia_come_in_10_days/,Can dementia come in 10 days?

"the fact that you have to wait until the patient is literally unable to sit upright in a chair on their own, and can’t speak more than six words a day is absurd. quality of life has long since evaporated by then. obligating them to hold out til the bitter end is horrible and expensive for everyone involved. i know she wouldn’t want this, she wouldn’t want this to end with her being upset all the time and family resenting each other.the patient (or their poa) should be allowed to choose some ability or experience that is important to them, that makes their life worth living, and that once it is gone they should be allowed to start hospice. for example, the ability to recognize their children, the ability to put their own shoes on, the ability to make themselves a simple meal, to follow a tv show. or the ability to just sit in their own home without distressed thinking they are somewhere else instead of the same house they lived in for decades. what kind of life is that??????", that's weird. my mom was put on hospice when she was able to sit in a wheelchair for hours at a time and spoke full sentences sometimes again for hours at a time.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/opr5wh/i_wish_medicare_would_let_you_predetermine_your/,I wish Medicare would let you pre-determine your own benchmark for when you want to start hospice.

"my grandmother (82 years old) went to her neurosurgeon the other day and he explained that her benign brain tumor was pressing down on the brain stem which controls breathing, circulation, swallowing, etc. and that it was causing fluid buildup in the skull cavity (hydrocephalus.) he said we had three options. one: we do nothing and she eventually gets so drowsy that she doesn’t wake up. two: she gets a shunt put in to drain the fluid but that only prolongs the inevitable. it will help her headaches but she has been saying that she’s not having headaches at the moment. three: she has the tumor removed but that is a major surgery. hospice came to the assisted living facility and said that my grandmother seems to be declining. i’m wondering if they have to say that? do they just say that in order to get patients on hospice because that’s how they make their money? my grandmother’s blood work has been fine and normal. but the surgeon said that she’d need to go through tests before either the shunt surgery where they put a tube from her head to her stomach; and tests before the tumor removal. for the removal, they’d need to do an angiogram to make sure that the tumor isn’t vascular because while it appears to be a benign meningioma it is behaving uncharacteristically. i guess what i’m really asking is this: do we try the surgeries since she’s most likely going to die anyway if we do nothing? or do we just let hospice come in? i’ve heard that some people turn around after ativan and morphine in hospice care. i want her to stay here for a long time but i also don’t want her to suffer. sometimes she says she wants the surgeries and sometimes she says that she doesn’t.thank you in advance!"," this is very hard, and i don't know if there is a right answer.i have approached similar situations with trying to priotize quality of life, not longevity.  so, from your grandmother's doctors, i would ask what option means for your grandmother's comfort and quality of life.my sense is...that's probably not surgery, but perhaps i'm wrong and she is in quite a bit of pain. so, ask what the recovery would be like, and what living with the tumor would be like.perhaps the shunt can lessen her discomfort, and not only give her more time but good time. more time being present and comfortable, before eventually subcumbing.  or maybe it too would be an uncomfortable recovery.  maybe doing nothing and utilizing pallative care is the right answer.i really can't say, but that would be my guiding light.  what will give her the best time, however much is left.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ophnfg/hospice_or_surgery/,Hospice or surgery?

"my grandmother (78) has always been known for being a bit scatterbrained and making silly remarks, and we’ve always joked about it. last year, my aunt said she was more concerned about my grandmothers memory and that she was becoming more forgetful. we brushed it off as her just having a moment and the fact she is a little bit older, and that was fine. she’s perfectly lucid and has a quick, sharp wit. i saw her today and now i’m concerned- she was trying to tell a story about a family member and it took 4 or 5 attempts for her to get the story right, and that was with me asking her to clarify who she was talking about as she was getting names confused and my grandfather also intervened to correct her at one point. on the flip side, she remembered nearly every detail of something insignificant that happened 25 years ago (passing my parents car on a road in a tourist destination). she also has moments of forgetfulness in regard to her short term memory- you may speak to her and tell her you’re doing something and she’ll completely forget until you remind her and will be like “oh yeah”, and she often confuses details about stories. this is the first time where i am wondering if there is something more than just age-related confusion. can anyone give me advice on next steps or how i should approach this? i’m going to speak to my mother about it of course, but not sure what else i could do. there’s no other dementia in the family, apart from an aunt who is 105, so i don’t have much experience with this…."," your grandma is old enough to see a geriatrician as well.  this person will give her the same memory test that the neurologist will.  based on her score they will place her in a category of dementia - mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, moderate, or severe.  the neurologist, however, can order an mri.  this will enable he/she to identify the portion of the brain that is affected.  while that should provide more specific information for you in our case i found that it didn't.  the segment of the brain that showed atrophy and the related functions it affects just didn't correlate.  that said, i think it's good to have a baseline.  we have found that her geriatrician is a better source for her over all well being.  she focuses on socialization, exercise and nutrition, all important to those with dementia.  the neurologist asked me if i was looking for a cure.  i said, ""no, i'd just like to understand exactly what is happening in her brain.  it will provide us with a baseline and will help us prepare for her future.""  he just wasn't much help in the well-being side of care.  i also found that there are local sources for education through the local alzheimer's association.  it was good to attend a few of these to understand how to care for mom and how to respond appropriately when she repeats herself or gets lost in her stories.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oof0do/possible_dementia_symptoms_what_next/,Possible dementia symptoms- what next?
"my 73 year old dad had a breakdown last year as a result of my country's covid lockdown.he spent 9 months as a psychiatric inpatient being treated for severe depression and anxiety.he's been home with my mum now for a few months but had just been flat and send dulled. he's on a lot of pills.he's also getting ect treatment every two weeks, and came out of the last treatment extremely confused and slurring his words for two days.his speech is improved since then, but today something really scary happened.my wife and i are having a baby, she's 10 weeks.we told my parents last week.today while i was visiting, he asked me what it feels like to hold my baby.i had to ask him to repeat, but it seems like he thought my child was already born.i feel like i'm losing or may already have lost my dad"," i would talk to his doctors about it, if he's having ect and is on a lot of medication then that could cause confusion, it's not necessarily dementia. maybe if you talk to his doctors they will be able to look at the treatment he's on and see if they can tweak it or reduce it to see if the symptoms reduce. i know from personal experience that being on a lot of psychiatric meds can completely mess with your memory and thinking capabilities, so it's worth ruling that out, and if it's not that then the doctors will already be aware so they can do some more tests to figure out what's going on. also, congratulations on the pregnancy!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ooeke7/my_dad_might_have_dementia/,My dad might have dementia
"she kept asking me to take her home or drive her to her dead uncle's house and unlock the padlock even though she's not safe on her own and gets lost. the caretaker we have while we go into assisted living was complaining about how hard it is for her as if we're not paying her to care for this woman and left hours early. the loved one was banging on my door, accusing me of lying to her, saying i enjoy her suffering, etc so i blew up on her in rage and locked my door after slamming it shut. i feel bad and know i did basically everything wrong you could do with an agitated dementia patient but it's just so frustrating being treated like shit for wanting to keep someone safe and having this responsibility thrown onto me for someone i don't even like with no guidance"," don't be too hard on yourself. we all get those moments. i blew up tonight at my 91 year old mother. after hours of her running around the house wondering where her boyfriend was, opening the front door twice to show her that her non existent boyfriend wasn't there. she was still on the hunt, accusing me of frightening him away. nerves definitely get frayed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oo8ao3/i_flipped_out_on_a_loved_one_with_dementia_and/,I flipped out on a loved one with dementia and feel like shit now

"my dad (78 y.o.) doesn't have a diagnosis yet. his most severe symptom is urinary and fecal incontinence. my mom came home from running errands the other day to find poop on the floor. he is having increasing accidents for both #1 and #2. at first my mom tried to brush it off as normal aging but pooping on the floor is not normal. he also has problems walking. he has fallen a few times over the past 4 years. when he falls he cannot back up without a lot of assistance. his memory is ok but he sleeps a lot during the day (takes a long nap every afternoon) and i would say his mood/affect is increasingly flat. he gets overwhelmed in social situations, starts to shut down, and just sort of stares off into space. he also suffers from restless leg syndrome, but he's always had that. his personality is mostly the same as it's always been, maybe some small changes in what he watches on tv. he saw a neurologist 2 or 3 years ago after a big fall, but nothing came of it so currently he is only in the care of a primary care doc. his next appt is not until mid-august. i want him to be evaluated asap to the fullest extent. what do i need to do to make that happen? i am 5 hours away by car but my mom is there with him.", can your mom get him into adult diapers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/onrnk4/where_to_begin_for_parent_with_suspected_dementia/,Where to begin for parent with suspected dementia?
"hello. my father (77) has severe dementia. all the books my mother and i have read said to start planning for his future resting place. i know it is a morbid thought but i went to forest lawn cemetery and checked on the prices. forest lawn is a little pricey, but i thought it was beautiful and probably the best i could find that was green like ireland in southern california near me. my grandma is buried there and my mother wants to be there with her, so i thought it would be best to have my family together there. my mom and i had planned to get two spots for my mom and dad and do the payment plans.  my dad always would say ""i'm not old. i'm not going to die"" or ""bury me in the backyard"" when mom would ask him or try to get him to decide with her. right now my mom's only income is his social security and she is his caregiver so she couldn't afford to pay for it all at once if at all...i tried to tell my half brother about it, but he and his wife got mad at me for wanting to bury dad ""next to michael jackson-- the most expensive cemetery in california!"" i honestly never expected them to help pay for it. i know he has kids so i just didn't think he would chip in. he said we should cremate dad because it's cheap, but dad said everyone in his family has been buried and ""they don't believe in cremation."" i checked online and it says few people are cremated in ireland... my brother said it wasn't my and mom's decision to make and that it should be his and my half-sister and mine. i thought the spouse has the first say? my half-siblings have barely come around in 30 years. i don't think he wants to be cremated like they believe. i got yelled at by both half-siblings to focus on getting him in a nursing home instead of ""treating him like he is already dead."" but memory care is just not feasible right now. he won't go and we don't have the money. they cost 5000-8000$ a month in this area. i was trying to plan for the hard future that will be very painful and financially draining to pay for all at once...but all i got was criticism and people mad at me..."," i wonder how we all got to a point where death because so foreign.  it's not morbid and we all will suffer this same fate.my mom, never planned for this time - she lived as if she would live forever - but i know different.  my family does not believe in cremation either, everyone i know that has passed away in the family has been buried, i wonder why is that - it would be interesting to find out.however, i had a conversation with a number of pastor's at a meeting i attended that astounded me.  i asked them all the same question and i put it like this.""is there something special in the religious world that compels families to bury bodies versus cremate""?  (now these were all ""baptist, methodist and episcopal ministers) and to my surprise it was an astounding 100% no.  there was nothing in the bible or religious history that precluded cremation as a rite of passage.  in fact some societies recognized this for years as they burned the remains of loved ones.one even told me that the ""body is only bone and tissue, structure for the spirit; and that once expired, the spirit moves on therefore the remaining structure has no spiritual value - it's only value is in the people still living.i said all this because i too was thinking of taking my mom's body and placing it in a cemetery, at my expense, but realistically, my mom would not want anyone of her kids to bear this burden.  her spirit is what lives on, not her body.  and my mom being really religious i wanted to get confirmation i was on the right track.  i think she would be proud.you do what you think is best, but your dad can live on in spirit for your family!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/onrfm0/when_to_prepare_for_future_resting_place/,When to prepare for Future resting place?
"i don’t live with my dad. he lives by himself. he’s got moderate dementia although some days it’s worse depending on whether he has a uti. he gets help with medications and meals morning and evenings. the personal support workers also charge his gps, which is attached to his keychain. i can see where he is at all times.3-4 days of the week, he spends most of the day with nearby friends. 2-3 days of the week, i’m with him. i do the cleaning, groceries, personal care, and medical appointments (lately there have been a lot). there is a camera in his place, i check it probably hourly. i also speak to him maybe 5-10 times a day depending on whether he’s with friends or not. he does spend the odd day alone, usually in the park near his place. i call and remind him to drink and eat. i live 30 mins away by car, just over an hour on transit. usually i’m on transit, sometimes take an uber.we don’t want to move him because he’s still familiar with his close surroundings, and we can’t afford a place big enough for my partner (boyfriend of four years) and my dad and i (we live in an obscenely high col city). the plan is for us to move within 10 mins away asap. bit complicated as i have to sell my place to do it, but, doable… so really i’m a part time caregiver who’s also sort of “on call” at home.my boyfriend sometimes has empathy but sometimes gets sick of the “constant” dad talk and my “obsession” with him. complains to me about it at length. whines about never being really “free” the way the rest of my family are. (my mom divorced my dad and can’t stand him, my brothers are toxic, selfish a-holes - one is actually diagnosed with narcissistic traits, the other would meet criteria too, i believe - who refuse to help at all. i thank my stars daily my dad has friends who love him. otherwise i’d be screwed.) my boyfriend says things like “can’t we have one day without you being obsessed with your dad”. wtf buddy. no actually we can’t, dementia doesn’t have off days, and i have gotten off easy compared to many caregivers. i started this post right after him complaining to me. he just apologized but the resentment pops up every so often. i don’t think it’s going completely away. my boyfriend has bpd which doesn’t help. he’s even more demanding than my dad, in terms of time and attention. anyway. i find this extremely stressful. do some of you actually get support from your significant other?"," i’ve been in your boyfriend’s shoes. my lovely husband is an only child, his extended family isn’t close (geographically or emotionally) his father passed away, and several years later it became clear his mother wasn’t safe to live alone. at the time, we were in our twenties. she lived about half an hour away and initially was very resistant to any sort of hired help - much less the thought of moving. my husband was gone every weekend just making sure she was alive.it was hard. i was sympathetic but at times resented this woman i had no real connection to (her dementia is a resultof radiation treatment; she also had brain surgery that impacted her personality so i never really formed a relationship with her) demanding so much of my husband’s - and by extension my own - life. i wasn’t always graceful about it. we had some hard talks and ultimately i got in there and helped out more. even if she wasn’t my mother, i loved and was committed to him, and helping him with this burden was just part of the deal.thankfully, she’s now in assisted living nearby and we’re in a stable spot, at least for the time being. the crisis moments are passed us and we can have a life and marriage that isn’t predominantly around her needs.but, if your bf can’t come around, if he needs emotional labor from you, maybe this isn’t a good relationship for you to be in. it sounds like he has enough on his own plate he needs to deal with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/onq4aa/if_youre_taking_care_of_a_parent_how_does_your/,"If you’re taking care of a parent, how does your partner handle the demands?"

"a couple months ago, my 60 year-old father suddenly started experiencing short-term memory loss. he is relatively healthy, socially active, works in a cognitively engaging field, and has played live music in a few different bands almost every weekend since he was 16 years old.he first started to notice something was wrong a couple months ago when he would forget random notes/chords mid-song, sometimes on songs that he's been playing the same way for 5, 10, maybe 20 years. a few weeks later in mid-may, he brought to my mother's attention that, during a recent live performance, he looked down at one point and realized he had no recollection of changing into the clothes he was wearing before the show.since then, his condition seem to be getting slowly but progressively worse, but it also varies significantly from day to day. he is carrying around a notebook as a coping mechanism for a checklist/reminders/notes so he can get through his workday without accidentally scheduling a visit to the same client twice in the same week. some days he seems completely 100% normal, other days he repeats questions/comments occasionally and forgets details about things that happened &lt;30 minutes ago, and this past weekend he almost seemed ""blacked out"" and was operating ~30 seconds at a time after a long day of work followed by 2-3 hours playing live music. it seems like once routine but cognitively engaging tasks have become incredibly taxing for him, and once he runs out of fuel for the day (sometimes mid-day) there is just no avenue for him to recover aside from full night of sleep.so far, he has been referred to 2 different neurologists, had an mri with nothing remarkable noted, has taken a moca assessment where he missed one point (mid-june) and took a multi-hour long cognitive assessment (early last week) on which he scored above average in every area except short-term memory where there are significant deficits. he is seeing a cognitive neurologist this week and has been scheduled for a pet scan in a couple weeks.just curious if anyone has seen a sudden onset of symptoms and rapid decline like this within the span of ~2-3 months? my grandmothers both have dementia, but there were subtle yet obvious symptoms early on like forgetting to take medication, paranoia, etc. and i have not seen anything like that with my father over the last year up until a couple months ago."," my husband also scored very well on neuro psych test but i have since learned that high functioning people can score high and still have dementia.  follow up testing two years later showed dramatic changes.  when a person has fluctuating cognition, seemingly totally normal one day and problems functioning the next day, is a marker of lewy body dementia. there are times my husband seems totally normal then hours later he can't figure out how to buckle his belt.  mri's are not diagnostic for dementia, just rules out strokes etc. i know one person who had rapid decline, this is a disease that is not predictable. i believe the pet scan will likely pinpoint what is happening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/onhost/rapid_onset_severe_short_term_memory_loss_within/,"Rapid onset, severe short term memory loss within 2-3 months of noticing symptoms?"
"my mother-in-law was recently admitted to a 24 hour live-in dementia care facility.  my wife's family finally thought their struggles with caring for her would be eased.  however, my mil has been aggressive towards the staff and they have required us to pay for a ""minder"" or additional caretaker  to be with her 24/7 at the facility.  this is in addition to the already huge expense of keeping her there.  we can't afford this extra expense and so we have been the minders ourselves and now we are not only paying this facility to house her but we are having to be with her. there  this, as you can imagine, is in many ways worse than our previous situation.i'm wondering if we have any recourse with this facility.  it does state that having a minder would be required in the contract we signed.  however, given that aggressive behavior is exhibited by virtually all dementia patients and this is an actual dementia care facility, it seems unreasonable to me.", might consider a geripsych evaluation which could mean a short hospital stay to get a medication regimen that will help her with the aggression. the facility must have suggestions or protocols for this?  i ask tongue in cheek because in my experience getting the information you need from professionals who should have it can be like pulling teeth. boggles my mind.your situation sounds like a nightmare. i’m so sorry.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/onev8h/mil_required_to_have_a_minder/,"MIL Required to have a ""Minder"""
how do you handle visits after your loved one no longer recognizes you or other relatives?  my mom still recognizes most people (although thought my son was his dad (my ex) for a few moments and seemed confused as to why my ex would visit her) but i guess i would like to know how often people are visiting when their relatives are in full blown memory care?  and is it beneficial or does it seem to upset your loved one?," i try to visit my dad in memory care often. he always smiles and thanks me when i visit, and we engage in brief conversations. mostly we just sit and watch tv together but seeing him smile makes it worth it for me. i’m not sure what benefit it has in his mind but i personally benefit from going to see him. he still knows who i am btw.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oneop7/question_for_readers_with_loved_ones_in_assisted/,Question for readers with loved ones in assisted living and memory care facilities
"hi all, i'd appreciate your supportplease readi've always been ultra observant, sharp witted, intelligent and a deep thinker. so i'm finding this really challenging to deal with. over the last two years or so i've noticed that my memory is deteriorating. at first i didn't think anything of it as it was mostly small changes that were unusual for me. just general forgetfulness like forgetting to lock my door and car. leaving keys in door etc forgetting words and general things. however, a year later this developed into forgetting what i'm saying halfway through a sentence, forgetting what i'm doing, forgetting events etc and generally feeling like my brain isn't functioning right. like the awareness of the problem was becoming really apparent.now it's two years on and my family are telling me i'm aggressive, i'm doing stupid things like making coffee in pint glasses, putting things in the fridge that don't belong there, travelling into town just to forget what i'm doing and having to travel all the way back upset. people actually noticing my memory loss and commenting on it. t's just so infuriating.i get extra forgetful when i'm stressed or lose sleep and when i forget things my brain doesn't function at all. the best way to describe it is....it's like there's a black hole where the information should be and there's no strands to grab onto (no pieces of information) that i can use to piece it together and help me remember or take me back so i can rethink it over and retrace my steps etc. there's just nothing there. it's so scary and deeply frustrating because i've never had this before and it's happening a lot.i have to completely change what i'm thinking about in order to snap out of it. i'm incredible worried that i have early onset dementia or something and i'm getting tearful writing this now. i'm too afraid to go to the doctors and bit lost.", use the bredesen protocol. your best chance of stopping it from evolving into dementia.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/onay1d/im_38_and_legitimately_worried_i_have_early_onset/,I'm 38 and legitimately worried I have early onset dementia.

"we moved my grandma into assisted living 2 weeks ago.i was her caretaker since 2017, but this past year she declined significantly. after she fell for the 8th time, my dad and i made the decision to place her into senior care.we had an in-depth discussion with her doctor about her abilities and her struggles and he said we could try assisted living instead of putting her in memory care immediately.she has declined even more since we moved her into assisted living. in the past 2 weeks she has had sudden diarrhea all over the carpet 5 times. she has fallen once and forgot she had an alarm pendant she could push for help. the care team found her on the floor just sitting there in a confused daze when they came to check in her.her confusion is so much worse. she told me today she was in a hotel overlooking the ocean. yesterday, she called my cell phone 6 times on accident while trying to phone my dad. her living room and bedroom are separated by a half wall and she always asks where the bed is. it was 91 degrees today and she had her heater set to 90 degrees.is this normal? how long does it usually take for someone to adjust and settle back into their routine? i just hope this move didn't make her permanently worse. we were so confident assisted living would be a great fit, but maybe we were wrong and she have been in memory care from the start. i've just never seen her doing this poorly before."," i think assisted living is something to try before full memory care is incorporated.  it sounds as if your gramma would benefit from a lot more services.  can you add them ala cart as needed?the sad fact is that our loved ones never get better, so each change, each move, will make their health worse just because time is marching on.  and we all know how even the slightest stress or lack of sleep can worsen symptoms.  if you can, incorporate more help into her living plan and see if that helps, get her the highest level of assistance in al.  if not, then consider memory care.  you are doing the best you can do in an impossible, extremely painful process.  take care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/on6lan/grandma_doing_worse_in_al/,Grandma doing worse in AL?
"she is kinda paranoid and asking about where is her first son (one of his son is disabled and live far away from us, so she always worried about him).could antipsychotics be effective to calm her down? only for short term use. hopefully after 2-3 days she will be able to forget the question loop.because the last 7 days she didn't remember about her son and having a good time with us.but yesterday her other son came by and it must have triggered the question loop.thank you."," my grandma gets on question loops a lot. it’s frustrating to be asked the same questions over and over but when i pick up on one that she’s clinging to and i know for sure she’s gonna ask it, ive found it helpful to bring it up first. for example, for a while when my s/o and i first moved in with her, she would constantly ask if we needed a bed for our room. we always had one, but she was really stuck on that for months. so i started just bringing it up before she could. she would start with the good morning, and then i’d just lead right into the bed thing by saying something like “we slept so well last night on our comfortable new bed..”. it took away a lot of the frustration and seemed to help her too. that went on for a couple of months and now she’s not worried about the bed anymore. so maybe like if you know she’s gonna ask about it, try to lead with it. “good morning grandma i heard from [who she’s gonna ask about] today, he’s doing well, sends his regards” you might have to say that 10-20 times in one day so you know, change it up but maybe if she’s not constantly needing to ask, she’ll relax a little more about it. i know that wasn’t the answer you were looking for but maybe it’ll help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/on6bod/grandmother_repeating_the_same_question_all_day/,Grandmother repeating the same question all day long.

"long story short, i've posted before, due to covid and a few other factors we're unable to get an official diagnosis on my father yet.  he had a sudden and severe illness christmas last year and we had to move him in with us.  6 months and counting so far, not able to let him go home yet (his house is a disaster).  i feel really guilty for getting so annoyed, but it's affecting my whole family.  as much as we're trying to just deal with it and go with the flow.......we just need a f\*cking break.  constant noises when eats, yelling out every night in his sleep (occasionally really inappropriate things too, awkward!), the fixation on trying fix something randomly that just makes no sense (eg. a bike that was being replaced because it was old, broken, and had been ridden to death, we told him it was wrecked, so he spent more than we originally bought it for trying to fix because he decided he could - spoiler alert no, and now we have unneeded spare parts and a bike at the tip).  he decides to wash dishes then we have to rewash most of them because he seems to just wave them at the soapy water and they're left with bits of food or oil all over them.  he lost his old mobile so got him a new one, set it all up - now he's constantly looking up anything he can think of, and usually getting angry about: it isn't working properly (him pressing something wrong), websites, notifications, ads, errors in articles from 15+ years ago, wikipedia.....  and we always need to hear about it.  he talks over every tv show if it's not his thing.  he won't leave the room, read a book, play on his phone or just shut up and let people watch.  he sings, or makes inane comments that he thinks are witty or clever or insightful, or asks why/what/how while talking over it anyway.  over and over again.  then asks what he missed while he was talking.  last night he ruined a football game my husband and son were super invested in, to the point they refused to come back to watch.  and even when told point blank why, and that he needs to stop, he thinks it's some sort of joke. then does it again.  if he likes whatever's on, he has no trouble being quiet and just watching, then waiting for a break or the end to comment, discuss etc.  and then what he says is usually interesting, or at least relevant.  which makes me question myself about whether there's actually anything wrong or if he's just an a\*\*hole.none of us want to be angry with him, and looking from the outside it's just an old man being a bit silly occasionally.  but from the inside it's like death from a thousand cuts.  he refuses to believe he's anything but 100% right 100% of the time.  what i've listed isn't even half the little things that happen daily.  and i'm coming to the realisation that he probably won't be able to go home at all.  if he does i suspect it won't last long, for a lot of reasons.  suffice to say while he's not getting worse at a rapid rate, he's not improving.  he's not constantly forgetful, he's not confused all the time, it's not obvious what's going on unless you're living it.  until he was living with us we really didn't understand he's not been looking after himself for a long time, he hid it well.  our house isn't big enough for 5 people - it wasn't big enough as it was but we were only planning on being here a few years before moving to the other side of the country.  that's now on hold indefinitely.  we used to have family game nights, board games, old school video games and activities (especially through last years lockdown) to try break things up a bit and connect with each other (difficult enough with kids!).  now we hardly ever do things together, nothing feels the same.  it's like we avoid doing things we enjoy because my father won't join in, but will judge/comment/interrupt.  if all the above was only happening occasionally, i think we'd be alright.  but it's every day, every night.how do you deal with it when you're suddenly tasked with looking after an ageing parent?  when my kids should be my focus but now i'm looking after another adult, and i get so frustrated that he's so often basically like a bratty toddler?  i know no one ever plans to be doing this, but usually there's a buildup to this sort of situation.  it wouldn't be so bad but there's genuinely no end in sight to this situation right now, if we'd been anticipating this, we could have done at least a few things differently.how do you all cope, get a break, help your own kids and family, live a semi normal life, while dealing with a parent or grandparent with dementia?  is there anything that just helps alleviate the crap side of it all?  we have no family that could help, literally just my brother and he's barely a functioning adult at the best of times.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/on5c3g/it_doesnt_seem_that_bad_but_its_grinding_us/,"It doesn't seem that bad, but it's grinding us down....what are we meant to do?"

where are we?""  lather, rinse, repeat.  she keeps talking about ""learning to drive again"" (we all live in terror that she'll actually remember and want to).  she's always had a bad habit of telling pretty tall tales (those of us who love her have always just humored her, and she was otherwise a brilliant, funny, gold-hearted person).  they used to just be harmless ""then everyone clapped"" type stories with her the unlikely hero of a physically impossible adventure.but now, the tales are starting to become these improbable peyton place type dramatic stories about and against people, and are done in a negative way.  with them the villain, almost plotting against her, my friend, and in crazy movie plot ""i spy"" ways.she's developed a vendetta against a relative over an imagined slight, and of all the things for her to recall, she has built on that until her relative has become an enemy of epic proportions.  the things she's accused of are, first of all, not at all like this person (who's also a good friend), and secondly, don't make logical sense and aren't physically possible.it's breaking everyone's hearts as they were once very very close.   a recent occurrence brought it all home to roost (a truly wild tale featuring her formerly beloved relative as villain extraordinaire).  it was a tale that couldn't possibly have happened the way she's saying, or at all, frankly, and there are security cameras that would have shown the person's supposed ""bad act"" if they had done such a thing.it really showcased that her mind is starting to not process things that well now.  i mean, i'm only an ""adopted"" family member, she has a husband and a son (good friend), but i'm going to be there for her and them all the way.  just not sure what to expect as it starts going downhill even worse.  are there things i can say and do, now, that might help her organize her thoughts better?  better ways to distract her when she goes all peyton-place-dramatic-tall-tale mode?"," it sounds like your friend and my mom could've been twins. mom never admitted there was a problem until a few weeks before she died, she'd been in memory care for 6 months at that point and looked at me one day and said, ""i think there's something wrong in my head, i can't think right."" it put me in the position of coming up with those softer excuses instead of telling her she was dying like her mother and grandmother both had. felt like i was gutted at the time but that far along there was no reason to have that talk, the lucidity only lasted a few minutes anyway.repetitive questions, ""thinking of driving again"" all of that is common. creating dramas in their heads that couldn't possibly happen but they're absolutely sure they have... all par for the course. my grandmother insisted her 4 dead children were coming back every night to visit, escorted by a military man she didn't know.  fairies lot up her living room at night, but only if i wasn't there. mom insisted people were living in an abandoned rv on the driveway and that her neighbor had come down and shot her cats- she insisted that those same cats had to move into the house immediately to be kept from being shot again and the dog too... so she had 3 non-litterbox trained cats and a farm dog living in the house. she actually tried calling the neighbor to tell him off. thankfully he wasn't home and i stopped by and talked to his wife and explained the situation before mom got ahold of them and even then she went on about how my cousin shot all of her cats. it's a long and bumpy ride and i wish it got easier, but it just changes.definitely watch teepa snow, she's what got me and my siblings through the early days with mom.  if you can, have the husband and son watch too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/omayoc/brand_new_to_this_a_dear_friend_adopted_family/,"Brand new to this.

"hi! my grandpa (80) has suffered from dementia for a few years now. his twin brother passed away in september, he had severe cognitive decline, parkinson’s and alzheimer’s, also had multiple strokes. this winter everything’s gotten so much worse, he doesn’t shower, doesn’t let anyone clean his prosthetics, he eats very little and is definitely underweight. all he wants is to smoke. my grandma has cut down his smokes to 7 cigarettes a day, because he forgets that he’s already smoked and can smoke a full pack a day. he gets very very rude and aggressive when my grandma doesn’t give him even if he just had one. he barely talks to everyone and most of the time it’s just inappropriate and rude things. he doesn’t seem to remember that his brother died even tho he was at his funeral. and it’s things like this, my grandma can accept that he’s sick, they have been married for 55 years. his doctor prescribed him some medicine but like a small child he’ll hide them in his pockets, tells my grandma to go fuck herself at anything she asks him. at least he’s taking medication for his heart. he used to be very generous, kind and hardworking so i’m not surprised why it’s hard for my grandma to accept that. he spends all day cutting grass, if she asks him to do something else he either laughs or again, tells her to fuck off. i’m at loss here, i have to sit him everytime my grandma isn’t home because he doesn’t give water to the family dog for whatever reason, forgets to feed him, doesn’t let the dog out of the house even tho we have a fence, we remind him everytime but he forgets very quickly. at least he sleeps well.does anyone know how to help when he’s not willing to take the medicine? or some other ways? for obvious reasons my grandma doesn’t wanna put him in a nursing home so that’s not an option. thank you fo reading."," you have to remind yourself that his brain is malfunctioning. he's not being rude, his brain isn't wired the way it used to be and his responses may not always be what he wants them to be but they're what he has left. i hope you and your family aren't reminding him over and over that his brother is dead, to someone with dementia it's all new information, so you're basically putting him through that death over and over. it's better to come up with a ""therapeutic lie"" to deal with questions- something believable that doesn't cause pain.

"hello. my dad (78) was recently diagnosed with severe dementia and alzheimer's. he has become very difficult for my mom to handle. my mother is 15 years younger than my father, but she has osteoporosis. she is extremely stressed out and feels her life is over since she has to care for him. she has been caring for people since she was a child. she wanted to finally do things just for herself. my parents have never gotten along so there is a lot of resentment. now she is losing her patience and temper. i went to try to help her go through things to declutter the house and watch dad last week, but here were many fights between my dad and her. the doctor had the dmv take my father's driver's license away and my mom hide his passport. however, he keeps demanding she give him his passport so he can go to ireland. he says he is going to go live in ireland and that he has family there still. his family there is pretty elderly and i looked it up and it didn't seem the uk helps dementia patients any better than the usa. it's still expensive. he is also furious she sold his car and remembers that it is gone. (it couldn't pass the smog and it cost too much to get fixed anyway.) he obviously can't remember why the car was removed even though he have explained many times. he keeps saying he will call the police. maybe he should if a male office comes he may listen...in addition, the mobile home they live in, is in his name. we tried to get him to sign the power of attorney and a paper that says that the house will go to mom when he passes, but he refused, says nothing is wrong with him. he won't write a will (he doesn't have much besides the house and some old tools) and he has never prepared for his own death in any way. he won't even add mom's name to the house.i don't really know what to do to help her. i doubt he would agree to go to a memory care home at the moment even though it would be probably better for the both of them... i'm not sure we could afford to pay for one at the moment. the only income my parents have is the small amount of social security my dad gets and mom can't lose the house. my sis and i could help pay for it, but from research they seem to be over $5000 a month in california. my half sister was telling me to get him into one, but i'm not sure if her family would contribute to the cost. i need to ask about that. i thought about asking my half brother to help to get dad to sign the paper work since he doesn't listen to women. but he would forget if he just called him so he would probably have to drive 4 hours to do anything. does anyone have any advice on what my mother can do? thank you.", if he's already been diagnosed with severe dementia then he can't sign legal documents. your mom would never go have him declared incompetent and have herself appointed his guardian.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ojn141/mom_cant_handle_dad_with_dementia_wont_sign_power/,Mom Can't Handle Dad with Dementia - Won't sign Power of Attorney-

"hey everyone, first time poster here. my mom (78) was diagnosed with parkinson's about 8 years ago. the initial decline was very slow and gradual, but in the past year her cognitive decline has really picked up into full-on dementia. lots of describing things that aren't there, thinking she needs to go places, thinking she has missed appointments and events, not remembering who some people are, dates/timelines all over the place, etc.we've stretched out living at home as long as possible by adding safety measures but lately she has been more physically active than ever (thanks to a medication adjustment), however she is very unsteady on her feet and frequently forgets her cane or walker, so it's only a matter of time before she seriously hurts herself in a fall. i live a day's drive away but my dad and sister that live with her are taking her on a tour of a brand new memory care facility, where she and my dad will presumably move in shortly. \[side note: dad's also 78, 100% mentally there, but overweight and aging, so he can't keep up with mom's care, especially waking up 2-3 times a night for bathroom visits.\]now that this is all in motion, it's a little overwhelming for dad and us kids, but we're committed to keeping mom safe and as happy as possible as her decline continues. the move itself is going to be jarring i'm sure - my parents have been in the same house for over 40 years.i don't really have any super specific questions, but i am wondering for those of you that have gone through something similar with a loved one, what advice do you have for me, both short and long term? also, this is particularly difficult for my dad, who has always been a keep-his-feelings-to-himself kind of guy, but mom is his everything, and he is showing clear signs of depression. what should i be doing to support him as well? i appreciate any thoughts or advice you can offer."," i don't know how to say this gently, but if any part of you fears that she will be denied entry into an assisted living because her dementia is ""that bad"" (my words for my mom's situation), please reconsider placement in a higher level of care facility.when we viewed places with my mom, i was so overwhelmed with her making sense, not falling down, or having a breakthrough seizure while we toured that i cried at home afterwards.my mom was perhaps too far into dementia when we placed her at one. she only lasted a year before another stay in rehab after a fall/seizure finally pushed us into a skilled nurse facility.not to say you're in that position, but please be mindful of how you're feeling about her interview with the facility. again, i don't mean any harm, just less emotional pain in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oiwoyf/time_has_come_to_move_mom_to_assisted_living/,Time has come to move mom to assisted living - looking for what to expect/prepare for

"i've been dreading this for a good long while, but today i finally saw my dad. i live in a different country, and we haven't spoken for years due to him being a lifelong alcoholic. in late 2019, my older brother, who also has severe mental health issues (and has been living with my dad his whole life) was put in a mental health facility and my dad was taken to a nursing home when it became clear that he couldn't take care of himself. we've been estranged for years now and never really had a good relationship, but i was planning on visiting last year, and then covid happened. he's had one or two visits since being admitted from other family members, and apparently at first he was still able speak, although incoherently. sometime this year, he completely lost the ability to form words, and mostly just strings together gibbrish words that are more like sounds. when i saw him today, i could tell that he recognized me because he got visibly excited and emotional. he cried a lot, clutched my hand tightly, and sometimes smiled and tried to communicate. i knew it would be bad, but i wasn't prepared for how devastated i would feel. he wasn't a good dad, but i know that he loved me. i cried a lot too and tried to make him smile as much as i could. he still seems like he enjoys being around people and always greets all the nurses with a big smile. i tried to see if he understood written words, but it didn't seem like he did. he is wheelchair bound and i'm assuming can't do anything by himself at this point. it's difficult to get any kind of  useful information out of anyone here in the nursing home, based on his inability to communicate i've deduced myself that he has frontotemporal dementia and that it seems pretty advanced. the government appointed someone to be in charge of his finances since no one was here, and i don't know what to expect. they're also apparently moving everyone out of this facility and that's in the process of getting sorted. i know i shouldn't feel guilty for not being here to take care of him, but seeing him was extremely difficult. earlier this year i started seeing a therapist and left my demanding job because of stress and depression. i'm afraid of everything else that comes next, and i wish i knew when it would just be over. i'm the youngest son of 3, and i know that my two older siblings would be completely useless at taking care of any of his affairs. i just want him to able to live his last years (if he even has that long left) in relative comfort. i don't really know what i'm asking in this post, just had to write it down in between the crying. if anyone has any similar experiences with advanced frontotemporal dementia, please share what to expect if you can.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oip8z5/saw_my_dad_today_for_the_first_time_in_4_years/,"Saw my Dad today for the first time in 4 years, Frontotemporal Dementia"

has anyone used medicaid planning professionals? we are desperate. dad’s parkinson’s and alzheimer’s is progressing very quickly and my mom is very very quickly reaching her limit with what she is able to do for him. she has cancer herself. both are in their 60s and dad likely needs to move into a nursing home asap. they don’t currently qualify for medicaid because they are over the asset limit and we’re unsure how to proceed.," i've never heard of ""medicaid planning professionals"" around here, but we recently had to admit my mother to a nursing home. due to her financial situation she had to pay the first month out of pocket. i'm still trying to learn the particulars myself, but it's my understanding that she had to do so until her financial situation was under the limit to qualify. hopefully they approve her after spending all that money.we had to gather everything for the nursing home/medicaid to assess: bank statements, life insurance, deeds/proof of ownership of property, bills of sale for any property sold, etc. i don't know exactly what they do with everything, but typically everything will go toward their care. my brother who sells insurance says the facilities cancel the life insurance to collect any cash value it has, but i don't know what happens with any real property. my mother did sell her house last year and moved to my brother's house while waiting for a small mobile home to be set up for her on his property. most likely medicaid will claim that as well.since it's so hard to find information regarding this stuff (it feels like some top secret info the public doesn't have access to for some crazy reason), a good place to start might be with the nursing homes you're considering for him. the people in the business office might be able to help you. if you haven't already, please speak to your mom about power of attorney. if she becomes incapacitated, you'll need to have something in place so you're able to see to your parents' needs. without it it's extremely difficult. my mother was always too stubborn to set up poa. she spent the month of june in the hospital, and she was no longer able to come home afterward. it was hard to find a safe place for her since my brothers and i couldn't provide the full time care she needed. after calling everyone we could think of for help, someone suggested we contact adult protective services for information & assistance. they turned out to be a big help and got us pointed in the right direction. maybe they can do the same for your family. is it maybe possible that your parents could both move into an assisted living facility? since some of them are connected to long term care facilities it could make the transition to the nursing home easier when it's time. i wish i had the answers to give you, because i know how stressful the situation is. i wish you lots of strength and luck. \*hugs\*",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oimxcj/medicaid_planning_professionals/,Medicaid planning professionals?

"first off, i so appreciate all of you in this sub. i've been reading through posts since fil came to stay with us a couple months ago and it's been an absolute life saver.fil has been diagnosed with alcohol induced dementia and depression, and exhibits a lot of fear and paranoia whenever we try to get him out of the house. he used to want to go for walks all the time but now even just in the neighborhood he wants to turn back pretty quickly. we've also bought a lot of stuff for us to do around the house - easy games, coloring books, puzzles, etc. but for the last few days it's just tv and movies all day. he'll look away from the tv and tell us he's tired of it but then turns down any suggestions we offer him.we can barely get him to talk either, and when he does it's just a few words. several weeks ago he was talking up a storm. i can't tell if these are signs that his dementia symptoms are getting worse or if his depression is maybe getting worse. i know he feels trapped here with us instead of back in his home, so i'm just desperate to find anything he's excited about to try and help him out! we're starting the paperwork for medicaide this week to get him into a memory care facility, and i'm hoping that process goes quickly. we're doing the best we can for him but i know he needs so much more. we've considered some kind of adult day care but the costs would put a pretty significant strain on our finances.sorry, i know this post is all over place. we've been so stressed and exhausted trying to find our way through this, i have trouble staying focused and organizing my very disorganized thoughts. anyone have any advice on ways to try and get him more engaged?"," i found music has been really incredible for stimulating my grandmother. she will literally sit there and stare at her hands, but when we put on her headphones and play her favourite music she beams and dances in the spot and sings along. she remembers all the lyrics, it's amazing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oid2io/hoping_for_some_advice_fil_doesnt_want_to_do_much/,"Hoping for some advice, FIL doesn't want to do much"

"i was referred over this direction from r/childofhoarder. i know there is probably a lot of overlap, and also with depression, too. my almost 69-year-old mother is living in a squalor hoarder situation. she's never made the best decisions about her life, especially regarding her house and stuff. i am concerned that she may be progressing into dementia but i'm not sure what to attribute to her hoarding and what to attribute to possible dementia, if that makes sense? i'm in the process of trying to help her with her finances and get her to doctor's appointments she's been avoiding, and eventually get her out of the house and into somewhere safe. she signed over voluntary power of attorney to me after she basically handed over her inheritance to my aunt for nothing and we realized it after the fact, so i have some legal ability to help her, but not the power to unilaterally force her into anything as she can withdraw the power of attorney.   what should i look out for as a sign of dementia? what can i expect from dealing with her if there is dementia on top of the hoarding? where can i take her to get tested that she would agree to go? i'm sorry i have a lot of questions but i'm just realizing things are worse than i thought, and it's possible its more than the hoarding that i'm going to have to deal with. thanks in advance."," first of all, i'm sorry this all landed on you. second, symptoms are going to vary depending on the type of dementia and the person, so it's hard to give you an exact list of what to look for. is she forgetting things more than usual? if she drives, is she getting lost on familiar roads? (if you don't live with her you might still notice that it's taking her longer to get places or not getting there at all, just turning around and going back home, which could indicate she's getting lost.) increased anxiety is another common symptom, as is paranoia or other delusional beliefs, so keep an eye out for agitation, any mention of people watching her house or trying to break in or steal her things, etc. finally, how is she with tasks? is she still making herself meals or struggling with that? is she wearing appropriate clothing, or is she wearing weird/random things that don't fit the weather or occasion? has her grooming gotten worse?as for what to expect if it is dementia, expect that she'll start off needing reminders to do things like eat or dress or take her meds, then instructions, then hands on assistance. expect that she'll grow increasingly unable to stay alone and increasingly likely to damage things or hurt herself as her cognition gets worse. depending on how she is physically, she may be a fall risk, especially in a cluttered house, so you'll probably have to clean up her house and/or move her eventually. (also, clutter tends to lead to more confusion and to trigger delusions, like believing there's a person in the house because they mistake a pile of laundry for a person, so be careful of that.) eventually she'll need 24/7 care.for testing, you could start with her general physician, but a geriatric neurologist is your best bet, if you can get her to one. people with dementia tend to pull out the stops to act ""normal"" in front of doctors, so make sure you find someone who recognizes the need to keep her there for a longer assessment - long enough for her to get mentally tired and be unable to maintain the facade.lastly, i'd suggest contacting an elder care attorney to a) figure out how to pay for her care and b) figure out what you need to do, legally, to be able to move her into a facility against her wishes. i'm very concerned about her staying in her house as you describe it - that's a bad living situation for a healthy person, much less one with dementia, and is likely to make it a lot harder to care for her effectively.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oi9nh6/where_do_hoarding_issues_stop_and_dementia_issues/,Where do hoarding issues stop and dementia issues begin?

"it’s… a lot, not anything new or unique to this board. my question here is, when these very identifiable, incontrovertible problems exist, but due to being in such a dysfunctional family system basically forever, how, personally do you draw your lines?i had gotten to pretty low contact with both my parents after years of not understanding that i was being blamed and gaslit for problems that generously belonged to all of us, but when someone recently said, “it sounds like the common denominator here is, your parents are extremely unreasonable”, it just sort of crystallized. i carried some bad habits to my marriage and children, and have been trying to fix everything both up and down for so, so long, but way too late realized just because i want that, doesn’t mean they do. i came home when my father had potentially caught covid (he actually did), caught it myself from him, and have been trying to find my feet ever since. he has not and will not return to his home. fortunately i am not legally responsible for him, but do a good amount of daily hands on care and research a lot of the things he needs and treatments available, although it largely goes unused.  his current placement is woefully inadequate, and my sibling who is the poa will not see that. i see flashes of my father acting “normally” but that just makes things more confusing- his normal wasn’t fun, either. ironically, or in some specific ways to try to work through stuff, i spent nearly 10 years in elder care and am currently the sole the caretaker of a low functioning adult child with autism. i have special ed certifications, did my cna training, spent time working in various level care facilities, and am comfortable negotiating the benefits systems surrounding this, albeit in another state. to be blunt, i know way more about this than my sibs do, and it’s super frustrating to be playing emperors new clothes here. one has checked out entirely, says i should just go home and not deal with any of it, that’s his preference and he’s got a right to it. one thinks he knows what going on, but a five minute phone call every two weeks is…less than a thorough understanding of what’s happening. the one with the poa just…won’t see it? and her interventions are so wildly variable i can’t keep supporting them? but she has no interest in abdicating any control, and i don’t exactly want it, but she thinks things will just “work out” and she’s not super concerned how or when that is. if i leave, things that are currently sort of keeping this boat afloat will quite likely not happen. i’ve made my peace with that, i think if i can get things more or less settled and try to facilitate as good a summer as possible, that’s about the best i can do. it is so hard to be told i’m a martyr (i promise, i’m not enjoying this at all) or incompetent (by people who have no understanding or ability or inclination to do better, much less really put forth true effort) or uncaring (i’m literally here, what else can i do?). i’ll give anyone three swipes at me and i’m done for the day. i understand my father cannot “learn” at this point, and redressing 50 years of problems at this junction is simply not an option. but i can’t take being talked badly to. my siblings, however, should be capable of personal growth, and it’s just unclear when i bail on that dream. also i have real sympathy for my sisters situation, it is simply too much for one person to do, and no one else is stepping up to help her. i feel like i’m marinating in the gaslight stew i finally extracted myself from. it’s a daily struggle to hold on to an objective reality when the ones i inhabit are so messed up. but at least it’s voluntary? i feel like people do what they can, and different people have different abilities or willingness levels, but i’m not nagging on you all, quit unloading on me for trying to present the obvious truth. any insight would be appreciated."," it sounds like we have similar situations. i wish i had a playbook to pass onto you, but i’m trying to find my bearings in this all too, as my mom’s diagnosis came april of this year.it truly sucks when a person who contributed to your emotional abuse gets dementia. it’s hard to tell what is intentional and what’s not. it sucks to have to pick up the pieces of everything they broke, as most children w/ n-parents have to do.i can imagine why u went low contact in the first place. then the conflicting feelings of coming back to help and ur siblings talking down to u.giving u a big virtual hug. honestly, idk what else to say or do. if later on i find coping mechanisms, i’ll pass them along.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ohpap2/narcissistic_father_78_post_stroke_post_covid/,"Narcissistic Father (78) post stroke, post Covid, with mid level vascular dementia, extreme untreated depression and anxiety"

"i [19ftm] feel for the families and the residents i meet at the nursing facility i work for. i've been getting to know the residents more and more (the ones that talk to me when i clean their rooms) and it's hard to watch them go through this. they tell me about their hobbies, families, what they did, what they want, etc. even if they don't remember their lives as well as they used to and they don't always make sense, they're just so sweet and interesting. i just like to learn from their experiences and their lives.there is one women, i will keep her name private so i can respect her family.. i will call her d. d and i talk all the time when i see in the halls on my way to another room. or just when i clean her room. she has been depressed lately. the residents all have their days, but it always gets me... i love these people and it hurts to see them like this, let alone the families. i found out recently that d loves puzzles. i thought about bringing her some puzzle booklets. she says she loves doing those and she used to do them a lot. i am just super happy to get to work and see these lovely people. i like to try to make their days brighter and i love to see them even in their worst moments because they all are going through something i cannot imagine. d even loves candy. her favorite is milkyways. another woman, i will call k, has been super, super sweet. she always makes me smile and i love talking to her despite her not making any sense. she is funny and very loving. i will say hi, ask how she is, even talk about our day. even though it's mostly me talking, she loves it. she even bothers the nurses just to speak to me when they are trying to do therapy with her.i always speak with the residents and always smile at them. i always interact with them all and give them my attention. they love it. i hope that it makes their days a little bit better. it's worth it. i just wanted to write about this because i feel for all of you guys dealing with this.. it's so hard to watch other people's family members dealing with that. i had a grandpa (mom's side) who battled with dementia and now his wife is following closely behind. i got this job to hopefully be around her more when we eventually cannot take care of her ourselves. she is doing okay as she can be right now, but not really herself. i just want to let you all know that everything you deal with and everything you feel is your strength. i hope all of you know that what you're doing is awesome. ❤️"," i admire you a lot. all my life i've been uncomfortable in residences like that, and sad about the people who get put there and forgotten, or whose deteriorating faculties make the last years of their lives so difficult. i couldn't do what you do, but you and others like you are sooooo important and i salute you. keep it up, op. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oh2i2p/just_some_support/,Just Some Support
"so my grandma has dementia. she is convinced her neighbor has planted a device in her house that makes them able to talk to eachother. problem is, she hates her neighbor, so she spends her time cursing and yelling  at her ""neighbor"". she's also convinced that her neighbor keeps almost killing this dude. but this dude doesn't exist. she calls the cops often. we told her not to but she still does. she says she can't sleep because her neighbor blasts music and yells all night. she's also convinced my mom is a murderer but she seems oddly fine with that information.what im wandering, would it be bad to make a ""device"" that blocks the neighbors ""device""? like, just something small that we attach to the wall or something that looks device-y? obviously it'd not actually do anything, but maybe she'd think it works? also, am i supposed to play along with her or tell her its not real? it seems real to her and in the beginning my family tried to tell her it isnt real but we all stopped trying with that. i don't really know much about dementia, i'm still a teen so my mother deals with all the medical stuff with my grandma. all i know is from what i've seen/experienced. what can i do to help her? i feel so bad, she doesn't seem to mind the ""gossip"" but she does mind not being able to sleep."," it sounds like what is known as a fixed delusion. that means she has it in her head and cannot be talked out of it. the recommendation for this is to go along with the delusion in a way that reassures her that she is safe and taken care of. even though she won't forget about the belief that her neighbors are talking to her, she might forget what the box is for. maybe put some pictures of family and things she likes on a box or board or piece of paper with a button on it that she can press if she feels bad or afraid and tell her it sends out love that will keep her safe. sorry about your g-mom. it's so great that you want to help her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oh28ck/my_grandmother_has_dementia/,My grandmother has dementia
"let me begin by saying i will keep this post entirely politically neutral.  i will not state my father's (or my) political views here.  this applies to everyone, no matter your world view.also, remember, people suffering from dementia have little to no capability to learn new facts or information.........but they do have a great ability to absorb new emotions, as you will read in my post.my father has always been very interested in both politics and current affairs.  the breadth and depth of his knowledge, of both past and recent events, always amazed me.  he has forgotten most, though not quite all, of it by now.he was always an intellectual, read books from the world's great thinkers, and got most of his news from the best newspapers and radio programs.  as technology progressed, he started to listen to podcasts in his car, and read online a lot.his girlfriend is fairly aligned with him politically, but does not have his intellectual bent---she mostly gets her news from the least-deep source, television.  but at least the tv news was something they could enjoy together.nowadays, my father no longer drives, and can no longer read very much, let alone download a podcast or even navigate to a website.their nightly routine today consists of his girlfriend recording the news from one of the major cable tv  networks (again, i won't say which one) on the dvr, then playing it in the late evening, close to bedtime.here's the typical result of all that:\--my father sees sensationalized reporting of a mass shooting\--my father is disturbed at both the senselessness of killing someone you've never met, and our elected leaders' seeming inability to do much about it\--my father can no longer write to his congressperson, or president, or even make a decision on who to vote for\--my father is incapable of making a decision as to which public place is or isn't safe to visit\--my father gets to experience all of the trauma of hearing about what's going on in the world, while simultaneously receiving absolutely zero of the benefits of knowing what's going on in the worldagain.......i hope this won't devolve into a political debate---this isn't the place.  i just wanted to point out that there is no benefit in letting your loved one see negative things on television.  especially close to bedtime.  instead, find a youtuber with a soothing voice and slow, calm speech, who will talk about a subject that is pleasant to your loved one."," when the pandemic started, my dad would watch the news by himself in his house and, every time they said “stay home wash your hands don’t touch your face wear a mask” he would go wash his hands. even though he hadn’t been anywhere and there was no way for any new germs to infiltrate his home.  he gave himself a rash on his hands from scrubbing. and then he decided that was covid. now, his tv doesn’t have cable or broadcast and he watches cowboy movies. he’s a lot chiller.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oh04zt/opinion_tv_news_harms_rather_than_helps_your/,"Opinion: TV news harms, rather than helps, your loved one"
"so a month ago i posted about my grandmother's dementia and my feelings regarding it, that post can be seen here: [&amp;#x200b;i have a not-so-fun update that happened earlier this week. so as i mentioned my aunt is staying with my grandmother to keep an eye on her. what i don't think i properly explained in the last post is that my aunt staying with my grandmother is what's keeping my grandma's sister from putting her into a nursing home for people with dementia. my aunt didn't want my grandmother to hate her for putting her in a home, and she didn't want to separate my grandma from her dogs. plus for some reason we still don't understand, my grandmother is packing up items into bags, boxes, and suitcases, so we don't know what she thinks is going on. she's also on this new medication that's supposed to help with her memory, i don't remember the name of it but my aunt thinks it might be making my grandma grumpy. another thing i didn't bring up in my original post, my grandmother's house is falling apart. very badly as well. she has a serious rat and ant problem, her kitchen sink is constantly leaking, she's got spots in her kitchen where the floor is caving in, the central ac isn't as great as it used to be, and at one point a whole row of cabinets fell off the wall. the hording mess is an entire other issue as well. but we managed to at least clean her bedroom and master bathroom while her sister had her at her house. she still doesn't notice, which i don't know if that's good or bad.so on sunday night, we're driving down to my grandma's house to drop off my dog, who my aunt had agreed to watch while we went camping. when we got there, my aunt's boyfriend was outside, and in a very hushed voice, told my mom something and she all but ran inside. he came back and told us that my grandmother had put a bag under the sink, into the bucket my aunt kept to catch the leaking water. it was soaked with dirty water and milk that she poured down the drain. my aunt tried to move the bag and save whatever was in there, but my grandmother snapped at her. my grandma just started screaming something about ""this is my house and i'm not going to be treating like this in my house""my aunt, very calmly tried to calm her down. ""mama-"" and that apparently set her off more because my grandmother just shouted, ""i'm not your mama. i did not birth you, you are not mine.""now this isn't the first time she's said something like this to one of us, she told my brother a week before this that she isn't his grandma. but my aunt's heart broke. she knows how dementia patients are, she's worked with them before, and she thought she could handle her own mother. but to have her mother scream in her face that she wasn't hers just broke her. she went to the bathroom sobbing, and that's what it was like when we got there. my aunt's boyfriend showed us the video to catch me and my brother up while my mom handled the situation.  she tried that on my mother too but my mom is a bit more used to yelling, and just smiled. she later told me she knew that pissed her off, but she managed to calm her down and my grandmother just forgot in the next minute. this has happened again while we were gone, and my grandmother even ended up hitting my aunt on the arm if i remember correctly. but the short end is this, my aunt doesn't know how much more of this she can take, and while she doesn't want to put grandma into a home, that might end up being the case soon. i don't know how much more my aunt can take...and i don't know how much more i can either."," i'm so sorry for your situation. the up and down swings hurt a lot. my mother puts on a great ""show"" when new people are around. ""i love my baby. she's so cute""...things like that. the new people go away thinking what a ""sweet old lady"" she is. for months i think people must have believed that i was just a grumpy, mean person and a liar. once i got a caregiver to come in and help, she got to see what mom is like away from the song and dance. it was a strange thing to be relieved about since, technically, it means another person is suffering with me. but i'm just glad someone else can see that i'm not imagining the situation. she can see i'm not a liar.getting your grandmother out so you guys can clean/improve the house is brilliant. it was how i was able to get rid of all the moldy things at my mom's house and get a plumber in for both sinks. my mom is a hypochondriac and walked herself into an emergency room for no real reason the one day i didn't visit her. it was bad at the time, but once they decided to keep her, the gloves went on, i bought masks and had a dumpster brought over, and things actually got done. best of luck and we're all pulling for you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ogyaid/update_on_my_grandmother/,Update on my Grandmother

"i mention the uk because partly i'm wondering about resources the family (my sister, dad and i) could access or use.  tl:dr my nan had vascular dementia (early onset) and passed away in her 60s. my mum's (50s) exhibiting some worrying symptoms that may be due to post menopause/hrt but kinda seem like maybe they're not and i'm shitting myself. and looking for any options to deal with it.  long story:  my mum's mother passed away several years ago from (i believe) vascular dementia - we were told this is a hereditary type and more common in women?   a huge part of her problem was her total social isolation - my mum and her brother never got on with their mum (their dad died when they were teens) and left home asap. my grandmother stopped working when she had kids and never went back, lived in council housing that required very little interaction with people and claimed a pension (i assume i was younger and didn't get super involved at the time) church groups and other old lady clubs were constantly dropping by and checking in and asking if she wanted tea or her grass cut etc. she'd stubbornly tell them to piss off and she wasn't a charity case, eventually they stopped bothering.   from what i recall of visiting as a child she wasn't great - like nothing awful but 'children should be seen and not heard' quite old fashioned (you can't have children if you're not married!) and racist - the point is she wasn't the friendliest, made no effort to get out and stimulate herself and actively pushed people away who would have otherwise helped - even family.   part of this is why some of the signs took so long to be noticed - she was angry and snappy at the best of times and we only saw her a handful of times  a year.   anyway, i don't want to dwell on that to much, it's simply for context.  my mum recently (few years back) went through menopause (confirmed over by her gp) and during that period and ever since has just been...not right.   she can't organise herself (she used to run and manage a busy day care plus the household)&amp;#x200b;she forgets things unless they're listed or on a calendar, she needs reminding multiple times where she's supposed to be or what she's supposed to be doing. she get angry at people for reminding her, and angry at herself for having to be reminded.   she does things that make no sense (like my parents have two fridges and veggies always go in one of them, she'll put them in the wrong one - i know it seems minor but it's something she'd never have done before)  it reached a peak over the summer when she had some unexplained bleeding and went to the hospital for a few tests (nothing untoward just lady parts being lady parts and it all cleared up) she was a wreck. she had to be hand held to every appointment, my dad had to take notes for her, she got lost in the clearly signed hospital and (armchair psychologist here) i'd say she had a full blown anxiety attack and anxiety for several weeks, she compulsively made lists, lost track of them, made them again and then fished the shredded pieces out of the bin when we threw them out, whilst getting angry with us. she called me in tears because she got lost at the hospital and she kept calling herself stupid and 'better than this' i spent almost an hour calming her down and then having to speak to my dad to get up to date with her medical stuff so i could talk to insurance for her. the only minor upside is we had a small bonding moment over how awful anxiety is!  we put a lot of this down to menopause and hormones - i know first hand from my own experience with bc how fucking mental the wrong balance can make you! as part of the fix for above she had an iud - half of hrt therapy.  the 'final straw' came about a month and a half ago when she passed out in the kitchen, fell and knocked her tooth out - she was obviously shaken up and what bit of confidence she had is slowly leaving her (she wouldn't even ring the gp to make an appointment because she said she couldn't keep it straight in her head what she needed) and  since then we've spent the last few weeks back and forth to the gp convincing her to try the other half - oestrogen gel.  i went to one of the appointments with her and ....it was like taking my toddler, she just sat there quietly letting me explain these really intimate things to this gp, i felt awful and patronising, like i was stepping all over her. she just said thanks and could i text dad the details cause she'd already got a bit confused.  about 4 weeks ago she finally started and we've been holding our breath hoping that this is the answer, the gp did say it should start working almost right away even if it takes a few weeks to go full swing. she has a follow up in a couple weeks.  last week we went away as a family together and the length of time we spent together made it really apparent there is still something wrong.   she seemed almost 'off' half the time, she didn't read anything, she didn't talk much. she joined in with the things we did (like snooker) but got angry at what (in years gone by) would have been good natured ribbing (we're all terrible at snooker xd) she said 'the rules kept changing' .  she tried to make tea by putting tea bags directly into the kettle, and then claimed she didn't do it and got angry - honestly it felt like she really truly did not have any recollection of doing that action.   &amp;#x200b;she's not quite as bad as her mum in that she kept working up until redundancy about 15 to 20 years ago maybe. my dad earned enough to not worry about it and my mums always been a home maker, so she liked being home and my dad liked not having to do house stuff. since i had my son shes loved being able to care for him as well and it's one of the few things i see her really light up about.   she's never really been a hugely passionate person, she loved cross stitches and puzzles but her eye sight makes that hard, social wise she had my dad - both of them are just each others best friend and rarely socialise outside of the odd couple friend they have, so she doesn't have a lot of hobbies and she stopped driving years ago and is now too nervous about it to take it up again (and more recently she's got really anxious about the bus) she's almost voluntarily housebound weekdays. she cares for my son a couple days a week (and she is fantastic at that, although i am starting to worry slightly but it's like with him she switches back into old habits and has it together) and we're always over at the weekend (i love my mum to bits and the running joke is i never left home xd) so she's no where near as bad as my nan was - but it's still heavily reduced and very little mentally stimulating activities or things that really keep you on your toes yanno?  it's to late for her to go back to work (her career credentials have expired and regaining would be like starting from scratch as it's changed so much in childcare) she has very basic it skills (as much as i love her i wouldn't wish her on the office of my worst enemy!) and frankly she's just to nervous about everything to be of any use doing much. i'm worried the window for keeping her mind active and working has passed....and whilst i'm glad my son can help, the second i think he's in any chance of danger i'll send him to nursery full time (and my mum totally agrees, her biggest fear is accidentally hurting him)  i firmly think, regardless, she needs counselling for anxiety but getting my mother to understand my problems with anxiety and depression has been a long up hill struggle that only really achieved her acceptance that /i/ think i have a problem. i suggested she may need to talk to a professional and she just sort of brushes over it. my dad is only marginally better. she absolutely does not want to admit this is a problem, she may have a problem or that that problem may not be solvable with a course of tablets or similar.   and all of this is made harder by the fact all of us have full time jobs and i have a child to run around after as well. we will absolutely figure something out to run her where she needs to be if we have to, but regardless of intention and desire the fact remains we're all adults with families that also need care and time - luckily we all live about 3 miles apart!  i'm also aware we lose our patience with her and that makes it worse. my parents have always been sort of low key bickery but recently it's like every weekend is them snapping at each other and with the best will in the world, even knowing she might not be able to help, some of the stuff she does is maddening - i guess sometimes it's akin to asking my kid to get something and him getting distracted by a penny half way through - like i get it! but also dude come on! i asked you to go get your shoes!i try and help by cooking but then she loiters in the kitchen looking lost and helpless and i feel bad because now i feel like i'm taking away the things that made her feel useful &gt;&lt;  i'm so sorry for the huge ramble, i am so so scared this is early onset like my nan and there's nothing we can do except watch it get worse. i don't know where to ask for help, i don't know how to get her to come get help, i can't even talk to my dad and sister properly because we're all skirting round the issue hoping the gel will work and she'll start getting back to 'normal'. and i'm looking at my dad who's so far the opposite you'd probably peg him as early 40s and just wondering what the fuck he's going to with my mum over the next decade and then the rest of his life if this does go 'worst case scenario' .  i'm hoping to find some information about how i could approach an appointment to discuss this - should i make one for me alone (can i even discuss someone else in an appointment for me?) should i take her with me and ask to speak to the dr alone for a moment, should i just straight up mention it in front of her?  does anyone have any hrt experience that could tell me i'm just being an impatient twat and to let it work or adjust it?   is it better for my dad (as her husband) to try and seek help?   are there any uk counselling services for this, or is going through the gp the best?   are there any things we could passively encourage her towards that might help her mentally in terms of activities/hobbies/clubs etc without her feeling to 'old' or 'helpless'?", u.k. science suggests drinking silicawater rich in silicic acid helps remove neurotoxic aluminium from the brain associated with neurological conditions like alzheimer’s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eaakqg/uk_mum_early_50s_possible_early_signs_of_early/,(UK) mum (early 50s) possible early signs of early onset dementia?
"i care for my wife's 96 year old grand mother, being a work from home engineer has allowed me to attend to her over the last 5 years but the last few months have been exceptional difficult as dementia has finally started to bare its teeth ( i am very thankful that it took this long to start affecting her but it still sucks)anyways... we are on a pretty consistent daily schedule, deviation usually leaves her confused or scared so we have settled into a pretty rock solid routine. unfortunately she has become increasingly frustrated with the news and doesn't want to watch it anymore, no biggie, i think its for the better but in her state she can't fill that time with anything else but more music. it is now becoming a little too repetitive for her. she will only really listen to old era music, bing crosby, franks sinatra, nat king cole etc (i've learned to love it)... but we need to be careful because shes prone to bouts of sadness triggered by music that is, well, sad. anywho, i am looking to try and incorporate some audio books into her routine but have not had much luck searching and finding recommendations. i have tried ""to kill a mocking bird"" and ""pride and prejudice"", two of her favorite books from here formidable years, but she struggles to comprehend the story lines, which leads to frustration. i am hoping to find some short stories that would be easily digestible, clear narrators, clean audio and most importantly subject matter that is engaging but not to emotionally triggering (subjective i know) she usually laments her lack of a partner, so anything that focuses too much on losing partners can trigger this grief, so we try to avoid the subject. if anyone has any recommendations for books or short story collections, in audio form, i would be very grateful. i believe adding audio books will be a great boon to her quality of life, i just need to find the right material to get her interested and then perhaps move back and try some of her favorite novels in audio form in the future. she says that she likes the audio books we have tried but they are to slow, she gets lost in all the detail and just wants things to happen, any enjoyment then gets lost in frustration.the format of the audio book doesn't matter, i will subscribe to any service (we already have audible and we use the public library audio book service as well) or purchase physical discs or tapes and digitize them for her music player. it's just finding the right books that is the hard part, like searching for a needle in a stack of needles. it will take some trial and error for sure but thought that i would enlist the help of the good ol reddit community, to maybe help point me in the right direction at least.thank you for listening and i, and my family, appreciate any help we could get.-michael", ernest seton thompson is worth looking at. his wildlife novels are observant and gripping with no excess drama. i remember seeing a couple of his books on audible.good old mark twain is also worth a look.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ea9a8w/looking_for_audio_book_recommendations_for_96yo/,Looking for Audio Book recommendations for 96yo Female

"so as i’ve said in previous posts i cared for my grandma for roughly 2 years up until recently. i watched her go from a sweet old woman to an angry, confused and nearly immobile person that i didn’t recognise by the end . she’s in care now and although i’m still struggling a bit with guilt and anxiety things were really starting to look up. she’s happy there and well cared for which is all i can ask for honestly. but then 2 days ago my dad called me and i knew something was wrong because me and my dad rarely talk on the phone, only text. my mind immediately assumed the worst and that someone had died. he called to say that he was worried about my nan (my other grandma/his mum) because she was forgetting a lot to the point where she couldn’t remember what she’d done 5 minutes prior. this isn’t normal for her and i know there can be a lot of reasons and causes for memory problems but as soon as i got off the phone with him i burst into tears. i haven’t seen her much at all lately (maybe twice in the past year) and part of that is my own fault, but it’s also not easy for me to get to her and on top of that i was caring for my other grandma who towards the end had such extreme anxiety that she couldn’t be left alone for more than a couple of minutes so trying to plan a visit was extremely tricky. not that any of these are an excuse i know. now i wish i’d tried harder, maybe i could’ve spotted the signs or helped in some way. i’ve always looked up to my nan, she’s such a strong and independent person and the complete opposite of my grandma, she’s positive, good humoured and so selfless. she’s lived alone for over 20 years and is almost 90. i’m hoping with all my strength that it’s just a uti or something else. just anything treatable. anything but dementia. she doesn’t deserve that after the life she’s lived. she’s got a doctors appointment soon so hopefully i’ll hear more this week, i’ll also be going to see her just before christmas with my dad.i just don’t want to see someone else that i love and have so many wonderful memories with lose themselves and their memories to this fucking bullshit disease again.", {{hugs}}  i know the feeling.  i wish i didn't but i do.  it's like living in a zombie apocalypse.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e9y51n/not_again/,Not again.

"in the last 6 months to a year, it has become increasingly obvious that my mother is suffering from memory problems. she routinely forgets conversations we've had in the recent past, as well as events and conversations from long ago. a couple of quick examples (though there are many more) are: &amp;#x200b;1. there is a story my grandfather told about a very notable event that happened in his farming community when he was a child. it has been told multiple times over the years, by many different family members, including my mother. when i recently brought this up (over the summer) she claimed to have never heard the story, nor recounted it herself (but i have a video of her talking about it 2 years ago!)  2. she has started to repeat things she's already told us, sometimes multiple times within a few hours. i first noticed it when we met up for lunch one afternoon and she recounted to me a long story from work that she had already told me via text earlier that week (this was a couple of months ago). just this past week, she repeated the same anecdote about a doctor's visit the same day we met for dinner, three times during the meal. &amp;#x200b;my grandmother (mother's mother) ended up being diagnosed with dementia (not alzheimers) in her early 70s, though she had probably been suffering from the symptoms for close to ten years before it was finally named. at the time it was attributed to her suffering from many ""mini strokes"" that were probably the result of her 50+ years of cigarette smoking. it eventually killed her at 78.my mother has not smoked a cigarette since the early 1990s. she is also extremely physically active several times a week and has been for close to 20 years (yoga, cross-training and running). she has a very high responsibility job (though planning to retire in 2020) and as far as i know, her memory issues don't seem to be affecting her professionally. it is only in personal interactions that i've noticed these issues.   how likely is it that this is the beginning of dementia? to be honest, i feel like i've been in a bit of denial about it; and am secretly hoping that someone will say ""it's normal for older people to become slightly forgetful and repeat themselves. it may not be dementia at all!"" she lives alone, so there is no one to monitor her behaviour and report back to me, but i do talk to her a few times a week and we usually get together on the weekends (i live about an hour's drive from her, have 2 kids and work full time, so it's not possible to see her more often.)i want to talk with my mother about what we've noticed, but i'm feeling stressed out about it and hoping that folks in this sub can help me figure out a way to broach the topic in a sensitive manner. i'd also be open to hearing from any other people who've dealt with this in their own family, especially with a parent, about what steps you can take with health care providers and if there are any treatments that can at least slow down the process.thanks in advance for any advice/commiseration."," in 2012, i became suspious that my dad could show indications for dementia. i made some memory tests/ memory games with him but pretended that zhis was just a game/ just for fun. i figured out that i could clearly see the difference between some ""normal"" forgetfulness and cognitive malfunctions. when my suspision got stronger, i made the watch test. i let him draw clocks showing different times. he failed, and from this point i was sure that it is dementia. he got his official diagnosis in 2014 or 2015. now, 2019, he needs heavy care.make some tests/ memory games. good chance that you get a clearer picture then",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e9brzs/my_40m_mother_65_is_having_problems_with_her/,"My (40M) mother (65) is having problems with her memory, and we have a family history of dementia.

"hi, i hope this isn't too long- i am new to reddit and just had the thought to search for dementia and ask for advice on my dad here.  he is 64, has had vascular dementia for 3 years. he can no longer work or drive. he is depressed and has never had many hobbies or much interest in social life or picking up new activities so it's very difficult to keep him entertained- i worry about him all the time, as he lives with my mum and i live a few hours away. he goes for a lot of walks every day, to the shops but also just around their neighbourhood. we are thankful because it keeps him physically healthy, but he has more and more issues as time goes on and i'm more and more concerned. he has heart issues now too, and will occasionally have severe chest pain which leaves him basically stuck to the spot in agony. he was attacked by a dog recently while walking. he has not yet got lost but we worry about that too. i got him a tomtom gps watch because it was waterproof and meant to have good battery and be quite resilient, but it only showed where he was whenever i could plug it into my laptop later- i couldn't find him if i ever decided to open the app and look. the watch broke within a year too because he's quite rough with watches i think.  he's never been a phone guy but i purchased a phone for him and a band to wear it like a belt, a shockproof case, etc so that i could just keep the phone connected to my account and track him plus we could call or he could call in an emergency. but he never announces when he will leave for a walk, so my mum can't remind him to take the phone with him, and when i have tried to test by calling it or have tried to get him to attempt calling with it, he's forgotten how to answer or make a call (i made it as simple as i could by having only the call option on the first screen for him but it still didn't work, i suppose because touch screens are a foreign idea to him). walking is still one of the only things he enjoys, one of the things that's good for him, and i just need to lessen some of my constant anxiety about him by knowing that we can find him if anything happens. does anyone have any ideas? bonus points if you can help me with any other activities to suggest getting him into that he could do around the home- he often potters about in the shed or garden but just sort of pulls weeds or gets big stones out of the driveway because he doesn't like gardening itself."," **apple series 4 or above smartwatch** - battery can  last 24 hours.  can act as a phone - very simple phone to use too.  let it be your mom that charges it.  she's the only one that takes the watch off him and the only one that puts it back on him.  the watch is waterproof so he can shower with it.  it will detect falls and also monitor heart rate for irregular heart beats (though apple doesn't say it will detect heart attacks or anything) - and then send you or your mom an alert.  you can use apples find my friends to locate him with your phone.**jiobit**- does he always wear the same jacket or belt?  if so, you can put this device in a pocket he doesn't usually use or attach it to his belt.  he should never be the one that is responsible for charging it or moving it in any way that way he doesn't misplace it somewhere.  the battery lasts 3 days to a week so your mom can just be the one who charges it at a set time and then put it back right afterward.  the cost of subscription is cheaper than a phone plan.

"my mother over the past few years has had symptoms of dementia that came on slowly and would get slightly worse slowly. it went from her saying a wrong name or forgetting maybe every 3rd visit to every second visit to every visit but that was over maybe 6 months. about 3 weeks ago my mom stopped wanting to eat. this was sudden. i usually stop at her favorite bakery and bring her a donut or fritter and she is happy and eats it right away. she refused to eat the bakery items. she also stopped watching tv. the tv used to be on 24/7 in her house.  again a few weeks before she was watching the animal and cooking shows she likes and then nothing. her confusion was so much worse. she says she tries to get out of bed and sit on the side of the bed and then she looks up and two hours went by and she does not know what happened. time seems to be a big confusion, suddenly she thinks it is night time and it is morning. she was sleeping constantly and complaining about dizzyness. her hygiene went downhill and she was not dressing properly for the weather or for modesty. she was having horrible time just walking around her house to go to the bathroom or get food. her walk was never fast before due to a bad knee replacement surgery but she could get around her home. i got her to agree to go to an urgent care and they sent her to the er. the er found fluid on her brain and the er doctor thought maybe something called normal pressure hydrocephelus? they admitted her and we live landlocked and there is only one neurologist and neurosurgeon for that hospital and for over 100 miles. the doctor said the fluid was not the issue, ran a few tests and wanted her to go to a rehab  facility to see if her self help skills, balance, walking etc could be improved. multiple people tried to talk her into this and she refused and we got the call she has checked herself out. i guess if she can answer like 5 question, her name, the president, her birthday where she is , they consider her ""okay"". my son was like why did they not ask her the time ! very true because i went to pick her up and she was upset because she thought it was night but it was 1pm and she was confused about the whole day's time frame. can she have really lose so much functioning in a few weeks. going from sitting and eating with you watching 90 day fiance (sometimes getting the couples names wrong or confused but still trying to interact)  to just not eating and starring at the wall? and having no interest in anything.  i have possible some serious surgery coming up, i am actually going to the surgeon in the morning to discuss it. myself and my husband and our kids (who cant drive) are the only caregivers. she has no friends and will not deal with any church help. she has good insurance and long term health care. should i try and get a second opinion about the fluid on the brain? travel is very hard , the closest second opinion is 120 miles away and it is a large city hospital that is overtaxed with patients and not the best choice but closest, the closest choices that would be research or university type hospitals are 300-400 miles. or is this just dementia getting worse rapidly?  the best way to describe it is like a horrible depression came on, she has no interest in anything, no desire to eat, and just sits there.thanks for any advice. i have a call into home health and i was able luckily on dec 7th able to make changes to her medicare so she will have more options for rehab/home health in 2020 before care before long term heath care can kick in. she had me sign paper long ago after my father passed about her medical care and end of life care. it was 25 years ago so i don't remember much. i do know she added my husband a few years ago. when i called medicare supplement plan they said they had me and my husband as authorized to make changes, and when i called for home health to come out and access her , they said i was listed to do that. i know before her last surgery she took out what she kept calling her pull the plug paperwork and went over her wishes and my husband and i were the 2 on that paper. i also had a checkbook to pay her bills with my name on it.  i put a call into her lawyer but it will be a few days. i do know the doctor said because she answered those 5 questions right, she had the choice to check herself out and i could not over ride it."," i think it depends on the type of dementia/alzheimers too. my dad has vascular dementia, caused by a small stroke, and occasionally will have another small stroke. with each stroke there is another rapid decline. of course i don't know for sure, but it's maybe possible she had a stroke and this started the first decline- the symptoms she shows were the same for my father. hygiene, eating, movement, lack of interest in regular activities, change in sleep pattern.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e81yx0/can_declines_happen_suddenly_or_is_this_something/,Can declines happen suddenly or is this something else?

"hi everyone,my grandma with dementia had a fairly sour marriage to say the least for most of her life, so she often gets stressed or worried about things from her past. doing an engaging activity is key to starting her day off right, keeping her brain active on positive things, and keeping worrying at bay for some time. however, finding activities she would enjoy  and engage in has been a struggle. she can't understand what she reads anymore, she has a hard time understanding crafts you put in front of her, and she doesn't follow along well with tv. i've tried a plethora of things that could trigger happy memories from her past, but she wasn't a big hobbyist so i'm running out of ideas. for some examples of what we've tried and where she's at: i've had her bake a pie with me and let her mix things, knead dough, and roll out one of the pie crusts. she didn't exactly enjoy being put to work but it did take her mind off things and the instructions were basic enough that she could follow along well. painting a simple sunflower was mentally challenging, and she needed me to point for each place to start and stop her brush. caused a bit of frustration at first but she kind of enjoyed it halfway through. she loooves loves loves listening to elvis, i can put him on for a good hour before she gets bored and she goes to town with foot tapping in her recliner. i was hoping some of you could share activities that you find to be engaging with your loved ones? we'd be more than happy to try just about anything.thank you for taking the time to read this","   i'm a little angry with merriam-webster! what does it mean when someone calls you ""demented""? according to the dictionary, demented: adjective. 1. suffering from dementia. (so far, i'm okay with that). *synonyms:* unbalanced, mentally ill, deranged, crazed, distracted, unhinged, insane, mad, mad as a hatter, etc. and, sadly, the uk isn't much help: *informal. british.* driven to behave irrationally due to anger, distress, or excitement. ""a demented, dangerous, and sadistic mafioso"". *synonyms:* mad, insane, deranged, out of one's mind, crazed, lunatic, unbalanced, etc. well, worldwide dictionaries, **i have dementia**. i am not, for the most part, a lunatic, crazed, unbalanced, insane or an ax murderer. yes, i like the godfather trilogy, but that does not make me a sadistic mafioso! i am a person with dementia. it sucks. but i am not demented. choose your words wisely, unlike merriam-webster.  for activities, remember: we are still us. whatever your grandma used to enjoy, she probably still does. flowers, looking through magazines, being creative through art or music or dance. listening to her favorite music or watching her favorite movies (like the godfather). cooking. yes, some of those activities require supervision depending on her stage of dementia, but doing the things she used to enjoy will stimulate her brain activity and slow the progression. i still enjoy doing medical research, gardening and even playing the piano. i'm not as good as it as i used to be and some days are better than others, but it's about the journey....not the destination.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e758f2/engaging_activity_ideas_for_demented_loved_one/,Engaging activity ideas for demented loved one?

"i wanted to post a story about something that happened to my dad last week.he has had caretakers for the past couple of years now that come once or twice a week to the house to take him to the gym or go run errands with my mom. after an incident with his previous, private caregiver missing appointments due to alcohol abuse, we settled on an agency who vets and trains their caregivers (big lesson learned there). as his condition has deteriorated, my mom noticed that he was getting a little testy with some of the female caregivers, he can normally be fairly flirty (saying she’s beautiful or wonderful) but in the last couple of months he started telling them to stop bossing him around and to keep their nose out of our private family matters - they were doing their job and we are very appreciative of these women for their help.my mom noticed that he seemed to respond well to a male caretaker who he had seen once or twice, so we asked the agency to send a male if they had one. right off the bat this guy didn’t seem very professional, he walked in the door and started playing with the dog while my mom continued to get my dad ready. after this first visit, my dad told us that “max (not his real name) asked me if i was gay.” this was strange and he couldn’t really answer our follow up questions, maybe he is remembering it wrong and he was the one who asked max if he was gay? we weren’t sure. the second time max left, last thursday, my dad reported some very strange interactions. including after showering max asked him if he would go to bed with him and asked him if he could give him a blowjob (never heard my dad say this word in my entire life). my dad was also saying that next time they would go to the bank so they could settle some kind of financial management situation they have together.alarm bells were going off for both of us. he said he was not touched or that anything else happened. but even if his account isn’t entirely accurate, we have never heard anything like this before. none of the women who have been with him have reported anything lewd or requested transfers, he’s mostly charming with them.of course, we reported this to the agency and their care coordinator said she would deal with it, and obviously he won’t be coming back to us. i just wanted to write this down, i don’t have a conclusion, it’s just one more thing to worry about now."," when we got my grandmother a caretaker the first thing i did was buy cameras for the house to put in the most active rooms. i try to put them in subtle places and they offer a option to record whats going on as well as talk through the camera. everything can be done through your phone. **yi 2 piece smart security system** is what it's called, it was like 60 bucks i believe. i definitely recommend it for anyone who is in a similar situation. it will give you some peace of mind and if anything is going on you can check on the person or just record whenever you are not around.. periodically throughout the day my mother and i will check the camera to make sure everything is good. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e6l7qg/wildly_inappropriate_caregiver_behavior/,Wildly Inappropriate Caregiver Behavior

"i've tried so many ways of writing this but it always ends up too long with too many unnecessary details of family history. essentially it's just this: i think my dad needs more help with mum. she is 66 and has alzheimer's. i'd say she is now moving into stage 6 so things like washing, dressing and going to the toilet are increasingly an issue. she is close to being incontinent. my dad is wonderful with her, but he is uncomfortable helping her with these intimate things and wants her to have bodily autonomy and independence - which is laudable really. she is too proud to ask him for help in this area. but she does let my sisters and i help her with washing and advise her with dressing and deal with toilet issues and emergencies. i bought her some pull ups but she will only wear them if my sisters and i encourage it. if my dad asks her she just says she is wearing them when she isn't: this happened yesterday, she ended up soiling herself and my younger sister and i cleaned her up, in a public park and then again at their home. she also hides soiled clothes in amongst her clean ones to avoid him finding out. we have had various emergencies in recent months, including her thinking one of my sisters was an imposter, and her going missing for 12 hours. i recently told my dad i feel like i should move closer to them as i am currently a 40 minute drive away and would rather be as close as possible. he seemed really happy and relieved at the thought. but now i'm thinking it might just be better (including financially) if i moved back in. for various reasons i haven't lived with them since i was 12, so this is a big decision. i also have anorexia, which is currently under control but nearly killed me just a few months ago. i'm doing okay, but i can't figure out how i would handle food stuff in their kitchen due to hygiene control obsessiveness. but i'm 100% sure that they need another adult in the house to help with washing, dressing and continence stuff. neither of my sisters can do it, one is overseas and both also live with long term boyfriends. and both my parents are really averse to getting carers in. so it would have to be me. i know it would be the right thing for them, but i'm not sure it would be the right thing for me or for my cat. i'm also about to finish my masters degree and wondering whether i should give up the idea of full time work when it's finished, or whether it would be better to continuing just tutoring so i'm making some money but have more time available for my parents. i just feel like my dad needs more help and i feel so guilty letting him deal with it on his own most of the time (i spend the day with her roughly 4 times a week at the moment). i don't know what to do. i want to help as much as possible and make life easier for them both. sorry this is so long. let me know your thoughts."," i moved from overseas back in with my parents for a year in a similar situation.there's no right or wrong answer, but it's important to remember that dementia is not a situation you can ""fix"", you just have manage it, and it will deteriorate. eventually your mother will need to be in a residential care facility (this is what we call them in australia), or you will need high level nursing care at home.both my parents have/had early onset illnesses. my dad was caring for my mum who has early onset dementia, but at 66 he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer - this presents basically like a super fast dementia, where he declined from normal competency to (bluntly) dead over 10 months.my sister moved in with mum and dad, but my father was a big guy and the tumour made him became paranoid and suicidal. he was also terrified of outsiders coming in to help him. mum at this stage could not cook and had very poor long term and short term memory, but she could still drive to maybe one or two locations and could wash and dress herself but would not be able to help my dad.after five weeks in a mental health hospital where the doctors were unable to stabilise my dad's mental state, we decided he needed to be in a residential aged care facility. i say this lightly now but it tore my heart in two at the time and we agonised over the decision. eventually, it was the realisation that we would need daily nursing care and significant modifications to the house (to allow for wheelchair access to bathrooms, etc) that swung us. as someone said, we'd spend months getting our house ready to look after him and he would likely die before we were done, and we would have spent those last months stressed and busy instead of spending time with dad.so, my sister moved out, and i moved back from overseas to live with my mum - i was in the very fortunate position to have a job that i could do remotely. however in hindsight, i should have quit or at least taken a significant portion of leave. your family is always more important than work, and trying to balance work with family made me resentful and stressed and feel like i was failing on both fronts.i lived with my mum for a year, until my dad died. while he was sick, mum would spend every day with him at the nursing home, where they fed her and effectively looked after her like at a dementia day care.when my dad died, my aunt and uncle offered to look after my mum in a different city. they are retired, with no grandchildren or other responsibilities. but even for them, it was only a few months before they suggested a residential aged care facility. i desperately wanted mum to come back and live with me - but in all honesty, it would be a full time job, i'm single and it is just my sister and me and we have no other family in our city. the australian aged care system pays family who are carers but it's a tiny amount, not enough to live on.mum moved into the same residential aged care facility as my father had been in. they are truly some of the most wonderful people i've ever met - good care does exist. it took me a long time to accept that mum wouldn't come home to me, and i think it was because i held up ""mum being at home"" as a perfect solution and ""mum being in care"" as a dismal second rate solution. but that's not the case - the both imperfect solutions to a distressing situation. in some ways mum would have been happier at home, but also in many ways she's happier in care - she always has people to talk to, she has a range of day care activities, and my sister and i sleep soundly knowing that there is someone there to help her any time of the day or night.so my takeaways are:- it was hard looking after my mum but i also cherish that time and don't regret it.- it is incredibly intense living with your parents again for both you and them -

(picture madea from tyler perry minus the guns)  some of the regular things that she usually does ever since i started for college was the following: - getting up at different times of the morning cleaning for no reason- raising a fuss over the littlest of things. - having mood swings where she is angry at one moment and she is content the next.- often be supicious about some stuff and tend to always accuse me of lying. she has however had her good days where she goes to work ok, shop and get groceries she needs, and is willing to travel 40+ miles if i am in need of something (as at the time, i was in college and 40 miles away) i am currently further away from getting my mfa and it has been almost a year since i visited her. my mom who is living with her usually has to deal with her attitude and whatnot, but i noticed something slightly differentsome of the noticeable changes were the following:-  i noticed she kept repeating questions like when i was going back and when i tell her when she corrects herself and even says that she thought it was one day when it was the next. - her normal tantrums were usual but were more frequently after she upgraded her flip phone to a smartphone. she was able to text easily but now we had to teach her to use the phone. nothing normal as i have seen most stories of grandparents adapting to technology. but whenever she ask for help she usually forgets how to do something and often get upset and ""wanting to take it back because the phone was not acting right""(she needed a google account to access certain things and she was complaining about that)- she can still drive and apparently an outstanding teacher for pre-k and elementary schools. she forgot to get certain things and often make frequent trips out of the house. - whenever she is not driving she gets impatient and wants to drive back home, often rushing us. - it was a few occasions where she talked to herself. i don't think too much of it, as this is something that i usually do myself but it's more frequent for her. - she seems to thrive off of starting drama and hyping on it but lately, it's been more frequent. my mom, uncle and i were talking about this and we was wondering if she was developing the signs as my late great grandmother develop signs around her age (she is 65 and my great grandmother was in her first stages around 67). one thing for sure some of her actions mirrored her mother as my greatgrandmother loves to dump a bunch of sugar into things while my grandmother likes things sour and salty (while she did most of the cooking, my mom and i avoided her cooking because of the amount of salt it was in there. my mom is a diabetic so it would affect her while it made me gag eating something that taste like ocean water. i wanted to ask if these signs is what we should be worried about or should we keep observing and keeping a close eye. my family is normally the type to reach out to people but i wanted to see if there was a way to catch on to it before she winds up hurting herself driving, or at her job, etc. while i am away for grad school, i pretty much handle everything financially to help out while my mom and uncle is there with her."," it could be many things but possibly.try to help her reduce frustrations. what coping methods does she already have to remember how to do things? find a way to use that.for example, my grandfather made a book of notes and step by step instructions on how to do things like turn the computer on and send an email. the key points were that he always knew where his instructions were; it was like his recipe book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e565iu/is_my_grandmother_showing_signs_of_dementia_if/,Is my grandmother showing signs of dementia if she's repeating herself?

"although ""[dementia]( is often used interchangeably with terms such as alzheimer's disease or memory loss, it is actually an umbrella category of brain diseases that comprise more than 100 types of memory disorders.[dementia]( refers to a collection of symptoms that signal cognitive declines, such as short-term memory loss, language deficits, poor judgment, and changes in behavior.while [alzheimer's]( disease is the most common form of dementia, comprising 50 to 70 percent of all dementia diagnoses, some of the other forms of dementia we will focus on today include:* lewy body dementia (lbd)* frontotemporal dementia* vascular dementia* parkinson's disease dementia (pdd)it's important to understand the most prevalent types of dementia so you can begin to recognize the signs your loved one is exhibiting, arrange a medical assessment, and prepare for a potential move to a memory care community.## what is alzheimer's disease?neuropathologist aloysius alzheimer first identified the disease that bears his name in 1901. the most common form of dementia, alzheimer's disease (ad) currently affects 5.8 million americans, and this number is projected to reach 14 million by 2050.while many people assume [memory loss]( is a normal part of aging, alzheimer's disease is not inevitable. as we age, it may become more difficult to recall someone's name, and you may tend to misplace your reading glasses or leave your shopping list at home. but these forgetful moments are usually attributed to age-related memory loss and not necessarily signs of impending alzheimer's disease.part of the confusion around alzheimer's disease arises from the challenge in diagnosis. like lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia, alzheimer's disease can't be determined with complete accuracy while someone is alive.the biomarkers for ad — sticky plaques and tangles that accumulate in the brain from abnormally folded proteins, causing inflammation and cellular damage — can only be positively identified on autopsy. thus, doctors generally make an alzheimer's diagnosis by testing for and eliminating other possibilities.## what are the signs and symptoms of alzheimer's disease?ten signs and symptoms that a senior's memory loss might be alzheimer's include:1. disruptive memory loss. the inability to retain new information, forgetting important events, or needing to put reminder notes everywhere indicate a problem.2. problem-solving difficulties. mom can no longer follow a recipe she knows by heart, or dad can't balance the checkbook.3. getting lost driving to a familiar location.4. temporal or seasonal confusion: is it spring already?5. challenges with visual or spatial relationships: how far away is that sign?6. vocabulary issues: having trouble finding common words, such as calling a toaster, ""the thing that makes bread dark.""7. odd misplacement. it's one thing to leave your keys in a different room; quite another to place them in the freezer or dishwasher.8. loss of judgment. giving money to phone scammers, neglecting to bathe.9. social withdrawal.10. personality changes: confusion, anxiety, suspicion, fear. someone in the early stages of ad may become easily upset when out of their comfort zone.## what is the treatment for someone with alzheimer's disease?as with all types of dementia, and other health conditions in general, good nutrition, exercise, social engagement, mental stimulation and lifestyle choices that nurture the body, mind, and spirit may delay, slow the progression, or even prevent the onset of alzheimer's disease.let's examine them in turn:* healthy eating. here at the kensington place, fine dining is the cornerstone of our first-rate memory care. our culinary craftsman, tony ng, is devoted to delivering a mealtime experience that each senior will savor, not only for the delicious and nutritious cuisine but also for the presentation and variety. while heavily processed foods laden with sugar, salt and preservatives can actually [induce or increase memory loss]( the healthy meals tony prepares contain [memory-boosting foods]( such as leafy greens, cold-pressed olive oil, and mouth-watering salmon.* exercise. our life enrichment programs are renowned for offering an ever-changing calendar of events to residents seven days a week, from morning till evening. whether it's walking, dancing, yoga, or stretching, we encourage our residents to keep their bodies moving, which also [boosts brain health](* social engagement. building friendships and staying active has been shown to reduce stress, preserve wellness, keep the mind sharp, and increase feelings of worth, especially for seniors. and the bay area is [one of the best locations]( in the country for staying active, with parks, museums, classes, art galleries…there's something to interest everyone!* mental stimulation. while our life enrichment coordinators work full time with our core team to keep our senior residents active and engaged, there is a lot of options seniors can choose to do on their own to challenge their brains. solving puzzles and math problems, reading, and learning a new skill such as surfing the web, help light up the brain, decrease the buildup of plaque, and [keep alzheimer's at bay](## what is lewy body dementia (lbd)?up until a few years ago, lewy body dementia (lbd) was not a familiar term to the general public. even mds weren't necessarily familiar with it unless they specialized in geriatrics or neurology.however, lewy body dementia gained widespread attention in 2014, after beloved comedian and actor [robin williams]( chose to take his own life rather than slowly succumb to the disease.lewy body dementia is the second most common dementia after alzheimer's, accounting for up to a third of all cases, according to autopsy reports. there is not yet a cure, and symptoms tend to worsen over time.lbd comprises a spectrum of diseases involving an array of dementia and motor symptoms. identifying lewy body dementia can be challenging, because its pathology is similar to that of alzheimer's, while many symptoms appear to mimic parkinson's.however, there are notable distinguishing characteristics. unlike people with alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia, patients with lbd exhibit:* strong psychotic symptoms (hallucinations)* extreme sensitivity to antipsychotic medications* day-to-day symptom variabilityin addition, lewy body dementia is twice as common in men as in women (alzheimer's occurs equally in both genders) and is rarely genetically linked.## what are lewy bodies?lewy bodies are abnormal structures in the midbrain: microscopic protein deposits found in nerve cells that disrupt the brain's normal functioning, causing it to slowly deteriorate. frederick lewy, a colleague of aloysius alzheimer (for whom alzheimer's disease is named) first discovered them in 1912.while the presence of lewy bodies in the mid-brain has long been recognized as the hallmark of parkinson's disease, in the 1960s lewy bodies were discovered in the cortex (the brain's outer layer) of people with dementia.people with lewy body disease have lewy bodies in both the midbrain and cortex. lewy body disease patients often have the plaque characteristic of alzheimer's disease, while people with alzheimer's may also have cortical lewy bodies. this overlap leads to frequent misdiagnosis.## what are the signs and symptoms of lewy body dementia?many of the symptoms of lewy body dementia bear a striking resemblance to alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia. however, a physician familiar with lbd will be alert to the following signs that the illness is in fact lbd:* mental decline: reduced alertness and lowered attention span* visual hallucinations, usually related to people or animals. these hallucinations occur in 80 percent of lbd patients, often at night.* poor response to antipsychotic medications known as neuroleptics, which are usually given to people with mental health problems. in the case of an lbd patient, however, this class of drugs may actually amplify rigidity and confusion, and can even cause sudden death.* increasing problems handling the tasks of daily living* repeated falls* sleep disturbances, including insomnia and acting out dreams* delusions or depression* fluctuations in autonomic processes, including blood pressure, body temperature, urinary difficulties, constipation, and difficulty swallowing.if a patient exhibits some of the above symptoms, the additional presence of parkinson's motor symptoms can help facilitate a lewy body dementia diagnosis. these include:* tremors* muscle stiffness* difficulties with balance* shuffling gait, stooped posture, slow movements* restless leg syndrome.some of the cognitive symptoms found in both alzheimer's and lewy body dementia patients include:* behavioral changes* decreased judgment* confusion and temporal/spatial disorientation* difficulty following directions* decreased ability to communicate.since the lewy bodies themselves can only be identified by autopsy, accurate diagnosis relies heavily on physician awareness of the defining characteristics of the disease. a brain scan can detect mental deterioration, but not the actual lewy bodies.a thorough medical history that focuses on the pattern of symptoms and looks particularly for the hallucinations and sleep disturbances that are common to lbd patients is the optimal route for diagnosis, once other possible conditions have been ruled out.## what is the treatment for someone with lewy body dementia?being diagnosed with an incurable illness, especially one that involves dementia, can be an overwhelming experience. because lbd is a multi-system disease, with [treatment]( focusing primarily on symptom management, it's helpful to take as proactive an approach as possible from the outset. this means working with your physician to:* become informed. learn as much as you can about lewy body dementia and how it may affect your loved one, given the senior's health history, age, and lifestyle.* strengthen the senses. have your loved one's doctor evaluate each of his or her five senses — sound, sight, touch, taste, and smell — in order to identify and treat any abnormalities. then ask about exercises to improve them. by challenging themselves to enhance their senses, seniors will boost both mental and physical capabilities.* manage symptoms with behavioral changes. one example of symptom management in lbd involves low blood pressure (hypotension), a common lewy body dementia symptom that can lead to falls. to help stabilize blood pressure and minimize the risk of fall-related injuries, someone with lbd needs to:   * stay hydrated   * exercise   * avoid prolonged bed rest   * stand up slowly.* choose medications prudently. the potential benefits of any medication need to be carefully balanced with possible side effects that may occur. in people with lbd, the treatments for hallucinations, delusions, and behavioral disturbance tend to make the parkinson's symptoms worse; treating the parkinson's symptoms can make the delusions and behavior problems worse. however, depression and sleep disorders can and should be treated with medications that the patient can safely tolerate.## what research is being done on lewy body dementia?the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), a division of the national institutes of health, conducts and supports research on a wide array of dementia-related diseases, including lewy body dementia. the goal is to [learn more]( about diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of lbd. researchers are also exploring the lewy bodies themselves, in an effort to understand the mechanisms of disease formation and progression.one [study that made recent headlines]( used a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to diagnose lbd in living persons, with a high degree of accuracy. up until now, the only way to prove someone's symptoms were lewy body dementia was via a brain autopsy.## what is frontotemporal dementia?first described by arnold pick in 1892 and originally called pick's disease, [frontotemporal dementia]( (ftd) encompasses six types of dementia involving the frontal (behind your forehead) or temporal lobes (behind your ears).ftd causes the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control speech and behavior, to slowly atrophy, leading to an irreversible decline in mental functioning over a period of years.according to the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke, the following conditions are currently grouped together as frontotemporal dementias:* pick's disease,* primary progressive aphasia,* semantic dementia.while up to seven million americans may be afflicted with ftd, pick's disease accounts for just five percent of all progressive dementias. it is frequently misdiagnosed in the early stages as depression, mental illness or alzheimer's disease, because of the manner in which symptoms initially appear.## what causes frontotemporal dementia?as in lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia is the result of a build-up of protein in the affected areas of the brain. the accumulation of abnormal brain cells eventually leads to changes in character, socially inappropriate behavior, and poor decision making, progressing to severe impairment in intellect, memory, and speech.frontotemporal dementia typically strikes adults between the ages of 40 and 60 and is slightly more common in women than in men. while the cause is still unknown, there is a strong genetic component: about a third of ftds are hereditary.## what are the signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia?because the frontal lobes affect behavior and emotional response, people with ftd will usually show signs of changes in personality before they manifest evidence of dementia. this may begin as impulsiveness or a lack of inhibition. while the progression of symptoms in ftd is fortunately slow, symptoms do worsen over time.the following symptoms are typical of patients with frontotemporal dementia. more severe symptoms will appear in later stages of the illness:## behavioral changes* impulsivity* obsessive/compulsiveness (e.g., overeating or only eating one type of food)* drinking alcohol to excess (when not previously a problem)* rudeness or impatience, leading to aggression* poor judgment* withdrawal or seclusion* inability to function or interact in social situations* inability to hold a job* lack of attention to personal hygiene* sexual exhibitionism or promiscuity## emotional changes* abrupt mood changes* lack of warmth, concern, or empathy* indifference to events or to one's environment* easily distracted; difficulty maintaining a line of thought* unaware of the changes in behavior* decreased interest in personal care## language changes* reduced quality of speech: shrinking vocabulary, difficulty finding a word* difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia)* repeating words others say (echolalia)* weak, uncoordinated speech sounds* decreased ability to read or write* complete loss of speech (mute)## neurological/physical problems* increased muscle rigidity or stiffness* difficulty moving about* lack of coordination* general weakness* memory loss* urinary incontinence## how is frontotemporal dementia diagnosed?as with lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementias can only be conclusively determined by a post-mortem examination of the brain. careful symptomatic evaluation, together with brain scans and eegs, are the best methods currently available for reaching a probable diagnosis. these techniques can help ascertain whether the presenting condition is likely to be ftd or a related disorder, such as alzheimer's disease.if at least three of the following five distinguishing characteristics are present in the early stages, the diagnosis is likely to be ftd rather than alzheimer's:* onset before age 65* initial personality changes* loss of normal controls, e.g., gluttony, hypersexuality* lack of inhibition* roaming behavior.also, as compared with alzheimer's disease, obvious mental impairment and memory loss occur later in frontotemporal dementia patients than in alzheimer's patients.## what is the treatment for frontotemporal dementia?while there is no specific treatment for ftd, a [supportive environment]( can yield surprising bright spots. for example, at the university of california/san francisco medical center's memory and aging center, doctors discovered a small group of frontotemporal dementia patients who [developed new creative skills]( in music and art. the artistic talents emerged when the brain cell loss occurred predominantly in the left frontal lobe, which controls functions such as language.as the ability to communicate through words declined, these patients' brains somehow accessed other realms of self-expression. so exploring and encouraging the development of latent skills is one way in which ftd patients can maintain their quality of life, and possibly slow the progress of mental deterioration.in addition, consider the following steps to help manage the symptoms of ftd:* sensory function aids, such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, etc.* behavior modification that rewards positive behaviors* speech therapy and/or occupational therapy* medication to control behaviors that can be dangerous to oneself or others. antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) may offer some relief from apathy and depression, and help reduce food cravings, loss of impulse control and compulsive activity.## what research is being done on frontotemporal dementias?the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), and other branches of the national institutes of health conduct regular research related to frontotemporal dementia. they also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. their goal is to learn more about the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and possible prevention of pick's disease and other ftds.the ninds is currently recruiting patients for a number of [clinical trials]( that will explore various treatments for the frontotemporal dementias, including pick's disease and primary progressive aphasia, as well as related dementias.## what is vascular dementia?conditions that commonly occur as we age, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, block the arteries and impede blood flow to the brain, creating what is known as [vascular dementia](if vital oxygen and nutrients can't reach the brain easily, parts of the brain die. this is called an infarct and is similar to what happens in a heart attack, or myocardial infarction. when brain tissue dies, the person begins to exhibit signs of cognitive impairment.while nearly as common as alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia remains under-diagnosed, in part because the symptoms mimic many other conditions.## what are the signs and symptoms of vascular dementia?the signs and symptoms of vascular dementia can look remarkably similar to those of other dementias.## physical symptoms include:* tremors (common in parkinson’s disease dementia and lbd)* leg or arm weakness* balance problems (common in ftd)* shuffling steps (common in most dementias)* loss of bladder or bowel control (common in many dementias in the later stages)## mental symptoms include:* sluggish thinking and forgetfulness (common to all dementias)* hallucinations and delusions (common in lbd)* depression and irritability (common in alzheimer's)* personality changes (common in parkinson's disease dementia and ftd)* confusion (common to all dementias)## behavioral symptoms include:* language problems and slurred speech (common in ftd)* inappropriate emotional response (common in most dementias)* difficulty planning or following instructions (common in alzheimer's and most dementias)* becoming lost in familiar surroundings (common to most dementias).## what is the treatment for someone with vascular dementia?although there is currently no cure for vascular dementia, by addressing the factors that lead to mini-strokes, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, a senior may be able to arrest or even reverse some symptoms, preventing memory loss and the need for memory care.treatment modalities such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help someone with vascular dementia to regain some or all lost functions following a stroke. in addition, some of the medications used to treat the cognitive symptoms of alzheimer's disease appear to work for vascular dementia as well, since many of the symptoms overlap.what is most important is minimizing the risk of having additional strokes, which will worsen vascular dementia symptoms.as with alzheimer's treatment suggestions, the best course of action is positive lifestyle changes. someone exhibiting signs of vascular dementia would be well advised to:* quit smoking* maintain their optimal weight* eat healthfully* reduce salt intake to manage blood pressure* reduce alcohol consumption* engage in moderate exercise* stay socially active* stimulate their brain with puzzles, games, reading, and other mental activities that help keep the mind sharp.## what is parkinson's disease dementia?parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is chronic and progressive. the hallmarks include muscle tremors, stiff or rigid movement, gait and balance problems, and cognitive impairment. non-motor symptoms can include difficulty sleeping, constipation, anxiety, depression, and fatigue.approximately one million americans are living with parkinson's disease. one of the better-known advocates for parkinson's research is actor michael j. fox of ""back to the future"" fame. now in his late 50s, fox was diagnosed with parkinson's disease at just 29. while most people develop symptoms after age 50, fox is one of the 10-20 percent with [early onset parkinson's disease](though parkinson's disease dementia (pdd) affects only 20-30 percent of parkinson's patients in the early stages of the disease, cognitive decline tends to become apparent as the disease progresses and the brain changes that parkinson's causes gradually spread, affecting memory and judgment.## what causes parkinson's disease dementia (pdd)?abnormal microscopic protein deposits of alpha-synuclein, whose normal function is not yet known, lead to parkinson's disease dementia. these deposits are known as lewy bodies, after frederick h. lewy, the neurologist who discovered them while working with neuropathologist aloysius alzheimer in the early 1900s.although parkinson's disease dementia is [one of the lewy body dementias]( (lbd), it is not to be confused with dementia with lewy bodies, which can include alzheimer's or vascular dementia (see below). lewy bodies are found in both brain disorders (pdd and lbd), which indicates that they may be linked to the same underlying abnormalities in brain processing.additionally, many people diagnosed with either parkinson's disease dementia or lewy body dementia also have the plaques and tangles that are the biomarkers of alzheimer's disease.## what are the signs and symptoms of parkinson's disease dementia?although researchers and physicians typically focus on the movement disorders that define parkinson's disease, loved ones observe personality changes in those who are developing parkinson's disease dementia.as the american parkinson disease association (apda) notes, the concept of a ""[parkinson personality]( is controversial, because the idea that disease could alter who we are makes us uncomfortable. however, states the apda, ""there is no question that the brain is changing because of parkinson's disease. because a substantial part of our personality relies on our brain function, it is not a stretch of logic to ask if a changing brain produces a changing personality.""## what is the treatment for parkinson's disease dementia?there are presently no treatments to arrest brain cell damage in parkinson's disease dementia; however, memory care focuses on reducing and relieving symptoms.the kensington place redwood city is uniquely positioned to care for residents with various types of dementia, including parkinson's disease dementia. our extensive team of health care professionals, as well as our alliances with community senior care programs and resources, make the kensington your premier partner in providing unsurpassed memory care for your loved one.because exercise remediates many age-related physical and mental health conditions, our community offers some parkinson's-specific programs. one example is energized fitness for parkinson's, in partnership with the [parkinson foundation]( and [genesis rehab](research shows that various forms of exercise, such as treadmill training, dance, stationary bicycle training, tai chi, and cognitive training combined with motor training involving stretching and strengthening exercises have been effective in promoting the [preservation or improvement of cognitive function]( in patients with parkinson's disease. treadmill training showed the most improvements.the kensington has also sponsored webinars on parkinson's disease dementia, such as [abc's of dbs (deep brain stimulation)]( in which board-certified neurosurgeon zachary levine, md, shares powerful, practical information about how this new technology can help seniors with memory loss due to pdd.## memory care as individual as your loved oneat the kensington place redwood city, we're committed to providing an optimal life experience for each of our memory care residents. memory care is our sole focus, which is why we have thoughtfully designed a memory

(she thinks she still lived at her old house and it’s 1990). she was checked into the hospital and is still there. she knows all of us family members, she knows how old she is, but she has no idea where she lives, she thinks things that aren’t true. the doctors don’t know why this is happening yet, but they told us it’s either from a uti infection/medication she is on or dementia. the strangest thing is how sudden it was. although my grandma isn’t physically the best, she’s always been sharp. we’re all very scared especially my mom and me. i really hope she isn’t stuck like this. it’s so scary and we miss her she really isn’t herself"," my grandma would have episodes like this but she also had ongoing signs of dementia. in my grandma's case, i believe the episodes were not from the dementia, but i believe they were attacks of dilerium from low blood sugar. i realized this when i walked in to her room one day and she thought she was back at work at her job from 25 years ago. i got her back in bed and gave her juice and some cookies and shortly thereafter she was normal again. the dementia would cause her to forget to eat or neglect to eat on her own and i think that is what was precipitating it. a cna or lvn now feeds her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e40h0s/sudden_dementia_advice/,Sudden dementia? advice?

"hi guys, my father has had dementia for around five years now. he's very amiable and polite and in the grand scheme of things very easy to look after. he is, however, very hard to keep entertained. he was a huge reader and avid film watcher when well but now seriously struggles to stick with a book or follow the narrative of a film and it makes him very frustrated. he was never one for daytime television and that hasn't changed at all. he's unable to work the remotes to switch the tv on or off let alone pick something to watch so if we need to get on with something in a different part of the house we tend to pop him in front of an old movie. as i said, he can't follow the narrative anymore, falls asleep during a love scene and wakes up during a gun fight, gets confused and tries to switch off the tv. he just spends a huge amount of his day incredibly bored and when he gets bored he starts getting destructive. he'll start taking appliances apart and generally fiddling with anything that catches his eye. however, recently, we've been putting on ken burns documentaries for him to watch. he loves them and i think i have figured out why. the voice over narration is consistent and mellow. visually they largely consist of still photographs and old footage. my father finds them very easy to follow and if he does fall asleep and wake up in front of one, the aforementioned audio and visuals don't make him feel like he's fallen asleep during one film and woken up during another. they seem to really soothe and relax him. the subjects covered like the american civil war and the old west are of particular interest to men of a certain age. just being able to sit down and follow something and enjoy something is immensely valuable to him. it boosts his confidence and gives his own mind a break from fretting about the usual things (money, keys, ""what's going on?""). it just gives me and the rest of the family an opportunity to nip upstairs or to the garden for 30 minutes to do something without worrying that he'll be getting up to mischief. films, books and learning were his hobbies and it's such a relief to find something he can enjoy.there are quite few ken burns documentary series on netflix here in the uk and i'm sure american people here grew up on these and would be able to find them easily.anyway, i hope someone finds this useful.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e3cz6p/thank_god_for_ken_burns/,Thank God for Ken Burns.

"hello everyone, this is going to be a bit of a write up so bear with me please.for the past year or so my grandmother has been exhibiting minor short term memory loss, it became noticeable because my mother and her were  marathoning a t.v show together, after they finished watching the entire series my grandmother wanted to watch it again, and treated it as if she had never seen it before.long story short, her and my mother wound up re-watching the show continuously for the past year, my mother was bored out of her mind but my grandmother always acted like it was the first time she was seeing it.this, compounded by other minor signs of memory loss led my mother and my grandmothers sister to try and talk to her about it. in most instances, my grandmother reacted with anger (kind of a how dare you attitude) but after a little deliberation they finally convinced her to see a doctor.this is where things get kind of weird, even though my grandmother had been showing signs of short-term memory loss she was still highly functional, and capable of living on her own and generally taking care of herself. she went to her doctors appointment, and in the interview process alone the doctor determined that she probably was suffering from the early onset of dementia. but for my grandmother, it was like she completely lost all cognitive ability after this doctors appointment, in a matter of days she went from being mostly self-sufficient with short-term memory loss to not even knowing  where she was, sometimes when she talks to me or my mother now, she’ll pause and ask us if we’re really there or if she is hallucinating.she gets these weird things in her head, and she’ll make really weird statements like she told my mom “when i die just leave me here to rot, you don’t need to go to the trouble of burying me” or she also once told my mom that her brother in law told her she was gonna die a long and painful death, because the drs would never give her pain medication, first of all this is completely imagined and fabricated within her mind, her brother-in-law would never tell her something like that, and when my mom explained to her that wouldn’t happen and hospitals have medication they give people in their final days and moments she just became argumentative with my mom.she refuses to eat unless somebody’s eating with her, and even then whoever’s eating with her has to basically gorge themselves with food to get her to eat just a normal serving as she watched you like a hawk and only takes bites when you’re cramming food down your throat.i don’t know the full extent of things yet, but i know that she’s become kind of aggressive and argumentative with my mom, this is very out of character for her as she has always been the sweetest person.i guess the thing that i’m struggling with most right now, is that she had such a drastic change so quickly after being told that this is probably what it was. can dementia progress in a matter of days? i’m not kidding when i say it went from being very minor memory loss, to full on confusion and hallucinations in a matter of days. today i’m meeting with my parents and we’re going to move my grandmother in with them so she can have mostly consistent monitoring and care.i’m just takin a back right now, i have not had time to process what is going on. everything i have read says that dementia generally progresses over the course of 8 to 10 years and some people have even lived upwards of 20 years with it, but that doesn’t seem to fit the case now with my grandmother, she has gone from fully functional to needing basically 24 hour care in a matter of a couple of days.have any of you had a similar experience with the progression process?thanks for any responses."," i’m not a doctor but have a small amount of experience with dementia and a big big trigger for decline can be stress. if she is forgetting whole shows right after watching there may have been other earlier signs that were missed. she however was probably aware that things weren’t right but definitely couldn’t figure it out, she might’ve just thought ‘that’s getting older’ with her awareness of something not being right and then having the doctor tell her she has dementia she probably got very emotional. emotion is harder to forget and can have a really big effect on someone. my grandmother recently lost her best friend. she passed away and none of us knew and she instantly went into a decline. the week before i was talking to my sister about how clear she was, she was remembering things i had said earlier in the day, that certain people were coming over. the second she found out about her friend she went into overload.she was asking if i was her grandson, she was asking my cousin if she was going to have children (she’s married and has two teenagers who are out 3-4 times a week). it was so sudden and so drastic and sometimes all it takes for a decline. dementia sucks because people can be going along fine and on a nice plateau then all of a sudden they are in a decline and it can really seem like night and day. you gran is going to go through these declines and they happen fast or slow or sometimes it seems like over night. get her mind off of things, go shopping, go to the cinema, anything she likes to do or has enjoyed that don’t take too much problem solving. it’s hard and she’s so happy you are there for her even if it doesn’t seem like it. it’s not going to get easier and i’m not saying that as a reprimand. just prepare yourself that it won’t, it’s a horrible disease to watch it’s very confusing and can really take it’s toll on you. it’s going to happen fast and slow, sometimes overnight sometimes it takes months. stay strong and take care of yourself.dementia carers need care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e36e12/my_grandmother_73_was_recently_diagnosed_with/,My grandmother (73) was recently diagnosed with early onset Dementia and I am looking for some answers about the progression of this disease.

"i lost my paternal grandfather to dementia. he had it for 10 years. i lost my paternal grandmother to an inoperable brain tumor. she died a year before him.now, my maternal grandfather has dementia. my grandmother tried to hide it from the family. i eventually got her to tell the family. they lived in their house for 6 months after his diagnosis (2 years after the onset, doctors ignored her telling them he wasn't right). they now live at my parents' house. almost 3 years ago, i got very ill. my spouse and i moved back to my parents' house about 18 months ago. i have a degenerative genetic disease.so, there's 6 of us in this house. grandfather has no idea who anyone is. he insists on being near my grandmother at all times. but he yells at her and treats her like shit. he was never like this before dementia. he never had a mean bone in his body. grandmother refuses to let us help her. refuses to ask for assistance. and she's burned out. she's seriously depressed. she says some absolutely fkd up things. to him, to us, and about herself. it seems like she's going out of her way to try to make everyone hate her. she was my best friend. she always had my back and always loved me and supported me. we had a special relationship. she was never easy to get along with, she's rather abrasive, but she wasn't like that to me. now, both of my remaining grandparents are shells. i knew i'd lose him when this started. i didn't know it would cost me her, too.she refuses to go to a support group, see a therapist, or even see her primary doctor. i think she knows there's something physically wrong with her and she's trying to hide it from us. idk what it is but she's very aggressive about any question or concern about her health. she needs a therapist, at the very least, but i can't convince her to go. she's exhibiting a lot of behaviors and gestures typically associated with someone who plans to commit suicide, but can also be brushed off as things old people do, like giving things away, not making any future plans, etc.i don't know what to do. we're all stuck here, my parents are doing their best. but i am destroyed. i'm physically doing very poorly and emotionally devastated. i had no idea this would be so ugly. i really just want to be able to talk to my grandmother, but she's impossible. i miss her. she's making this a very toxic environment. it's taking it's toll on everyone here. we're all at a loss for any way to remedy this. sorry for the rambling. i just needed to get this off my chest.", call the alzheimers hotline at  **800.272.3900.  it's open 24/7.**  they can talk to you what is happening better than we can here.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e29wch/this_is_destroying_my_family/,This is destroying my family

"the term ‘dementia’ is an umbrella term used to describe the symptoms of cognitive impairment.  and within the dementia umbrella, there are many different variations - alzheimer’s included.  most of us average folk don’t realize that all dementia is not alzheimer’s.  in fact, i would venture to say that the regular layman isn’t quite sure what the difference between alzheimer’s and dementia is.  don’t fret - i’ll explain it here!learning the difference between the varying levels of memory loss can be crucial to know [the do's and don'ts of dealing with behavior challenges. ]( will also come into play with [understanding the levels of care]( that are available to fit your loved one's needs, so they can live more comfortably.in this blog we will discuss the top 4 most common types of dementia. the good news for you is that at the kensington, we are very experienced with these areas of [memory care]( and more. *we welcome everyone!*1. **alzheimer’s disease.**  this is the most common type of dementia. i like to describe alzheimer’s as a slow process of going backwards in time. while it begins with short term memory loss (and thus, repeating oneself- because the person doesn’t remember what has just happened or what they’ve just said), the person essentially goes back to earlier days, because the days of the present are no longer remembered. long term memory remains strong while short term memory evaporates. this explains why someone ‘doesn’t recognize’ their spouse, for example. if the resident feels and believes that they are now 50 years old instead of 90, and a gray haired gentleman tells her that he is her husband, she may reject the idea vehemently. people with alzheimer’s demonstrate trouble with thinking and reasoning, and may have little or no orientation to time. they live in the present- emotionally- and may do things that make no sense at all. the process of alzheimer’s has been divided into 7 stages which begin with simple confusion and in later stages the person has lost significant abilities (to swallow, for example) and full time care is needed.2. **lewy body dementia** (or dementia with lewy bodies).  lewy body dementia is another very common, yet frequently misdiagnosed, or undiagnosed type of dementia. a simplified explanation for what lbd looks like is that it is described as a combination of parkinson’s symptoms with alzheimer’s symptoms. the stiffness or rigidity typically associated with parkinson’s combines with the cognitive decline associated with alzheimer’s. in addition to these outward traits, one of the primary identifying factors of lbd is visual hallucinations. the hallucinations typically are of smaller people (children) or animals, and are not upsetting to the person with lbd. problems with sleep patterns – waking throughout the night or the acting out of dreams are other identifying factors. people with lewy body also experience fluctuating cognition- meaning that they can have moments or periods of clarity, and make complete sense- followed by other times of confusion and nonsensical thinking. lewy body dementia causes its victims to be extremely sensitive to anti-psychotic medications which can typically help those with either parkinson’s or alzheimer’s. these medications can create potentially fatal conditions for those with lbd.3. **vascular dementia.**  this type of dementia- which is sometimes called “post stroke dementia” is quite different from alzheimer’s or lewy body dementia. vascular dementia is actually brain damage traced to cardiovascular problems, or mini-strokes that caused bleeding or harm in the brain. the most outstanding symptoms that identify vascular dementia are when drastic changes occur immediately following a stroke. changes can be in personality, thinking or reasoning- all depending on the area of the brain that has been affected. trouble with paying attention, organizing thoughts, or analyzing situations can all be symptoms of vascular dementia. so simply put, vascular dementia presents itself mostly through cognitive changes, which are the result of brain damage. the use of medications has been shown to prevent or slow further brain damage, therefore control the progress of vascular dementia.4. **fronto temporal dementia.**  ftd occurs when there is deterioration to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. the person experiences problems with language, and significant changes in their personality and behavior. where the temporal lobe affects how one behaves or reacts in the world, based on outward input- the frontal lobe has to do with cognitive and emotional processes, and voluntary movement. the executive functions of the brain including planning, judging, or analyzing are all housed in the frontal lobe. when someone has ftd, they slowly withdraw into themselves. initially they may lose inhibitions, and behavior and actions can be shocking. as the disease progresses, they tend to lose interest in others around them, and their surroundings. their emotions become empty- there is a lack of sadness, or depression, and little to no awareness of the needs of others. verbal and communication skills are predominantly weak and decrease significantly over time.yes, there are many, many more types of dementia that are known. there is dementia resulting from years of alcohol misuse. there is dementia associated with parkinson’s disease. there is dementia that is a result of a traumatic brain injury. all in all, there are over 100 types of dementia being treated and researched today. an accurate diagnosis is critical to the treatment of someone with dementia, for obvious reasons.while cures for dementia continue to elude the medical world, that doesn’t prohibit us from learning about different dementias, and adapting our ways of thinking at the kensington [to love and care for those we know with dementia.](## recommended additional reading:* [what is a geriatric care manager?](*

"my grandad was admitted on sunday for a virus. i saw him yesterday and he was fine. however this morning i have a 5am missed call and my mum said he’s phoned her several times today (it’s only 11am) about some really weird stuff. he was adamant it was 4pm not 4am on one call but he was like that before anyway. the strange one? he said he needed a suit for a party. mum said to him he’s in hospital and he snapped that he wasn’t... she told him to look around and he was like oh right, i guess there are people in beds. but he was adamant he was going to a party. a few months ago he went in for an infection and the delirium was so bad he was convinced he was in flats and they’d chuck him out. it wasn’t a nice experience. i just don’t know how we cope with phone calls at all hours."," hiya, i know this is a day old but i've just spotted it  sorry. i saw a reference to the nhs in your comments. my mum was in hospital in london for 5 days for a heart thing last summer when the alzheimer's was less advance and she got really really confused while she was there, worse than i'd ever seen her at the time (although not as bad as your post describes). the worst moment for me was when the nurses came to tell me to leave for the night at 8pm and my mum started screaming about how she didn't like 'this hotel' etc and repeatedly asking me how i was going to get back 'across the sea' and begging me not to leave. they had to drag her away from me because she wouldn't let me go and it was just awful. but, on to the point of my comment, nhs hospitals operate the butterfly scheme for people with dementia. they put a blue butterfly sticker above her bed so any passing staff were aware and they gave her a whiteboard with 'you are in st george's hospital, tooting' and the name of the ward, why she was there, the date etc. we made sure one of us was with her for as much of the day as possible and that she had loads of magazines to flick through (over and over and over again) to keep her busy. i hope your granddad improves soon. it's more than likely that as soon as his physical health improves the delirium will abate quickly. how is he doing today?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e1wag4/does_anyone_here_have_advise_on_coping_with/,Does anyone here have advise on coping with hospital induced delirium?
"no idea if this is dads dementia or just his age (93) or what....but he cannot tell me the truth about his health. he has hearing aids, used to have good va ones but they wore out. he says since he missed a phonecall for a ride to an appt they suspended him and he needed to call the office in dallas to get reinstated. or as he puts it they dont want to help him anymore. he cant admit he made a mistake and call them.so he spent 5k for hearing aids at his audiologist and life was good. i got him to take his va aids along and supposedly his doc said theyre just worn out. i had suggested get them fixed and theyre a good backup. couple minths later he has trouble with his new ones and boom! the va ones work again. he has refused to get the 5k ones checked. he swears up and down they do work. just certain programs on tv dont sound oud. one day he had volume up to 80...freakin 80. when im not in the room and hes watching tv he keeps it pretty loud and then i usually watch a movie with him and the nightly news and every night i have to get it turned down so im not getting blasted. he tells me that his hearing aids auto adjust his volume and he cant tell what the real tv volume is. today it was screaming so we had a talk. at anything near a normal level he cant hear it. he now says his h aids dont auto adjust the volume. my brother had suggested a pair of headphones for him but the idea offended him. he doesnt want to admit he has an issue. he admits...again...he needs to go see his audiologist but this time i'll make the appt myself. i honestly dont understand why he does this. he likes his doc and has been using him for 30 years. i'll drive him over myself. i'm more than happy to help out but i cant do whats right if he wont tell me whats wrong. its just so damn frustrating every night to have to wrangle over the volume and his lil games. i get the same thing about his meds. he refuses to allow me to help with anything. he doesnt really understand meds and medicine yet he makes a snap judgemnet and thats gospel. his neurologist tried a new med with him and started at 1mg. he tolerated it fine and i thought it helped as he went off his walker for most of the 3 week trial period.  so she upped it to 3mg. unfortunately as he started the new dose he had a coke with dinner each night. he has sleep issues and a med. he didnt  sleep a couple nights that week and on the second time he ripped the patch off and slept...so he blamed his med. not the caffeine. was supposed to call his neuro and hasnt. wont let me do it, i remind him, doesnt do it. isnt taking any med for his parkinsons. i would have at least quit the coke and tried the patch one more night....so damn frustrated"," soooo frustrating! denial is *such* classic dementia. it starts with not wanting to see doctors and progresses to still wanting to drive a car, denying that you have dementia, not taking meds, not wearing hearing aids, not eating meals, not dressing properly, to downright not doing basic hygiene stuff. as carers we gradually make the shift from trying to argue or reason with them to just putting mechanisms in place to deal with the fact that they just can’t do this stuff for themselves any more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e1q7u4/lieing_about_ailments/,Lieing about ailments

""i'm not completely sure why the doc said you shouldn't drive but i'll look into it dad."" can certainly be a true statement, even if you know what the outcome is going to be.another strategy that i know people have used is to disable the car (e.g. pull the distributor - coil wire if his car has a distributor), then he can still have his license in his wallet (and think it's valid) but he won't be able to use it. on a even grander scale, remove the car and tell him it's in the shop and you're not sure how long it'll be before it's ready.good luck and don't forget to take care of your needs!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e12mz3/my_father_69_now_blaming_and_threatening_me_son/,My father (69) Now Blaming and Threatening Me (SON POA)

"my dad has always really enjoyed kids and especially babies. from when i was a kid, he's the guy who would make funny faces and wave and interacted with little ones. completely innocent, he's always had a huge heart and babies and toddlers make him happy. but now as the dementia advances, the filters come off and he can't read social cues as well as before. when he's out, if he spots a child, he really wants to interact with them,  just really focuses on them.most of the time, the parent is ok, and if i'm with him i can sort of re-direct him if it looks like the kid or the parent might think it's getting weird. but i worry so much that one day while he's out by himself it's going to be mis-understood and a parent is going to think his attention is inappropriate or creepy. i could totally see how it might look bad, someone will call authorities and it could just be a huge mess.i don't know if this is anything that requires advice, maybe i'm just wondering about ways to deal? talking to him won't work, he won't remember even if he understood what i was asking of him, which he won't.this fucking disease sucks the joy out of everything."," your dad sounds lovely. my mother does this too. i can imagine it must be much harder when it's a male parent doing this sort of thing because of people's suspicions. just the other day i had to explain to my mum that she can't touch the head of every child she walks past but she didn't get it and continued. when she engages a child and is really enjoying the interaction we loiter, mouth apologies and take our cues from the body language of the parents and the small people themselves. but we also don't want to suck the joy unless it is necessary. i would say though, that if he is alone and someone ever does overreact and call the authorities it would be a good idea to have an id bracelet or card. my mum keeps a card in her wallet that says she has dementia and has our phone numbers on it. but it's also pretty obvious she is not okay. a few years ago when she was more independent she was caught shoplifting a few times and banned from a few shops. when i went back to apologise to the managers they said they didn't call the police because it was obvious to them that she isn't well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e0jh1f/worried_my_dads_love_of_children_might_backfire/,Worried my dad's love of children might backfire

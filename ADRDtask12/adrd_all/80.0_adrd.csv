"my mother (74) has been in early stage lb dementia since last summer. her diagnosis was actually downgraded in november to a mild cognitive impairment, but the isolation of the winter coupled with a uti brought her back to the dementia diagnosis. she had another uti about 4 weeks ago and it combined with some other health issues caused her to stay in bed for a week resulting in dehydration. she had to get fixed up at the hospital and in that time, i came home for a few weeks to help her out. she's mostly really good. her sense of humour is in tact and someone who doesn't know her well might not see that she has any cognitive decline. however, she does have these narratives/delusions happening: she thinks my sister steals her makeup (my sister is actually never here and rarely involved in my mother's care). she sometimes is lost at night and doesn't know where she's supposed to sleep. she worries about where her car is. and she sometimes thinks that i am home and/or live with her (and wonders where i go). *i worry that this might be the case once i leave in a few days; that she may be reliant on my presence and continue to think i'm with her.* the idea about my sister is never going to change. that is cemented in her brain. but sometimes, she is cognizant that her brain is messed up and that sometimes those other things aren't reality. she has called me on occasion to ask if she's where she's supposed to be or where her car is, knowing that i can reassure and help center her. **is there anything i can do to help trigger my mother's memory?** some visual cues or aids i can place around her apartment to help her know what's what? i got her a new big calendar yesterday to put on her fridge and in the memos section, i wrote my name and number and **the city i live in**. a minor thing, perhaps, but maybe it'll help her understand where i am when she's looking for me. and maybe this is a silly example, but in the series, castle rock, sissy spacek's character places chess pieces around her home as visual cues to help her get back to reality when she becomes lost in her head. i wonder if this idea is legit?anyway, it's such a difficult thing to navigate. shout out to all who are desperately trying to help their loved ones with this disease. ❤️"," one recommendation is to get an eye exam. my mom, also early to mid-lbd had cataracts, one eye to the point of nearly 100% vision loss. once we had those taken care of her anxiety seems a little better managed (w/ cbd) and she is better at finding things in her apartment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o8u1yw/memory_triggers_or_cues/,Memory triggers or cues?
"this isn’t necessarily like a question or anything but i thought if post it in this sub. my poor grandma has pretty advanced dementia and i think she has to wear a diaper sometimes now, she can’t really be by herself, and she gets angry at her daughters and my mom. she forgets where she is, who her family is, if she ate, and the list goes on.  i’m sort of getting teary eyed bc every time she sees me she mentions how beautiful i am, how wonderful my eyes look, how she always wishes she had a son (she had all daughters), and that god finally sent her the most beautiful son. she calls me and my brother beautiful, but for some reason she really gives me the most attention out of like 12 of her grand kids.i assume that’s normal grandma talk but i just find it really touching that even when her brain is literally deteriorating there’s still something in her that has love for me. i try to listen sometimes to her but it’s hard, she repeats herself snd talks shit about everybody, but i do my best and just let her vent to me about whatever she wants sometimes. and i wonder if some part of her knows that i struggle with depression, sometimes i just hate myself and i feel like i’m not enough, i lye down in bed thinking that i’m just not good enough for anything, but her saying these things does make a difference. she says it with such conviction and sincerity, and her constantly repeating it to me makes it seem like it’s almost true. like it sinks in more since she constantly tells me and i think she forgets that she even told me (which makes it work), but i’m thankful every time. and i don’t know why it just hit me that no one is going to believe in me as much as my grandma does. my grandma has 5 aunts including my mom and they’re all amazed that she’s so enamored by me, and like she talks nonsense about things that’s aren’t true sometimes, but every time she sees me she never forgets to tell me that i’m her most beautiful grandchild, i was the first born (not true), that i’ve so tall (i am very tall), and that she took care of me when i was little. she seems to like her “only” two grandsons (me and my brother) since she doesn’t really like my other male cousin who is autistic, and my other cousin who doesn’t show up to family events that much anymore. i just can’t stop crying bc i feel like my grandma saying all these good things about me is giving me the courage to think that i should stop thinking so negatively of myself, bc it would be disrespectful to my grandma. and i don’t really believe in like a traditional god but i feel like there is something that is trying to relay some message to me, it’s weird idk.again it just fascinates me that even when she has pretty advanced dementia, she’ll hit her own daughters sometimes, she’ll call her great granddaughter annoying, she’s makes up weird stories, and she’s just not well. even through all that there’s something in her that never forgets to constantly remind me that i’m worth something and do have value."," this sounds exactly like my grandmother. she doesn't know where she is, where her family is, or anything that's going on, she often tells me rude things about her children and grandchildren (usually made-up stories, but i always go along with it) and is pretty distant with other family members, but every time i walk through the door she says the exact same thing - ""wow look at you, look how beautiful you are."" she's dealt with a lot of the same anxiety and depression that i deal with, and i think she can see me dealing with the same struggles even through her dementia.when i was leaving the other day she told me that she couldn't remember how we met, but that she was so happy to have such a good friend. it's touching knowing that even when she can't remember i'm her granddaughter, she knows we're friends. we've always been incredibly close and i have no idea what i'd do without her.it's nice hearing other people having similar experiences/relationships with their grandparents, it's not something many people understand unless they experience it themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o8s6b0/even_though_my_grandma_is_doing_pretty_bad_she/,"Even though my grandma is doing pretty bad, she still praises me every time she sees me."

"i've posted here before about my dad and his issues with dementia. tl;dr he in mid stage liver failure (among other things) and this causes dementia. he recently left the hospital for rehab, where he's been the last month. we've been trying to figure out what to do with him. he wants my mom to bring him home, but i don't think my mom is capable of taking care of him. neither me nor my wife are either. he's not capable of walking or even pushing his wheel chair. he needs to be pulled up out of his chair to go use the bathroom. i'd like to get him transferred to full time nursing home care, memory care, or even hospice. we have no idea how long he's got left. the last few days he's been pretty unresponsive and withdrawn, but it's hard to tell if that's just depression or if he's actually getting worse. i could easily see him passing in the next few weeks or he could bounce back and it could be a year before he finally dies. i dunno. one thing i do know is he's miserable at the nursing home. he's a social butterfly and he's very lonely. he wants us to spend all our free time out there with him. and honestly? while i don't want my father to die, i'm not that upset over it. i've always had a laid back approach to death... it's going to happen eventually, so you just have to deal with it. and with my dad it's just... i love him but i don't like him. we've never been particularly close or had anything in common. he's always criticized every decision i've made in my life, despite a track record of me making good decisions. he's always been a little paranoid, and overly sure of himself. he doesn't like being wrong and before he retired if he got mad at his boss he'd just quit on the spot. all of his problems are someone else.as the dementia has gotten worse over the years, these aspects of his personality have intensified. getting him to go to a doctor visit, or even just basic self care is like pulling teeth. if one thing goes slikely wrong at a doctor office, he'll pitch a fit and never go back again. he's utterly non-compliant on nearly everything they suggest to him. when he's had to go into the hospital, he will be combative and actively refuse care. with me, my mom, and my wife... he expects us to serve him non stop. it's our responsibility to entertain him and keep him company. before he went to rehab, he would have my mom running around like a chicken with her head cut off. we'd sit down for dinner, and he'd ask for ketchup. mom would sit back down... now he asks for a knife.... she sits back down... can i get a little more water? and this is non stop. if she leaves to go to the back bedroom to watch tv he gets so mad at her. since he's been in rehab he expects her out there every day from the time they open to visitors to the time they close.he basically expects us to give up our lives and spend all our time helping him. he wouldn't willingly go into full time care. the best we can possibly do is in home care or in home hospice. so i write all of this to explain why i feel conflicted. i believe my dad when he says he's lonely and he is probably depressed. but there's a big part of me that just doesn't like him and i don't want to be around him in large quantities. lately i've been going out to have lunch with him one day a week, then having dinner with him sunday evenings. but it's never enough for him. and so i find myself in this situation where i have a hard time empathizing with him... we've never been super close. he was a good dad who tried his best, but he was never my best friend or anything. he's in this situation because he's spent the last 5 years ignoring doctor's orders and trying to treat his provlems with ""all natural"" nonsense. if he'd made one bit of effort to try and take care of himself, it'd be one thing, but he doesn't.i don't know what this is for. i wonder if i'm a shit son. i just needed to rant, and my therapy appointment isn't until tuesday. if anyone has any thoughts i'd love to hear them."," oh i totally understand. i have the same feeling about death. we're born, live, then die. we all do this. my mother is the one with dementia and after her diagnosis she was trying all these vitamins and supplements that did nothing but smell up her apartment. i'd get nauseated and have to leave. she's in a nursing home because she needs round the clock care and a ton of medication. it was the best choice. she was moved a couple of times until we found a good one and she's made friends. therapy and reading books on stoicism ave helped me. best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o8qmrf/feeling_conflicted_with_fathers_impending_death/,Feeling conflicted with father's impending death

"this community has been very helpful to my dad and i in our ""adventure"" to move my grandma into assisted living. so far, the strategies we've learned here have served us well and my grandma has not been as combative or resistant as expected.i want to update our experience so far in hopes it can be of any help to people in a similar situation.it started with a fall. her 8th fall. the last straw. my dad insisted it was time she move into a safer home. he didn't ask. he only told. he said she was going whether she liked it or not and that he'd start looking for places the next morning. she wasn't happy about it, but she agreed.that entire week, my dad and i researched the senior communities in our area and toured the ones we thought seemed best. we narrowed it down to the two communities that fit every need she has, specifically pet assistance. (they'll help her take her dog out to the dog area and pick up the poop for her as she physically unable to do it herself.)we put a deposit on rooms at both locations. my dad met with my grandma to go over all the information with her and they toured them together.after the tours, my grandma made excuses that these places were too luxurious for her. my dad said that's not a good enough reason to stay in an unsafe home. she started making other excuses, like her belongings need to be sold and her house needs to be sold. my dad said those things can wait, your safety is more important.we gave her a few days to come to terms. every single family member and friend she has spoke with her and said this was the best thing for her. she sounded like she was on the edge of agreeing, but needed that additional push.so today, we decided to give her that push. no more waiting or delaying. my dad wrote a letter explaining we all loved her, but we made the decision for her and she was moving to the community we thought was the best fit. we all signed the letter, let her read it, then started our heart to heart with her. the immediate family and her best friend were there.we just kept saying we love her, we need her to be safe, we are sure this is the right thing to do, we are sure she will be happy if she gives it a chance, but we would come up with a different solution if she was unhappy after a one month trial. all we are asking is that she try the place out.she agreed. july 5th is moving day. she doesn't know that yet, but she knows there is a deposit on a room for her. she's not thrilled things are moving so fast, but honestly, things can't move fast enough. this house is not equipped for her needs and i'm scared she is going to fall again and end up bedridden for the rest of her life. all i hope is that she please please please stay agreeable and give this a chance.wish us luck! she is scheduled for a doctor appointment and assessment at the facility next week. on moving day, my dad will take her to lunch while the rest of us move her belongings and have them ready in her new apartment when she arrives. it's a little nerve wracking knowing there's still so much time between now and moving day. 😅", 💪,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o8liel/update_moving_grandma_into_assisted_living/,Update: Moving Grandma into Assisted Living

"my 90 year grandfather had a fall and hit his head about a month ago. he went to the er with a huge knot sticking out of his head, but they ran all kinds of tests and it didn’t seem like anything was seriously wrong. a couple days later he was sitting up eating at the hospital, asking for more food, looking like his normal self. his next stop was to be a rehab facility to get some strength back for a few days before going home. this is where things went downhill. we received a call that around 7 am he trashed his room like a rockstar. he’d been barricaded into the room, and thought my dad and grandma were on the other side being kept from him. somehow he picked up a chair and put it through a floor to ceiling window. afterwards, he knew exactly what he had done and why. they were locking him in, he prayed for the lord to give him strength and he was getting out of that room. he was restrained and taken back to the hospital. now they did more tests, including an mri to check for a traumatic brain injury, but everything came back negative. from this point on, every evening, night, and early morning became kind of a shitshow. agitation, aggression, yelling for the sheriff, hitting and kicking nurses, thinking everyone is conspiring against him, thinking he’s back in the korean war, thinking he’s in totally different time periods. at this point we learned the term sundowning, as that was the only diagnosis anyone had given.this is not his personality at all. it’s unreal. before the fall, he was still living independently at home with my grandmother, and still driving (although he shouldn’t have been at this point). i guess he could have had dementia coming for a while, looking back, maybe. lots of repetitive story telling and constantly talking his stream of consciousness, but that was also just his personality. we chalked it up to being 90. there weren’t any safety concerns other than him occasionally falling.i flew into town to help out for a few days. we finally got out of my grandma that he’d started getting angry and agitated with her at home sometimes in the last couple months, but she hadn’t told anyone. we weren’t really seeing them much during covid, but still talked on the phone a lot. but nothing really stood out. when i was there, one minute he’s completely normal and having conversations, the next he’s in some half awake / half asleep state. when he gets agitated, it takes 3-4 of us to help him get to the bathroom. one time he was so angry, but literally trying to walk into the wall with his walker. during this we also learned that they’d been giving him ativan. it’s hard to know when exactly he’d had it, but it would turn him into the hulk and had the opposite effect instead of calming him down. even after knowing this, nurses would give it to him as soon as our family left for the night. i don’t think ativan can be blamed for his problems, but it was definitely fuel on the fire. finally they stopped that drug and tried haldol. definitely better, but not all the way. then another doctor prescribed him ativan again, despite the big bold note in his charts not to give it, and things went crazy all over again.now he’s been to hospice, back home for a night where they told us he was fine (he was not and that night was a nightmare for all involved), a nursing home, to a geriatric psych facility, then back to another er and admitted to the hospital. they’re trying to find drugs that can keep him calm, but he’s having to be restrained almost constantly. sorry for such a long post but wanted to share this story and see if anyone has had a similar experience. my grandfather seems to have gone 0-100 on dementia and literally can’t be calmed down. these antipsychotic drugs they are trying seem really dangerous for the elderly but are fed to them like candy. but it seems like everyone is running out of ideas. it’s also been frustrating and eye opening what happens in some of these facilities, but i can’t imagine what they go through and certainly don’t get paid enough to deal with situations like this. is there any chance of him having any quality of life left? we’ve not dealt with something like this as a family yet, and have no idea how long he could go on this way. there’s no chance our family can handle him, he needs professional help basically around the clock. thanks for any advice."," messed up my last post, let's try again:my advice is to push to get him off the ativan and haldol. while hospitals use those by default, for people with dementia, particular lewy body, those drugs can have a paradoxical effect and make psychosis worse. we found that out the hard way, and it led to my dad's diagnosis with lewy body - his doctor gave him ativan for what we originally thought was anxiety, and he went off the rails. from 0-100, totally delusional and agitated, just like you describe. once we got him off the ativan he stabilized.it almost looks to me as if the fall and hospital stay triggered some hospital delirium, which is common with dementia (a strange environment and stressful circumstances can really tip them over the edge) and then they gave him the wrong meds, which have only perpetuated the problem. try to push to get him off those meds and onto an atypical antipsychotic like quetiapine instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o81frw/grandfathers_rapid_onset_after_fall/,Grandfather’s rapid onset after fall
me and my sister finally got our mom to a neurologist about her suspected dementia.   they want a ct scan.  me and my sister have no idea how to proceed.  she will likely not want to do the scan.  how do we deal with this if she refuses medical treatment/testing!?  she is paranoid and thinks everyone is out to get her.  she thinks everyone is rude.  she is very difficult to deal with in general.  she desperately needs help but besides tricking her what can we do?the same goes for getting a poa.   does anyone have any tips or advice?," this may sound odd, but why do you need the official diagnosis? i mean, what will that actually do towards helping her? i’m not being facetious but i had a similar issue with my mom and i took her for a neuropsych assessment, she got kicked out after 15 minutes of the interview because the doctor thought she was getting aggressive. the report read “impression of dementia”. the drugs aren’t really effective, so why bother. we were fortunate that she trusted 1 of her 3 kids and so we got a poa and other estate plans in place with some limited trickery. if you and your sister are on the same page, get your mom some psych meds to help calm her and talk to doctor about administering them if your mom is resistant to meds. perhaps the meds might put her in a better state to get things done, including the ct scan",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o80iom/ct_scanpoa/,CT Scan/PoA
dad was very clear in his advance directives he wanted no artificial   mechanisms keeping him alive. and before he went into care he told  me verbally he didn't want to go on if he couldn't have home cooked  or good restaurant food. well now (2-1/2 years later) after aspirating   some food and getting pneumonia and a hospital visit where they thought   he could die any moment - it's looking like special meals out are  likely off the table. we finally post-covid visited him and brought him   to some of his favorites and he was so happy and thankful. but now it   looks like perhaps all the love may have actually harmed him. the hospital   gave him antibiotics and for now he's perked up and was able to haltingly  walk with a walker. even though his language has been a jumble  it was such a joy to at least get to take him out somewhere special.  he really looked good.  now he has to learn to swallow again in pt just to be accepted back  to his memory care program. sorry for the rambling. i know this   isn't what he wanted. hand fed pureed food., my thoughts and prayers are with you during this time. i’ve been exactly where you stand with both parents and it is heart wrenching. just know you have been doing the exactly right thing out of love for your dad.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o800i7/food_and_late_stage_dementia/,Food and Late Stage Dementia
"my mother(65) was recently diagnosed with dementia. at first it wasn't too bad, i(25f) would help with giving her her meds and the cooking and cleaning and all that, but just within the last two weeks she has rapidly declined. she has forgotten where the bathroom is, she's gone in the laundry room and her closet that i know of. almost everyday i am doing soild laundry. she can't speak in coherent sentences. she takes her clothes off in the middle of the living room. she wanders when she's awake but sleeps most of the day. she has a referral put in for a memory care facility, but that is going to take a while. my daughter has also gotten very possessive over her stuff, but only to grandma. i've tried to explain to her whats going on but she's only 3 and doesn't understand why grandma is suddenly acting this way.i don't know what the point of this post was. i guess i just wanted to rant. am i a horrible daughter if i say i hope the wait for a place in memory care comes soon?"," no, you're not a bad daughter. i learned something recently that helped me put my dad's move to memory care in perspective: it takes about 20 employees to do what you, as a sole caregiver, are doing right now for her. the fact is, dementia caregiving is a lot, not just because of the physical things you have to do but because of all the crazy behaviors you have to deal with. just because she can't help being in this state doesn't mean it's any easier for you to provide that care. and you have a young child, too!i hope the tests point to a uti or some other easily resolved issue, because utis or other infections can cause a sudden and severe downturn. if it is a uti, that'll make the wait for memory care easier, because treatment should bring her back up to her previous baseline. otherwise, genericmelon's idea for scheduled toileting is a good one. she's probably having accidents because she isn't realizing she has to go or, if she is, she can't find the bathroom.also, check her clothes. sometimes if clothes are tight or hot or itchy or otherwise uncomfortable, a dementia patient will remove them. they can't communicate or, sometimes, even really understand what's wrong, but they feel that removing the clothes helps, so off the pants come. maybe try putting her in some different clothes to see if that helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o7zhfw/my_first_posta_rant/,My first post/a rant

"my grandfather has vascular dementia. and has had it. okay? okay. so. he sits on the front stoop and smokes or eats ice cream in the summer. he talks to himself, constantly. he can’t help it. it’s part of the dementia. he also doesn’t have agency over his actions. things normal people wouldn’t do because of inhibitions he does because the dementia makes him lose that inhibition. our neighbor came pounding on the door the day before yesterday saying that my grandfather catcalled his daughter (i don’t know how old or young the daughter was. she could be 15 she could be 5, we have no idea because the father never said) my stepfather answered the door (my sister, mother and i weren’t home) without pants on (wearing underwear) and told the guy to wait a minute so he could go get dressed. the man took this as my stepfather slamming the door in his face (idk) and started kicking our door. he was literally trying to kick our door in. we have it on video. my stepfather called 911 and the police had to subdue the guy until he had calmed down. my stepfather and the man talked about what had happened and my grandfather was implicated in saying something inappropriate to the girl. here’s the thing, though, my grandfather has very garbled speech. he could have said anything. we reviewed all of the footage we have. we can’t find anything of him saying anything to any of our neighbors. there’s nothing. he waves to them then says his little things he says (he says things like “nick and lane south of the border” nick is my uncle and lane is my cousin, they live in south carolina or georgia or something. on one occasion he said the einny meeny miney mo rhyme but said the n word instead of tiger (which is the original rhyme and it does have incredibly racist origins and i’m not going to lie, my grandfather is racist. but he’s not a violent man. and he doesn’t say unkind or cruel things to women (he doesn’t talk much to begin with). we can’t find anything to validate this girls claims. we told the father that. we scoured the videos, it films every time someone walks by, we have hundreds. they said it happened a few times, we can’t find anything. they freaked my stepfather out so badly he brought one of his guns downstairs (he is a registered and licensed gun owner, okay? i don’t want to hear anything about him having a gun) and the gun he brought down is the one he only ever uses when he’s freaked out. it’s a .50 cal revolver (not loaded and it’s typically kept in a gun safe in the back of a closet) and he had it in it’s locked case next to the dining room table just in case the guy tried to kick the door down again. we have to send him to live in a senior living facility now.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o7tafr/what_do_we_do_about_this/,What do we do about this?

"so, we found out a couple of months ago that my grandpa has dementia. it’s been difficult, and there have been challenges with getting him to accept he can’t drive anymore and such. i understand my mother and grandma are frustrated, especially because he was diagnosed with it a long time ago and didn’t tell any of us, we only found out when my uncle got medical power of attorney and went through his records, and then many things started to make sense.he’s started with many compulsive habits, thinking he has to give people money and other things like that. it’s difficult because he doesn’t think my grandma is his wife anymore, and he’s started to resent her for the way she’s been treating him recently. she gets extremely frustrated with the fact that she has to help with so many things, like counting money, explaining things. as i’m typing this she’s yelling at him because he wants to go and see his dead uncle and she thinks he’s being stupid. he doesn’t realise how far away we live now to where he grew up, and he thinks he can walk there... just things like that. i don’t know how to help them, my mother thinks he’s ‘a nutter’.i feel like i’m the only one who is sympathetic toward him and try my best to approach things gently, but i feel like that’s because i don’t have to deal with it as often as they do. he’s upset because he feels he’s done things wrong because people are showing frustration and anger toward him. he’s almost scared of my grandma at this point i feel. my grandma and mother are worried he will get lost, and i am too, but we don’t know how to convince him to not go out.. i think him being yelled at makes him want to leave even more, and his mother when she was suffering from dementia was actually found 2+hours away from home and i’m worried that will happen to him too.i’m sorry this is so jumbled, i’m just trying to balance keeping him calm and keeping my grandma calm right now, i just need help and advice, and maybe some talking points to bring up to all of them in a way that it will be gentle because i feel like im the only one attempting to keep the peace. i don’t want him to pass away and everyone have bad memories, it really hurts because i lived  with my grandparents growing up (my mother and i got our own house a few years ago now) and everything was fine and everyone was happy, and now it feels like everyone hates eachother all the time. i’m 19, so i have time to spare to help out but i’m also trying to balance a relationship, hobbies and studies, and i don’t live with them anymore, so it’s hard to be here as often as i would like.", your gandpa has something called capgras syndrome. my brother has this. google it. many people believe it is harmful to try to persuade the person that they are wrong and instead use validation therapy (again google this).  you can try to show your mother and grandmother the materials and see if that helps.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o7kcj8/my_family_is_getting_very_annoyed_with_my_grandpa/,My family is getting very annoyed with my grandpa who has dementia
"and intoxication and self destructioni think i've told my story a few times on this sub and have gotten great suggestions, but i always hit a brick wall when trying to executethe family my mom was living with during covid surprised both of us when they changed her mailing address to my apartment, set up payment plans for her for her debt, and took full control without poa. one day at work i got a text from them that my mom was coming to ""visit"". and this meant they are just going to drop her off on me. i understand that she is my mom and only direct relative (only child and my dad is dead, thank god) but this was just thrown on me without any permission. maybe i'm selfish for not just accepting this and thinking its irrational and possibly illegal but... for fuck sake maybe we could have made a plan before dropping my mom off at my studio apartment by lying and saying she is just coming here to visit. maybe there could have been more communication besides texting me that she is coming to visit knowing damn well that wasn't the case. so now it's been roughly 8 months that my mom has been living with me, and not in a healthy situation. i took time off of work because i don't feel safe with her around roaming or safe with her with my pets. its been 2 months of not working so far, and before that i was working 60hrs a week with her at my apt not knowing what was going on. cat food ended up in the dog food bowl, neighbor found her roaming around, which means my apartment was left unlocked the entire time. the family that drove her down brought a huge case of paperwork and i could find her will and trust, but i couldn't find any poa paperwork. i called the attorney and he stated that it was sent to a wrong address and never signed, which is odd considering he drafted them at the same time in 2010. my mom talked to him today in regards to that, but i couldn't be in the room so i have no idea how the conversation went. when i came back in at 5pm right after the phone call i asked how things went, i saw notes taken down on a pad i gave her, but she literally didn't recall a thing. i have no idea if i will actually get the poa or if he will deny it due to her being incompetent. will find out tomorrow. my mom keeps thinking she has somewhere else to live when she doesn't and just gets aggressive when i tell her the truth. i don't know if there are family members lying to her and saying she can stay at their place until she finds an apartment because that seems like the consistent response. i might be making a mistake by doing this, but i try and tell her that it isn't true and that i am actively looking for an apartment for her, not even saying that is going to be an assisted living facility, and then once her memory becomes worse i have no fucking idea what to do. so here comes another month of her living in my fucking studio apartment. no privacy, no comfort, just consistent anxiety and stress. i guess tomorrow, or today, i find out about how the conversation about poa went but its just more anticipation and less sleep. i know this is the next step i need to take if i want her to be able to visit the family again, but honestly this seems like its only going to snowball my stress and will probably have to have her near to take care of heri'm in constant fight or flight. i flinch if anyone even touches me. i don't think i would even get out of bed if it wasn't for taking my dog out. sometimes i sleep for more than 12hrs. taking this family leave from work has really put things into perspective. i want somewhere where she is safe and comfortable to live, but i keep getting denied because she thinks she already has somewhere to live. i want to live my life again. i want to go back to work without worrying about leaving her alone, i want to improve myself, i want the depression to end, i want to do so much that i can't because of this situation. i want a wife, a family, a house with a backyard, but mostly right now, i want to be alone. just alone for once in however many months i've been taking care of her in my apartment. i want to stop taking my dog for a walk at 3am and crying the entire time. i want the uncertainty to stop. for fuck sake just make the uncertainty stop.but wanting is just daydreaming. wanting is absolutely useless, but in my (or our) situations, actions have become useless. i don't see light at the end of the tunnel, i feel like i'm just doing a nosedive into a blackhole apologies this was probably a mess of a post i just spewed out what i am going through, and my feelings

"i left a post here last week and many of you assisted with recommendations and responses. i thought i’d let you know the good, bad and everything in between.none of this is textbook.now what i mean is, you can read books, go online, so research and you can still be surprised.even when my grandmother was younger and cognitive, she never dealt with stress well.we drove her to the facility where we told her we were going to be moving her in to. long story short, she went catatonic. the stress, the anxiety - it all built up. she sat in the car for 3 hours, only left to use the restroom and sat outside for an additional 5 hours. we ended up taking her to the hospital for a psych evaluation. she is now lucid, conversational, and more open to the move, but before the trip to the hospital she would even approach the subject of assisted/memory care living.we won’t be able to attempt to move her until monday, but here’s hoping that with enough hospital bed rest, more conversations about the move and trying to ease whatever fears, hopefully we can try this again.we’ve had to keep telling ourselves the same thing and this is for those who may need to hear this - you are doing the best you can in a very trying and difficult situation. this is a shitty disease. don’t look back and keep moving forward."," you know it makes my heart melt when i see grandchildren caring so much about their grandparents or at least been concerned about them enough, to make a post here. why am i saying all this ? my parents have grandchildren too, (my sister's kids) both adults above 18 years. till the time things were rosy, they'd come every year mind you for vacations to my parents house. do whatever they wanted. got lots of goodies typical grandparent stuff. 3 years ago, things changed. why ? i haven't a clue. but my niece came down to finish her graduation in the same city as my parents and in the 3 years that she lived there she must have paid a visit hardly 3 times and called a few times as a duty rather than any real concern. despite all this, my parents still defended them. anyway, now the kids are slightly older and my mother is in assisted living, dementia, bedridden ect but no calls nothing... sad times and selfish nature... i am of course sure, times have changed (reason given by sister) but to not bother at all ? but, i am so happy to know that they still make grandkids like you. keep it up and all the best !",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o7eyac/update_how_moving_my_grandmother_with_dementia/,Update: How moving my grandmother with dementia went.

"if he/she was more receptive, nicer, whether at home or in a facility?"," kiiiinda? i'll explain. my parents have two cats. while my dad was at home, the one cat would frequently sit next to him on the sofa, and i know he enjoyed her company and that she brought him comfort.however, he also fixated on them and invented scary delusions. he often decided they were sick or dying and they had to go to the vet. he'd get very agitated about it and try to take them himself if no one else would. he'd wake us up at night by dropping the (e: perfectly healthy but incredibly confused) cat on us over and over during the night, insisting that we had to get up and take them to the vet. (explaining that the vet was closed because it was four in the morning didn't help, because by then he had no concept of time or, apparently, of business hours.) got to the point where i'd put the cat in a carrier, say i was taking them to the vet, then just drive somewhere and play with the cat in the car for a bit before coming back home and saying the vet said they were fine. hated doing it, though, because they hate car rides and i hated putting them through it just to calm my dad down. felt like i was just exchanging one creature's misery for another's.he also became convinced, sometimes, that the cats would attack him, and a few times he tried to hit them or throw something at them. that was when his violent phase was starting, and one of the deciding factors in putting him in memory care was the growing fear that he'd hurt the cats or, you know, us humans.so it was a mixed bag, in my experience. i think visits with pets are great, but that like anything else, if the demented person is prone to delusions and they have pets around all the time, eventually the pets will become another thing they fixate on and develop delusions about, which can lead to really difficult behavior.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o6qelw/i_was_wondering_if_a_pet_has_helped_your_demented/,I was wondering if a pet has helped your demented relative(s)?

"there was an incident regarding my well-informed opinion and another family member who doesn’t live with us caregivers. dambich, said family member, was upset that i voiced my concern for putting my grandfather in a car. i tried to calmly explain to dambich that there is a reason her father was placed in in-home hospice care. there is a reason all the nurses and aides come to our house now instead of scheduling doctor appointments at the office. she wouldn’t hear it. she interrupted me, talked over me, then when i got choked up, she told me, “see, this is why i don’t like talking to you; you’re too emotional.” i hung up on her and haven’t talked to her since. she called the nurse and asked how she felt about putting my grandfather in a car. guess what the nurse said? “uh, i wouldn’t recommend doing that as it isn’t safe.” no shit. there’s a reason they ordered a sit-to-stand machine for my almost bed-bound grandfather, but dumbich doesn’t like to stay grounded in reality. have i gotten an apology? no. will i ever? unlikely. dumbich will not be part of my life after my grandfather passed away, and hopefully sooner. she’s a fucking cunt. the kicker to all this is dumbich told me she doesn’t want me involved in any decisions. i’m thinking about moving out, but i don’t want to abandon my dad and grandfather over dumbich when they both really need me. there’s no reasoning with dumbich and my father won’t stand up to her. we pretty much obey her will because it’s easier. any advice from folks who have had similar experiences? thanks!"," your best bet is not to fight with them.  just let them do their stupid thing and then go on with your life.  when she comes over, take a break and go do something for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o5c94x/no_thanks_no_apologies_and_family_doesnt_want_me/,"No thanks, no apologies, and family doesn’t want me involved in decisions."
"there’s so much to regurgitate but i’ll spare the details.  parkinson’s and dementia suck! dad has been spiraling down hill rapidly for the last three weeks. i took a leave of absence from work to care for him as his caregiver could not handle him anymore. i am more stressed now than i was when i was working and trying to care for him. he is a lot to handle. anyhow, getting to the leaky pipes. almost daily i walk into his room and there’s a puddle beside his bed, sheets are wet &amp; diaper is off most mornings. other times he’s hanging off his bed feet on the floor and i thought of a little hand. when i wake him he’s constantly mumbling something in audible i help him to a sitting position and he says look at these damn leaky pipes leaving water everywhere. sometimes i just can’t help but laugh. but most the time i’m irritated because i’m the one who has to clean it up. i don’t understand how he cannot put his diaper on, get himself dressed during the day or complete simple tasks. however, in the middle of the night he takes the diaper off, changes his clothes &amp; does certain things that he says he is in capable of doing during the day. does anybody know how this happens i’m tired of the leaky pipes and doing laundry daily. haha. the routine is to get him showered and then i clean up the mess while he showers. he likes to just stand under the water until i tell him he needs to wash up. give him the washcloth with soap and instruct him to scrub everything. lately he turns the water off after a few minutes. he says he washed up and is done. i see the washcloth where i left it, still full of soap. he says someone else put more soap on it and demands to get out. well, i let it go a couple times but i’m grossed out so i can’t let it go anymore. any suggestions to combat the lies? his latest nuance is tantrums, mimics &amp; the silent game. he will stand still and refuse to move or talk with an occasional mimic if he does not get his way. example, today we went to the grocery store. on the way, we passed his favorite ice cream shop. he began saying “ice cream time” over and over. i said we’ll get ice cream after dinner. he immediately began the mimic “we’ll get ice cream after dinner!” followed by a loud “the hell we will” and a hysterical laugh. it’s okay to laugh….i couldn’t help it myself and started busting up which actually got him to stop. he looked at me like i was crazy. :) we got to the store and he wouldn’t move from a certain spot. i said let’s go, he shouts out run, they’re coming after me for not wearing a mask! the young box boy got startled and looked scared. i assured him he was fine. just then my dad bolts off the opposite way. while yelling run. i’m so embarrassed but then he stops, looks around and doesn’t say anything calmly walks with me to the next isle. i get to the register, the lady asked if i wanted a bag.  i said sure. well, cue the mimic again. i was tempted to say screw it no dinner tonight but, i still needed to cook something for my family.  i apologize and she just nods with that weirdo stare on her face. now that we’re home, dinner is on the table, he is playing the silent game and won’t come eat. sitting in his recliner pretending to sleep. i already raised all 3 of my kids. i can’t with this childish behavior from a grown man! i know i know it’s the dementia but dang seriously this is exhausting! not to mention, he’s been taking off on me when i’m preoccupied cleaning, showering, i’m the restroom etc.  he usually shuffled around but when he has a goal to go awol, he moves quick and is quiet on his feet. what can i do to help ease the situation and not exasperate it?  my patience is running thin as i am full time taking care of him with some help from the hubby but that’s it."," anytime there is a rapid spiral in someone with dementia, you should call his doctor and get him checked for a urinary tract infection (uti).    uti's are also common in people with parkinson's because their muscles aren't working efficiently enough to get all the urine out--so the urine sits in the bladder and can get infected.you can ask in the parkinsons subreddit for more effective ways to make sure his bladder is empty.  there's also a parkinson's caretakers reddit. one is to make sure he uses the bathroom while his medication is most active so he has most control over those muscles.   this page talks about exercises that might help some of those muscles and other strategies.  talk to the dr. because medications might help.

"... and i am sincerely struggling as her caregiver to express empathy instead of anger. she's in the early-ish stages yet and is still ""there"" enough to know that her behavior is toxic and mentally ill. yet she refuses to try to be better while better is still an option; she simply expects me to adapt to her revolting lifestyle. let me explain...she refuses to bathe--often for literal weeks or months--to the point that when i go into the bathroom after her, *i can smell her violently stinky genitals*. she lays in bed about 95% of the time, staring into her phone where she compulsively plays games instead of engaging with reality. she suffers copd yet continues to smoke. she goes out to eat almost *every* day (i'm frankly surprised she hasn't done so today, but it's still early). we are on a budget and that is wildly unrealistic and dangerous. she is combative and speaks to me with contempt about most anything i say. we are in a decaying rv she purchased out of necessity; there's a leak in the roof, our air conditioner also leaks and is causing mold and soft walls, and she addresses none of these problems nor does she seem to care.compounding the issue is the fact that i am an epileptic and can't drive. this i rely on her to provide transportation so that i can do what errands she needs--grocery shopping, getting her wheelchair from the trunk, doctor's visits, etc.it is very difficult to love her and give her the care she needs. she's always been mentally ill--she's an unmedicated bi-polar/manic depressive who was ""misdiagnosed"". but this is ludicrous, disgusting, and distressing. **i don't know what to do.** frankly there are days when i just want to leave her to her own sick devices and actually live my own life.

"i write this now with my mom breathing shallow and slowly leaving this mortal world next to me.  for the past 21 years it's been her and i and we have had quite the ride.  she is such an amazing woman and life is going to change so significantly without her being on this earth.  she is actually my grandmother but she took me to raise when i was 3 months old and i grew up calling her and my grandfather mom and dad.  she has 5 children who i would say she is estranged from.  i want to give some back story as to why the past few decades have been so hard.  her children have used her over and over and she has always been the savior when they would fall into any type of trouble. she has purchased cars, given money, paid for legal problems, and generally been the mother hen.  my mom was such a caring person that she always wanted to serve everyone no mater what.  her children have used her and abused her for so long and i've been the one that has been her support after my farther (grandfather) died 21 years ago.  i know what they have done and it is eating me alive.  two of the five children have come to see her since she has been at the hospital one of them being my biological mother.  the others are aware but don't want to deal with anything. six + weeks ago mom had an episode where she was home and threatened herself, her daytime caretaker, and me when i was trying to work through her paranoia about the caretaker.  i ended up calling the ambulance because i didn't know what else to do and i was worried about her well being.  they suggested that she go to a facility that specializes in the type of situation that we are in so i agree after a very long discussion with care staff and the social worker.  mom spent 2 weeks at the facility and had good days and bad days but communication on her well being was difficult.  i would get varied reports and amazing claims about her well being.  they notified me on a friday afternoon that mom would be discharged and ready to come home on sunday.  i of course had nothing set up in that short notice.  my family was unwilling to help and her previous caretaker was willing but any mention of her would set off my mom.  so it was left to just me 24/7 once she returned home.  i had no idea how i was going to work and maintain  her care and my daily responsibilities completely alone.  i had to make several calls to multiple people trying to ask them for help about how to safely care for my mom.  after long discussions we decided that brining her home to a care facility where we could slowly transition her to come home would be our best option given the time frame.  we got everyone on board at the two facilities that this is what we are going to do and it was a week to plan for her transfer and an open bed at the new facility.  the following thursday i get a call from the local hospital asking for moms medical information and that she was transferred to the er.  the admissions person was unable to give me any details about why she was transferred or anything about what was going on.  i spent 2 hours making calls and waiting on calls back to try and figure out what was going on.  finally a very sweet girl in the er called me back and explained that mom had a stage 3 pressure ulcer on her bottom and was running a fever so they sent her out because of that.  i did get a call from the facility she was at after i sent a direct email to them in the afternoon.   i explained that this was not acceptable to not notify her contacts of her medical well being.  after i got off the phone with the facility i received a call from moms dr. at the hospital.  he explained that mom had tested positive for covid and was very malnourished.   my heart was broken to know just how bad of shape she was in given that i have sequestered ourselves for a year and a half to keep her safe.  she was not willing to get the vaccine due to her mental state and i did not argue with her for her medications because she has been non compliant with medicines her entire life.  the hospital notified me that since i'm her grandson that i would need to provide them with the poa paperwork for her well being.  when i went to her home and to the location of these papers as well as her will the drawer was full of junk mail.  mom has been trying to save junk mail for a few years and i had no idea she even remembered about this location.  since i could not produce the poa paperwork the hospital had to discuss with her 5 children about her care and i had no direct say in what was going on.  i felt so out of the loop with the decisions that were made.  i did discuss with one family member who consulted about what i thought was right.  the dr. actually ended up calling me directly a few times and told me that he emphasized with our situation and felt that i should still  be informed.  we discussed a feeding tube for mom but he was not sure it would be a good thing for her mentally because they would have to strap her down as she was constantly removing iv's and her o2 lines.  i told him that if it was going to cause trauma to her and make her uncomfortable that it would not be her wishes nor mine.  the dr was great and said that he would discuss with the rest of the family which thankfully they finally agreed on.  mom was transferred to a local hospital and was on quarantine because of covid.  she was limited to visitors because of this and family was not able to see her.  they all stated that they wanted to be there and we should get to see her.  mom was taken off of observation and quarantine and i have been with her everyday since.  i have even stayed a few nights just to see to her care.  no my family is coming around saying well with out a will they want x and y and z and that's what mom would have wanted...  i know what she wanted but now that i'm un able to find the will nothing legally says that it has to be that way.  i have talked to an attorney and basically with the ohio laws her next of kin would be the executors of the estate and i (as the grandchild who's parent is still living) has no legal rights to anything.  i am the only one that has been with her for the past 21 years.... now at the end of days i'm the one spending the long days and nights with her to see that she gets the care she deserves.  the rest of the family is fighting and causing so much drama i'm sick of it.  i want to tell them off but i've worked side by side with my mom for all of these years to have the things that we have together.  we have a lovely farm that we've maintained together with rental houses and other investments to make the property self supporting.  now not only am i loosing mom i'm loosing my entire life it seems.  i am just so angry at my family and this disease for what it does.  the past few years have been so difficult with her mental mood swings and paranoia but i've always been by her side and i will continue.  once she is no longer needing my support i'm not sure what i'm going to do.  i'm just so angry and wanted to express my story.  it's so easy to look back and think well i should have had the papers here and made sure she didn't mess with them but you don't know what you don't know.  now i just feel so lost but i'm staying focused on taking care of mom during her final hours.  she has had no food or water for 2 weeks and some how is still going.  she has not been responsive for 5 days now.  luckily on monday she was able to squeeze my hand and tell me over and over that she loved me but now she is just breathing slow and shallow and is just being like the energizer bunny.  please pray for me and i pray that you never go through the anguish of family like i do. if you have read to this point bless you for being interested in my rant and allowing me to put my emotions out there and try and get them off of my chest.  i pray that when i start to go through her things that i will find the papers that will give me some peace but i know the struggles with family are going to be very tough because even my own biological mother has already started to make requests for assets so it's just not going to be good. here is a picture of our farm that mom and i have painstakingly kept going together that may just be gone at the end...tldr: my family sucks and only cares about money and not the care of my grandmother during her last days.  her grandchildren are supposed to be the executors of her estate but with my grandma's dementia she moved the papers and now her 5 children are involved with her care and already circling the assets and making plans which leaves me with nothing after 21 years of me being the main caretaker.", just as a follow up mom passed early this morning... i'm am happy and hope greatly that she is at peace and happy to be reunited with her loved ones that she had missed so long.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o4c1jq/how_to_move_on_after_20_years_i_find_myself_so/,How to move on after 20+ years?

"-begin rant/ramble-both my parents have dementia. vascular for my dad, alzheimer's for my mom. they're lucky that they're in memory care together. they're beginning to not recognize me now, partly from the disease and partly from the new medicines that have tamped down their mood swings. yesterday, my in-laws asked about my plans for my dad and mom on father's day. later, while i was out of the room, my wife tells me she told them it's hard on me to field questions like that. i do find it hard. i don't think i have any knowledge of how to think about this whole situation to begin with. i have had so many experiences with people who give unsolicited advice, who ask but drift away. i have many negative feelings from those experiences. i don't know how to respond to people who might actually care. people who might just be neutral. i feel the weight of expectations. but when i think about all the things that have happened... there's no damn elevator pitch for ""shit's all fucked up and no they're not getting better."" my parents won't remember if i visit. i haven't seen them in person since before the pandemic, and i'd cut myself off from visits right then because they'd already forget if i visited within a day. if i mention it's a special day, they'll ask for special activities. if i take them out they forget why we're out and want to go back. if i show my parents an ounce of sadness they'll mirror it back to me. but i don't yet have a foundation of happiness to hold me solid when i go meet them. right now it'd be easier to talk about visiting a grave. no-one expects a regular grave visit to require party-level attendance, food, and decorations. no-one expects a grave visit to even happen.i'm sorry to my in-laws. i visit them for holidays and occasions. i don't know how they think about it that i visit them but not my parents. i feel lost in the chaos of possible discussions with them. i hate being unready for conversations. -end rant-", there is no easy way to go through this. not even a little. i lost my mother to cancer in 06 and at the end it spread to her brain and that makes people really go into psychosis. and my father in 2019 for severe dementia that took him within a year. my husband and i took care of him. but i want to say your wife is an incredible partner for walking this very difficult walk with you. having that supportive partner through this is so special. whilst taking care of my father i would scream/cry to my husband that he has every right to run. it was too much. but he stayed and held my hand until the end. i promise you it will be okay. keep strong!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o4b0an/fathers_day_ramble/,Father's Day ramble

has anyone else had this experience with their loved one/person you ate caring for?my dad sleeps a lot. when he wakes up he starts acting out his dreams. he has delusions that he has been at work. or gone to the store. that his wife is still alive. sometimes we hear him talking to whoever was in his dream. sometimes he starts yelling to the person from the dream and is really confused for a good 10-30 minutes after this happens. and he mumbles a lot when first waking. example: earlier today he called me in his room. he said i needed to take off his shoes and then put them back on because he just wanted his shirt underwear (diaper) and shoes on. i asked him why i needed to take his shoes off when he was already dressed the way he wanted (shirt underwear and shoes). he told me again that i needed to take the shoes off and put them back on. i explained again that he already was wearing what he wanted. he seemed to agree and i left the room. he called me in again not 3 minutes later saying ok let’s do it. ok let’s do it. he almost threw himself out of bed. i asked what he needs done. he sat there for a minute looking around and realized where he was. he said he was dreaming he had jeans on. another example: a few weeks ago he was hollering to his night sitter that he needed to call me. it was 3am and he told the sitter to give him her phone so he could call me. the sitter told him he was not going to call me at 3am. she asked what he needed. he told her that he needed to cancel his doctors appointment because he had to work today. he was half way out of the bed while saying this and headed to the closet to get clothes. anyone else have a lo experience this or something similar? we have no diagnosis yet but the neuro is leaning toward parkinson’s or lewy body dementia.," it's very common with lewy body. my dad has it and since june 2020 he's been delusional more often than not, except for the first few months he was on nuplazid. mornings or post-nap times are worst, and i think it is because he can't tell the difference between dreams and reality. he'd often wake up at 4am in a panic over what sounded like a nightmare but what he believed was real, like the time he ran out of the house because he thought the house was being bombed.unfortunately, the delusions all seem to be horrifying, like they came out of his nightmares or his deepest fears. one thing i noticed is that he seemed to feel a certain baseline level of extreme anxiety/fear, probably because his world had become a very confusing and scary place, and his worst delusions would come on when he was having a more anxious or confused day in general. it was as if he felt this general anxiety and then his fractured brain tried to piece together the reason why he felt so scared. only it couldn't, because it couldn't understand what was really happening, so it came up with some very weird ideas.i wish i had something more upbeat to tell you, but the delusions are very, very hard to deal with and the primary reason my dad is now in memory care. in cases like my dad's they're particularly hard, because his memory has been fairly good until recently, so once a delusion pops up he remembers it and gets fixated. the whole 'distract and redirect' thing doesn't work on him. sometimes we can sit and reassure him and try to re-orient him to reality enough for him to calm down a little, but it can take hours sometimes.meds help. dad's on nuplazid, which no longer totally stops them but i think is holding worse delusions and behavior at bay. he's given seroquel and trazodone as needed for really bad days, to calm him. cbd has helped when we've been able to get him to take it.it sucks. sorry. if it helps, he is doing better in memory care. i think having many different people caring for him prevents his delusions from fixing on just one or two people as 'the bad guys'. (although he really hates the nurse who gives him his meds.) i also think the freedom of being able to wander the facility at will, and the distraction of all the events and activities and people, keeps him engaged and feeling in control enough that his anxiety doesn't morph into delusions quite so much. they're still there, though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o3utsr/delusions/,Delusions?
"when i was 18 years old, i had to move out of my home right before i graduated high school. my mom, who i was living with at the time, started doing heavy drugs with her boyfriend and my entire house was already going to shit because she’d given up on trying to be a mom years before that. so i did what i thought i needed to do and moved in with my grandmother who had always picked up the slack for my mom as a kid with me and was always there when i needed her.          shortly after moving in i started noticing her exhibiting some odd behaviors but didn’t think much of it because i didn’t quite understand the warning signs of dementia at the time. as a couple years passed she started to get increasingly paranoid and began having vivid hallucinations that my mom was breaking in every day and hiding her things and just generally making her life miserable. before i understood what was going on we would get in these massive arguments where she would even be accusing me of being in on it in some way and it was all so real to her.    so i just continued to be there for her and began taking over all of her responsibilities that she’d been neglecting because she could no longer drive or do the things she would need to do in order to be independent. so i picked up her groceries, cleaned the house, took her to every appointment, got all of her medications, and tried my best to learn everything i could about navigating those tricky conversations that happened when she was having an episode.      i continued doing this for as long as i could but i am now 22 years old and have been working full time and enrolled full time at school which i am set to graduate at the end of this semester, and i can no longer be there for her as much as she needs me to be. i am pretty much the only person in my family who does anything or gives a shit about her besides my sister but she has been dealing with breast cancer for the past year so it’s been all me for a while now. when i came home one night and the cops were at the house and told me she’d been walking around with a knife when they got there and she told them my mom was outside trying to kill her, i had to make the difficult decision to move her into an assisted living facility because it’s not fair to her that i can’t be there to give her the help she needs nor do i have the knowledge for how to actually help.      so we finally got her in a very nice facility with great staff, which she was all for at the time because she thought she’d be somewhere my mom could not get her, but now she is calling me all day and at night with her hallucination stories again and she is really scared. i feel some sort of comfort knowing she is being fed and checked out every day, and even getting involved in the activities they have for the seniors there. but i can’t seem to get rid of the anxiety that i had living with her over the years and never knowing what i’d be walking into each day at home. she is sometimes so mean to me and i want nothing but the best for her so it really hurts even though i know her brain is deteriorating. i also now have this overwhelming guilt that she thinks i abandoned her and that i never believe her so it makes me an enemy even though i’ve tried so hard to make sure she okay over the years. anyway, i’m really looking forward to actually starting my life now and getting my own place by my school and doing what i imagine other people my age do that i haven’t really been able to because of all this over the years. i’m sorry to rant on here like this but i figured you guys might be the only people who really understand. any advice in dealing with these feelings?"," i’m sorry you’ve had to take on such a huge responsibility at such a young age. she’s getting the care she needs and you should not feel guilty about that. you have not abandoned her, you did the best you could and did what was right for her safety & well-being as well as for your own well-being. congratulations on your upcoming graduation. what an amazing accomplishment. you deserve to be happy and make the life you want. she would be proud of you! blessings to you on your future endeavors. please seek counseling/help if you feel you need it. mental health is very important.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o3ua1b/dealing_with_guilt_and_anxiety/,Dealing with guilt and anxiety
sadly my mom has been struck with dementia and its been about 10 years since she started her slide. as of recent she has told me my dad left her and the man in the house is her father not her husband. i keep trying to explain to her that he is my father and her husband but she just said its impossible. they actually come to blows over it (well mostly her hitting him :(  ). but today i finally found out the reason why she believes this. my dad and her dont have sex and shes pissed. she said my husband always had sex with me and this man doesnt so clearly he must be my dad or someone else who looks like my husband. maybe they have it once every couple of years but now its just mostly him in the caregiver role. im a recovering catholic and parental sex talk is about as taboo as you get so this has been a really awkward afternoon. she feels he needs to perform these matrimonial duties and if he cant or wont then what the point of being married? she even said if he doesnt wan to be with me then what are we even doing and why dont we get divorced????!!!!  im not sure how to deal with this and would love some ideas on how to either a: get them to enjoy the full range of marriage or b: figure out a way to have them realize that those days are over and they can love each other in a modified way.," oh man, that's a tough one. maybe try a relationship counselor or something? i know there are sex therapists and such, so it might be an option. definitely sounds like an outside perspective would alleviate some of thr awkward feelings for you and your parents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o3ti35/the_mess_that_is_my_parents/,The mess that is my parents
"so most of the time, my grandmother (76) can't even say coherent sentences anymore. she doesn't know who me or my dad (58) or anyone is anymore. she talks about relatives of her that died around 40 years ago as if they were still alive. she has horrible mood swings, she refuses to go to sleep, she forgets everything short-term, she often goes into a hallucinatory state and she looks around as if she's seeing something, and she tries to attack people when mad, she even threatened my dad with a knife once. my family (and myself) finally convinced my dad of sending her to a psychiatric clinic, because he's too old to be taking care of an even older woman, and he simply can't take it anymore. today's the day she will be sent, and my dad has been doing nothing but breaking down into tears. i'm not really sad she's gone, because i lost my grandmother a long time ago, that's not her anymore; she doesn't even know i'm her grandson. i'm worried about my dad, i'm worried he falls into a depressive state because of this and i don't know what to do."," your dad may be going through caregiver guilt. my dad went through it too and is still going through it. he may also be grieving the loss of his mother, even though she is still here. continue being supportive, give him the time and space to grieve his loss. your grandmother is going to be well taken care of by a skilled nursing team. keep visiting her when you can. be there for your dad when he needs you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o3p651/my_grandmother_is_getting_hospitalized_and_my_dad/,My grandmother is getting hospitalized and my dad is emotionally broken.
"i watched my grandparents suffer from dementia but i feel like my moms still to young for this. i’ve been noticing her doing things that just don’t make sense lately but yesterday she did something that really shocked me. i came home and she was halfway through making a pasta salad with linguini soaked in salad dressing and when i asked her what she was doing she said the next step was to roast some brussel sprouts to add to it and let it get cold. also, for some reason there was broccoli out ready to get thrown in but she wasn’t sure how she meant for that to fit into the dish. it was extremely bizarre to me but i can’t figure out if i’m making too much of it or maybe i haven’t been paying attention and her mental state is worse then i’ve realized. i just can’t stop thinking about it. i took over cooking and when i did she seemed to realize how confused she was and seemed embarrassed. she’s only 67 but maybe she’s going down hill a lot faster then i think? i can’t really grasp it, i’ve realized lately i’ve been getting frustrated with her over things but now i think maybe she’s been confused and i’m a huge asshole. i don’t know what to do or how to approach this. she’s my best friend but this is such a delicate subject and one i mentioned years ago but eventually decided it was just getting older and nothing serious."," please speak to her sooner rather than later. my father has moderate-severe dementia at 70, and it had started manifesting years prior to now. getting started with the condition management now will help her have a better outcome. it may also be the time to discuss the details of end of life care with her, and how she would like to manage this condition if she does in fact have the beginnings of dementia. her being amenable to treatment and assistance will help her to remain independent for longer. my father denied his condition and refused to accept any treatment or help. this went on for years until he got to the point we had to legally step in as guardians before adult protective services stepped in. when we got guardianship, his finances and condition were in such disarray that our options for his care became extremely limited. i wouldn’t wish this on anyone. we became the “bad guys” overnight, when we had wanted to partner with him and help him in the years prior.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/o3ns21/kind_of_afraid_to_ask_can_someone_give_me_some/,"Kind of afraid to ask, can someone give me some input from outside of this situation with my mom?"

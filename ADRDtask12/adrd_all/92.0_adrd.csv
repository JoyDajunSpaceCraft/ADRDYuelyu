"my father and i take care of my mother with advanced ftd at home. she started having swallowing difficulties a over year ago, and up until very recently we were able to follow the advice her doctors gave us to make sure she was able to eat—eliminate distractions, make the environment familiar/comfortable/have mealtime cues, alternate small bites of food with sips of a drink with a straw, and staying upright after the meal ends. the past couple weeks, though, mom stopped feeding herself completely. luckily she still opens her mouth when i lift a spoon or fork up for her, but she doesn't chew or swallow until after taking a drink, and even then only does so about a third of the time and by chewing once or twice before stopping. i've largely switched to soft or liquid food like scrambled eggs and soup along with nutritional shakes, so the difficulty chewing isn't as troubling as the worsening dysphagia. i'd  still like to provide mom with solid food if there's a way for her to still enjoy it safely, so if anyone has an unlikely solution that would help my mom chew i'd appreciate hearing it.i've heard that massaging the throat can help assist swallowing, but i haven't found a resource that explains exactly how to do that and my attempts at figuring it out haven't been helpful. can anyone tell me how this works or point me in the direction of a place i can learn how to do it?thank you for taking the time to read this. i have a feeling that there's not much of anything i can do, but it would be nice to be proven wrong."," we’ve started down your path recently , too. now when we are eating anything that requires much chewing, i blend it into a purée, even things that seem weird to do, like salad or rice (carefully because that gets super sticky). at least it keeps the variety of foods in rotation. also, my grandma won’t necessarily pick up a utensil to feed herself, but if i load the fork or spoon and hand it to her, she puts it in her mouth. maybe if your mom could follow a cue like that, she’ll reflexively chew a bit (but still only super soft foods of course). i also demonstrate exaggerated chewing motions that cue her to imitate when she lets something sit in her mouth. she understands the visual better than the verbal instruction to chew her food.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l7exjb/hand_feeding_advice/,Hand feeding advice?

"hi, my grandfather got diagnosed with lewy body dementia last year and has very quickly declined since then. i'm 22 and struggling to care for him, my mother already cares for her autistic son. we've recently been thinking about trying to get him into a care home, as at-home-care is no longer suitable. i'm in over my head, no training, doctors won't give me proper information on the care and i'm now seeking help to try and figure out the best possible way to get him into a care home.  does anyone have any links, information, phone numbers, anything at all about seeking out a care home for him? we live in the south of england and cannot self-fund. the dementia advisor refuses to help us (she has a lot of stuff going on in her own life, i gave up being angry about her a while ago.)   i feel lost. i'm considering contacting age uk to try and get some guidance. has anyone had any luck with them regarding information?   i don't want to be told he doesn't need a care home, that i should just keep caring for him, or anything similar. i know enough to know that this is the way forward, it's just getting there.   today was a very difficult day, so i'm asking for kindness if you give any information about care homes and how to apply. thank you in advance."," check with your local chapter of the [alzheimer's association uk](  there are helpful no matter what the ""flavor"" of dementia you are dealing with.

"i’ve only been home 2 months now. it was supposed to be a month, that’s turned into 2, that looks like it’s turning into 3. mum is only 69. she’s been diagnosed with lewy body dementia for a little over 2 years, probably showing symptoms we didn’t catch for 5-7 years. dad can’t retire for another year. i lost my job due to closure of my office due to covid and at first didn’t want to come so i wouldn’t expose them (i live in a big city with fairly high covid rate). became obvious dad really needed a break, and since we really can’t know how much longer she has i came home to spend thanksgiving and christmas. and i’m still here. she has problems pooping on her hands. she doesn’t always understand what’s happening to her and says she has to reach down there because weird things are coming out of her. she then comes get me with poop all over her. on a good day it’s just a bit on her fingers. on a bad day she’s up to her elbows. on a really bad day she gets it everywhere in bathroom and i have to clean top to bottom not knowing where all the little particles may be. dad says the poop thing hadn’t happened to him. she’s done it to me about 3-5 times a week since i got here. she won’t let me sleep. if i try to go to bed she starts crying about how “they” will come get her if i do. if i go to bed she just storms into room multiple times, so i stay up till she falls asleep. she won’t sleep in bedroom with dad. we’ve created a day bed for her in living room. it takes me about an hour to fall asleep on a good night. she then wakes me up 5-6 hours later. she gets naps. if i move or go to take a nap myself she wakes up, so i just sit there next to her watching tv. i’ve been trying to find home healthcare but covid restrictions seem to mean most are not dealing with the stuff i need someone to come do for her.... ie help her bathe, make sure she doesn’t have poop on her, and help her wash her dentures daily. i’m torn daily between wanting to get back to my own home and knowing while she’s capable of being alone in most ways, if she has an accident dad won’t get here til 4 pm, then also wondering does she figure these things out on her own and get herself cleaned up when i’m not here because she knows she has to and only comes to get me cause she can? am i in some way contributing to her to decline being here? example: when i first got here she poured her own drinks, now every time she wants tea or juice she just comes and hands me an empty glass... i know i can’t leave until i find some sort of help. it’s just stressful. and since she suffers from delusions and is convinced dad is having an affair (there’s a man living in the grandfather clock that wants to kill her too for an example of how crazed they are) i also worry she won’t accept a helper in house. she’s accused me of trying to kill her multiple times, when i do nothing but spend my whole day caring for her, i worry about what she’ll tell the care giver and if they’ll truly understand dad isn’t a monster who hates her and hurts her like she says, but occasionally once a week raises his voice when she’s about to do something that she could hurt herself doing... it’s really hard not to resent someone who is so unkind and accusatory. who cannot see that anything is wrong with them, it’s us that are crazy, or have “changed things” so that she can’t do them herself anymore. it’s hard to remember she’s not a child i have to potty train, that i can’t teach her to go to the bathroom correctly again, her brain is failing her, there’s no re learning, there’s just more decline at an unpredictable rate on an unpredictable timeline. i’m just so tired. tired of being yelled at and feeling rage then feeling immediate guilt when she throws herself in my arms and cries that there are people in the house that aren’t there trying to hurt her. having her tell me she loves me and trying to feel that after spending hours reminding myself she doesn’t mean anything she says when she’s being cruel. watching someone you live go through this... it’s torture. knowing this may be me in 20 years is horrifying. knowing there’s no fixing any of this is paralyzing."," you can take my advice it’s on you. a pill i used to help my family with dementia. it worked. i got chemist to combine psilocybin ,cbd , coconut oil, thc.  the cbd i assumed help with swelling and psilocybin helped firing those dead nerves. it has worked on person n second person is recovering. i don’t want to make money just give help because i went thru with a lot of trouble with grandma with dementia",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l6wgen/so_torn_advice_venting/,"So torn, advice, venting..."
"hi all!i am just not sure if i am being overly worried or if there is some cause for concern please read below. my father is 57, turning 58 this year and in recent months my mother and i have noticed that he is more forgetful and angrier. he wont remember questions or conversations we had the night before, and often asks the same question again later after he already has. his aggression and agitation has skyrocketed and it seems the smallest disagreement or even a simple conversation can gaslight him so fast. he has always been somewhat temper-mental but it has blown up in recent months. he is very strong-willed/headed and is successful and intelligent but these changes in mood, memory and agitation have started too stress me out and i can see its taking a toll on my parents relationship as well. i am not sure if he has noticed it but is too pig headed to say anything we are both also too scared to bring it up because he will probably yell at us. i am not sure if there should be cause for concern? but if there is i am really not sure how to suggest he should see a doctor as i know he will just brush the idea aside even if he really might need help. any comments or similar experiences and what you did would be appreciated. thank you."," there are so many reasons this could be happening. stress or any number of health issues that aren't dementia related. he needs to see a doctor, be honest with that doctor, and go from there. if it turns out that it's some sort of dementia, getting treatment to delay progress is important. also, getting it through his head while he's still capable of comprehending it is very helpful. from my own experience with my mom, who stayed in denial that anything was wrong until a couple of months before she died, it'll make things easier... not easy, but easier if he's not fighting you every step of the way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l6t74u/does_my_dad_have_signs_of_early_onset/,"Does my Dad have signs of early, onset Dementia/Alzheimers or am I being paranoid?"

"so i’m 22 years old and my dad is 56 and he’s had what we and all of his doctors think is lewy body dementia for about 5 years now. his symptoms didn’t start getting really bad until about 2-3 years ago. i recently moved back in with my parents to help out since my mom is disabled and he’s getting worse. it’s so hard to know what to do or how to feel when all the doctors say they can’t diagnose him for sure and none of their “experiments” are doing anything for him. his symptoms are: rem sleep disorder, slurred speech, shaking, sometimes his legs just don’t work, he is constipated most days of the week, he pees at least 4 times an hour and sometimes he’s unable to make it to the bathroom in time, he complains his vision changes a lot, he’s forgetful, angry, paranoid, depressed and he’s starting to have trouble eating sometimes. he has a hard time walking and he’s fallen many times which scares my mom and i so we moved to a house which is easier for him to move around in. but he has really bad anxiety and anger and it makes him hard to be around sometimes. he accuses my mom of cheating on him and talking bad about him behind his back, he gets mad over little things and he recently in the last 6 months or so has started forgetting things which makes him even more angry. and i’ve tried teaching him to play video games, i’ve tried offering to take him on drives, ive tried to get him to paint with me but he doesn’t want to do anything but watch movies and tv all day. i make sure to get him dairy queen at least once a week since it’s the only thing that really excites him anymore but it just makes me so sad that he isn’t enjoying anything. he complains all day about how he is sick of watching tv and how much he hates living and it makes me so fucking sad. and the reason i decided to post today is, today he has mentioned at least 5 times that he’s “only going to be around for a few more days” and i can’t tell if he’s just in one of his moods or if something is happening that he’s not telling us about. he hides when he falls and he tries to hide most of his symptoms from us so i’m scared something new has happened or something. sorry for the rant but i don’t know what to do and i’d really appreciate it if anybody has any insight to share or ideas for things to do for him to cheer him up or any info on lewy body dimentia. i don’t have anybody to talk to about this and it’s been progressively getting worse just since i moved in in october and i would really appreciate any advice."," are you in the usa? my husband had a telehealth appointment with a doctor at gw, and she was extremely good. she recommended both medications for the parkinsonism and for his memory. however, we need to get a care team set up in arizona. we have both the mayo clinic and barrow clinic (established by mohamed ali). i also found that my husband is quite happy watching movies. we watch a movie every day. it really has calmed him down. i still get frustrated - he will try to cover up his memory issues and paranoia. he always performs for the doctors so it’s hard for them to make an accurate assessment. the gw doctor said that was normal, they can see through it. the parkinson’s subreddit also covers lewy body. there are many helpful suggestions there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l6o5ld/does_anybody_have_experience_with_lewy_body/,Does anybody have experience with Lewy body dementia?

"hey everyone, i feel a need to unload this here, where i'm sure others can relate and no one is attached.dad has severe cognitive issues. he was diagnosed with korsakoff's in june and placed in long-term care. covid has run rampant in the facility. he caught it and survived but they lost several residents and staff members. thus, they have not allowed visiting since he's been there. the only means of communication i have with him is the phone.this is the issue. often times speaking to me or anyone still familiar to him upsets him. it conjures up a momentary realization that he isn't home- even though he doesn't know where home is anymore. he's had angry outbursts after phone calls to the point that he's being given ativan when needed. the other issue is that to be honest, i get upset when i speak to him. it breaks my heart. even though he is still ""here"" and can recall some things (no memories newer than 15 years or so), he isn't himself. he's like a prisoner in his own brain. and when i call, he will forget he spoke with me within 10 minutes. so admittedly, i don't call much. and i beat myself up about it.  it's a constant struggle, trying to not upset him but worrying he somehow senses i don't call. trying to keep my composure when i do.that's all. thanks for listening."," here's an added issue. while i'm aware of my dad's triggers and am careful not to upset him, certain family members are not. last night i got a call from the facility because he was agitated. the reason? because his wife told the nurse to tape a piece of paper with her name stating she's his wife and her phone number. the problem with that is they've been married 13 years and he cannot remember anything that recent. he thinks he's still married to my mom. and she has convinced him that she is in fact my mom, his first wife, not herself. so he's calling her at all hours because he's reliving my mom leaving him. she is the absolute worst.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l4xwsx/to_call_or_not_to_call/,To call or not to call

(strongly suggest your dad and the care-team hook up with [www.theaftd.org]( as soon as possible, if his type is ftd).noise sensitivity is a big issue for me also.  i use ear plugs extensively, and there is no such thing as ""background"" noise like tv or radio !!!long-distance members of care-team are important.  here is my listing of links for symptoms and strategies >> [ .",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l3jw16/activity_advice/,Activity advice?

"so i guess mil took a bath while nobody was home (although i’ve told her not to) and, very predictably, couldn’t get out of the tub. she said she spent 45 minutes trying to get out. mike and i have attempted to install items in the tub to help her get in and out. the bathroom was ripped apart. the bar we attached to the tub has been worked loose. i’m sure she tried to pull herself up by the shower curtain, which is a tension curtain and now is all wonky and there’s a bunch of damage to the wall where it scraped along as she wrenched it down. shampoo bottles were strewn about. the plastic no slip bath mat was crumpled and shoved in a corner of the tub. shit went down. i suggested, again that she no longer take baths while nobody is home. fast forward an hour or two and i’m ready to take a shower. i ask her if she needs to use the bathroom and i specifically say “i’m going to be in there a while are you sure you don’t need to use the bathroom?” she said no. i said “are you sure?” she said she was fine. i went in there and asked google what time it was. google said 7:24. i covered the bathtub with scrubbing bubbles and went to wash my face. sprayed down the tub with water and once it was clean hopped in the shower. i had *just* put the shampoo in my hair and started to soap up my bits when #bang #bang #bang on the bathroom door. mil needs to go pee.so i said “just a few minutes” and had to quickly rinse my hair and body and put a towel on my head and a robe on my butt and came out to her sitting glaring at me impatiently. i looked at the clock, it was 7:36. “too ya long enough” she says. ugh. so i said “next time i am going to be in there for a while you should maybe try to use the restroom even if you don’t think you need too” and she says all super snotty “then you should have said something” mother fucker. “i did”."," sorry, but you have the ability to remember she has progressive brain-failure.  our (since i am speaking as another person living with dementia) ""rememberer"" is progressively broken.to put this in perspective you might realize that one of the next steps is that she will probably lose the sensor that tells her she needs to go pee.  in my experience when a sensor is in the process of going out, it often mis-fires and gives us false information before it goes out (like i had repeated smell hallucinations of body odor before i lost the ability to smell that scent entirely) .  neurological sensors are specialized equipment, and they all lead to the brain, where we are supposed to make sense of what those sensors tell us.... and personally i dont remember my husband is in the bathroom, without the spiral note-cards he leaves on my work-space.  i guarantee she has forgotten when she went pee last - and having the impulse could mean she will dribble down her clothing in a minute == so that is cause for panic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l3hctx/bathroom_blues/,Bathroom Blues

"we just moved my septuagenerian mom in with us from across the country. she has some form of early dementia, though she is not a fan of ""too many psychological questions"" from her doctor, so any full diagnosis is going to take some time. (we are in the building rapport stage with her new doctor.) i have been taking care of all of her life stuff that she let fall at the wayside, including figuring out her finances. i have known that she was involved with an internet scammer for a couple of years, but honestly could not stop her. after she gave him some money and bought some gift cards we convinced her (*i think*) to stop giving them money. i have access to her phone, and they are in constant contact and have recently been asking for more money. in addition, i think this person might have gotten way more money, as my mom's retirement is empty. she didn't have that much money in there and was never planning on really using it for retirement, but still. i have not been able to track down exactly where the money went, but it's definitely possible that it went to these scammers. **it is time for this to end.** we are planning on reporting the scammer to the fbi. i various details to share with them. i am just not sure what to do regarding my mother. she sees this person as her love. and she is very defensive anytime i mention them. she had a fairly loveless marriage and has been pretty lonely since my father died a couple of decades ago. i am worried that they will just find her again. she is only so good at being sneaky, but i am still worried. i am also obviously worried that they will steal more money from her, though i have access to her bank accounts and pretty much know what's going on. she has been a bit depressed since moving here. she was not being very covid careful, and so on top of moving here away she is missing social time. i do not think she will just stop talking to this person because we ask. i am worried that if we tell her we need to block them that i'll send her into an even deeper depression. the dementia aspect of this is new to us and has also been overwhelming. i have been putting off this task, but i could really use some advice."," u probably will be ok to let her still speak to them, as long as they are not getting her money, she can just say she no longer has access to her money andsee how long they will linger then!  totake her away from them suddenly willbe traumatizing for her (i speak from my own experience). better to let it die a slow death😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l26b06/mom_w_early_dementia_victim_of_romance_scam/,Mom w/ early dementia victim of romance scam

"recently i’ve volunteered to help a family i know with their elderly mother who suffers with dementia at night. until now she had no overnight help after 8 pm but after 2 falls in one week they decided to hire people to sleep at her home every night. she chooses to sleep in a recliner without even reclining with the tv blaring all night and at around 4-5 am she would transfer herself to her wheelchair to sit in front of a heater. this is when she would fall asleep again and end up on the floor. she cannot walk without a walker and even then it’s only a few steps. since overnight help started we decided that the tv would go off at 11:30 pm after the news and she had to prop up her feet. i also work two day shifts during the week and during the day shifts i’d keep her up and her caretaker at night would tell me she slept through the night just fine. well the overnights i work she refuses to sleep and very combative all because the day worker on those days let’s her sleep all day. this not only makes her dementia worse but i’m in the position that i’ll have to quit due to not being able to stay up all night with her. they will need to hire someone who can work an actual third shift. i can’t expect a person to sit in silence for 8 hours straight, she can’t help that she isn’t tired. i guess i’m just venting here about how frustrating it is to work with other people who can’t do their job. i also can’t voice my concerns to her family as they are really fond of the woman who works during the day before me. i’m at the point of not even wanting to help with doing day shifts. i’m seen as the “villain” now in the elderly woman’s eyes.", there is no way you should and could be expected to do two peoples jobs. ground rules need to be laid out and followed. it's already a very difficult job to begin with. you can't sacrifice your own wellbeing for them. i hope that you can find a better situation that properly respects your efforts and demonstrates that in their cooperation.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l1gri9/working_overnights_with_dementia_patient_who/,Working overnights with dementia patient who doesn’t sleep

"hello r/dementiai'll get straight to the point, i am an 18 year old male who is currently diagnosed with severe depression and adhd, and under watch for bipolar disorder. i have severe insomnia forcing me to either take sleeping meds or lie awake until 4 am. i smoke often, and often do soft-drugs (marijuana, magic truffels etc.). lately i've been having trouble with speaking and thinking clearly, as well as having short term memory loss. i keep telling myself this is happening because of my poor mental health and being mentally/physically exhausted all the time, but i can't shake the idea that these are symptoms of early onset dementia and i am paranoid about it.i guess i'm making this post to seek affirmation that i'm just being paranoid. i'm sure more people of my age group and situation have had this thought occur to them, and dementia in 18 year olds is extremely uncommon. i'm not looking for constructive criticism. just someone telling wether or not i should stop being so paranoid.", cut back on the weed. it kills your memory,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kzyiu7/18_yo_and_afraid_of_having_dementia/,18 y/o and afraid of having dementia.

"tl; dr: what are the pros and cons of hiring someone (probably a stranger) to serve as a remote assistant to a senior citizen with memory loss?my mother is elderly (over 80) and has started to have short-term memory loss. it's gotten more noticeable in the last 6 months or so, and she has started to acknowledge it. my brother and i both live at a distance from her, though he is close enough that he can make the round-trip in a day, and he visits every few weeks. she is not home-bound, she drives well, and is very intelligent. we do not think she is any danger to herself. due to the pandemic, she is alone a lot of the time, especially now that it is winter and she can't easily have visitors outside in the yard. friends and relatives phone her often--one of them daily, several multiple times a week. she has local friends who bring her groceries weekly. she is also able to run to the grocery store herself, where she is cautious about going very early and making the trip short. however, she is not great about remembering to wash her hands, remove her mask properly, etc.she needs help with computer and iphone issues fairly regularly. she's always been tech challenged but it is more critical now, with phone and zoom being the main ways of interacting with people during the pandemic. she reaches out to my brother a lot for tech help (and to me occasionally on it). she reaches out to me on financial questions fairly regularly and sometimes on medical. my brother and i both observed her memory issues getting worse. i began pursuing trying to get a diagnosis and any medical help that seems appropriate. she was able to get a zoom appointment with her family doctor, who seemed excellent. (i attended, too.) he prescribed comprehensive blood testing. everything was normal. he has referred her to a neurologist. that will be next--she would prefer to wait until after she's vaccinated. i made sure she registered for the vaccine as soon as she became eligible.just when her memory issues got to the point that i thought she should get medical evaluation, my brother began  advocating for her to get a remote assistant to help her with technology problems, scheduling household repairs and maintenance, remembering appointments, and keeping track of medical issues. he would like to hire someone overseas (inexpensive).my mother is not eager to have a remote assistant. she thinks that will just be someone to supervise and have to try to share everything with electronically. her biggest source of frustration is technology, and second is trying to get things done where she has to depend on other people being reliable and doing the job well. she has a lot of trouble scanning documents or emailing photos of things.i asked my brother if the reason he wants a remote assistant is because her questions are becoming burdensome to him. he said no but i think he has backed away from that answer. my husband, who works in it and is super patient, has offered to help her with computer issues. she is happy to have that resource and thinks the world of my husband, but she hasn't reached out to him yet. i think she is used to contacting my brother and i don't think he has discouraged her from doing so. here's why i'm posting: i am concerned about the safety of a stranger knowing that she lives alone and has memory issues. that person would know when she has an appointment and is out of the house and could also potentially try to scam her in other ways, such as financially. (at this point, my mother controls her own finances, though she is gradually bringing me in to help.)when my brother first suggested the remote assistant, i raised my safety concerns with him. i also suggested that if we do hire someone, we should set the cost aside. we both know that she is well off and cost is not an issue for her--she is happy to pay well for work for her. i have said we should put safety first and hire someone one of us knows and trusts (i gave him 3 names of underemployed friends who might be interested) or perhaps a friend of a friend who is well-vetted. my brother's position is that anyone can rip you off whether you know them or not. i subsequently also offered to help more (which i am doing) and i have offered my husband's help with the technology issues (which my brother has not responded to--instead he's emailing me things like medical releases we should give a  remote assistant).  sorry this post is so long. i would love any advice on any of the following: whether i'm being overly concerned about my mother's safety, approaches to dealing with my brother on this assuming that i'm not being overly concerned, possible alternative ways to address my mother's issues, any stories of success or failure using remote assistants, and anything i might be missing. thank you in advance!"," > scheduling household repairs and maintenance, remembering appointments, and keeping track of medical issues. like no, absolutely not... you can’t trust strangers to this. so many mistakes and omissions are routine in these areas. your mom will need an advocate who cares. i can’t tell you how many times i’ve had to push for tests, question prescriptions (either with a doctor or pharmacist, even having them go over filled prescriptions that were wrong), double check that paperwork is correct... i’ve been at my dad’s bedside in hospital, witnessed adverse reactions and had to shout to get a nurse or doctor... had to force them to write what happened down. i’ve had to reiterate an allergy every single time he’s gone even though it’s supposed to be in his chart. have queried ekg results and labs and caught errors... for the place - one of you is going to have to physically go and check on things. at least once a week ideally. for her appointments- that’s easy enough, google calendar is fine.medical - no chance would i offload this to anyone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kzezt6/advice_on_a_remote_assistant_for_forgetful_senior/,Advice on a remote assistant for forgetful senior?

"hey all! i hope this post doesn't become super long, but i do have a particular tendency to ramble. apologies in advance. i was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation like my sister and i are. some background: we're both now 29, and mom started exhibiting radical personality shifts and coming up with strange memories as far back as when we were 17 or 18, maybe a little younger. by the time we were 19, we approached my dad to discuss our concerns. dad has been difficult, to put it mildly. power dynamics have been a prominent part of family life. as a result, reasonable discussions with dad about mom's health have been a mixed bag over the years. his long-lasting denial was a huge roadblock. sister moved away several years ago, so her role is now long-distance caregiver, while my dad and i are living together at home with mom. late this year he intends to retire, sell the house, and move across the country (us). his plan is to take care of her himself, hire in-home nurses, etc. mom is, i would say, solidly in stage 6: severe cognitive decline. there's going to be a big chunk of the safety network gone once he moves, as i'm not staying with them. while i'll be flying out with them initially to spend some time with relatives, my final destination is to be moving in with a friend and solidly distancing myself from him and mom. i know my dad better than to think he truly sees me as an important or meaningful part in the equation of my mom's care, so we'll just leave it at that.""we'll cross that bridge when we get there"" is how he handles most things relating to mom's dementia. sister and i firmly believe mom should be in a home or facility, or at least taken to a decent daycare facility. we have firmly believed that for a few years now. when we've tried to broach the subject with him, it never goes anywhere. he seems to feel he can truly handle the end-stage with her at home, whereas my sister and i don't feel he has the correct temperament or experience to handle it. does anyone have advice for how to get through to someone like this? he's wrapped up in his head. convincing him that you might have a valid point is difficult, sometimes impossible. he ran from the responsibility of this for *years*. he has historically taken it as a personal offense about how he cares for her when sister and i discuss her quality of life. and i wish i could say it's a personal offense because he wants to do his best for her, because he loves her, but it's always come from a place of pride. he doesn't want his daughters questioning what he does, because he never wants anyone questioning him. mom has just.. languished for years. left to drive for far too long, left alone for far too long, left to do *nothing* because she can't do anything stimulating without another person helping her. sister and i have felt helpless and crazy so many times throughout this ordeal. this turned into a super long ramble, i'm so sorry. i already cut out a bunch. any help in advance is much appreciated."," i have been caregiver to my elderly mom and dad for ~6 years now.   i have had a lot of success restoring their functionality with r/nootropics brain supplements.   they won’t help in every case, but they worked so well for my parents that my wife has me giving them to her 95 yo mother (also with success, she is still living mostly independently).  it is odd, many of these supplements are commonly used in other countries, but american doctors know very little about them.a side benefit is that you might learn something about your own future — if you inherited whatever type of dementia your mom has.   the first ones to try are very safe and simple natural compounds, alphagpc and tyrosine.  alphagpc  sometimes has a noticable effect within an hour.[alphagpc for alzheimers](it kind of insane.  the drug companies thought they had found their “magic pill” that would make them all billionaires, but it failed:[alzheimers-amyloid-drug](existing compounds that can’t be patented are ignored, even when there is scientific evidence for their safety and effectiveness.  another is:[levetiracetam+for+alzheimers](while that requires a prescription, other “racetam” compounds don’t.

"so my beloved grandma lives about 6 hours from me and her assisted living facility is pretty strict with no contact due to covid and she just doesnt have the energy to do window visits. now my niece through marriage knows about my grandmother's condition. shes 20 and by far my favorite. a few weeks after i told her about my grandmother, i met her for lunch on her way to see her dad, she luves about 4 hours away from me.she asked me to give a present to my grandmother. and when i saw it i just started crying. my niece went through some trauma when she was younger and she was given an extremely lifelike babydoll to help her cope as she is a nurturer at heart. she wants me to give this precious doll to my grandmother. but i have no way to hand it over to my grandmother like i see in all the precious videos where you see people handing them the doll as if it were a real baby. i've read how this can be extremely therapeutic and just that my niece would make a gift of this doll that probably saved her from losing it, it's such a precious exchange. any thoughts?", luves.  what a wonderful typo!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ky0s3p/how_do_i_give_a_doll_to_my_grandmother/,How do I give a doll to my grandmother?

"very recently my mother has had a rapid deteriation in her ability to remember things. by rapid, i mean within a span of about a week or two she went from her normal self to having what i'd consider some pretty big memory issues. she passes the mmse but i don't think it says much considering the following issues:* cannot recall accurately what was done during the day. will conflate things done over the last few days as having happened today. she will sometimes not remember anything at all, while other times might get a couple things right. with assistance she will generally remember these things happening or conversations that we've had. something needs to trigger her memory for her to recall it.* cannot recall when to take her medications. will forget what's left or whether she's done for the day. without me there she won't bother taking any of them at all.* can't follow multi-step instructions. for example ""can you grab the empty bottle off the table and throw it in the bin outside"" will result in her maybe grabbing the bottle and then asking what i wanted her to do with it, or not knowing how to get outside to the bin (or remembering where the bin was). she can however follow something like ""can you wash the dishes"".* for the most part she won't eat unless i tell her to do so. * basically wants to lay down and do nothing or sleep. she's never been an active person, but she used to always watch tv and find something she enjoyed.combined with this she initially was very depressed and had little to no energy. she was living alone, and with lockdown restrictions was getting very isolated (i don't live in the same city). this happened a week or so after news of the one neighbor she had interactions with was moving away. as a result the doctors at the hospital suggested it could be a result of depression and from what i can see there's even something called depressive pseudo-dementia so it's a possibility i suppose.the sudden onset though could be explained by vascular dementia (she's had strokes in the past) and her minor memory issues could've previously been handwaved away until they became more drastic. she has had episodes like this before, but not all issues at once and not ongoing (in other words, forgetting what day it is till she was told, momentarily losing her bearings as to which street she was on, forgetting which chemist she went to for a brief moment).we've done blood and urine tests and nothing has come back suggestive of a problem and a ct scan again hasn't shown any problems and to get a formal diagnosis requires a neurologist which is likely going to take months to get an appointment in.there's many potential factors here i'm sure (including previous conditions, medications she's taking etc that i haven't mentioned because of space limitations) but i'm wondering what're your thoughts on this sounding like dementia, and if so what are some steps i can take to rule out anything else as a possible cause?"," i have recently discovered that depression and dementia go hand in hand. uti is also a possibility, but could also be part of a lack of personal care which is also a symptom of some form of dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q0ggf5/seeking_opinions_from_those_with_experiences_with/,Seeking opinions from those with experiences with family members who have dementia
"hi everyone- my mom (at least in my opinion) seems to have fairly rapid decline.for example in 2016 she was attending parties, 2017 she got lost driving, 2019 hoarding food and severe delusions and repetitiveness, 2020 same as 2019 but huge drop in dressing or combing hair and the start of throwing things threatening people. she falls a lot.she has behavioral front temporal. over the last week i noticed a few days she seemed like sedated, barely talking (she is loud), barely replying and also had no idea what she was doing. she pulled off her clothes because she wanted a new gown but did not care who saw and wouldn't stop when i asked her to be patient so i could find one.anyone with experience - does this sound like a new phase is starting? it's intermittent. i was thinking her skilled nursing may be giving her a sedative but i think they would have discussed. i find that out monday."," as per experiace with my wife, her deterioration for last 6 months is very fast and  you would find new phases every other day. now a days she barely talks even on video call from her son when asked she would not reply to him. it is not any effect of sedative. these are the fast changes setting in .",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q0ftxu/slow_speaking/,Slow speaking
"hello!for a month now i've been working (as a trainee) at a residential home for people with dementia. the building is made up of six different sections housing a total of 72 people. i work with 10 of them and everyone has some kind of dementia. their needs are varied, ranging from being quite independent (apart from meals, medications and overall health care) to being non-verbal and in need of assistance 24/7. every single one of them is a wonderful human being and i feel humbled by their gratefulness towards the smallest of things. so far i've been doing good despite having no work experience with anything health care related. i don't have any personal experience with dementia either. i've learned a lot this past month. prior to starting my trainee program i took an online class (from the swedish dementia centre) but the majority of learning has been through working with them and observing the staff. my question to anyone as a loved one (or health care professional) is this: is there something important i should keep in mind? i've used common sense a lot and i'm keeping an overall respectful approach. the residents seem comfortable with me and i give them as much time as they need, even if it means hearing about a cherished memory for the fifth time. :-) it just makes me feel good because their eyes light up when reminiscing about the past!i've thought about asking staff but i'd really like to hear from the loved ones and their perspective. out of respect, i've kept from asking the few visitors. they're not there to educate but to spend time with their family member. what are the do's and don't's of dementia care? i know they're all individuals, but i'm eager to learn more and especially from loved ones!thank you for your time and take care!"," i always remember, with my mom, if she is agitated, redirect to something you know that particular patient loves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q0eayy/just_started_working_in_dementia_care_any_helpful/,Just started working in dementia care.

"ageism exists. i can’t count the number of times i was told “it’s not a uti” despite high leukocyte esterase and at least one other sign (eg nitrates, white blood cells, a few other things ) at any time. know that this is a judgment call for a doctor. they can have a positive sign, but decide that unless a b or c is present, they’re not calling it a uti. or they’ll say the person is “colonized”. or that it could be anything (with le this is true, it’s not specific). if antibiotics were used in the recent past, they may not be able to get a culture so it’s an open question. or they’ll say “it’s probably the dementia” (i heard this several times. by internal medicine specialists as well!). sometimes they know it is a uti and just don’t treat because it’s fashionable to do this now. (some article came out advocating for not treating.)i knew there was a uti, based on the frequent urination and the fact that cognition would sometimes temporarily improve after an antibiotic. he never complained of symptoms. but he was retaining urine thanks to bph and probably some nerve damage after a catheter. as well, he was forgetting to pee. which led to an accumulation of bacteria. this cycle of temporary improvements with antibiotics  went on for two years… through two urologists and countless other doctors in and out of hospital (not all for utis). in that time, my dad’s cognition and communication were pretty limited. well…  finally, one of the urologists agreed to put him on weekly prophylactic antibiotics. to humour me, because i asked about it. it seemed to help, but not totally - half the week he’d be ok, half not. so i went back and the doctor agreed to give this to him twice a week (it’s a sachet you usually just give once). well -  now i’ve got my dad back, apart from some memory issues. i cannot believe this. his speech is fluid, and his repertoire has expanded a hundredfold. for years the man had only a handful of phrases… i’m not saying this will work for every person with dementia who has a uti. he doesn’t have alzheimers, he has small vessel disease and ftd. but even so, if you really feel certain it’s a uti, don’t let bias get in the way… get your loved one help! i can’t believe for two years, my dad suffered. if i had listened to the doctors, they’d have all agreed he was far gone and he’d probably be in a home or dead (from neglect at an ontarian home) right now."," this post may have saved my mother’s life. i had no idea that a uti could look so different in an older woman, especially one with rapidly advancing dementia. but this week she suddenly began hearing voices, hallucinating, attacking, and fleeing. it was terrifying. i read this particular post, something clicked, and she’s now on day 2 of antibiotics. the doctor also said her uti was so severe she may need an er visit if symptoms don’t improve. i’m not expecting miracles and know the dementia will not magically improve , but now there’s at least a treatment for one thing that was causing her suffering. so thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q0bnm9/it_took_me_two_years_of_taking_my_dad_to_multiple/,It took me TWO YEARS of taking my dad to multiple doctors to get his UTIs treated!

she also would say things from the news as if they happened to her). they get are prone to getting lost if they venture out by themselves but can still go to routine places pretty well. knows what the weather is like outside and who is president. would benefit from communal living such as with family. stage 5 is the loss of independence. definitely should not be driving or going places alone. can't live independently at all, needs to be pretty much constantly supervised or they'll endanger themselves somehow as they are still active. they can't pick appropriate clothes for the weather but can physically dress themselves. can't remember how to cook a recipe or to turn off the stove at the end. significant difficulties with communicating, more stammering than words but still able to construct sentences. asks the same questions over and over. paranoia escalates, everyone is against them. some people have hallucinations and delusions, they will tell you crazy stories as if they were real (loss of ability to differentiate between fantasy and reality). having trouble recognizing loved ones or remembering their names (""i know i love you but i can't remember where we met""); still remembers the people they live with. may experience age regression and believe themselves to be a teenager or child. if they speak multiple languages, reverts back to native tongue. has no idea what's been in the news, doesn't know who is president, doesn't always know what year it is. can still toilet and eat independently. stage 6 is severe dependence. severe trouble expressing themselves, and communicates through pointing, sounds and simple disjointed words. not able to dress themselves, doesn't understand how sleeves work. no longer able to respond to questions at all (""do you want ice cream?"" blank stare). not able to be prompted by sounds, doesn't know what it means when the phone rings or when the fire alarm goes off. very irritable about everything. not able to track time, has no idea how long it's been since any event, even earlier today. does not recognize loved ones and has lost all names. doesn't recognize self in mirror. can still eat semi-independently (with supervision and encouragement, but they can still hold the spoon). can't hold a pen or write their name. needs help toileting and showering but can still go to the bathroom for these things. incontinence is common, adult diapers are needed. stage 7 is the final stage. bedridden. may not be able to sit up without assistance. complete incontinence. loss of speech entirely, from ~6 words down to zero words and then no outward attempt to communicate. no facial expressions. can't feed themselves at all. can't chew, needs soft foods only. sleeps 20-23 hours per day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pz8xkk/seeking_advice_about_alzheimers/,Seeking Advice about Alzheimers

"i really don’t know what i am trying to ask for here, maybe just a listening ear for me to vent to for a minute. i am sorry if i am rambling or if this is the wrong place to do this, if so please point me in the right direction.a few years ago my dad was diagnosed with lewy body dementia. my children and i live with him and my mom. my mom works outside the home, my kids are all in school, and i am home with him all day while taking classes online. i have been trying so hard to not let his moods get to me but i am not doing a very good job. it is hard for me to separate him from the disease any more. his nasty mood this past weekend (my daughter’s birthday was saturday and party was sunday) has been especially rough.he has been acting like we think he is a total idiot all the time, interrupting questions because he assumes he knows what we are going to say, or ignoring anything anyone says to him. he’s been acting extremely selfish (eating an entire brand new pack of cookies because he finished the ones he really wanted), questioning why my mom needs a new dress for an upcoming wedding after they bought him a suit. he refused to go out to dinner on my daughters birthday and refused to go to her party. after a full weekend of me taking care of all of the things we had going on i snapped at him for interrupting (to say forget it), when i was asking him what he wanted me to do with the pork chops he wanted me to make for dinner. it seems stupid to let it get to me like this but i have no one to really talk to about it. my mom doesn’t want to hear it because she lives it too (and says i need to just deal with it and be nicer). my oldest gets a lot of his nasty attitude just like my mom and i so i am constantly trying to help her cope as well. i can help her and talk her through whatever he said and why but don’t know how to help myself. logically i understand it’s not him, emotionally i can’t separate it."," i'm sorry. i think i know the feeling. lewy body turned my gentle, thoughtful, loving dad into an irrational, violent, selfish, nasty person. i know how hard it is to not let it get to you. yes, it's the disease, but when someone is being spiteful or cruel, it's still upsetting, regardless of the underyling reason why they're being spiteful or cruel. i never did reach that emotional separation, myself.plus, you're at home dealing with it all the time, while your mom and kids work or go to school, so it is very true that you are the person bearing the brunt of it. so your mom not wanting to hear it because she lives it...well, that honestly got to me a bit, because yeah, she lives it, but not the same relentless assault all day every day that you've living through, and her attitude is not helpful. there is a difference in levels of exposure here, and it's no surprise that, given your situation, you're getting particularly burned out.is there any way to hire an aide and then go study at a starbucks or a library for a few hours, just to get a break? have your mom take some time off work and take care of him during the day? anything to get a reprieve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pwpj1t/i_am_out_of_my_depth/,I am out of my depth

"hi all! first post here. i take care of my grandma on the daily along with my siblings. she has respiratory issues, wears oxygen 24/7, and has to sleep with a bipap. we do everything for her.recently, she has been acting different. she asked my sister if i was the cook, the daughter of the owner.

""who are you talking about we were talking about the dog."" ""oh the lady across the road was talking about..."" repeated questions. she asked us three times how the dog reacted to us coming over since she was out when we came. we responded each time and she acknowledged us responding each time. i pointed out that she has asked the same question three times. she instantly got defensive and argued that she didn't hear us the last two times.her driving is really poor. i noticed that her parking is odd. she will have like 3-4 feet between her front bumper and the curb. she makes very insecure and jerky turns, she sometimes leaves the turning lane she is in.poorer memory. she forgets where she puts things constantly. she asked me how ripe my melons were from the garden. she helped me grow butternut squash all summer which seemed odd to mix up. despite multiple trips to my apartment, she still isn't sure where to turn. i'd like to think that her behavior is typical for early dementia, but now i'm second guessing myself since i also detest being around her. so and his mother have admitted she is showing mental decline but refuse to speak with the grandmother about what they are seeing for fear of making her angry."," very typical dementia signs, and the unsafe driving is terrifying. frame this to her family as concern for her safety - get them to make a doctors appointment about a general check up and pre-plan with the doctor that it will be a dementia check.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pw3zd6/am_i_over_thinking_about_gmil_showing_signs_of/,Am I over thinking about GMIL showing signs of dementia?

it was 2015.  my brother had died that year.   my mother was having huge problems with functioning independently.  she was slipping away - very slowly.    a piece of me died in 2015 and i've never been the same.," my mom's memory has been getting worse over past couple years but significantly since my dad died 5 months ago. i felt being alone after 70 years was part of the problem and decided to move her to memory care in hopes of getting her more active and stop her self isolation. i'm really worried i made the wrong decision because there are many women far more advanced with the disease. a couple have anger issues and i'm already concerned the environment will be more negative than positive. my heart has been in angst since move in date this week. yet i know she is more advanced than i often think she is. when i'm with mom, even though i love being with her and talking to her, the conversations alone are so very upsetting to me as i experience her decline and realize more and more that the she's not the woman she was.  i'm more the mom now and she my young daughter. she says things that make no sense, forgets within minutes, the wrong words come out. i almost feel i'm carrying a conversation with a child. agreeing and accepting what is being said, going along with it, to keep her happy. all the while i'm silently in horror that it is coming to this and crying inside for my mom. i hate that i feel upset at the loss of my supportive mom, my best friend. i'm left with no one to listen and allow me to talk without judgment. i don't feel depressed but overwhelmed and saddened by life. i feel terrified of what is to come and what it will also do to me once i find myself truly alone in this world.  i feel extremely guilty for worrying about me!.  the few times i've been unrecognized by my mom i fall apart. dementia is not just destroying my mom's brain but killing me mentally and physically along with her. i often wonder how my heart can possibly endure this pain of losing her mentally and if i'll survive when she physically leaves this world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pv0ls0/when_my_mom_first_exhibited_symptoms/,When my Mom first exhibited symptoms.
"my grandmother contracted dementia about 6 months ago at age 63. never have i seen it progress as fast as this one. in merely 3 months she went from being herself to being trapped by her own thoughts, in her own world. my grandmother we knew had already died, and what remained was not her. we took her to many specialists and psychologists to look at her brain scans but we never got a straight answer. we got alzheimer’s, we got vascular and we had another sort. one of her specialists commented on her behavior as it was more schizophrenic, hallucinations and psychosis like. it started with he being afraid of the tv speaking to her , characters threatening to hurt us or even kill us. my grandmother would often scream, cry and point at a “black figure” attempting to hurt her or my mother. she would “cook” food, fix meals and make coffee every morning and leave it outside for said figure and argue with it day in and day out. many nights she would spend attempting to escape my home. often she would not sleep , if at all. if we got lucky she slept maybe 3 hours every 3 days. she and my grandfather both lived together in our home but separate rooms, we made sure to provide her with the space she needed to feel comfortable. she was surrounded by those who loved her despite how hard it was to see her deteriorate before us. after my grandfather died due to covid in july of 2021 she didn’t grieve or cry , in fact it seemed she had forgotten him, but the black figure remained to haunt her and it wasn’t until a month before she passed that we connected the dots to who the black figure might’ve represented . it was my grandfather, who before they moved to the states would abuse and torment her. we believe the years of trauma she endured when they first married carried into her dementia and caused unbearable and incredibly real psychosis . she passed last month due to covid complications but at the very least she is no longer suffering . we never did get a straight answer for what kind of dementia she could’ve had as i haven’t heard of many cases like hers, i was just wondering how many others have seen these kind of effects."," hi u/_avocado_diableam sorry your grandmother is suffering this way and for all who witness her decline. please let me encourage you to immediately get the book the end of alzheimer’s by dale bredesen, md. he has written a phenomenal guide on how to understand (and maybe *reverse*) dementia but it’s not a guarantee and time is not on your grandmother’s side but there might still be time since she’s only 6 months in with symptoms! this book will also help to understand that alz may have at least 36 different causes so trying to pinpoint a particular reason for any dementia based on symptoms alone is dang near impossible.the only way to be certain about any dementia diagnosis is after death and with an autopsy. for my dad, the neurologist thought he had lewy bodies (like robin williams) but he actually had alz based on the autopsy results.if you can, try to immediately find a medical provider in your area that specializes in the bredesen protocol treatment methods (also called recode). this will help to give her the greatest chance to maybe improve if y’all choose to go this way. having seen six relatives die from alz, am convinced that doing something is better than waiting to be devoured. feel free to look at my blog (same name) if you’d like to read more about own journey having witnessed alz (including my mom) as diagnosed three weeks ago. she and i are going to bredesen-trained providers in texas and, even if it doesn’t work, then we must try.sending you all compassion and clarity during such overwhelming loss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/puzw26/what_kind_of_dementia/,What kind of Dementia?

"two years ago was the last time i saw my grandma and while she was definitely aging, it wasn’t much other than a few more wrinkles and the occasional need of a walker. she still looked like my “gma”. 2020 was hard for my grandma and i think the isolation didn’t help her depression. i call my grandparents often and i started talking to my grandma less and less because she’d be too tired or not in a good mood; etc. may 2021 grandma is going through back surgery because there’s an issue with something in her spine. she still was herself though for the most part. definitely some changes but still my gma. last time i spoke to my gma was maybe a month ago. she called me, which she never does. by this point after her surgery things had begun to rapidly get worse. grandma was confused and unlike herself. she started talking about some unpleasant things from her past, confusing my grandpa with her dad. anyway, she called to tell me she didn’t know how much longer she had. i don’t know what she was referring to as far as memory or… you know. i’m sorry. i’m trying to be as honest as possible here and i’m still really processing this. it doesn’t help that my grandparents live over 1,000 miles away. i’m getting all of my information either via my grandpa or my mom essentially, and sometimes the information conflicts. my grandpa has been under so much stress the last few months. anyway, a week ago grandma was placed in memory care. my grandpa made the choice, and the facility seems lovely. he sent a video of my grandma the other day when he was visiting and he’s just holding her hand while she’s laying in bed crying out. it’s just a video of her starring at the ceiling and moaning and yelling. it’s so sad. my grandma is unrecognizable. she’s frail, she’s small, her hair is so grey. i’ve never seen her without brown hair. why is she crying? is she okay? grandpa said the doctors are going to put her on medicine, but i haven’t gotten anyone to tell me the name of the medicine yet. i just think mom and grandpa have forgotten. grandpa says it should help her. i hope it works."," so sorry you are going through this. it can be traumatizing witnessing someone fall apart like that. if you've spent time in nursing homes and some parts of hospitals, it becomes clear how common and unsettling it is. we have an illness- and death-avoidant culture i think in large part because of how difficult it is to experience the brutal sides of aging.the crying/yelling/moaning can be for a number of reasons. when the brain deteriorates, it can drastically change how someone behaves. it might be because they are emotionally labile, it might be because they are in pain (but can't vocalize it), it might be because they are confused/delusional/hallucinating, and in many cases it's completely spontaneous. my mom had some acute brain issues three weeks ago that caused her to scream for a nurse in between normal sentences while having conversations. she was doing it reflexively, like how many people conceptualize tourette's syndrome.the ""good"" news is that it's manageable. when someone is suffering like that, the pain can be numbed if it exists, and the brain can be calmed down with medication. there are people called geriatric psychiatrists who specialize in this. when people reach such a dire state, they can be mellowed out and not have to suffer continuously. it will take some time to tinker with the medications but there should be some improvement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/putu7y/mom_sent_video_of_grandma_that_grandpa_took_the/,Mom sent video of Grandma that Grandpa took the other day.

"sorry, this is a long rant because i have nowhere else to put these words.                 my grama was 94, and was diagnosed with dementia about 8 years ago. it's been a really difficult grind, especially for my mother (who ended up being her primary caregiver). for the majority of those years, dementia magnified the worst parts of my grandmother's personality. before she became frail and confused, she was manipulative and abusive.                  my grama was a textbook narcissist and spent decades deeply planting guilt into my mother about anything she could. if my grandmother was bored, she would create fake reasons why my mother *had* to come over immediately. sometimes it was a made up fight with a family member, sometimes she pretended to be sick, sometimes she would demand to go shopping only to purchase things she insisted on returning the next day. everything was an excuse to control my mother and force her to spend all her time with my grandmother. we lived 45 minutes from her apartment, so dropping everything to cater to my grama’s every whim wasn’t as easy as just stopping by. if my mother attempted to tell her no, it was met with tears and the typical ‘you don’t love me, how could you do this to me, after all i’ve done for you, i guess i’ll just walk my frail body out into the street and take myself to the mall’. my family developed some very deep resentment towards my grandmother for how much time she’s stolen from our lives. the phone calls never ended, usually 3-5 per day, and most of them aggressive and cruel. my mom is the most beautiful soul i’ve ever known, and would listen in tears as her mother spewed vile, ungrateful words at her. my family attempted to convince her to stop answering the phone, but abuse is a tricky habit to kick and she had her claws in my mom for the long haul. our energy switched from trying to rescue her to realizing that she wont ever give up on my grandmother, so the only thing we could do was support and console her in the tough times.                     my mother is the youngest of 5 daughters, all currently around 60-67 years old now. through their entire lives, my grandparents would constantly pit them against each other, using gossip, as a form of entertainment. this created a lot of rifts between the sisters, as everyone felt like they were never good enough and other daughters were favoured. through the years, caring for either of my grandparents has always fallen onto my mother. every other sister has walked away and left my mother the responsibility of handling all aspects of my grandmothers life. i understand the want for self preservation, but my grandmother was still a human who needed to be cared for, and the laws in canada make it very difficult to put a person into a care home if they don’t want to be there. my grandmother was very good at having a sweet personality to strangers, which meant doctors, psws, etc. were unhelpful when my mother asked for her to be recommended multiple times for external care, and to leave grama to her own devices could be considered elder neglect. in times when my mother was begging for a lifeline, in dire need of being saved, her sisters convinced themselves that my mother ‘wanted this’. so they carried on with their lives, sometimes they would have meaningless visits with my grandmother where they saw her nice personality for 30 minutes every other week, then pretend like they’re helping by distracting her for my mothers sake’. they never thought to start the laundry, or the dishwasher, or take out the trash, or clean the toilet full of excrement because my grandmother was too senile to notice she left it like that. no that was work for the youngest daughter, that was *her* job.                 and then my grandmother declined. the dementia made her personality more aggressive, more manipulative, but now with the added confusion of trying to figure out whether the situations she complained about were real or a hallucination. to people on the outside, they saw her as a sad, confused old woman, and how could you hate someone who can’t help themselves? when things progressed enough, i started seeing her current state as a separate person to her old personality and just accepted that she has no control over the choices she makes now.                 but now she’s gone, and i’m not sad. i’m relieved knowing my mother has gained some freedom, although i suspect *mental* freedom is still further down the path. it feels strange seeing my extended family, cousins, aunts, all posting touching tributes on facebook about how lovely she was, and how deeply she’ll be missed.  i feel like they either lived completely oblivious to the real person my grandmother was, or they just didn’t care about what my mother dealt with. people keep offering condolences to me and i think they’re shocked by how cold i must seem about it all. it was just another wednesday for me, i didn’t cry, i probably won’t."," 🪄 the internet wishes you a very long, fulfilling life. ...move along now",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pu73ht/my_grandmother_passed_away_and_i_feel_uneasy/,"My grandmother passed away, and I feel uneasy about being relieved."

"does anyone know about, or have experience with, the pace program? i am considering it for an unloved one because it provides all medical and associated care, in the home and in contracted facilities, and they provide what many families do in terms of scheduling medical appointments, getting to them, coordinating care, and more. this family member lives alone because he walked out of his marriage, his grown kids rarely see him and only one is involved and he's running her ragged. he can't afford in home care for long and is increasingly unable to manage in his apartment without at least daily visits to be sure the stove is off, he takes his meds, the sheets are washed and put back on the bed, etc. the pace program is private pay or medicaid (same monthly fee regardless). i'm sure it's a cost saving for the state, and i'm trying to figure out if it deprives the patient in order to save money, or not.thanks, if anyone knows about it in their county."," i read a study a couple of nights ago that compiled data from several studies; so it was a meta analysis. interestingly, they aren't really saving money. family satisfaction was the same or better than for people in other care. there are fewer hospitalizations. life expectancy a bit longer. i'm interested in it for my unloved one because no one in the family wants to or can do the care or visiting or arrange everything or take him to medical appointments. he will balk about giving up his doctor, at losing self agency, at everything.but we were sick of him long before dementia began, and i think it's more responsible to get him into a program that will look after him than to abandon him or have family resenting him all the time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ptspt3/pace_anyone/,PACE?

"hello, my (f20)  84-year-old sort-of-grandfather is dying. he's had dementia for the last eight years or so, but it's getting to the point where he's not swallowing much anymore. i've barely seen him in the last five years as i lived on another island, but have just moved back in the last few months. i'm going to go spend as much time as possible with him, but i just don't know how to show him he's not alone, and that he's loved. he has very little family, and none around, so my family are all he has these days so it's important to me that he's got someone there with him.my mum mentioned that the last time she saw him he was listening to a performer that had come to cheer up the rest home, the music seemed to really cheer him up. as i'm a singer, and currently studying opera, i wondered if i should go sit with him and sing to him, but it scares me a little, and i'm not sure what to sing. it'd be just us in the room due to covid restrictions, but i just don't know what to sing to him, or if it's a good idea at all. i've only known him since i was little, and i don't remember what he liked musically, he spent all his time talking about astronomy, i'm really missing the times he was still with us. sorry if this is all a little hectic, i'm pretty shocked about his sudden decline and am just hoping to bring him a little light in his last few weeks.if anyone has any ideas ,or song suggestions they'd be much appreciated."," i didn’t  get to sing to him today. he was sleeping, he’s not really doing anything other than sleeping these days, it  seems. i didn’t know how to be around him anymore, so i tried to talk to him a little, reminded him he was loved, and said good bye. i’m not sure he’s still there anymore, it doesn’t feel like it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ptspa5/wondering_if_i_should_go_sing_to_my_dying_sorta/,[deleted by user]
"hi everyonei’m reaching out in this sub and i hope it’s allowed (sorry if i’m breaking any rules) because last week i was told that my mother (58f) was diagnosed with early onset dementia. it kind of blindsided me honestly. she had breast cancer a few years ago and absolutely kicked it’s arse but wasn’t ever the same since. in the past few years she’s really slowed down and even in the past few months i’ve noticed a huge change in her. a few months ago i (23f) was working but i’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for the last ten years and it’s really perked it’s little head up recently due to a break up and so i’m no longer working full time due to just not being able to cope with things. at first i kind of thought that because i was out of the house so much (at work, staying at my then partners place for extended periods) that maybe this is how my mom had always been and because i was home a lot more i was noticing it more i guess? but my dad sat me down after her hospital appointment last week and broke the news to me. i haven’t really spoken to them about it since. i got very upset when i was told and in the week that’s passed every day feels more and more like a struggle to wrap my head around. i remember my nan (her mother) having dementia and not knowing who we were when i was a kid and she died in her 60s or early 70s. i haven’t really wanted to ask my parents about what will happen to or with mom because honestly i’m too scared to have that conversation. having conversations about it makes it feel really real and set in stone and i know that regardless of talking about it with them it won’t change anything. i feel awful for my mom. i remember she was super independent and since she had cancer she’s completely shifted and is dependent on my dad as her carer now. the whole thing has been a really big shift for all of us and this just feels like a kick in the teeth. i am booking a session with my therapist and hoping to go through my feelings in therapy so i guess what i’m asking for here is:1. what’s to be expected? i’m sure things are different from person to person and things vary but are there things i can expect to see happen or that are likely to happen? 2. how can i support my family and also myself during this? 3. has anyone else had a parent or someone diagnosed with early onset dementia and how did they cope and things in the weeks/months following?again, i’m so sorry if this isn’t allowed. this isn’t something i ever imagined looking into especially this early on in my life and yeah i’m just trying to navigate this whole thing in a healthy and informed way."," must be very hard to hear this news. having seen what the regular dementia does, early onset is even more cruel. good move to get counselling now. i would recommend counselling and also speaking with the alzheimer's society - here in canada they provide free of charge access to social workers and medical system coordinators who have been incredibly helpful  to me and provided a lot of guidance on the ""what if"" and ""how to"" questions. this disease takes various shapes and forms but being more prepared for the worse case scenarios (was dealing with psychosis and aggressive delusions) gave me a lot of reassurance. other than that the best advice i received was to not overplan as you have no way of knowing what comes next and how soon. just be mentally prepared that this will undoubtedly get worse and worse - may be slowly, stepwise or rapidly and can take may forms (personality change, adls, delusions, wandering, etc.). the progression charts help to see roughly in which stage the lo is in and what to expect on adls and executive functioning. the other main thing is to help your dad so that he doesn't burn out and develop severe health issues or his own, or worse. help him keep sane. this is incredibly, incredibly tough on the caregiver, even those that are ""natural"" at this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ptqbgu/struggling_with_receiving_news/,Struggling with receiving news

"my mother was diagnosed with dementia over three years ago.  i helped my father take care of her and he brought one of my sisters over to help.  he passed away about a year later.  my sister ended up with a pretty serious heart condition, so i do most of it on my own now.  she does some cooking which does help, but can't lift mom or anything else really.  i handle medication and basically everything else.  i am her legal guardian and falling behind with what i'm supposed to be doing.  i will end up back in court and that worries me but that's another post altogether.up until yesterday my mom was in pretty good spirits.  i get her up late at night to take her to the bathroom and she would smile at me.  i'd admittedly go overboard with kisses on her cheek or forehead and she'd say any number of random things like ""you need to stop"" or ""i'm gonna knock you out"".  i think of it as payback for all the times she embarrassed me growing up.yesterday morning my mom was congested.  hours beforehand i had gotten her up and she coughed, so i turned the fan off and took her to the bathroom.  i hadn't noticed then but thinking about it now i realize she didn't smile at me.  she seemed ok, she relieved herself, i helped her get back to bed.  hours later was when i first heard congestion, and she seemed really out of it.  normally she gets up a bit later and not early morning, but i got her up and got her something to eat.  she seemed fine eating for the most part, but quiet.  took her to the bathroom and the congestion was more noticeable.  i helped her clear her nose as best as i could.  she wouldn't blow her nose but i was able to clear her nostrils a bit.  i called a pharmacy and asked which cold medicine would be best, they said robitussin dm, i went and got some along with groceries we needed.  on the way home i nearly fell asleep driving.  got home and almost passed out in the driveway.  managed to get inside and start putting things away.i stopped to give her some of the medicine.  she wasn't making much sense but she seemed to be getting better so i decided i would get some rest and check on her later.  what was supposed to be two hours became four or so.  my sister woke me up to tell me she was leaving as she had a doctor's appointment the next day.  she had put some vaporub on mom and mom was breathing better.a few minutes later i got up and checked on mom.  she did seem to be breathing better, but still wasn't speaking  much, and what she did say made no sense and came out with less strength than how she had been speaking the last couple of months.  she was still congested which made sense.  went to the bathroom on herself, and i had a tougher time than usual cleaning her up but i got through it.  gave her more cold medicine, then her regular meds later.she moans and cries in her sleep now.  had not seen her do this before.  looked it up and it's a late stage thing.  i always knew things could and most likely would go like this, with the sudden change, but i guess i let myself believe it would happen much later than it has.i have done the best i could but it hasn't been enough.  my own life is a mess.  i put my mother first because she did so for me, and because she can't do anything for herself any more.  when she's asleep i either sleep too or maybe watch something or play a video game just to try and relax, but i feel like i shouldn't even be doing that sometimes.  so much is piling up.  i've been living at home my whole life.  never quite got going.  i hate to say it as if it's an excuse, but i have been dealing with depression for most of my life.  i've been afraid of what happens next.  when my mother's time comes there will be so much to do and i will barely know where to start.  i only meant to talk about my mother here, but i also want to say don't end up like me.  make something of yourself before its too late."," i agree with all of the comments!  i do think it will help to reach out to a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis and then maybe get some support for you.  i, too,  suffer from depression and cannot imagine shouldering this alone.sending group hug!this is so hard!  people that step up and take care of those in need have my highest respect.  at the end of the day you can know you are doing the best thing by being there for her.  don't feel guilty asking for some help though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pt6v7b/i_think_my_moms_time_is_coming_soon/,I think my Mom's time is coming soon

"for the past several years i have worked in multiple nursing homes and evidently have spent much time around the dementia/alzheimer’s/ palliative care population as well as have witnessed the varying degrees of cognitive status, mental awareness, and behaviors associated with this population. just recently i have began to wonder about the connection between this population and spirituality and the possibility of their being some vague/general awakening of a “sixth sense” (clairvoyance, psychic, medium, communicating with the afterlife, etc) that occurs within this population. something a bit odd happened to me today that really got me thinking about this and i’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar incident or can relate. it’s kind of a bit of a rant…so please bear with me here…     about 1.5 months ago a new admit was placed on my caseload-extremely pleasantly confused, repeated the same stories from childhood multiple times in a 20 minute period, and comedically blunt (nothing abnormal for a dementia dx). one day i walk into the patient’s room and she is sitting in her chair, looking out the window, and crying. when i asked her what’s wrong, she tells me that her late husband was standing out the window and waving at her and that she misses him dearly. we spend the better part of the next hour talking about him and she tells me that he died ~3 years ago, how he died, the story of when they first met, and a plethora other outstanding attributes about him (repeating the same stories 6x and going on tangents) but at the conclusion of our session she seems to be doing better. before i leave her room she blurts out:  “do everything you can and go out with that guy and go see that movie and go to the park and maybe bring yourself something to eat, like dinner, and you all have a nice time and enjoy y’all selves.”(i immediately wrote this on a post-it note and have it taped on the door of my apartment so i see it every morning before i go to work)     the weird part about this is that a month or two beforehand, i met a guy at a local park (we sort of had met beforehand through a mutual acquaintance) at a group gathering. not to go into too much irrelevant detail, the context/environment i had met this guy in was awkward and i questioned  how i could get to know this guy better without things getting more awkward.  i never once told this woman anything about this (gotta keep your professional and personal lives separate 😂) and whether it was a coincidental tangent or some underlying intuitive notion is beyond me. the whole thing was just really weird.        every so often (couple times a year) i visit my paternal grandparents’ grave sites, not to necessarily speak to them, but i go there to reflect on life, and in a way, pray (for lack of a better term-i’m not a  particularly religious person) and ask for guidance or seek clarification for whatever crossroad or question i have in any aspect of my life at that given time. i’ve been doing this for many years  and though they both passed before i was born, i was named after them-so in a way i feel some connection to them and have always  had a little belief that they are watching and guiding me, wherever they may be.   i had visited their gravesites about 2-3 weeks before this interaction with this woman and the thoughts on finding a life partner and raising a family had been heavily on my mind that day.      fast forward to today. i’m doing work at a different nursing home and i have a new patient recently admitted to the facility. unlike the other lady, this one is in a bit more of an emotional distress, however is pleasant nonetheless (also confused as well, but doesn’t go on into long repetitive tangents). the first time i had this patient (last week) they requested i open the window so they could wave to some relative (relative was not outside the window, nor do i have any knowledge there was a relative outside the window). today they did the same thing and were convinced that there was someone out the window they were waving to, however i did not see anyone. while i’m with them, they all of a sudden begin to rub my stomach and ask about the “baby inside of me.” i explain there is no baby inside of me and that i’m on period and definitely not pregnant (i also haven’t been with anyone in awhile, but clearly left this out to my patient). she proceeds to continue vigorously touching my stomach, trying to find “the baby” and then says “you can be fertilize’n.” when i explain again that i’m not pregnant, she continues to look at me perplexed and in an unconvinced tone says “well i guess you know your body better than i do.” please note i’m 5’2 and 130-135 lbs.       so how is it that these two women, in very separate places,  are waving to people that i can not visually see out the window and  making these really strange statements to me about relevant things that i discussed with my dead grandparents?

"i could use some advice. i’m fairly certain my mom (late 60s) has dementia, if not alzheimer’s (her father had it).i don’t have the best relationship with her, and i live a few hours away. she’s currently living with her siblings; this only happened a few weeks ago and i didn’t know about it until it was done. unfortunately, they’ve realized she’s not great and now they want her out.she’s obviously having short-term memory loss, like she forgot who her sister was. she sometimes remembers after you’ve told her a lot. she also says she’s not having a problem and it’s just stress or anxiety.she has no assets and a mountain of debt, so i’m concerned about getting power of attorney and having to deal with her finances. she won’t listen to me (never has), or go to the doctor, and i can’t force her cause i don’t live there and she doesn’t yet have a doctor here in a new state. i also have no money to put her in a home, and she can’t live with me even if i wanted her to.i feel like her siblings have thrown a bomb at me by bringing her to my state without me knowing and then telling me i have to take care of her.what do i do? where do i start? i’m overwhelmed and have no idea how to help someone who lives hours away and doesn’t want help.thanks in advance."," would recommend starting asap with a licensed and reputable (board certified) estate planning attorney in your area (don’t just go with any attorney). the ethical ones will be willing to negotiate with you to pay a flat fee rather than an hourly rate (as long as you do all the legwork to gather all the documents they will need). since it sounds like she has no money and few assets (along with debt), then ask the attorney to help you sign her up for medicaid. there are attorneys that will help you do this so please make sure it’s your first question to them. in case it’s not clear, medicaid is a federal reimbursement program which means that any assets your mom has would be used to pay for a nursing home either before or after her death. or, if she has $0.00 assets then she may owe nothing but keep in mind that income, cars, investments, and homes count as assets. since estates (even for $0.00) get complex, it’s another reason to start with an attorney.this may sound both daunting and expensive but, trust me, you can’t afford *not* to do this. to find out if the attorney you may want to hire has any shady results then check with their licensing board in your state - typically, this is a free online search with immediate results (in texas, this is the state bar) but it may have other names in other states. also, if you’re able to gather all requested documents then (in 2017) we paid a flat fee (about $1,700) for the attorney to handle everything from start to finish. a bargain for compassionate and expert help that you won’t find anywhere else. above all, don’t try to do this yourself because there are too many complex legal considerations both now and in the future! sending y’all the feels from a daughter who has seen six relatives die with alz (and will always die trying not to be #7)!you can do this. am an only child who’s called buffy the dementia slayer for a reason! 🤠",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psy2aj/mom_may_have_dementia_and_im_overwhelmed/,[deleted by user]
"i live with my grandma and grandpa. my grandpa is 83. his memory has been going pretty bad and he doesn’t know where he is anlot at night.the other night my grandma woke me up and my grandpa was holding her hostage on the couch with a flashlight and would threaten to hit her every time she moved. i walked in and sit down and he kept threatening me too. i managed to get the flashlight from him because he sit it down to put his shoes on. at 2am. he then grabbed a pillow and smacked me in the head with it. and threatened me and was using vulgar language. he had no idea who we were or where he was at.fast forward to a couple of hours of sitting on the couch and talking to him getting cursed at and threatened he finally let us “go to bed.” he’s a weak small man so i’m not physically afraid of him. he stayed up about an hour after we went to bed and i got up and he was fine. the same nice guy i’ve always knew. the next morning he was fine. said he slept great all night when we asked about it.any advice for this? i’m in my 30’s and stay with my grandparents and help take care of them but i work second shift and i fear he will try and hurt my grandma one night before i get off work. she’s stronger than him, but he tries to find weapons to hit people with or at least he did the other night. i fear he will find a knife or a pair of scissors but we’ve hidden them pretty well. i told my grandma all i know to do is call the police when he’s like that but i don’t want her to because i live in the south and the police beat people and beat them in jail here. not all places but in my county they do. and i fear they’d try to beat him up because i know he’d be combative. what should i do?"," i am so sorry you're dealing with this, thank you for caring for your grandparents. it's terrible to be young and dealing with dementia (i am too). i hope your grandma will be okay, i really feel for her.i would call the alzheimer’s association 24/7 helpline! (800.272.3900) they're so so nice and available around the clock, 365 days a year. totally free service, no cost to us. they may have more suggestions.definitely a medication check and adjustment by his doctor would be great! uti checks are important too. it sounds like something is making him paranoid/combative and a check up could help.i am glad you're hiding knives, scissors, etc. you may need to keep anything sharp/heavy in a lock box (with a key or combination). they make necklaces with a device that beeps loudly (when pressed) if your grandma needs help alerting you in the middle of the night. they sell them on amazon. it's understandable to be afraid of the police especially in certain areas. as another suggested, i like the idea of telling the police ahead of time that he has dementia, just in case you need to call them for an emergency. it could reduce his chances of being harmed by them. if you guys need urgent help is there a strong family member or family friend that could stop by in an emergency? for example if you do not want to call the police? if you don't have such a person perhaps you could let a neighbor, church members etc know your situation. someone might be willing to help. hopefully things improve and the medications will help. let us know how it goes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psvup3/long_story_but_i_need_advice/,[deleted by user]
"my grandmother has had dementia for nearly four years now. this past week she has stopped being able to use the bathroom by herself. the hospice nurse put her in a diaper but she takes it off and poops everywhere on the floor. also two days ago she stopped eating breakfast, lunch and dinner, which isn’t like her. the only thing she’ll eat is an ice cream cone. does this mean she is close to passing?"," you may want to ask the hospice doctor to evaluate her again? the reason am asking is that   when my dad was admitted to hospice (in texas) the only way he got in was by a doctor certifying his condition as within 18 months of death and he died 10 months later. of course, it’s impossible to make an exact death prediction, but would expect that hospice can help with this request if y’all choose to do so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psv39j/i_need_some_info/,I need some info
"my grandma is 74 and has awful dementia. my sister currently lives with her and is her provider. my grandma’s dementia symptoms revolve around paranoia and if she isn’t gonna die or be killed today it’s sure gonna happen tomorrow. or she’ll go to prison. lately it’s gotten so bad for my sister she can’t even cook for her because how verbally abusive she is with my sister because she is convinced she’s gonna kill her.i started care for her about 3 weeks ago. she’s had good and bad days. today was awful. she threw most of her medication and plenty of items at me because i wasn’t convinced she was dying. i had to move her a few times because she was so frantic i was afraid she would hurt herself on the stove or something else and she has responded by hitting or punching me. the anger and frustration surged through my body and i had to goosfraba myself snd remind myself this person is sick. like… sick sick. nothing works on her either. xanax, cbd products, nothing. this woman is immune to everything. i found this subreddit about a week or two ago snd just seeing everyone’s posts and responses has helped me so much and made me feel less alone. so i just wanted to say thank you. thank you for helping me not have a breakdown."," i'm so sorry you're going through this. i agree with the other posters that this is the time for anti-psychotics and/or facility placement. we went through similar stuff with my dad: he was (and is) plagued with paranoid delusions that lead him to become very agitated and often aggressive or violent. anti-psychotics helped, but it got so bad and no med changes seemed to fix it that we eventually put him in memory care, because we couldn't live our lives terrified of him and of what he'd do next. he tried to strangle me, tried to push my mom down the stairs, etc. we all slept with our doors locked and bars because he'd wake up confused (and maybe still stuck in a nightmare) in the middle of the night and bust in and attack us. didn't get much sleep for a while there.  so, yeah. first, push hard for a med adjustment and see if that works. in the meantime, research memory care facilities in your area. fact is that a few beleaguered family members on 24/7 duty just can't live with this level of insanity. it requires trained staff working in shifts and a team of medical professionals to even begin to handle it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psupgw/everyones_responses_are_reassuring_thank_you/,Everyone’s responses are reassuring.

"my grandmother was in assisted living type place and i ent to visit her. she was happily surprised to see me and we sat on the couch and spoke a moment and she gave me a five dollar bill (i was in my thirties at the time, lol) before getting up to go into the kitchen for drinks. never got the drink but she was just as happily surprised to see me when she wandered back out as she was the first time and gave me another five dollar bill again. this happened about eight times as i kept putting the money back in her purse.i really enjoyed the experience and it just made me feel good that she was so happy to see me everytime."," it can be really bittersweet. i’m lucky, my dad is amiable and easygoing even when he’s having a bad day. he’s always happy to have “company” (we live together). he asks about my day, my work, my family (sometimes he will comment that he hasn’t seen kadora (me) in a while, and that’s pretty heartbreaking. i usually tell him she’s at work, and he tells me how proud he is of her 😭❤️). try to hang on to the good moments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psj40x/its_not_all_bad/,It's not all bad?
"i have someone in their 90s in memory care. i visit her few times a week because i don't want her to feel lonely. i ask her if the staff is treating her well and tell her to let me know if any staff mistreat her. i check in just to make sure she's not being neglected in anyway.here's the issue, she's in late stage of dementia. last visit she asked me how i found her. i saw her 3 days ago and it pains me that she can't remember that. i'm also dealing with major health issue at the moment. so it's a challenge to see her so often and i'm just wondering if it matters at all because she won't remember any of it. she's in a great facility so i don't worry too much about her treatment and her care. some days she's back to her old self but most days she'll have hard time remembering things."," really good question, and i think these 2 first comments are spot on;  visit her as often as you can and as long as there are at least some moments she remembers you, and take care of your own life and family.  this is a cruel disease where the body remains, but the sole and spirit of your loved one is stolen away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psg4zl/does_visiting_help/,[deleted by user]
this is not an exaggeration. she gets up and sits down over and over and over. she repeats her self for what she wants over and over and over almost like a chant. she doesn’t sleep at night despite multiple sedatives and valium. my dad hasn’t slept in 3 nights i’ve slept a bit more but still not a healthy amount. she is so nasty now as well. i know it’s not the real her but it takes a toll regardless. she’s moving into a rehab facility tomorrow and then hopefully ultimately a memory care unit., i've worked in care homes. a lot of people with dementia are restless at night. one of the things they lose is their circadian rhythm and if sedation doesn't work then that might not be the answer. might be better off trying to get on a list for psychiatric input. i've seen risperdone change someone almost overnight. while it does have a slight sedating affect its not a sedative it's an anti psychotic. alternatively something like melatonin a few hours before bed can trigger a sleep cycle. good luck,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psfrqd/keeps_getting_up_every_2_minutes/,Keeps getting up every 2 minutes
"early onset dementia stemming from tbi from a major brain operation in 2001. sometimes it feels like i'm looking after a 61 year old toddler, and recently she screamed at me to make her a twitter account, and fell for the peter popoff ""miracle water"" scam; neither of which she remembers. besides putting her to bed (because it only happens at night), what more can i do without my adhd getting in the way?"," she doesn't need internet access or a landline. just like you would do a toddler, redirect her when she mentions it. let her fold towels, put a puzzle together, look at family pictures, etc. if you have financial poa,  open a new bank account and leave a little money for her in the old bank account. if these tantrums are happening in the evenings she could be having sundowners. if that's the case, start with pulling the shades down early in the evening before dark. then gradually turn off lights in the house to help her biological clock realize its getting night time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psb5kp/how_do_i_better_help_my_mother_unit/,How do I better help my mother unit?

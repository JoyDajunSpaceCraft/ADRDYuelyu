"thanks everyone for the advice, insight and encouragement. after the 1 year struggle of caring for my mother with dementia / alzheimer's, i placed her in an assisted living facility yesterday.  i've been overwhelmed by a swath of emotions the past 24 hours; guilt, remorse, sadness.... followed by relief.she did not take too kindly to being moved into a new environment, but i'm sure she will adjust soon. and what's most certain is she will now get the care she deserves, and my brothers and i will get our lives back.other than my gratitude for your support over the past year, reading my rants and offering advice, my final words on this sub are definitely going to have to be, ""f*** dementia."""," on second thought; before i bow out from this subreddit and move on with my life, ***ama***.background:  mother diagnosed september 2015 with ftd with signs of alzheimer's, early-onset at 49 years old.  moved in with sons (my brothers and i). went through several stages of dementia with signs of alzheimer's during time at sons house.  after hiring elder-care lawyers, care home placement specialists and working the u.s. healthcare system, we successfully placed her in an assisted living facility in december 2016.**ama**",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5iv9v3/thanks_for_the_support/,Thanks For The Support

"hey everyone! my grandmother was diagnosed with ftd and once she passed, we had her brain donated for research and they discovered she specifically had pick's disease. that diagnosis explained a lot- she had dramatic behavioral shifts prior to diagnosis which only got worse as time went on. to be honest, i was 2 when she was diagnosed and never really knew my grandmother distinct from dementia (she passed away when i was 18). *this is background info*through all this, it's led me to working on some research regarding ftd (although curious about other forms of dementia) and impulse control issues (specifically hyper-sexuality, which has had the least amount of research) which include alcoholism, hoarding, and impulsive or inappropriate behavior, such as overeating, outbursts of frustration, touching strangers, urinating in public or diminished social tact. i know this is long so please bear with me- inappropriate sexual behaviors which can be anything from increased porn, inappropriate touching of others, sexually aggressive behavior, overtly friendly, lewd comments, etc in ftd (dementia/alzheimers/parkinson/lbd/etc) are pretty taboo. i'm curious if doctor's not talking to patients and caregivers about this behavioral change has an impact on caregivers and their relationship to the person with dementia. would understanding that the person with dementia isn't in control of these behaviors and that it's the ftd (and possibly medication for ftd) going to strip clubs more, engaging in online relationships etc? could this reduce resentment, divorce/separation/ early placement in a facility? would it make family member's more compassionate (while probably still frustrated) about their loved ones behavior? is this something that as caregivers, you wish more people spoke about so that you could understand what's going on better?i'm working on a survey now and would truly appreciate any input of experiences you've had with your loved one, their dementia, and increased innapropriate sexual behaviors. really hope this dissertation opens up awareness around this and can help caregivers understand these behavioral changes. thank you so much for even reading this!!"," this is interesting to me - i've had my 87 yo father with dementia living with me for a few months now. he has, in storage, a lot of vhs porn that he had been used to watching in his old apartment. a couple of weeks ago he asked me about getting pictures of naked ladies.  i actually made one of my boys go into a bookstore yesterday to get copies of playboy and penthouse.  but after reading this i'm wondering if i should actually give them to my dad?  what if it does cause issues with his behavior?  i'm personally concerned because he already sometimes forgets i'm his daughter and thinks i'm his wife (eek!).does anyone know what to expect?

"for those of you who have or had a loved one with dementia, what do you wish someone had told you early on in the process? if you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself? the purpose of this question is two-fold. i am a neuropsych in clinical practice and it's always helpful to understand my patients and their families better. i'm also writing a book on dementia for family members/loved ones and i really want to make it as useful as possible. "," one piece of advice i'd give any prime carer is to question and oversee everything! a true clinician and thinker would welcome any questioning and be open to discussion. as a prime carer of my mother suffering dementia i accompany her to gp appointments, psych appointments, hospital appointments the lot. the psychiatrist is really proactive and wants the family to be involved and researching themselves.one reason i try to now oversee everything is because, my mother who was diagnosed with dementia a couple of months ago was taking a tablet known by psychiatrists to affect the brain and enhance cognitive decline. once this was spotted, the psychiatrist wrote a letter to the gp asking for this tablet to be replaced by another that did not affect the brain. i was really upset and angry when i attended the gp appointment with my mum to find not only did the gp not read the letter or my mums notes that were passed on way before we were due to meet, but i had to give her a print out to read the letter in front of us, for her to turn to us and say ""i will prescribe **"" (the tablet that caused severe mental impairment). so now not only has she been given this golden information in 3 different formats but has now come up with the incorrect solution. after questioning her decision rather furiously she realized the mistake and give us the tablet the psychiatrist recommended.3 months on from this my mum is a totally different person. no more hallucinations, language is more fluid and sentence structures intact. although memory is still impaired to some degree it is a remarkable turn around. we know as a family the dementia will always be there from now on but one tablet has transformed my mums way of living for the time being.i have learn't to question everything but also realize even gp's and doctors in other areas outside of psychiatry/mental diseases simply do not know enough to make informed decisions when dealing with patients will mental impairments. just because they are doctors does not automatically make them the most informed. on a day to day basis i find not stressing my mum out by asking specific questions helps a lot. if i find her stuck on a sentence or word, i simply try to bypass this by moving on with the conversation or offering my sentences around it to make the conversation flow. i can see the frustration building up quickly when a word wont spring to mind. its heartbreaking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5hxutr/what_do_you_wish_you_had_known/,What do you wish you had known?
"he's always had anger problems anyway, so i don't know if this is him being normal or the anger is designed to stop us questioning things that are genuinely problematic. here are two examples:- dad is given a repeat prescription to drop off at the doctors. leaves in his car, comes back.- days later, the surgery says that no repeat prescription was filed. i ask him about it and he says i never asked him to go, i never gave him the prescription.- we find the prescription in his pocket. he says he must've forgotten to put it in.- i asked what he did that day when he drove off in his car- did he forget in the drive what he went for? did he not wonder why he was in the car?- he got angry and said that what he did with his own time was his business and he wouldn't explain to us what he did.december- dad is asked to give our cat her de-fleaing tablet. he gives her a tablet then asks me what we give her for fleas. i say that we just gave her it and he said no, that was a de-worming tablet.- i ask why he gave her a dewormer when i told him she had fleas. he said that she didn't get one last month. i ask what we are going to do about the fleas because she needs a de-fleaing. he says that we have run out of deflea tablets. i say that we need to get more.- he checks the tablets and says that he did give her a deflea tablet. gets very annoyed when i try to check what exactly he gave her. when i remind him that he just told me that he gave her a dewormer, he gets angry and says he has now told me he gave her a de flea tablet so i should stop worrying. i say i am worried because he seems confused about what he gave her. he is very angry.- he says that if he told me he got on a bus on rails i should know that he means a train. i say that if he confused a bus and a train i would want to double-check what medicine he just gave my kids.these kind of things worry me because it's like he forgets what he's doing in a second, he literally walked downstairs then asked me what we use to deflea the cat. you just gave her the tablet! he drove off to the doctors, which is 30 seconds away...yet forgot in that time what he was driving for. this worries me because if i forgot what i was doing in the car i would ask people until i worked it out. but he just took it as normal that he forgot why he was there, and drove back.in other ways he seems completely normal. he's quite high on the autism spectrum so he's always had problems with compassion, empathy and social situations. he did take a memory test at the doctors but it seems to be things like, what year is it. he can tell you that! he can tell you the year, the date, current politics, etc. but then he can walk into a room that i've decorated for christmas, and get upset that i have moved something 6 inches- without realising that the entire room has been tidied and decorated. all he sees is that his one thing has been slightly moved, and he can't see the context- that the entire room has been decorated, and maybe that explains why his thing was moved."," i agree with the advice to try and get medical advice.  the behavior of lying to cover memory lapses is familiar to me, as my grandma has been getting worse at it.    * a snowman decoration lost its hat during storage, but grandma insisted it was there when she put it up and that it must have blown away.  i was just trying to ask where she got it out from but she was lying evasively and i found the hat exactly in the box where it was.  i don't think she could reconcile that she'd put the decoration up without noticing it missing a piece, so the only logical conclusion was that it was there and lost another way.  these mental gymnastics can go pretty far into the absurd sometimes (and when i recognize it i stop questioning her -- and try to figure it out without asking her).

"my dad was diagnosed with vascular dementia some years back and while it has been managed with medication over the last year or two he has gotten significantly worse. my step mum, let's call her wendy, told me that they'd advised his gp he was still driving and the gp said he was fine to continue unless they felt he was not safe or confident doing so (bear in mind my only source of info is wendy, any or all of what she has told me could be absolute rubbish). i first became seriously concerned about his ability to be driving when he vanished for 4 hours after wendy had sent him out to get milk from the shop which is less than a mile from where they live. i expressed my concern to her and her response was very brusque 'well the doctor says he's fine to drive'.at this point, i made an anonymous report to the dvla with my concerns, although of course you never get any kind of response due to data protection, and i never heard anything from wendy about any sort of follow up they'd had from them. although of course, this doesn't mean it didn't happen!a couple of weeks ago i received a phone call from her saying he had vanished again in the car, this time he disappeared from kent where they have a holiday home and drove all the way to almost back to where they live, he was gone for more than 15 hours. the police eventually found him sitting in the car, very upset and confused, he'd not eaten or had anything to drink the entire time.now, this is where stories divide. according to my mum, wendy told an old family friend the police took my dad's license when they found him, however, this is not what wendy told me. again, i contacted the dvla who again said basically they couldn't tell me anything and their advice was to contact the local police.i am reluctant to involve the police because the last thing i want to do is get my dad into trouble. he is not responsible for this situation, he has absolutely no awareness or memory of any of this! surely it is wendy's responsibility to stop him from putting himself and other people at risk? what it comes down to is she hasn't driven regularly for so long she has no wish to start now, add to this how difficult it would be to stop my dad from driving and convincing him he wasn't allowed to, i do have empathy for her, it's not a situation i would want to be in, my dad can still be a dominating personality.could i get some advice, has anyone else been in a similar situation? if i contact the police what action can they take and if he refuses to stop and wendy refuses to take control of the situation what is the long term outcome? i have tried on more than one occasion to talk to both of them about my concerns but it's either ignored or met with shrugged shoulders, and my dad has no idea what i'm talking about so just makes a joke out of it.it's an incredibly frustrating and concerning situation that i do not know how to handle in the best way for everyone concerned."," it could be as easy as ""lose"" the keys or pull the distributor cap. the thing is - he may have a legitimate need to get around to the doctor or store or other activities so there needs to be a way to provide acceptable transportation.  my dad lost his car. forgot where he left it and i did not worry one bit about that, it turned out the mechanic filed a lien on the car for the amount of repairs and that was the end of it - an expensive lesson.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5g955w/dad_has_dementia_still_driving_possibly_without_a/,"Dad has dementia, still driving (possibly without a license) and step mum won't stop him, what to do?

," i work in a memory care facility and most of the behaviors that i see can be helped with communication, especially to the people who have a hard time making a coherent sentence. everyone is different so it may not work every time or for every person, but i always try to listen to them and mimic their expressions, whether or not i truly understand what they are speaking about. ive noticed it seems to help them feel validated in their emotions and they trust me more if they feel like i am listening to them. this includes letting them search for the words they need. my coworkers usually aren't too keen on this, because it makes me move a little slower in my duties. but i would rather everyone be in a good mood than be up quickly!i also try to ask a lot of yes or no questions or offer them a few choices to pick from. everyone is more willing to do something if they feel as if they had a part in choosing it. of course there are times in which these aggressive behaviors are unavoidable, and in these times just be patient with yourself and whoever else may be working with them. as u/shelb_e said, hand holding and explaining in short, clear sentences helps too. and empathy! good luck to you.

"tl;dr: i just need to talk about my dad. i don't know what to do. his doctors say nothing is wrong, and my mom just takes them at their word. i'm home with him all day, everyday. *there is something wrong with my dad*, and i just don't know what, if anything, i can even do to help.my dad is just shy of his 73rd birthday, has cognitive issues that haven't been diagnosed, and a major hearing problem. anyone who talks to him for more than thirty seconds can tell there's something off about him, something that isn't all there. my mom has taken him to see neurologists and been with him to his visits with his primary care doctor, but from how she tells it, they all just kind of shrug and say ""well he seems fine to us!"" he has hearing aids, but refuses to wear them. i'm his 28 year old daughter, and my young son and i currently live with them after my breakup with my son's father. i'm not officially his caregiver, but i'm home all day during the week, partly because i care for my son, and partly to make sure if something happens to my dad, there's someone around to help. obviously, i'm not privy to all of his medical information, i can only go off of what my mom tells me. she goes with him to his appointments now, partly because he can't/wont give her any information from the doctors, and partly because we don't really trust him to drive safely anymore. more than that, when he would take the car to go places, he is out for much *much* longer than you'd think it'd take to go places, driving god-knows-where.even now, he will just straight up leave the house and catch the bus to what he says is the hardware store, but is gone for hours at a time. we try asking him about where he goes and what he spends the money on, and he either can't or won't tell us much beyond 'i went to the hardware store'. sometimes he comes back with stuff, sometimes he doesn't. when he goes out, he almost *always* goes to the bank (not the atm anymore, my mom had to take away his debit card. he would get anywhere from $40-80 out of the machine, and come home with no money and nothing more than two or three packs of cigarettes to show for it, and my parents *cannot afford* for someone to be draining their bank account like that once or more a week). he still manages to get money out of the bank, despite the fact that my mom will *always* give him cash to buy whatever he needs, or take him out once she gets home to get what he needs with *her* debit card. and still he comes home with his money all spent and little if anything to show for it. it's impossible to tell if he's lying to avoid having to say what he's spending the money on, or if he genuinely can't remember. i tend to think he doesn't remember, but my mom usually tries to make it out like my dad's just suddenly *decided* to be the way he is now.when questioned too intensely about things, or when you can't get him to understand why he can't do something, he tends to get incredibly angry. he has hearing aids, but refuses to wear them. talking to him is almost impossible without them in, and even with his hearing aids, you're still not sure of what he's understanding. i've taken to writing important things down, but there's many times when i'm *still* just not sure i've gotten through. he wanders around the house all day, either doing his minor woodworking projects in his workshop in the garage, playing solitaire on his computer, or watching tv. my mom gives him a list of minor chores to do throughout the day, but every day without fail he misses one or two things. even when i remind him, ""hey, dad, could you feed the cats?"" there's still a good chance he'll get halfway through the task without finishing it. it now takes him two full days to do laundry, where even just a month ago he was able to get his and some of my mom's laundry done in a single day. he *insists* on working in his shop, and will get belligerently (near violently) angry at the mere notion of taking that away from him, despite the fact that he's already cut himself *very* badly twice in the last year. he has these near-constant repetitive vocal mannerisms that he says throughout the *entire* day, and i'm not sure if he's even aware he's speaking. just constantly, ""yeah"" and ""okay now"". all day. he talks at anyone who will listen about anything going on in his mind, which is fine, i guess, but it's a clearly one-sided conversation. he either doesn't hear or doesn't understand anything you say to him in response. it's not *impossible* to get your point across, but casual conversation is nearly nonexistent. he forgets to eat unless i either make him breakfast/lunch or pointedly leave things out so he'll 'remember' on his own. my son is four, and not very close with my dad because of how my dad is, and more frequently than i'd ever want to see, my dad will ask my son for a hug, my son will refuse (i don't make my son hug anyone he doesn't want to, that's not the issue), and my dad will call him a bad little boy. and there's nothing i can say or write down to my dad that changes anything. i just try to explain to my son that grandpa's got problems with his brain, and he can't help his behavior etc etc. he's also, within the last few years, been arrested for groping two women in a convenience store. it got swept under the rug, he plead no contest and didn't have to register as a sex offender. to hear him tell it, he doesn't even remember it happening, but there was video evidence from the store. i just don't know what to do. i feel like if my mom were to push for *some* kind of validating diagnosis from *some* kind of doctor, then at least we would know *if* there's even any treatment available to help him. or if there's anything my mom and i as his caregivers can do to make things easier around the house for everyone. just... anything, honestly. i have two older siblings, but none of my please for help from them have come to anything. i don't even really have a question. if anyone has any insight, it would be appreciated. i know this was long, but thanks for reading if you've gotten this far. i feel like a wrung-out dishrag."," you could ask his doctor to

"could really do with some advice on the problems we are having about neighbours, where the mother has dementia.i apologise if this just sounds like im whining and by no means am i attempting to belittle the awful situation the neighbours must be living with.the context of the situation:based in the essex, uk and have lived in our purchased semi for about 3 years now with our 2 young kids.all started about a couple of days into living here we heard screaming next door along the lines of ""xxx where are you"" over and over for about 30 mins along with banging of doors or furniture.i went round to to see if everything was ok, the daughter (in her 30s/40s) said all is ok, just her mum with dementia and she panics if she can't physically see the daughter. also stating she is her mothers carer.from that point on, we've had 3 years of the mother progressively getting worse in frequency and severity of the screaming and banging, i believe the main term is sun downing and typically starts about 6am until about 9/10am and again from about 5pm until she goes to sleep, which can sometimes be 1am.it isn't constant, and sometimes not everyday, but it is getting more frequent.the early stuff typically wakes us all up and the late stuff prevents me from getting to sleep or staying asleep. in the past 6 months, i've probably only had a handful of uninterrupted evening or nights sleep.in speaking to the daughter, it is very apparent she isn't quite all there herself, in her actions, what we can hear and the way she generally conducts herself. in the past whenever we've gone round to ask if she can settle her mother (due to either the kids now being in bed or the obscenities being screamed being so clear we don't want the kids to hear it), the only response we get from here is her medications are strong enough or she just looks at us almost as if we've caught her out (hope that makes sense, her reaction and response just seems really strange).this then typically follows with what i can only assume is the daughter then locking her mother in her bedroom, as you can clearly hear the mother screaming at the daughter to get off her followed by rattling of the bedroom door along with crying and attention seeking (screaming that she's fallen over and can't get up, but we never hear the daughter coming to her aid).we have also in the past needed to go round because the daughter took to screaming back at her mother when she was doing it, thankfully this didn't last more than a few weeks after we spoke to her to make her aware we could hear her doing it at any volume she chose.the mother is at her worst when her son is home, we think he is also not all there mentally and we can only assume is away at some form of centre as it's clear he can't take care of himself. in his 30's, slow speaker with some form of nervous twitch and typically watching children's tv.in the past, which i can only assume was before they put a lock on her door, when he was home, from about 6am till about 8am, you'd hear him slamming a door screaming ""go away"" continuously.when he is home, the mother is more agitated and her sun downing screams always seems to be in response to him. for example screaming ""not funny, get off me"" or telling him to f off, even if there is no indication that he is anywhere near her. (from what we can hear) his reactions to the mother are also terrible, he shouts at her when he's had enough of her sun downing.the other scenario that's worst is the weekend, it's like the daughter either goes into a coma or just has headphones on full volume, as the mother will be screaming and banging from 6am anything right up to 12pm and any attempt to knock on their door goes unnoticed.as you can probably gather, they are loud, but also the sound carries right through our house. nowhere is safe from it. we have made the daughter aware of these facts several times, but there is usually only an evenings difference in her actions/volume and none in the mothers.we've spoken to the daughter with no solution apparently in sight due to not only the horrible situation this must be for her, but also the fact she doesn't seem capable of dealing with anything other than her mothers basic needs.we've also spoken to the social services team who have the mother on their caseload. to whom we have told all of this and some things i've missed off. the reply is typically, we'll look into it, followed by ""we've instigated a care plan for her""this doesn't appear to result in anything, so feels like we've just been palmed off. probably because they appear to work on the basis of only dealing with issues where the basic needs are not being taken care of.i think complaining to the council won't really help, i don't think you can reasonably prosecute someone with dementia and expect anything to happen. plus once we complain to the council, that is then something that goes against us if we try to move, as it has to be legally declared.im not sure if any noise complaint made verbally to your neighbours also has to be declared when selling, so this also puts us in a bind as we probably won't be able to get a successful buyer. so moving might be off the agenda.i can only assume the mothers basic needs are being catered for and i have no proof otherwise, so social services probably wont intervene or take her into care.being screamed at or left in her room appears to not come under their definition of elder abuse or putting the mother in an unsafe situation either based on the replies we had from them.i've tried headphones at night, which only works whilst i lay on my back, which i rarely seem to get to sleep that way. laying on my side with either inner or outer headphones just hurts my ears after a few minutes.ear plugs don't fully work, the banging just carries through the whole house.we put soundboard plasterboard over the walls in the living room and insulation in the floorboards upstairs in our room, which is next to the mothers. neither have really made any impact, as the sound is just too loud and the banging carries through the joists.i don't feel any conversation about this with social services have been taken seriously and from internet searches on noise with unwell neighbours, it seems to come down to either put up with it or use earplugs.it really does feel like the only solution we have is to wait for the mother to die. apologies if that sounds blunt or horrible, but what other long-term, un-problematical solution do we have that does not impact us either financially or at a detriment to our way of life any more than it already does?what can we do?thank you for reading."," it really sounds like the daughter has a full plate and is probably very stressed and tired, which is why her responses might be ""off"" (in your opinion). not only is she caring for a parent with dementia, but a sibling with developmental delays.perhaps if you have the money, you might offer to help pay for a helper to come in for a few hours each day, during the sundowning period. another strategy, and perhaps the daughter has already tried this, is playing music. if you have a boom box or cd player, you could lend it to them along with cds that the mother would be familiar with, such as music from the forties and fifties. it would be worth a try. also, see about a lawyer who might advise you about other options you maybe hadn't considered, perhaps selling and renting for a while, etc.continue  following up with your social service agency, and try to use this as an opportunity to teach your children compassion. this woman is not in control of her body or her mind, and she is likely living in a state of constant fear and frustration. keep that in mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5dpftv/dementia_neighbour_advice/,dementia neighbour advice

"" and try to either insult me, or point out how i've got say, a letter near the same spot that's mine ( of course this is her trying to say, if your crap is here mine can be too! ) i think this stems from a extreme attempt at 'saving money' as she will try to justify keeping anything in a specific order of; &amp;nbsp;&gt; i was going to use that for x, y, z&gt;that's not mine it was nans ( my nan of course, )&gt; oh i like it&gt; that was from when x, y , z happened x amount of years ago. &amp;nbsp;all of which as you can see, have no real solid basis on why keeping a large variety of dusty cermic jugs make sense. &amp;nbsp;as well as the forgetfullness and hoarding i am expected to do everything financial for her. she forgot to get vehicle tax for 9 months this year, because i didn't do it for her. (i wasn't even aware she forgot about this because she usually does it at the post office). i'm expected to set up everything online, do her car insurance, transfer money, set up direct debits, order items etc, it's gotten to the point where i've even had to do certain training courses for her work for her, not to mention she doesn't even know how much money she has in any of her bank accounts. she has a pension lump sum, and a few savings accounts and i'm in full control of them all and am the sole one who knows how much is in each one. if i hadn't taken this firm stance into knowing the financial details no doubt she would continue to waste money on her hoarding habits, at least this way i can try to dictate her how best to spend her money in order to secure a better house in the future with as much captial left for anything post-purchase. &amp;nbsp;she even got a laptop and promised to learn herself but everytime i tried to teach her she would make little effort and look away from the screen. i even wrote down instructions but she just refuses to learn anything for herself,  the same goes for anything new, including basic things such as car insurance comparison, i'm expected to do it, otherwise she'll leave it and she'll pay more money by staying with the same company, a very strange contrast of behaviour considering how incredibly greedy and frugal she can be. &amp;nbsp;one of the worst examples of her 'greedy' nature is whenever our dog has to go to the vets and there is a price tag attached that she isn't expecting, the first reaction is never ever about the dog's wellbeing, it is always about "" how much do you cost me "", "" i could have gone on holiday with how much you cost "" all in a polite sarcastic voice toward the dog, but this on top of her other frugal behaviour makes it obvious deep down she resents taking financial responsibilty for him. &amp;nbsp;i feel sorry for her because she knows deep down she is having problems but at the same time she has been very abusive to me when i was a child, so i'm now finding it extremely hard to put up with all the pressure she puts on me to live her life for her. i wouldn't mind so much but she expects me to do her things for her and is horrible if i do not do them in the time she wants them done in (when she actually remembers). i'm finding it extremely difficult to help her as she just expects me to live her life for her so she can sit in front of the tv and just sail through life. &amp;nbsp;i've tried on numerous occasions to get her to realise she is having problems and seek help but she is in complete denial and ends up being horrible and upsets me to get me off her case. i'm coming to my wits end trying to help someone that cannot even listen to me respectfully. at this point if i had the funds to move out and leave i would not hessitate. i've been considering going to the doctors and asking them to speak to her, but she would no doubt punish me at a later date for this. any advice is greately appreciated as i have 0 experience dealing with this, all i know is that i can't keep living like this."," find out if there is a dementia support group in your area. if there is, start attending it. if not, try to make contact with nurses and caregivers who work with the elderly at nursing homes and senior care facilities. they can direct you to appropriate resources. start networking with people who are in situations similar to yours. they can help you. your mother's health will only deteriorate. you need to plan for the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/57jw5b/mother_shows_various_signs_of_dementia_how_can_i/,"Mother shows various signs of dementia, how can I get her to recognise her problems?"

my friend is showing signs that he is going downhill. i believe he's in his mid 70's and he is losing his home so that is stressing him out i'm sure of it.he doesn't have many people close to him so i've contacted his god daughter but if she can't help it want to make sure he does this end up homeless.are there any programs in los angeles that will give housing to an elderly man who is showing signs or may possibly already have dementia?he will probably try to lie his way out of getting help or he may truly believe due to the dementia that he has a home to go to (he has told me this but i know for a fact it's not true). when he was normal he was always a liar but this time he genuinely believes someone gave him 8 houses (i can tell by his voice and facial expression he believes it to be true).if anyone knows how i can help him that would be great because i don't want to see him end up on the streets. thanks, aps in the area might be able to point you in the right direction: ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/568ljo/elderly_friend_developing_dementia_may_end_up/,"Elderly friend developing dementia, may end up homeless Need help"
"i read the essay by robin williams' wife and noted that i match a lot of those symptoms.  i don't want to be ""that guy"" but after reading lbda.org, i am wondering if it is this or something similar.  i've been diagnosed as a soft bipolar in the past but i do understand there is a lot we don't know about this stuff yet.as with any disease like this, i have decades worth of meds, therapy, and story.  i'm skipping all that but please ask if you have a question.  i just moved to a new state and have a doc appt but have to wait.i had my wife assist me with this list of symptoms...•	fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness•	memory problems, changes in way of speaking, forgetting words, personality problems, impaired thinking, variable loss of executive function (planning, processing information), poor problem solving, difficulty with learning new skills, and impaired decision-making•	visuospatial difficulties - directional sense and periphery illusions/hallucinations, kicking things, hands and arms running into things, hitting head (30x plus on a bad day)•	problems with movement including tremors, stiffness, slowness and difficulty walking•	behavioral and mood symptoms, including aggression, depression, apathy, anxiety, agitation, paranoia, lack of initiative, and limited range of emotion (variable) (poss. due to neuroleptic drugs)•	changes in autonomic body functions - blood pressure control, temperature regulation, bladder/bowel function, hyper hidrosis, urinary problems, sexual problems - difficulty with maintaining an erection, vision problems - blurry vision and light sensitivity, digestive difficulties including loss of appetite, bloating, diarrhea•	i'm on oxybutynin and is listed as a cause of sedation, motor impairment, and confusion (i experience all three)•	changes in gait; walking stiffly, body stiffness in the legs (mostly)•      parkinson's mask (blank stare, emotionless look on face)•	rbd - new, minimal (punched wife in sleep 2 weeks ago - never have acted out before)any ""crowdsourced"" thoughts welcomethank you"," i have been thinking about you and just saw you posted 7 hours ago, so hopefully you will get this message as well.i am the person who wrote about going off anti-depressants several months ago.  i didn't post this at the time, since i wasn't sure you were still checking your throwaway email, so here is more of what i was thinking when i read your post.i want to reassure you that i have had all of the symptoms you are thinking might be dementia related as a side effect of one medicine or another.the heading my head on things--no.  but when i took depakote, i couldn't drive a car faster than 35 mph because my visual-spacial stuff was so messed up  (it was really fun when i had to drive to a pdoc visit and the only route i knew to get there was by driving on the highway).   i went back on depakote several years later and i started ""fainting""--i would drop to the floor with no muscle control while still being conscious.  it didn't hurt at all because my muscles were so relaxed.problems with movement--yes, esp. while on lithium.parkinson's mask--this could be a side effect of any anti-psychotic meds you are on. i have had hallucinations while on med doses that were too high--lighting coming out of my head, ants running around under my skull, raindrops on my head.  i don't blame you at all for looking at lewy body stuff to try to get a better grasp of what is going on with you.  as for me, i just looked up soft bipolar since that is a new term to me.  i was diagnosed bipolar 2 about 20 years ago, looks like i would be diagnosed soft bipolar today.here is what really seems to be up with me: not saying this is you, but could be helpful.  i was always moody in high school, but got super depressed when i started taking birth control when i got married.  ended up in hospital for being suicidal.  i was mostly super depressed, but often had ""mixed mania""-- a hypomanic state of being less depressed than normal but super angry.  basically, didn't get happy or energetic when hypomanic ,but angry and super emotional.i refused to go to counseling because this was during the time that some counseling patients were retrieving repressed memories of being sexually abused by family members.    i knew this was not my problem.  so i did no counseling, only did medications.  (would llie when my doctors asked if i was getting counseling).  did 5 more hospital visits for suicidality.eventually ended up in counseling as part of getting divorced.  after several years of counseling, started to remember being raped when i was 14 in church basement.   counselor was very careful to not do anything to plant memories in my mind.  eventually talked with other girls who went to my church, i was not the only victim.as a result of remembering this, diagnosies was changed to major depression.  current diagnosis is civilian ptsd.   i still take anti-anxiety meds (buspirone and hydroxyzine)--i can't sleep without them since i am always tense something might happen. (i don't share my bed with anyone, but have no doubt that i could be hitting things in my sleep). but still managing to stay off anti-depressants.by the way, i also gained aboug 40 pounds while going off the anti-depressants, since i was dealing with so many feelings the anti-d had masked.  but am working on losing the weight now.that was a lot of info that might not even relate to you.  but if there is something similar in your past, could help you get off meds that are causing side effects.  let me know if you have any questions, or if i can help you in any way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/567ayh/42m_lbd_soft_bipolar/,"[42M] LBD, Soft Bipolar, ... ?"
"the trouble is, she can hold a completely coherent conversation with the doctors...... she just completely forgets what was said by the time we get home (or makes up what happened), or sometimes that she even saw a doctor recently. we've discussed it with her primary care who says that she seems alright but she's experiencing paranoid delusions at home, misplacing objects that are right in front of her, claiming things that she's holding are wrong or were stolen, mixing up the days on the level of *months*, mixing up day and night, probably screwing up her pills but she won't let us give them to her ""like an invalid""... we have tried convincing her to get a time-released pill box but she claims she has everything under control and is overall a very antagonistic person to deal with. are there pros-cons to having her declared incompetent? how would i go about this? i know there are tests they do, the trick will be getting her to agree to them... she claims her pictures are different and someone's snuck in and changed them all, and it's becoming a frightening situation. any advice? :("," are there times that you can unobtrusively record her? just put your phone on record when a conversation gets weird, or video her? the thing you are describing is sometimes called ""showtime"" and some folks with dementia can seem perfectly in control for show, to the point on having their caregiver be the one whose sanity is questioned.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/56563y/looking_for_advice_my_grandmothers_dementia_is/,[Looking for Advice] My Grandmother's dementia is advancing to the point we're considering declaring her incompetent.

"hi everyone, i'm new to this subreddit, so i apologize if this topic has come up already. but i'm in desperate need for help. my mom, who is 71, almost 72, has shown signs of dementia i'd say as early as 60 years old. it was very minor back then, but i'd say in the last 2-4 years, it's gotten significantly worse. my mom is in complete denial about it and/or is just completely scared. she watched her own mom succumb to the disease 27 years ago. it was never diagnosed as alzheimer, although i've had my doubts that she might have be misdiagnosed. either way, she watched her own mother go through it and i can tell she is terrified of it happening to her. but that's the problem. it is happening to her. she is somewhat aware of it and admits that it's a problem, but only ""when she's stressed"". otherwise, she thinks she's totally fine. one of my sisters, my dad and myself had a gentle ""intervention"" with her 2 years ago which got her to go to a neurologist. she did have a mri to rule out any kind of strokes or any signs of possible alzheimer's. according to her, everything came back normal. however, we can't fully trust that she told us everything truthfully because part of the appointment she was alone and it wasn't until later that my dad finally joined. my sister (the one at the intervention) brought it up to her again last night and said that my mom was on the defensive almost immediately and got really mad/upset and kicked her out of her room. do any of you have any suggestions to help us convince her to go back to the doctor's? are there any treatments such as medications, therapies, etc she could try that might help? i know there is no cure and most alzheimer medications only help in prolonging the onset of more symptoms, but don't stop them completely. are medications out of the question since it hasn't been diagnosed as alzheimer? *i should describe her symptoms: she has excellent long term memory. like scary good. but her short term memory seems so minimal. she's gotten to the point where she asks us the same questions multiple times in one day. sometimes within minutes of each other. she has to leave notes around the house to remind her of things constantly. she will completely forget conversations and will adamantly deny things, despite me having evidence (example, she left a voicemail on my phone and when i played it for her, she claimed that wasn't her and someone was impersonating her). and don't get me started on the repeated stories. she hasn't lost the ability to do activities of daily living, and she's still able to drive, however, she's too uncomfortable to drive anywhere outside of her own town. her personality has changed too. she's almost reclusive and her once social life as dwindled down to 1 solid friend/neighbor and maybe a handful of other people she occasionally interacts with. she's become very judgmental and kind of angry with everyone but especially to her kids. i understand that everyone can suffer from the repeated story syndrome. i'm super guilty of it too, especially with mommy brain. but this is so much different from that. please help!!"," the thing is, there really aren't any effective treatments available yet.  *if* she has a diagnosis and is motivated, you could get her to enroll in a clinical trial, but it doesn't sound as if she'd be amenable to that.  one of the earliest signs of dementia is the inability to learn new skills. the hardest part of dementia for the sufferer is the loss of competence which can cause extreme frustration.  i've found that the best approach is to supply your loved one with the tools she needs to succeed; calendars, reminders, labels, etc.  see if you can engage your dad in a discussion about how *he* perceives the situation.  he's the one who will need the most support as it's the caregivers who suffer the most in the later stages.

"my aunt and i are the primary decision makers for my father.  he has had his disease for a number of years now.  i am aware that it has gotten worse.  yesterday we finally made the decision he is too far gone to be going to church anymore.  which was the last thing about him that was still....him...for lack of a better way to explain it.  he used to be himself still, and just needed help.  with yesterday's decision came the hard realization that he was barely even a shadow of himself.  but having known this was coming for a while i was ok with it.  it's the right decision.  he doesn't need to be alone at all.  this morning i was cleaning out my new phone and came across a two and a half year old voicemail from a phone number i couldn't place.  (i need to clean out my phone more, i know) so i listened to it.  it was him.  at the old number for the house hes at.  it was just him asking for a ride to church, to a different mass than normal.  but it only further reinforced just how bad hes gotten.  it's been so progressive that i never noticed a sudden change in his demeanor.  but hearing him from two years ago hurt.  it just drove the point home a little more that my dad is gone.  and its only a shell of him at this point.  i just needed to type it out.  i'm upset at work and was hoping this would make me feel a bit better.  thanks for the outlet reddit.

"this is more of a rant to just help me alleviate my own stress over this whole messed up situation. i've had to watch this happen to my mother, up close and personally, over the past 9 months and i'm not sure how much more i can take.i've posted here before. my mother was diagnosed with ftd in september of last year, and in january of 2016 i moved her in with me. she had noticeable problems for about 3 years before the diagnosis, ultimately leading to the dr's prognosis of ftd with signs of alzheimers and early onset dementia.  we have a large family, and my mother has 8 brothers and sisters.  but they all agreed that she should move in with me, her 30 year old son.  if one of my brothers (i don't have any sisters) ever got early onset dementia and it came to the point where they had to be taken care of... and they had a late 20's son or daughter.. i would never expect their children to take care of them!  the fact that my family and i had to argue for almost 4 hours straight and eventually they all decided for me that it was in everyone's best interest that she moves in with me was infuriating, and one of the hardest decisions i've ever had to make.   and it's killing me.  after 9 months i have officially feel like i have no life whatsoever. all of my prospects for girlfriends have gone down the drain as soon as they find out about this situation.  i have had to turn down job opportunities because my mother is in a grey area in her disability at this point, in the sense that she's considered too young to be moved in to full-time care senior living facilities (not to mention i don't want her institutionalized.. yet. she is still a long way away from being a 'shell', as they say) and everyone who just looks at her thinks she's fine.  talk to her - ask her questions, etc - and it's a totally different story.it's absolutely heartbreaking and a bit terrifying because i know there's a possibility this could be me some day. and if it is , and i get the exact same thing, then that means my life is more than halfway over already! and instead of pursuing my own dreams and ambitions, i'm burdened by the daily care of my mother, whom i love and care for deeply but gd when do i get to live my life??so her sisters do help.. they call doctors, make appointments, handle paperwork. i'm truly grateful for their help. it wasn't easy agreeing to have mom move in with me. i pretty much knew this was going to happen (not everything, but most of it). the good news is i have secured a golden opportunity in the form of adult day care. we're starting mom off at 2 days a week in about a month. she'll have 16 hours a week at this wonderful facility where she will have at least 10 activities per day to keep her occupied. and what's even better, the facility workers have agreed to basically lie to her and tell her she is an employee there, so she feels like she has a sense of purpose and that she's actually helping other people. mom always loved to help other people. still does.now, the 'going downhill fast part'...mom's been through several phases, the most recent one being extreme clingy-ness. she wouldn't last alone on a pre-arranged activity for more than 5 minutes before venturing into my home-office and interrupting my work.oh yeah, did i mention that i got extremely lucky and secured a contract to work-from home 3 months before my mom had to move in? it wasn't planned, just sort of miraculously happened that way. there are 2 contracts total and they renew on a monthly basis... so at any given moment in time i could be royally screwed if a contact isn't renewed. i'm working towards a full-time gig but that would only happen if my mother went to adult day-care 5 days a week and i had someone at the house for any 2-3 hour periods where i might be home late from work, etc. i can't even begin to think of getting a full-time job until the medicaid goes through. my brothers live with me, too. but they are younger than me and quite frankly they only help when i force them to. they're good guys but i wish they would be more proactive in their help.  it's more like, ""hey i absolutely 100% need to go do this freelance gig today to pay the bills and make some money, so you have to watch mom and the dog today"" and they have no choice but to agree.  and when i get home it's instantly all dumped on me again. they're getting better, though. no real complaints. i am the oldest after all.anyway, back to the downhill descent into madness. of course it's heartbreaking and i feel so sad for her that i just can't even begin to explain in words how much i wish this had never happened, or that one day i would wake up and i could just get my mother back, and everything could go back to normal and i could resume my life journey. but i know that's not going to happen. i'm a realist. i know where this is going. my long term plan for mom is that she lives at home with us as long as feasibly possible. i want her to experience the last remaining remnants of her fleeting lucidity with her family. with her loved ones. until the last recognizable thought escapes her mind and she can no longer formulate a sentence. until faces and names become trace memories and all that remains is not my mother, but just... i want her to be happy and comfortable. i want her to believe everything will be alright. and then when that fateful day comes and she asks me, ""who are you?"" then i will know that it is time.i also watch her 8 year old son once every other weekend for 2 days, as is the current custody and visitation agreement. i won't even go into the details of how messed up that whole situation is, but just know that it doesn't make things easier. and quite frankly, her 8 year old son, and the time she is still allowed to spend with him, might possibly be the only thing holding her back from going off the deep end. teetering on the edge of absolute madness, i strongly believe her love and affection for this 8 year old little half-brother of mine is what's still keeping her fragile psyche in-tact.  but i won't go there... i wouldn't dare think of separating my mother from him, and i shudder to think what would happen if that were the case.the reason i say she's going downhill fast is because these phases of dementia are becoming clear to me the more research i do.  and the current phase she has just entered is the most unsettling and scary phase i have encountered yet. she's started talking to people that aren't there. it started with quiet mumbling and slowly but surely the volume began increasing to where i could hear the pops and whistles of her ps and s's. ""who are you talking to?"" i would ask. ""just myself""....    ""oh.""driving to the grocery store and the semi-audible self-conversations start again. i turn up the radio volume. she increases her own volume. ""mom. can you please stop talking to yourself??""  i get a bit irritated and ask her with a bit of annoyance in my voice. ""i'm just talking to myself, do you have a problem with that?""  how am i supposed to respond?? i tell her ""no, i guess not but can you please try to keep it down it's annoying me""  she shuts up for now, but now i made her angry and when we get to the grocery store she refuses to put anything in the cart or help me, so we only buy 2 things and just get the hell out of there before she causes some type of scene. people look at me and her as she walks angrily with her arms crossed, spouting nonsense to herself almost inaudibly, but just enough to make people notice.  i'm not embarrassed at all, just angry. angry at myself for making her angry it's not her fault after all.. today. i woke up just early enough to catch mom before she goes outside. we have an extremely loud alarm system but i forgot to set it last night and i'm currently home alone with just her and the dog. thankfully the doors beep so i could hear her opening the door and i intercept.  i agree to let her walk the dog, watch her carefully through the windows, then lock everything back up once she's back inside. she's allowed to go for 15 minute walks in the back yard, but i still have to watch her so i try to limit them when i'm attempting to get work done. it's an extremely stressful situation.  i got tired and took a nap on the couch. the dog got up on the couch and laid on top of me. it was a sublime, peaceful moment as i faded into sleep, almost forgetting about my situation for a moment.when i woke up i could hear mom's voice coming from the kitchen. she was sweeping the floor before i fell asleep, but all sounds of cleaning had since subsided. ""she's the devil."" i clearly heard her say as i started to wake up. ""you know who she is? she's the devil. and she killed the devil. killed it and went *some type of attacking noise* and cut it's head off. she cut off the devil's head but she is the devil. i'm going to kill all of the demons. no more demons because she's the devil, that's right""as i returned to full consciousness and began understanding what she was saying from the kitchen, i decided to secretly record it. i only got about 30 seconds before the dog woke up and made her 'snap out of it'. but what i got was pretty much the same as what i just wrote above. more talk about her ex-husband's new girlfriend being, ""the devil"" and how she killed the devil and demons, etc etc. very bizarre and unsettling stuff. and she responds to nobody, too. ""and i killed the demons. uh huh, that's right. *little laugh* yup. no, it's okay. lots of demons. millions of demons""   wtf?!?!??!she's just standing there in the middle of the kitchen, broom in one hand, dustpan in the other, frozen in place spouting nonsense to an invisible individual.i really hope this is a phase because it is officially the scariest phase yet. i joke with her about it, try to get her to stop, but now.. i just don't know. i set her up on a coloring book before coming to write this, but i bet with 100% certainty that if i snuck upstairs quietly right now i would hear her talking to herself again this very moment. okay, rant over. time for me to return to the madness. wish me luck."," every time i thought my mother had plumbed the depths of what dementia could do to her, the dementia dug deeper, then deeper yet. and i always tried to follow her into those depths to see how i could get her out, and i could not, as it only dug her in deeper. until at times i've though its stripped her of all she was, of all that is human. her particular demon was that someone was killing the baby, and she would do absolutely anything to stop that happening - anything from attacking me, to attacking the window, door, books, tv - and then i'd have to steel myself into locking her in her room, somehow getting tablets down her throat so she would calm down... so, i know where you are, friend, and must advise that it will for a long time get a lot worse, and for your and your family's sake, and especially for her sake, she needs to be in a care home. really. i wish i'd known that with my mum.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/538ezw/mother_with_early_onset_really_early_shes_50/,Mother With Early Onset (Really Early.

"i am a speech pathologist (slp) looking for some insight. many of my patients have dementia, and it surprises me how often caregivers/family members are not informed of the types of treatments available for their loved ones with dementia until their disease progresses significantly due to a fall, stroke, or any other trauma. don't get me wrong - speech/cognitive therapy does not fix nor does it heal dementia, but the treatment slps provide facilitate communication and assists with aiding some level of independence, safety, and quality of life to the person by addressing their cognitive skills. we use evidence based practices to guided our treatments coupled with clinical experience and individual needs of the person. my questions are: what type of services does the md suggest after a decline/diagnostics/etc resulting in the dementia diagnosis? do you see a benefit in having your loved one participating in therapy? why or why notwhat are some barriers (e.g., financial, transportation, etc) or skepticisms you have regarding speech therapy? "," i agree that conducting treatment with individuals who are constantly declining is difficult. the slp's treatment approach is targeting things that are important to the individual, as we cannot remediate all issues. for example, i used aids to establish/drill information for recall to later have the patient with mild dementia independently recall without cues or aids. it is important to note, her family was also proactive during our treatments and learned to cue her as i did, which aided in carryover.  in the early stages of dementia, the individual is usually aware of their deficits (even if they don't admit to it), such as poorer recall of short term information. also, i aided a woman with moderate dementia to recall her children's names and she has been able to recognize them during visits now. evidence suggests that the early to moderate stages of dementia are able to exhibit learning of information (commonly re-learning of previous knowledge [e.g., names of relatives] or relevant novel information [e.g., safe walking with walker]). the nature of the disease is progressive, so it does make it that much harder to observe progress, especially when other medical, personal, and/or psychological factors come in to play. if progress is slow or not possible, we target maintenance of the current skills to improve quality of life. as the disease process changes, so does the slp's goals and targets. most types of dementias, like alzheimer's disease, affect the person's episodic, semantic, and working memory however their procedural memory (or muscle memory) is intact. this allows for a positive direction for training. also, the ability to read is preserved until the very end. if the person with a moderate or severe dementia is able to read and follow directions (likely with demonstrations), then we can use this to our advantage in treatment. i have seen progress in many of my patients (not to say some did not benefit due to medical status, other psychiatric disorders, etc), but the ones who have benefitted the most we the ones with the strongest family support, early interventions, continued participation in activities of interest, and with those who were diligent and motivated to work.edit: extra word",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/536w7o/cognitive_communication_treatments_for_dementia/,Cognitive Communication Treatments for Dementia.

"he was treated for leukemia a few years ago. it went into remission, but he never fully recovered. he developed dementia and a host of physical problems that grew worse over time. he steadily lost all ability to take care of himself and my mil was stretched too thin and overwhelmed. it came to a head when he couldn't understand basic instructions to move from a chair into a wheelchair, tried to stand too quickly, and fell, hitting his head. he went into a facility to be assessed and was diagnosed with late stage alzheimer's.my mil and bil were in denial about how badly he had deteriorated. they were convinced the meds he was given in the facility made him worse, but before the fall he could barely walk, couldn't feed himself, and repeated the same stories over and over without remembering. he was also becoming paranoid and angry. when he was put into a nursing home, my mil felt guilty and relieved and guilty for feeling relieved. 2 nights ago, my fil went to sleep. he hasn't woken up. he's in the icu with severe dehydration and very low blood pressure. my husband is conflicted. he wants his dad to be okay, but it's not his dad anymore. he wants his dad to die and feels awful for thinking that. my grandmother suffered from dementia, but i was shielded from it. my last memories of her are happy. i never saw her fade away into a shell of a person who barely resembled who she once was. my husband has seen his dad disappear. he feels like his dad is dying twice."," i'm truly sorry to hear this, it must be very difficult for you and your husband to have to go through this.  no solutions from here, but sending virtual hugs",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/532saj/my_fil_may_be_dying/,My FIL may be dying

"my grandpa was diagnosed with dementia a little less than a year ago. he's a very strong, independent person and just refuses help from anyone. when i try to talk to him about allowing people to help him he just says thing like ""i don't want my brain to go to mush, when you start letting people do things for you then you start to die quicker."" i tried explaining to him that it's not true but no matter what you say he just refuses help in anyway.the things i'm worried most about is his medication. almost every single day he forgets to even eat dinner or he forgets what he was doing 10 minutes ago. i feel like if he can't even remember that, then how can he be remembering to take his pills or he could even forget he took the pills and take them twice.another issue is his finances. as far as i know (he's very secretive about his money) he doesn't really have any bills to pay besides maybe his insurance. but he still gets social security/has some oil stocks. he lives with us and we provide him with all his meals, but lately over the past few months he always seems completely out of money. he calls the bank a lot and i overhear him talking to them. when i bring it up he just says the ""market is really bad right now"" and never goes into detail.my family really doesn't know what to do with him. he refuses to let us help him in anyway, he snaps at us randomly for no reason (which is very uncharacteristic of him), he randomly has dreams that we were mean to him or told him to do certain things that we never told him to do.it's really difficult, we don't want to put him in a home or anything like that because he's lived with us for 20+ years, but we just don't know what to do with him. hoping somebody here knows about what we could do to make things better."," where do you live?  (i mean, what nation and what state).  you need to be doing some planning (like setting up an irrevocable trust for him - it is just going to become impossible and may already be very hard).sounds like your grandpa and my dad are in similar places.  eventually, my dad fell and broke his hip, so that changed everything.  he had stopped doing a lot of his medications (and was lying about it too).  this is all part of it.  for my dad, he was kind of becoming a conscientious objector to life.  no meds for him.  at hospital, he ripped out all the tubes he could get his hands on (and would have gotten out of bed and tried to walk on his broken leg/hip if not for their alarm system).my dad is going to a home today - i keep saying it's only temporary, but it's probably not.  you *must* take care of yourselves.  my dad has grandchildren.  no way do i want the kids' lives to be taken over by grandpa (who would be so upset if he could tell he was upsetting us - but he no longer has that in mind).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/52owx2/grandpa_has_dementia_family_is_having_a_hard_time/,"Grandpa has Dementia, family is having a hard time dealing with it."
"tl;dr: seeking resources to further my professional development in regards to alz+dementia.i work in a long term care + rehabilitation setting, and tonight while perusing /r/science i came across a disease i wasn't familiar with: huntington's disease. turns out (pardon me if this is too reductive of a statement) that's an inherited form of dementia. that was news to me, and i realized i know very little on the subject, though definitely more than enough to effectively take care of my patients. i'd like to learn a lot more on the subject, preferably in depth material breaking down as much about alz + dimentia as i can. anyone have some good resources or education material to share? also, considering attending some lectures and events on the topic, anyone have experience with that, or is it just a time sink? also, having done this five years, i've repeatedly proven in the field that i'm a natural at dealing with these patients, but does anyone have any little ""protip"" type things of any value to share? have had a handful of folks that didn't respond so well even when i pulled out all the stops, and in retrospect i'm sure there's plenty of room for improvement.edit: had one last question.", just remember this: even if a group of patients have a common denominator doesn't mean that they are not individuals. usually patients suffering from any form of dementia have extremely short term memory. even then they are able to memorize feelings. say you treat a patient very roughly and they might remember it even days afterwards. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/52bviy/nursing_professional_and_i_want_to_know_more/,"Nursing professional, and I want to know more about dementia"

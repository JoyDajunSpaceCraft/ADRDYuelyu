"i've lurked here quite a bit over the last few years. it's been about 8 years since i first began suspecting that my dad was showing symptoms of alzheimer's. i worked with him full time and as much as he tried to convince me otherwise, i knew there was something more going on than just simple disorganization and stress induced forgetfulness. my husband and i moved away in 2012 and i no longer worked for my dad, however we frequently had conversations on the phone or on facetime. i remember in 2015 my one year old son tripped and fell, scraping his face. my dad and i had a long heartfelt talk about how scary it is to be a parent and see your kids hurt. sometimes when he is busy with work you can tell when he's only half paying attention and not absorbing what you're saying. this was not one of those times. i had his full attention. i cried. he soothed me. i sent a picture later that day of the scrape on my son's face and i received a panicked message back from him. ""what is that rash? you need to go to the doctor!!"" he thought the scrape was a rash. he had forgotten the conversation. i called him back alarmed asking if he had forgotten about the conversation we had. he got angry at me and said he had a lot of stressors happening with his business and he can't possibly remember anything. the conversation was short. i was upset. he was angry. i never mentioned it again, but at that time i knew with 100% certainty that there was something severely wrong, and that it was almost certainly alzheimer's. there have been more stories similar to the last one, some more severe than others. forgetting that i was pregnant with a baby boy in 2017 and asking my older son if he was excited for his baby sister. getting lost, forgetting things. his girlfriend brought some alarming behaviours to my attention including not paying government debt that he was being chased for, and dropping the ball on many of his business projects with customers frequently  upset with him. i already grieved this years ago. i felt the pain, i accepted it, i moved on as best as i could. i did my best to get him to go for testing but i realized that my mental health was more important than fighting a battle i had no chance at winning. so i let it be. finally his girlfriend convinced him to go to the doctor's about a year ago and they started the testing process. last week he was diagnosed. i thought i was prepared for this, however i was not. i am currently trudging through the depths of despair as my three year old has been battling an aggressive form of leukemia since january and i just don't have the capacity to handle any more tragedy in my life. i feel like i am spiraling with grief. i need my dad. i am his spitting image, inside and out. he is the only person who understands (understood) the way my mind works and always gave the best advice and the kind of support that would make me feel like i could conquer anything. the past months dealing with my son, i haven't called my dad nearly as much as i should have, as i would only get frustrated with his repeated questions about my son's treatments and his inability to understand the answers i gave. i knew this was not his fault but it's hard enough digesting this information on my own, let alone having to repeat it multiple times in different ways when i don't want to talk about it at all.i have been so mean to him. i have been so unaccommodating. i haven't been there through the hardest moments of his life. and now he has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. i'm not sure of the point of this post. i just need to get some weight off my chest. i have been so absorbed in my son, his treatments, and living in constant fear of what might happen to him. and now i know, beyond a doubt, that i am going to lose my dad in the most cruel and heartbreaking way imaginable.he is 59 years old, so this is early onset. he is one of seven kids. one other has already been diagnosed, and another one is showing symptoms. so that’s at least 3/7, all under 65. my dad's grandfather had alzheimer's as well (he died at 75) so this is very clearly genetic. so on top of all of the above, i am also terrified for my own life, and that of my children. i am just so sad, and so scared."," i can relate to so much of what you said. i also have a little one and a parent with undiagnosed alzheimer's. my baby was born in june. my mom has recently had a big decline and i keep getting alarming calls from her independent living facility. it's bad enough that i'm wondering if she should move straight into memory care and skipping assisted living. she is a bit older than your dad so i don't think it qualifies as early onset. she is 72. i'm her only child. i feel like most people whose parents have this disease are much older, but i'm only 33. i just wanted to say i can relate to being sandwiched between two generations who are both needing your help. and i'm so sorry about your son's diagnosis. that is something i can't relate to and that is probably so, so tough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jbfkfv/been_a_long_time_coming/,Been a long time coming.
"hi all. any ideas on how to help someone voice/decide what they want to eat? i'm about to have 6 days with my grandmother who's been fixated on yogurt for some years and often flushes the meals her usual caretaker makes for her. i'm bringing some homemade vegetable soup and plan to get some rotisserie chicken, and make some soft sandwiches or congee, but i think she struggles with voicing an opinion ('i want to eat x') other than 'i don't want to eat that.' i really don't want her to eat like 15 little 3 oz yogurts like she usually does. thanks in advance. take care, everyone."," so, thank you everyone for the advice. it's been 2.5 days and i've been batting about .500 which is better than nothing; she's refused to eat smoothies, pasta, sandwiches, and the thai food i ordered ('this is nothing like my cooking' yeahhhh she didn't cook, not once). i have some success with instant congee and she's eaten a lot more of the homemade vegetable soup than i thought she would. some of the success was plating; she really likes being waited on so i wrap utensils in napkins and have plates and saucers and everything. i absolutely had no expectations going in, i knew that she would always prefer her yogurts, and i've never stopped her from having them. it's just heartbreaking at times to hear her say ""well there's nothing to eat, i'm starving"" while looking at a small bowl of food she doesn't even look twice at.but thanks for the advice to try, and the support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jb306e/ideas_for_meal_selection/,Ideas for Meal Selection?

"my 73 year-old mother is in the latter stages of alzheimers (diagnosed six years ago). i’m currently staying with my parents to help my father wrap up his mother’s estate as he’s pretty limited in what he can do when he’s the only one looking after my mother. for a while now she’s been hallucinating and we generally go along with the hallucinations and reassure her that even if it’s scary, everything is alright and she’s safe with us. tonight, she woke up sobbing; i heard her and went in to check on her to find her standing in the middle of the bedroom. when i went to her she said my name, sighed a big sigh of relief and then told me that a man had told her that i was dead. i was calm and asked her who told her that and she couldn’t remember. after a long hug and several reassurances that i wasn’t even hurt, she calmed down but was still visibly confused. when i told her that she probably just had a nightmare and that’s ok, she looked at me and said that she didn’t believe in those. i had to fight my smart-ass instincts to keep myself from saying anything that could make her feel more unsure (like “well it was either a nightmare or you’re crazy because i’m fine”). i’m concerned this could happen again and i’m not sure what the best response is, especially since she “doesn’t believe” in nightmares. i’m obviously alive because i’m speaking to her and if i confirm her hallucination, it will just further upset her. has anyone dealt with this? she was prescribed seroquel for agitation but i’d like to know if there’s a better way to handle it without giving her the pill unless it’s absolutely necessary.", your mom is very likely at the very critical stage of alzheimer's (mid stage). in a couple of months she will lose all her independence. you may try brainglucose to stop her nightmares and hallucinations due to  post-midnight low energy in brain.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ja6pdy/guidance_appreciated/,Guidance Appreciated
"i am only 25 years old and my dad (56 m) has bern diagnosed with this horrible illness for over 2 years now. he is declining rapidly and his neurologist recently told us that he has the most aggressive form. my father is the nicest person i have ever met in my life and watching him suffer/deteriorate is heart breaking. my mom constantly talks about how she is going to be a young widow and is very depressed, i just don’t know how my family will get through this. none of my friends can really relate as some of their grandparents had it, but got to live a fuller life and i just feel so scared and alone. we have always been super tight on money and now he can’t work while my mom has to continue to work 50 hours a week just to barely get by. i recently got a decent job and help contribute however i can, but we need someone to be home with him at all times. i’m sorry for ranting, but just not sure where else i can vent about this."," i'm so sorry you are in this situation. like you i'm just turned 26 and my dad has had alzheimer's since i was about 19. it's so hard when you see your friends having a really normal happy relationship and life with their parents. it's been tough for us too with money, my mum is 68 and still working full time, and i've moved away to get a better job so i can contribute more money. luckily my dad can be at home alone for short periods of time, so long as my mum has left him food and drink (as he doesn't know/remember to eat or drink otherwise). but i suppose in the next year this will probably change :(i'm not sure where you live but are you able to access any subsidised drop in carers who can be with him when you're working? there may be some volunteer groups or lunch clubs especially for those with alzheimer's. or with covid and lots of people working from home, are you able be flexible with your hours?again i'm sorry you're going through this, and it's so tough when money is a worry. just try and remember you are not alone in this, and there is a lot of support and resources out there for carers and family. also please remember to take time to look after yourself too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ja3b1i/dad_has_dementia/,Dad has dementia
"hello.i am in a situation where a parent in their early 70's is slipping mentally.  they have other issues that may be terminal but with the time they have left i am trying to be kind and helpful.this person doesn't have many forms of happiness and suddenly has a very strong want to take on a complicated project that they used to do years ago.  i learned the craft from this person and in preliminary discussions i can tell they have a memory deficit, and they get argumentative about defending their reality.i keep reading not to take any anger or lashing out personally, and i only want happiness for the person.  engaging in this activity is tricky, frustrating,  and expensive when everything is right so i can foresee them getting frustrated and defeated by it.  the person is aggressively pursuing this and i want to assist them in doing what makes them happy, but it is going to be sad to see them get defeated.this person was nasty to me as a young adult and the last time we did this activity was during that era.  we made peace since but i can see this person starting to revert back to that behavior when their memory and mine disagree.  i sense that they are scared and need validation that their cognitive abilities are intact but i am afraid there is no way that i am not going to be the enemy.i know i have to protect myself and i am able to, but i want to preserve this person's dignity and not add to the rest of the things making them unhappy.  i have no idea if it's best to play along and try to smooth things over as we go, knowing that i'm eventually going to be the target of their frustration, or if i should present reality every time a distortion comes up.  i want the overall best.  at worst i can totally withdraw but it is important to me to do my best to spend the rest of their time on good terms, and withdrawing would result in estrangement.i spent a lot of time figuring our relationship out over the years and i can say this person is manipulative and toxic, but now that i can see it i'm impervious to it.  that has lied dormant for a long time but it is ramping up again.  i have my hands full this time.  any thoughts?"," waou thats really very tough and complicated.  i feel for you!  good on you for wanting to try assist in making them happy, and being impervious to toxic manipulations, waou, sounds like a mine-field!  sounds like you are doing a heroic job of it there! i'm carer for my mum, we have also a highly toxic element causes chaos in our very small family, (my sister, actually, but)  it's extremely hard sometimes.  idk, those resolved / nonresolved issues -- sometimes i let them go like water off a ducks back, and change the topic, sometimes i have to set the reality straight even if its unpleasant momentarily - and then deflect / distract on to some other topic/activity.  counselling / therapy helps me somewhat, and time-out.   idk how it's going to go as mum progresses.. only you can gauge & call the play.   i don't envy you.  i hope you have plenty support for yourself, get breaks and respite, and i guess at least keep withdrawal as an option if needs.  best of luck to you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ja1rpo/how_do_i_handle_this/,How Do I Handle This?
"hello all,forgive me if i am posting this in the wrong place. my grandmother (73) was recently diagnosed with amnestic mci. i can't say that i am particularly shocked by this diagnosis, as my mother and i were already suspicious due to the way she was acting a few months prior. however, though i was kind of prepared for this, i still can't help but to feel scared, worried, and, perhaps most of all, helpless. i'm a recent college graduate and i moved across the country a few months ago. my mother and step-father still live in close proximity to her, and my mother has recently retired from her job in order to help more. i occasionally have contact with my grandmother over facetime, but most of the time she doesn't pick up when i call--which leaves me feeling a bit dejected, albeit sort of selfishly. i was doing some research about mci and read that a diagnosed person has the chance of developing alzheimers some years in the future. i want to do everything i can to help her keep her mind stimulated, even if i cannot be there with her physically. does anyone on this subreddit know of any productive ways i can do that? maybe there are some fun, but easy phone games her and i could play together? we used to play virtual scrabble in the past, but she gets stressed when she plays it now (tagalog is her first language, and as much as i try to communicate with her in it, my grammar isn't very good).  thanks for reading my post--i'll even take some words of encouragement if there are no suggestions."," your options are limited by distance.  when my husband was diagnosed with mci (and now, alzheimer's) we were told that exercise is extremely important, and that the best brain exercise is socializing.  we were also told to have a very healthy diet called the m.in.d. diet.  but since you aren't there, what you can do for exercise and diet is limited.  keep having facetime calls, but also, mail her a card now and then.  she will probably really enjoy this.  you can also send her little, inexpensive gifts now and then.  simple things like a cd of the type of music she likes, a pretty handkerchief, a sample-size hand lotion or cologne, just simple things anyone would enjoy.  these things can really boost someone's mood, which is important.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/j9z6xv/grandmother_diagnosed_with_amnestic_mci/,Grandmother Diagnosed with (amnestic) MCI ?

"**some background:** my dad (68 yrs) was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's a few years ago, and he's rapidly deteriorating. as of the past few months, he's no longer driving and was forced to quit his part-time job (he's retired government)--he's basically piddling around the house now. my brother and his two young sons (5 and 4) live with my parents and all three of them are extremely demanding on my mom's time and energy. from what she's told me, the situation is getting worse each day. emotionally, my dad is nasty and angry and isolates himself from them, and it's driving her into a deep depression. my brother helps out a bit with the kids and my dad, but he's not wholly reliable and she's doing 99.9% of the work.my husband is going to be out of town for work for about 10 days starting next week. i'm going to try to get my dad to come stay a few nights at my place to give my mom a break, and to give him some space from her (i'm sure the frustration and sniping goes both ways in their relationship). the thing is, i have newborn twins, and our days are basically eat, play, sleep, repeat. what can i do with my dad while he's with me? he needs supervision, so i can't send him on errands alone. my girls have eating issues so i was thinking he could hold and play while i do the feedings, maybe help wash bottles if he wants, watch some tv and relax... but i'm not sure what else. i want to be there for my family and help relieve some of this pressure but with babies and covid, it hasn't been easy trying to figure out what is the best way to do that. any suggestions or advice is welcome."," my dad has late stages of alzheimer’s and is currently visiting my family from out of state to visit his new grandson. i have been taking him for walks outside regularly, i engage with him in frequent conversations (constantly asking if he is ok, if he is hungry, if he needs anything, telling him i love him, reminding him of names of our family members, and asking him questions about his childhood and his parents and siblings), and i try to maintain as much physical contact as possible (holding his hand, putting my hand/head on his shoulder, etc) to comfort him since he is aware he is not in his home which raises his anxiety. one important thing i would encourage you to do is take as many photo and videos together during the early stages to create memories for the future. this disease moves fast and you will want to save those memories for the future or share with your loved one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/j1lnu2/what_can_i_do_with_my_dad_when_he_visits/,What can I do with my dad when he visits?
"i'm just going to throw this out there. my father was diagnosed with ad a few years ago, and since then i have done quite a bit of meta-research on the disease, causes and potential treatment. it seems like the very specific medical community just gives a shoulder shrug to this information but from my perspective it seems solid enough to make some changes in our lifestyles to adjust for it. i am in the process of designing and testing what i call a ""memory gym"" to not only try to help my father but possibly to help anyone who has dementia and maybe more importantly, any boomer who loved cap'n crunch, frosted flakes or mountain dew. please stay with me. sugar causes ad. maybe not early onset or other variations on ad or dementia, but over and over again in my meta-research (i call it that because i'm just studying other people's research), i find that ad is linked to sugar. the brain is very greedy with sugar because glucose is the brain's only food. every hour the body produces 2 tablespoons of cerebral spinal fluid and pumps it to the brain. refined sugar and sugar from fruit juices that have been separated from their fiber is concentrated in the cs fluid and is pumped to the brain, the subsequent syrup leaves behind a plaque in the brain which we know as beta amyloid. this plaque essentially kills the brain cells through a process. this has a historical logic to it because a hundred years ago the average american drank zero ounces of soda per year, now that average is over 50 gallons. this is concerning to me because although ad is affecting my parent's generation right now, my own generation was raised on sugary cereal and soda. way more sugar than my parent's generation. if the correlation is correct then ad will reach a new epidemic height very soon. although, it is not technically part of my memory gym, the first thing that should be done to combat present and future ad is to cut out all refined sugar and fruit juices. it's important to understand that playing brain games and trivia is entertaining and time occupying but it doesn't really do much to the brain. to stimulate new brain activity you have to make it jump through some new hoops. the goal is to create new neuropathways that can be used to essentially bypass the old rotted braincells. in order to accomplish this you have to teach the brain a process that it doesn't already know. learning to play a musical instrument or a foreign language are great examples of this. the idea is that you are engaging previously untapped parts of the brain and that once tapped can be useful for accessing memories. the memory gym has 4 parts, each that last 15 minutes:  1. listening to music from high school  2. light exercise  3. practicing piano  4. studying language 1. listening to music. if you haven't tried this with your ad patient, i have to tell you that the difference is amazing to me. if you do nothing else, get them a playlist with music that was popular when they were young and/or young adults. my dad lights right up when elvis in on. my recommendation is that they sit in a comfortable chair and with headphones on and listen to a varied selection of top 40 songs from the years around when they graduated high school. this puts them in a much better frame of mind to complete the rest of the exercises. 2. light exercise. (probably want a doctor's ok before this) anything to get the blood flowing. if they can walk on a treadmill, great. if not then you have to figure out what they can do for 15 minutes that will elevate the heart. i advocate light exercise for 15 minutes without music. i think there is   3. practicing piano. i bought a teaching keyboard that the key's light up as the song plays. playing basics like twinkle, twinkly little star become reasonable things to learn. i will give you model of the keyboard if you're interested but i don't want anyone to think i'm selling a product. it works well though. 4. foreign language. this might seem like asking to much for a person with dementia but i have also identified a very useful application that can run on a pc, tablet or phone that works really well. it has a unique teaching style that keeps it fun and fresh without feeling like you're being taught anything. i haven't implemented this gym with my father yet as he is reluctant but i actually feel like there is some merit to it and i'm hopeful that someone can benefit or expand on this. all 3 of the exercises that involve sound can be completed wearing comfortable headphones so the sound isn't disturbing to others. also, if you're confident that i'm completely barking up the wrong tree please tell me. i don't profess to be any kind of an expert, i'm just functioning in a void of any real leadership. thanks for reading", thanks for that,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/j1bvif/memory_gym/,Memory gym

quick question. my mother is a hard core republican and loves watching fox news. should i expect her to lose interest in politics at some point or stay the same? has anyone had any experiences with a very political alzheimer's patient?," my grandma used to be more of a centralist but leaning towards the left. her alzheimer's has actually made her a lot more into politics. i think this is because of the 24hr news cycle. she can't remember that they had already talk about a subject on the news but she remembers being angry about it. then when the news comes on again she just gets more angry about it. we try and get to not watch the news as much anymore. she used to watch the 4 o'clock, the 6 o'clock, and the 10 o'clock news every single day. of course things get repeated on the news when they are major stories. instead of her thinking it only happened once they are just repeating, she thinks it has happened 3 times that day. it all ends up making her more political. she has a hard time comprehending the news as well. for example, whenever the news brings up a bill going up for vote, she thinks it has already passed. she confuses people too or doesn't fully understand that something is actually good.luckily, my family are all on the same side of the political spectrum so it doesn't cause us discomfort when she gets really political. we do try to limit how much she watches the news. one thing we have started is our whole family watch the world news on abc every night. we pause the tv after segments and explain it to her and let her ask any questions she has. it's really funny because whenever it's 5:30 she yells ""david is on!"" even when my mom and i are just talking about the news by ourselves we still start stuff with ""did you see on david tonight...""anyway, from my experience they will get more political. however there are ways to combat this if it makes you uncomfortable or them upset. tv parental controls help a lot. watching the news together to explain helps. limiting what type of news they consume (international news, national, local, weather, community based).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/iwqxmn/what_happens_to_patients_who_are_very_political/,What happens to patients who are very political?

"this just sucks. i love my mom (50s), who is no longer the person who raised me (30s). i'm grateful for this community and i hope you might be able to give me some advice on how to go about this.  for a while now, it's been clear to me that my dad, who is my mother's primary caregiver, needs to get more help. they are actually quite young-- in their 50s so my father still works full-time and will do so for a while. over a year ago he's already been working primarily from home so that he can take care of my mom, who has gradually required more and more assistance. he literally cannot leave her home alone because she'll do things like turn on the stove, put random objects (not clothes) in the washer/dryer, attempt to get the mail but end up ""running away"" so that he loses track of her. the pandemic obviously didn't help. in january, he had signed her up for meet-ups for people with alzheimer's (she's the youngest, by far), but which are now cancelled. he was looking into housecleaners, but that was scrapped too. i was finally able to visit them after several months and i was shocked at how far things have gone downhill, for both of them. my father no longer exercises, he resorts to quick frozen meals because he's short on time. they're both in bad shape (after being physically quite healthy for many years into middle age). the house is mess (understatement). in part because my mother keeps ""cleaning up"" and rearranging things and my father can't keep up with tidying after her. their roomba is the only thing that cleans anymore.i should also mention this-- i have a fraught relationship with my father that required a lot of therapy and made me have to set boundaries. me moving in to help out is just not an option. i feel incredibly guilty about this, but i have to admit to myself that i don't think i would be a good caregiver because i already have a lot of pre-existing stress/anxiety when it comes to my relationship with him. that being said, i'm not callous to the situation. i love them both and i know that in his own way, my father loves me too. but we would butt heads too much day-to-day for us to successfully help my mom. my sister also lives too far away to help and has small children of her own who keep her busy.my mother literally an't function without him. though she still knows who we are, she gets confused. she suffers from delusions. sometimes she'll call me several times a day about how my sister or her best friend are stealing from her or that my dad is physically torturing her or that her mother has died (these things are all unequivocally not true). he helps her shower, lays out her clothes for her, makes her meals, and does all the housework. before the pandemic, he tried to take her out on weekends to meet up with friends, but that's not happening anymore. i know it's time to sit down with my dad and have a serious conversation about getting help. i actually think it might be time for a memory care facility. i've spoken with other family members/her friends who have seen her more frequently this past year than i have about this and they agree. my uncle was actually the one to bring this up.so here's my question: how do i bring this up to my dad? how should i approach this? i'm worried about my dad's reaction. he's stubborn and the type who refuses help from others. he's been in denial about how bad this is. should i research facilities beforehand? any advice on wording or angle of approach, fellow redditors? thank you in advance."," i was in a similar situation with my father who was the sole caregiver for my mother. he refused help from my sister, my older brother and myself for many years. we would see that my mom was getting worse year after year. he would not budge to help himself or my mom. he saw only expense instead of quality of live although he had the money. i approached my sister to contact adult protective services three years ago. she did not approve of this avenue in favor of an intervention. the intervention never happened. fast forward two years...the situation was dire. my mom could not walk well and had pain in her knees. she was near end stage and still no help of any sort. i contacted my sister again to push for adult protective services with anonymity. we called and got the ball rolling. adult protective services visited my parents house to my fathers surprise. adult protective services determined that she was neglected. my father had three weeks to place my mom in an appropriate care facility. two weeks later my mom was sent via ambulance to the hospital kicking and yelling ""help...help...help...help"" as loud as she could, tied to a medical cart to the back of the ambulances. she was sedated for the trip to the hospital and later diagnosed with pneumonia and a nasty foot infection. she was treated for pneumonia and the foot infection over a period of three weeks. the social worker at the hospital told my dad that his wife was in the process of dying and the pastor visited him and my mom.  my father did not take this well. he didn't grasp that she was dying or that she was not coming back home.  after three weeks at the hospital, my mom went to a really nice rehabilitation center. she stayed there rehabbing with incredibly compassionate nurses and staff. the nurses were shocked she was living alone with my father. she was doing well at the rehab center but medicare would only pay for eight weeks of rehab. my father didn't want to keep my mother there because it was expensive and found only one assisted living facility that would possibly accept her, where she had to walk everywhere. my mom failed the assisted living placement interview and could not walk 50 ft. my father pressed again to have her retested. she barely passed her placement test which in hindsight i believe was detrimental to her survival. she was later moved to the assisted living home and she was there for a week. she fell once out of bed, got into a fight with another patient and a few days later she fell again and broke her left femur below her ball joint. due to her end stage condition, she was not a candidate for surgery nor would any medical doctor perform surgery on her. she had been recommended to hospice for comfort care but my father was considering surgery against our wishes. she survived intense pain for three weeks. soon after she passed.my point is, do not wait to intervene if you feel someone is not acting in the best interest of your loved ones. act as soon as you can to give your them the care they deserve. call adult protective services if you have any doubt that your relative is being neglected or not being cared for properly.edited",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/in4uja/how_do_i_talk_to_my_dad_about_getting_more/,How do I talk to my dad about getting more involved treatment for my mom?

"hello people, i never thought i would be writing this but my grandmother got alzehimer, it all started a few years ago and i still don't know how to cope with it, i love the woman but is just to pianfull watching her repeating her self over and over, inventing stuff that of course she believes to be true and all those things that come with this disease.i love going to see her but i keep putting it off not just because of covid but also because is just to painful, i know it might sound selfish but the way i feel right now is that i if i don't go to visit her i'll totally regret it when she dies and that this could happen at any moment, but if i go she is just not herself and i don't know.. any tips to make it all a bit better? i'm 23 and is just not fair losing her in this kind of manner..not native english, sorry if there are mistakes."," after spending time with family members with alzheimer's i've noticed even though they may be forgetting words, where they are, who you are, even who they are, looking into their eyes it's still them, it's still exactly the same person you knew and loved. they may have lost a lot but they never truly lose who they are. spending time with my mum, even though she is quite far into the disease, looking into her eyes, there she is.so my advice is even though it is scary and sometimes unbearable, you will never regret spending time with them, and helping them, holding their hand through this scary time they face, they will be so grateful even if they may not be able to express it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/imdhl6/any_tips_on_making_my_visits_to_my_grandmother/,Any tips on making my visits to my grandmother with alzehimer less painful?

"my grandmother has lewy body dementia. in short, she should have been moved months ago. this is partially due to my grandfather's denial and finances. additionally, her doctor seems to almost be in his own denial. the family was told that my grandmother needed a wellness check before entering a home. the only thing he will schedule is a telephone appointment. i do not believe half of the messages are even being passed on to him.i was discussing this along with other things (possible wandering, dangerous delusions, etc) with my personal therapist. she said it sounds like my grandmother is becoming dangerous to live with. i agreed.so, who is responsible for finding a nursing home? the doctor, the family? what was your experience? anything and everything is helpful. thanks!also, if it matters, we live in north carolina."," the reality is that its up to your gramps until he is deemed unable to make decisions for her usually by a doctor or court. it doesnt sound like he wants her to go.i would respect his decision, support him and maybe he will change his mind over time. it is your grandma. but its your grandpas wife and at the end of the day, legally it is up to him for the time being.its usually the family that starts the process for private facilities in the state of ca. and if it is not a private facility then the doctor would generally set you up with senior resource and a social worker would assist her with finding a home and would help with financial support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ilinln/who_is_responsible_for_finding_a_nursing_home/,Who is responsible for finding a nursing home?

gf wants to see her dad but family he lives with  won’t let him out for walks or well being placing to many excuses . is it wrong to allow people with alzheimer’s to walks or strolls during covid era ?," it probably depends on a lot of factors. alzheimer's patients can't go out alone because they'll get lost and they won't be able to find their way home. they have to be under constant supervision. it also depends on your local population density. if you live in a dead suburb, you can probably take your loved one for a walk more easily than if you live in downtown manhattan. the family may have had issues in the past with walks, or it could be that nobody is willing to supervise him outside. maybe the family is just controlling. it's hard to say without being there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ilf2w0/gf_father_has_alzheimers_family_wont_let_him_out/,Gf father has Alzheimer’s family won’t let him out ?

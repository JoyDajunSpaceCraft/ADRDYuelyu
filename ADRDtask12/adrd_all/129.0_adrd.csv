"hi all,first time posting so please be kind :-) my father is 62 and for the last 3 years i‚Äôve noticed his mental state steadily declining, more so in the last year or so. it all started when he made me a cup of coffee in one of my kids sippy-cups, when i commented on this he then made a cold cup of coffee in a normal cup. the whole scenario was bizarre and it was clear he was flustered and confused. since then it‚Äôs been a string of incidents; he gets stuck driving around roundabouts, forgets where he‚Äôs going on a motorway and panics, has caused a handful of minor incidents at his work, couldn‚Äôt tell you who was prime minister or president, and generally has days where he‚Äôs very withdrawn in himself, barely talking and asking odd questions when he does (e.g at christmas he asked me if the lights in my kitchen ceiling were sprinklers) he has seen a doctor, who referred him to the memory clinic, he failed his memory test quite impressively bless him and now the next step is a ct scan and then referral back to the memory clinic for diagnosis. he‚Äôs accepting that his mind isn‚Äôt what it used to be, but he‚Äôs desperately sad about it, as we all are, but i‚Äôm glad he is seeking help now and not further down the line. his short term memory is shot, worse on bad days, good days are still occurring for now. he‚Äôs not had a definitive diagnosis yet, and i‚Äôve not much support as my partner is all ‚Äúyou never know it might be nothing‚Äù but that kind of dismissive attitude isn‚Äôt helpful at all when the truth of the situation is that i don‚Äôt know how it could be anything else less serious. how can this have any other outcome üòî he feels too young to be disappearing already. i had to show him how to write a christmas card this year.... i‚Äôm sorry for the long post. my heart is breaking before we even know for sure. i guess my question is: how many of you knew in advance of an official diagnosis? could my gut instinct be wrong? i feel i have no where to turn. my sister is just coming to accept the situation and is not coping well, my mum is the same, though she won‚Äôt show her emotions. i feel very alone"," my fil was diagnosed with early-onset dementia (lewy-body) and he showed similar signs. another sign is that it gets worse in the evening (sundowners) and at night. prepare yourself for that diagnosis, but realize that there are many people and organizations (alzheimer's association, lbda, support groups) that relate to what you're going through and can help. no matter what happens, you and your family are not alone in this. if he is having confusion on the road, it is crucial that he stops driving now. my fil got into a bad car accident that injured him and my mil. this is a difficult step: have the doctor tell him that he's not allowed to drive until the doctor clears him to drive when his memory improves.best of luck to you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7rbs13/worried_about_my_father_would_love_others/,"Worried about my father, would love others experiences and opinions"
"our family has reached a dilemma. a month ago, my siblings and i agreed that it was time for dad to quit driving (mid-stage non diagnosed alzheimer's). he does not feel that he is dangerous, and is stubborn. nobody wants to be the bad guy, so we felt his doctor, who has done cognitive tests, could get the ball rolling. so the doctor requested a common form from the dmv, (which the dmv sent by mail to dad) with a deadline to submit a physical check. the form also has space for the doctor's opinion. doc put on the form that he recommended a new road test and advice from a neurologist. so the ball is in play, with a deadline of jan.31 to submit results to the dmv.some background: dad's mother died of alzheimer's and he never dealt with it emotionally. he has never talked about his feelings, ever; the stereotypical tough farmer bit. we all agree that his *knowing* that he suffers from alzheimer's (even though it's obvious to everyone around him) and that his family knows it, would really crush him. we just want him to sleep well at night and be comfortable. so we decided that he could do a road test, which he won't likely pass, and that would make the neurologist appointment moot anyway. losing his driving freedom would be the lesser evil here for sure. now that the gp has referred to a neurologist and an appointment was made, if it goes on the record that this appointment was declined, could his life insurance later use that as a reason for denial? the rest of his physical exam shows him to be in excellent physical health, except for blood thinner (wayfarin) that he's been taking for about 15 years.if anyone has had similar situation, please share your experience.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7raieb/could_cancelling_a_neurologist_appointment_void/,Could cancelling a neurologist appointment void life insurance for a physically healthy 82 yo ?

"sorry i don't really know how dementia or alzheimers works so i'm asking you guys to help me out, i'll list a few instances of forgetfulness or confusion that has happened in the past year or so.couple months ago i had dinner in the city with a few friends, i told my mum and dad about it, got home had a good sleep woke up the next day and my dad was like ""hey son, how was that hotel room you and your friends booked so you could party at last night"" i was confused i explained that i had dinner in the city and actually came home at a reasonable time, he says that my mum told him that. i talk to my mum later and she says that she told my dad that i was just having dinner in the city, mum even showed me the text messages. my dad is certain that my mum told him i booked out a hotel room with my friends.also a bit of a small one but he's a really good cook, he likes coming up with new creations every now and then but sometimes he says that he's created something new but it's the same thing we had like 2 weeks ago but he doesn't remember. this one is a bit of a smaller reason as i can see if he creates lets says 3 new dishes a week, times by 52 times by however many years, of course they're going to overlap every now and then.this happened this week, we got onto the topic of cruises and he says that he had booked 4 tickets on a cruise for these holidays but he discussed it with all of the family but none of us wanted to go on it so he managed to sell all the tickets. i would of wanted to go on a cruise these holidays, i passed this off as just me forgetting about him discussing this cruise, but i talked to my sister and mum and they dont recall ever having a conversation with him about having a cruise these holidays. he's adamant that we all were definitely not keen on going on a cruise but i talked to my mum and sister and they said if there was a cruise booked these holidays we would all of been keen on it.there are other small instances of forgetfulness that are easy to just pass off, for example i said i was sleeping over at a friends house and he texts me at 11pm and says he's out the front of the house, i call him and explain i already said it was a sleepover idk where he got the 11pm pickup time from.he's nearing the age of 60 btwsorry if this is just simple natural forgetfulness i'm just a bit worried and hoping you guys could clear it up for me :)"," i agree with the rest of the gang, please get him checked.  the first checkup will be just simple things but if the dr believes more testing is needed then go down that route.  my wife (67) was just diagnosed about 1 yr ago.  it's never a easy road take care of your father and yourself ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7qym4v/is_my_dad_developing_dementia/,Is my dad developing dementia?

"my mother-in-law has had a lifelong history of undiagnosed mental illness, that we think falls into the personality disorder spectrum (probably borderline.) now, she is 75, and has started to display some of the characteristics associated with behavioral variant ftd, specifically, inappropriate sexual behavior.she was diagnosed with mild dementia a few years ago (unspecific,) and she got much worse after a surgery with anesthesia, but then slowly better over the course of a year, and now seems to be declining again, but in other ways.as i‚Äôve been reading about behavioral variant ftd, a lot of what we attributed to a personality disorder, seems to overlap. is it possible to know if one or the other is responsible for her lifelong issues, and if so, does knowing have any impact on what treatments might help her at this stage?"," this is actually a great question, and one that's being actively studied. tl;dr, we really don't know, but i suspect so.>does knowing have any impact on what treatments might help her at this stage? unfortunately, probably not - the best treatments will continue to alleviate symptoms as they appear throughout disease progression. perhaps one could be more aggressive with treatment for psych symptoms, but that would be a personal call for her and her family trying to balance quality of life. >is it possible to know if one or the other is responsible for her lifelong issuesit's not really possible to know this in hindsight, but a large number of patients with neurodegenerative diseases (ftd and others) have psychological issues, sometimes for a couple decades, before they are ever formally diagnosed with the underlying neurodegen disease (i.e. anxiety, depression, insomnia, behavioral, impulse control, etc.). as you can imagine, this leads to a lot of frustration where the patient can become ostracized from friends and family. you're doing great to help out.best of luck with your mil.p.s. i'll also mention that disease progression happens many years before symptoms are bad enough to render a diagnosis. for example, in parkinson's disease patients, the substantia nigra (the part of the brain most impacted and responsible for classic symptoms) loses almost half of its neurons before the average patient get diagnosed. this is both amazing because of the brain's extraordinary ability to reorganize and cope with trauma, but also a huge obstacle as a real disease treatment will require ridiculously early detection methods.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7qv83y/can_someone_develop_behavioral_variant_ftd_later/,"Can someone develop Behavioral variant FTD later than normal, like in their early 70‚Äôs?

"i hated visiting mum. she could be a mean person and she could be far worse in the home.it took ages to get her diagnosed. the nhs didn't seem to want to know. they seemed content to let her get taken to hopsital 16 times in one year. then when asked why this didn't seem strange to them, to be fobbed off with ""the family should look after her"".i found distracting her by talking about our favourite topic helped - cats! it got a bit confusing as she'd muddle them up but she was cheerful for a while.the other times... phoning me at 3pm in the afternoon and just screaming down the phone. then talking normally and carrying on screaming. i hung up on her - i kept telling her unless she stopped screaming, i'd hang up.then there was the nursing home. i had my doubts about that place. it cost a lot but never seemed to be ""on the ball"". my brother caught them out on several things.then there were the other patients. i think they knew where they were and why they were there but because of dementia they weren't sure.some would mutter obscenities or shout, others would keep calling for the nurse.that went on for four rough years. mum died in the nursing home shortly after breaking her hip. she accused us of all sorts of things. having to tell her dad was dead repeatedly was the hardest. being told we're keeping her from him wasn't much fun.then being told because we didn't have poa we couldn't access her money. nobody sat down with us and explained how this should work, we had to find out the hard way.like the court of protection. it took dad six months and a few thousand pounds to set it up. when he died... we had to do the same again... if we'd known, we'd have made all of us deputies to save the wasted time going through that again.now that they're both gone... i feel frightened about my own future. i feel as though i should be doing something to achieve more somehow.small things set me off, crying. sad songs. reminders. it's getting better but i suffer from depression.i fell out with my parents some thirty years ago when i came out as gay. dad came around a bit, mum never did. my partner supported me all during this. his dad died first, then mine, then my mum. his mum is alive and has kinda adopted me.except i feel detached from everything around me. i don't call anywhere home. i grew up all over the uk and abroad."," >small things set me off, crying. sad songs. reminders. this is normal, there's nothing wrong with what's happening to you. it's all part of what some will call, ""grieving process"". there's no time limit for grief and, even if a loved one died many years ago some little thing can trigger tears or upset. it happens, it's normal, don't be scared by it all. some people can feel a bit overwhelmed by these emotions, and all the baggage that goes with being bereaved, and can benefit from bereavement counselling. maybe think about it? these people can help cruse remember, too, that you are not alone and you do have somewhere to call your home - it's where you are with your partner. maybe it's time to let those roots develop?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7mti09/visiting_mum_in_the_nursing_home/,Visiting mum in the nursing home

(i'm with him every weekend and it would be more frequent if i didn't live 2 hrs away). i was completely shocked cause we had talked on the phone three times that day and he knew my schedule.i talked to my aunt about it and she said he does get cranky often but the doctor said it's because his blood sugar is constantly up and down. i told my cousin who is a nurse about it and she wondered if his cancer had maybe spread further, to the brain. i know no one here is a professional and it's really a conversation to have with his doctor, but i haven't seen him be angry at me in years. he was a mean man to me growing up so i had this almost child like fear of him last night. he hasn't spoken to me like that since i was a teen. he apologized this morning for being mean but then said ""if you visited me i wouldn't be like that."" this is all new behavior. i really don't understand and i'm scared."," my wife is a type 1 diabetic and former nurse. blood sugar fluctuations can definitely cause anger issues, much like someone who gets 'hangry' from hypoglycemia. my mom, on the other hand, has dementia, and was also angry and abusive when she was younger. she does go on rants like she did when she was younger, but they are actually rarer. and she has both fear and pain that make her angry.from your description, my vote goes for uncontrolled blood sugar. note that the pain meds might also be a problem, depending on what they are. my mom (former addict and alcoholic) spent a few years gobbling oxycontin due to a disabling injury, and the drugs themselves made her angry and violent. if it were dementia, he probably wouldn't remember it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7ly7cf/does_dementia_cause_crankiness/,Does dementia cause crankiness?

"(long post, sorry)hey everyone. i stumbled upon this subreddit just now and don't know where else to go to for help. i read through some of the posts and saw the amount of support and figured this was a good place to start. i'm currently visiting my grandparents here in germany with my mother and little sister (we live in an unnoteworthy midwest state in the us) and i need advice. my 82-year-old grandfather has what we think is dementia, and things have recently begun getting worse. it's never been diagnosed, but in the last two years, enough has occurred for us to take notice.  we first noticed symptoms two summers ago when he began experiencing troubles with his memory. he would start forgetting simple routines he followed every day and could no longer perform work on his projects without problems (he was a handyman for fun). he started getting frustrated but was aware of his forgetfulness and his personality didn't really change.after that summer, the forgetfulness started getting worse and he would have alternating days where he was mildly absentminded and then days where he would forget that he had a wife (who he has been married to for over 60 years). other times he would be generally anxious and paranoid--small disturbances would upset him for long periods of time and he would become depressed and stopped leaving the apartment altogether.the following december he had surgery to remove a cancerous bladder and was put under with anesthesia for ~4 hours. he was extremely disoriented following the surgery and regularly hallucinated for a few days afterward. he was 81 at the time and prior to the surgery, the doctors informed my mother that she would have to make arrangements since they were certain that he wouldn't be able to take care of his wife on his own when he returned home. since then there has been a rotation of caregivers that come to stay with him and my grandmother.the symptoms worsened after that. he grew more and more depressed and paranoid and would lose objects around the apartment when he hid them and later forgot their locations. small disturbances would throw him into a fit of mania and he sometimes spent whole days pacing around the apartment and making phone calls to friends and family. one of the more recent incidents involved his growing fear and paranoia that he was running out of money, which wasn't ever really a worry for him i guess. he was a kind of overseer and managed over 200 workers at a mercedes benz factory here in germany from ~1960-1990, and has a comfortable retirement income. my grandma was in the hospital a few months ago for lung problems and that aggravated his paranoia, so one day he took his walker and went alone all the way to his bank, withdrew 1000 euros, and lost them somewhere in the apartment. he hadn't been to the bank in maybe over 3 years and spent the rest of the week searching for the money and neglecting to eat or drink or sleep. he even started accusing the caregivers of stealing the money and would call our house in the us at 3 am in the morning rambling incoherently.in addition to all of this, he has been suffering from trigeminal neuralgia for the past 40 years. the pain has grown exponentially over the last decade and exacerbates his depression and mania. my mother and some of my grandpa's doctors think that this, in addition to the morphine pills that he has been taking since his diagnosis, has completely destroyed his nervous system and is causing all of the other normal forgetful tendencies to grow into the fucking horrible experience he now has to suffer through every single day. today was particularly bad. my grandpa was aggressive pretty much the whole day and was getting angry at everyone, including my grandma. she cannot walk and has been in a wheelchair for the last decade, and spends the most time alone with him when we and the caregivers are not there. he hit her on the head when he walked by her earlier, and it isn't the first time he's done that. when i told my mother she broke down crying and told me that she didn't want to leave him alone with my grandma anymore. she told me about a psychiatric hospital for the elderly that my grandpa's primary doctor mentioned to her when she last visited, and she has been considering it in the last few months. this would be a good environment to monitor his symptoms and if he would be committed he would be cared for by experts with plenty of experience. i know that this would break his heart though, just as it would break all of ours. he would only get more depressed and would lose the little strength he has left to continue.she told my sister and i that she would feel guilty for making a decisive choice though, but she knows that it is selfish to wait for things to escalate in order to justify something like committing him into an institution. it was out of desperation, i think, but she asked us for opinions and advice on the whole situation and i had no idea what to say. the whole thing is so fucked and unfair, and so i came here to look for some kind of information to help me help her.when my mom isn't here in person, she is managing everything--the doctor visits, the caregivers, the mania, everything--over the phone, 4,000 miles away from her parents. she is in constant stress and has been taking antidepressants for several years. it fucking kills me to see her and her parents suffer like this. if anyone has any advice, i would greatly appreciate it. at the very least, i want to be able to tell my mom something to make her feel better about whatever decision she makes. thanks in advance. you're all beautiful individuals for creating and maintaining a place like this."," it sounds like he is upset whether he is home or not. ya the facility might upset him more but at least this way he wont be able to harm himself, or others. i have worked with clients who are way past their families abilities to care for them and i have always done my best but it breaks my heart because they are not in a safe environment. if there is a caregiver that has been there for a while maybe have your mom have a candid discussion with the caregiver and ask for advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7lqxft/advice_needed/,ADVICE NEEDED

(sundowning?)we (my daughter and i) got her into senior care and while there she started seeing a psychiatrist who changed her medication around some. this seemed to bring things to the surface even more to the point where she would forget what day it is and who people were until we reminded her and she wouldn‚Äôt take her meds correctly because she couldn‚Äôt recall when she last took them. now she is to the point where she has put cardboard on her windows and is talking about speaking to neighbors that have been dead for over a year. she yells random words and claims she can‚Äôt shut up and accuses family members of controlling her with a remote control. she sits there and won‚Äôt eat or drink and just pees herself then gets angry about it. so much anger! last night she was threatening to burn the house down so she was taken to the hospital via ambulance and kept overnight for possible dementia induced delirium. it‚Äôs very difficult to see what symptoms could be from medication issues, what could be from dementia, and what could be from her mental illness. i found very little information online about dealing with dementia in the already mentally ill. the hospital is talking about helping my daughter get power of attorney (she has lived with my daughter for a few years now) and getting mom into a home. they (my daughter &amp; her husband) have small children at home (3 kids ranging from 6 months old to 8 yrs) and it‚Äôs hurting them to see her this way as well as scary to think at this point what she might do. thanks in advance for any help you might be able to give me on how dementia is diagnosed in these types of cases and on dealing with the guilt we are feeling when she says that putting her in a home is the same as killing her."," she sounds like the people at the dementia lodge where i volunteer. the psychotic stuff is also just regular dementia probs, which ebb and flow over time. a facility can handle her, normalise things like adult nappies, and monitor her fluids (a huge risk in her mental decline). do not feel guilty as long as the home is not abusive.

"my mom is in her 70s and has been exhibiting signs of memory loss for the last several years. she also is pretty much deaf (she has a hearing aid but it doesn't seem to help that much), so for a long time i couldn't tell whether it was memory loss or just her being unable to hear. (e.g., my dad would tell her that a friend invited them to dinner next week. she would seem excited about that. later in the evening my dad would mention the friend's invitation again, and my mom would react as if this was brand new information.)a few things have happened over the past couple of years that made me realize that she is definitely experiencing memory loss in addition to hearing loss. for example, my dad told me at a family lunch one day that my mom's sister has parkinson's. when my mom seemed shocked, my dad said that my mom was the one who told him. (i've since confirmed that my aunt does have parkinson's, so it's not something my dad misheard or misremembered.)another example: my parents had a party, and they invited one of my mom's oldest friends from high school. my mom sat next to her at dinner and talked to her all night. the next day we were looking at photos from the party, and my mom pointed at her friend in the photo and said, ""she looks very familiar.""also, according to my dad, she will walk around the kitchen (in the house they've lived in for the past 40 years - last redecorated at least 20 years ago) looking for the cabinet with the glasses.there are many more examples, but you get the idea. several years ago, when i first suspected my mom was having more than normal age-related memory problems, i asked my dad if she had seen a doctor about it. he said she is very embarrassed about her memory, doesn't want to talk about it, feels judged, and also no longer sees a gp  (her old doctor retired several years ago). my mom has always been very health conscious (former nurse), and my dad is the one who is afraid of doctors - but the rest of what he was saying kind of made sense. throughout their marriage, my dad has always judged my mom and subtly implied she is not as smart or high class as he is, so i'm sure she wasn't super happy to be talking to him about how her memory is failing.a few years ago, i tried again and got the same answer, so i enlisted my sister to see if she could help provide some support for the whole ""let's take mom to the doctor"" idea. my sister's response was, basically, why bother? a doctor can't treat or reverse dementia; if my sister were in mom's place, she would rather not know, etc.i have pointed both my sister and dad to online resources about dementia and menory loss which list various medical causes - a very small number of which actually are treatable/reversible. i have made the argument that the sooner mom has a diagnosis and treatment, the sooner she can start planning for her future in a reasonable way. the only argument my dad even halfway listened to was when i told him that, selfishly, i'd like to know whether this is something that i may have inherited. still, it wasn't that convincing: she still hasn't been to see a doctor. i know that if my mom doesn't want to see a doctor, she shouldn't have to. she is a grown adult. the thing is, i'm not hearing this from her; i'm hearing it from my dad, who i'm not 100% sure is reliable on this subject. i don't know what their conversation was like. an entirely imagined but not impossible scenario: ""oh there you go forgetting things again! you really need some help!"" ""no i don't!"" (stomps off in rage) later: ""well, i tried to talk to your mom about getting help, but she wasn't having it, so what can we do.""my questions:1. is it important for her to see a doctor? or are my dad and sister right when they say there's no point in it?2. if i try again, i think i'm going to make a plea directly to her, rather than going through my dad. i'll have no family support obviously. i only see my mom with my dad (rarely alone) - and he usually takes us to loud restaurants where she can't hear anything. she can't use the phone. she doesn't use email or text or social media. would a letter work? that's literally the only option i can think of.many thanks in advance for any information or advice!"," >my mom is in her 70s and has been exhibiting signs of memory loss for the last several years. she also is pretty much deaf (she has a hearing aid but it doesn't seem to help that much), so for a long time i couldn't tell whether it was memory loss or just her being unable to hear.>i know that if my mom doesn't want to see a doctor, she shouldn't have to. she is a grown adult. the thing is, i'm not hearing this from her; i'm hearing it from my dad>is it important for her to see a doctor? or are my dad and sister right when they say there's no point in it?these three are, i think, the key points.people who don't hear too well will often tune out of conversations because it's all too hard to deal with, so it's difficult to know whether they're not remembering or not hearing. you do say, though, that your mum isn't recalling when she's told others about things which does hint at some form of memory loss.if, when given that option, she doesn't want to see a doctor then she has that right. but she can't make that decision if she isn't asked the question. you can't rely on hearsay and third party decisions made on her behalf. you have to find a way to talk to her - writing a letter seems impersonal and quite heartless, if i'm honest.a diagnosis can be more important for the family than for the individual, or at least on the surface, because the family is likely to have to do the caring.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7j3eev/my_mom_may_have_dementia_and_no_one_in_my_family/,My mom may have dementia and no one in my family thinks she needs medical help

(couldn't have been any of her other children and their spouses, of course, because they're all 'very nice'.)my husband's siblings visit their mother once a year, if we're lucky. they always, always, go away with some cash from her purse and something nice from her cupboards or a picture from the wall. she tells us what they've taken, but they never do. we know how much money they've taken from her because we are the ones who go to the bank to get her cash and know how much she needs each week - she can no longer use a debit card. bit by bit these two siblings and their spouses are taking all the half decent stuff that should really be a joint inheritance, to be equally shared out. we've reached the point where we no longer care. we're the ones with the day-to-day running around, we use our time and our petrol to make sure she's okay. they just turn up, rummage through cupboards and take things. if they're so desperate for her belongings that they're willing to take from her whilst she might still need them then they can have the lot - even our own children want nothing by way of an inheritance because they're sickened by it all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7gj61q/scams/,Scams

"yesterday my mother told me my grandmother has been diagnosed with an early stage of dementia. she has been living all alone as a widow for decades now. she's 89 years old and although she's doing well in general, she recently developed some issues. her speaking abilities are declining. she often forgets certain words or names, which frustrates her a great deal. she sometimes doesn't remember whether she had told a certain story before. despite all this, i didn't consider the possibility of her having dementia. i lost a grandfather to alzheimer's 7 years ago, when i was 9 years old. it was a pretty agressive type of alzheimer's, and the experience was traumatic. my grandfather was 66 when he was diagnosed and 70 when he died. my mother assured me it wouldn't be like this with my grandmother. she says that my grandmother has dementia, which is not as extreme as alzheimer's. she says that it's less likely my grandmother will suffer from hallucinations, like my grandfather. my grandmother will be using medication that would slow the process down for up to 2 years.now, i'm not convinced this is true. she might be saying it to comfort us, because i didn't find anything that would confirm her claims on google. so i guess i'd like to know if it's true that dementia is less extreme than alzheimer's, and more generally, what to expect."," if you want to learn more about dementia you could take part in this free course next year    it's a really not threatening course which runs for 10 weeks and takes 3 hours (maximum) of time a week, but there's no weekly deadlines and in this year's course they gave people three extra weeks to complete it so if life gets in the way you've got some extra time.it's not a course with assignments or grading, and is meant to be an introduction to dementia (of all types) for everyone from people work in aged care to people recently diagnosed with dementia. it could even be good for your mom to do also. i partook in this year's course after having lost my grandmother last year, i was a carer for her for 5 years of her disease, and when i did the course it started out as a way to get a taste for the dementia care degree that the university offers and i thought it'd just be good for that purpose alone, but as i went through it i realized how invaluable that course would have been to me and my family when my grandmother was first diagnosed. it covers everything from methods of care and helping a patient have the best quality of life; whether it's in the community or a care facility, makes you think about the important things like end of life care directives and having those discussion early with the person with dementia if possible, and it teaches you a little bit about the brain of someone in dementia and how what's occuring can/will likely impact that person. anyway it might be worth a look. i think it's less intimidating than sifting through all the information online, and you know it's coming from a reputable source.i'm sorry to hear about your grandmothers diagnosis, i hope she says well for as long as possible. all the best.

they collect her and take her back home. we have organised all this on her behalf, yet when she talks to 'visitors' (care staff, doctor, specialists etc) she claims to look after herself.if something goes wrong then it's me who's on call. i go and see what the problem is and sort it out. if a doctor has to be called then i'll do that and wait for them to arrive, sort out extra meals if she's, ""too ill"" to go out. i do cleaning up and tidying up, sort out her shopping (which i've bought) and, when she'll let me, also her laundry.i do all this mechanically now. i talk almost all the time, giving her time to respond. i always keep the mood as light as possible. i make her a cup of tea, give her a tasty biscuit or her lunch, make sure all is well and then leave and go home. if she falls five minutes after i've left then there's nothing i can do about it, she has an alarm pendant - but doesn't know what it's for. she should be in a care home, but her other children won't agree to it. she doesn't accept that she has dementia and any mention of the word leads to weeks of ill-temper and abuse.i've written all this down not for sympathy but because it may help you with tactics. your mother needs help, yet you don't like her. you're allowed not to like her, but you do like your father. somehow you need to learn to separate your dislike of your mother and your father's needs. you need to almost treat your mother as 'just any woman who is sick' and bury all that emotion. it's hard, very hard, at first because it hurts like hell when they're foul to you but this time it's the disease talking rather than them. it's their messed up mind trying to make sense of the world around them, rather than a tirade at you personally. i know, from personal experience, that some types of therapy aren't as 'good' as others. your therapy might be good at uncovering reasons for a rift, but it should also be helping you to deal with those issues in a way that's productive. if all it's doing is looking back, then maybe a different therapist who can help you focus more on the future?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7cf7am/advice_please/,Advice please
so i will try to keep this as short and concise as possible. my grandmother has dementia. she was having slight hallucinations but within about a week is having full on delusions. we believe it was due to being on new meds that interacted with each other. she is now off the meds but the problem hasn't gone away. the real question is we don't know what to do. my mom is her caregiver but she works 2 jobs and my grandmothers insurance has denied her claim for in home care. they only live a block away from each other but with all the doctors visits and everything my mom doesn't have the time or energy to do a lot of leg work. she doesn't know where to start and she feels helpless. my grandmother has a case worker but they are no help. does anyone have any advice on who my mother could call to get some help? she just doesn't know who to contact or really what questions to ask. any help would be greatly appreciated.," i'm not sure where you are located, but if you are in the states there are usually local elder care resources you can tap into. if you just search for elder care in your area you should be able to get in contact with someone who should at least be able to point you to the right resources.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7bp9lp/helpadvice_greatly_needed/,Help/advice greatly needed

"(my views may be upsetting and controversial please respect them as my views and my experience)my  mum has dementia we believe it is part vascular and part some other kind, she does not follow the normal downward curve of events or even follow the stages, with her it is more like steps she will stay at a level for a week or a month then a major drop will happen like going from normal toilets to completely incontinent or eating and liking sweet things to no longer eating 99% of things events happen really quickly usually a big drop then a small raise in function then another big drop and so on.it started a couple of years ago when she was 59, within a month she was unable to speek anything other than gibberish, this was while she was still in denial at the diagnosis this meant we never had time to setup her wishes in documentation.we look after her at home and plan to do so until the end which may be coming soon, on the uk stages form she is now at 7b or c, we have a macmillan nurse who visits once a month and is just waiting for us to say when we need more help with pallative care they have been wonderful.we moved in next door to our mum so we can help her partner 24/7 if needed, i am already a carer of my wife who is disabled so we were able to offer help and advice on a lot of subjects most people do not have to deal with.we have setup a non resucitation red letter (i believe it is called something) we are all of the same feelings even though she was never able to put it down on paper or decide for herself we know this is not living and not what she wanted, if euthenasia was legal we would have already gone down that route, as it is all we can do is wait until she can no longer take food or liquid and take it that way.that may be shocking to some and it isn't about this being a bother it is objectiveness, we all knew my mum very well, she was an amazing, intelligent woman, independent and proud, i know she wouldn't want this because 30 years ago we had a friend who went through it and mum sat me down at the breakfast table one day and said ""if that ever happens to me find a way to end it"" she was completely serious and i sadly have failed that promise because i can not chance breaking the law and not being there for my wife.on the other hand unlike most people we have delt with death in our life for many years, my father went into a coma after a car crash after 6 months (no brain activity) my mum made the decision to not give him medication the next time he got a chest infection, her mother had throat cancer and in the late stages asked her to overdose her on morphine and she was the only one who loved her enough to do it for her when the rest of the family wanted to keep her alive for selfish reasons.add to that my wife has been slowly dying due to her illness for 20 years so death and mortality is an old friend to us.what bothers me the most is two sad truthsunlike cancer which can easily be classed as terminal and delt with accordingly dementia is still being classed as an illness where a cure is possible (not saying there will not be but once the damage to the brain is done past a certain point what is the point) and thus it is harder to get end of life care, in some ways d is the new c word.at the same time i dog lover and i know that if i allowed one of our dogs to live with the simptoms my mum has and not put him to sleep i would be rightly so done for animal cruelty.when i see the shell the husk of a person my mum has become when nothing of her old self is left and only the strength of her body is keeping her going past where her brain has already gone breaks me up inside."," >dementia is still being classed as an illness where a cure is possiblethis is the cruellest of cruel classifications because there is no cure and, frankly, unlikely to be a cure in the near future. it does, though, mean that dementia patients don't seem eligible for hospice care.>i know that if i allowed one of our dogs to live with the simptoms my mum has and not put him to sleep i would be rightly so done for animal crueltyrightly or wrongly, our pets seem to have more end-of-life rights than we humans. some of us humans are ~~expected~~ forced to linger on for as long as possible, when there is never going to be a positive outcome because a medical condition means that we will never get better.i often believe that the medical authorities are a bit scared of loosening legislation in case it is abused or applied incorrectly, or because 'the wrong generation' might be euthanised (or allowed to die) if it's acknowledged that their medical conditions mean that their existence is too cruel, too painful, and in some cases too pointless - and i couldn't argue against that point of view.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7axqzp/dementia_where_voice_when_early_on/,Dementia where voice when early on.

"has anyone had experience with the diagnosis of vascular dementia? about two years ago i posted on this sub regarding my father, 56. my mother and i had concerns about him but no one seemed to believe us. fast forward to an emergency hospital trip for my fathers liver. the nurses and a new doctor picked up that something was ""off"" about him. not being able to form thoughts clearly or find the right words. a lot of forgetting what was going on, and an inability to learn new concepts of his health(i.e. carb counting) his medical history includes a long list of heart disease, 8-bypass heart surgery, diabetes, high bp and cholesterol... so with the help of an entirely new system of drs, he was eventually referred to an amazing neurologist. however, he told us he can not diagnose dementia so he was referred to a psychoneurologist. this specialist spent three hours with my father and ruled out alzheimer's and all other genetic dementia. he believed my father was suffering severe depression. he's unable to find anywhere else to get that testing done.but here's the kicker... his neurologist has brain scans with an incredible amount of damage to white matter, and his cardiologist 100% believes he does have vascular dementia due to a high number of mini strokes. but neither one of them can write an official diagnosis? we are frustrated because he has been out of work for 4 years now.

first of all my grandma was diagnosed with dementia several years ago. it's hard for me to say what stage she's in because she's goes through normal everyday activities fine but has some memory loss. the worst part is she has vivid delusions and hallucinations. she thinks we hate her and try to do everything we can to upset her. she thinks there is mutiple non existent people she see children running around etc. she thinks the neighbors constantly watch her. i've read alot about it and i know it's best to avoid situations if possible but how do i deal when she's says you stole from me because i can't distract her she can remember enough to bring it back up. she remembers certain things for months. like it seems going along with delusions might cause more problems because she threatens to call the police etc. the hard thing is she know she's has dementia and she knows she forgets most of the time. my grandpa is constantly irritated because she yells and argues most of everyday. even if you get her calmed down 5 minutes later it's something totally different. she won't take the medications she is given for dementia. advice needed please.," >she won't take the medications she is given for dementia.and, realistically, this medication isn't going to make much difference because all it can do is slow the decline and for some people this can be worse than getting worse.>she has vivid delusions and hallucinationscan you discuss this with her doctor? it may be that she could do with some different medication to help deal with these hallucinations, or it could be that something in her diet or some infection is causing this.>she won't take the medicationssometimes 'vitamins' are taken more easily than other things. maybe tell some untruths? but without a court order nobody can force somebody else to take medication they don't want to take.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7auutw/what_steps_can_i_take_to_help_my_grandma_with/,What steps can I take to help my Grandma with dementia but also my grandpa who says he can't take it anymore?

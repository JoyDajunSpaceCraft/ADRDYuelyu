"he occasionally seems disoriented and confused.  he makes weird irrelevant statements at times.  i live very close to him, and he is always contacting when he forgets his login passwords for just about everything.  he always loses his keys, and forgets appointments.  c the interesting part is that his father was not diagnosed with dementia until his late 80’s, and passed in his mid 90’s.  i have no idea how he could be getting it so young.  he has always bragged about how he’s in great physical shape.  exercises and eats healthy everyday, and will live till he is 100.  it appears that is not going to happen the way things look now.  please help!", 71 is not relatively young. it's relatively old.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eo6yyo/my_still_relatively_young_father_seems_to_be/,"My still relatively young father seems to be declining rapidly.

"hello, my grandma has hallucinations of people in her house who doing random things in the house. my grandma doesn't seem to be frightened by them but she tells me she finds their presence annoying as they are for example having loud conversations. i told her i do not see them, but that i understand how she feels. i wonder if i could talk to her hallucinations by saying things to the empy room and then asking my grandma what they replied. could i try this or should i leave it alone?"," my mom has been hallucinating since early november, it’s been getting hard to work around it with her - she keeps bringing up my father who passed away in 2002 or her own father and i try to play into it but today was a rough one, it seemed every 20 minutes she’d be back to asking when i tried to pull her out from it. she gets agitated easily as well if i don’t explain where he is or answer her questions so i try my best to play along with the “therapeutic fibs”. it’s actually highly recommended to play into it because it’s they’re reality and it’s confusing if you try to switch them out of their world.my mom seems to hear people outside the house calling for her to come outside so i call out to them and have “chats” but i had to put extra locks on the doors since a few times she wandered when i went to the bathroom or another room and as slow as she is on her feet she seems to get a jolt to head out quickly. she just started trazedone for sleep and then partly during the day to help keep her chill as well and it’s helped with sleep definitely but not the hallucinating.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/enpp5u/can_i_interact_with_my_grandmothers_hallucinations/,Can I interact with my grandmother's hallucinations?
"background: so- my father has some form of dementia (as per a few health care providers)– a more formal diagnosis has not happened yet.  he will need to go into care soon but we are trying to let him be at home for as long as possible and are working on that so i’m not going into it.  he is very hard of hearing (doesn’t wear hearing aides despite our best efforts for years) and also gets lonely (we try to get him opportunities to socialize but he won’t use them- it seems unless its close friends or family he has no interest- he usually has 1 visitor per day).  meanwhile, i am one of two of his 6 kids who is involved at all in helping.  of the two of us- i take the majority of the ‘dealing with dad’ load in terms of calls- my sib is closer and helps with the ‘take dad here’ type tasks but doesn’t have the patience for dad’s drama which has always been bad (narc tendencies)- now it is just worse – plus the mood swings etc.  i just moved for a big job that without going into the details requires a lot of outside of 9-5 work hours (think lawyer, dr., etc. type jobs- re paperwork at home after hrs).  i really want to enjoy starting and also get off on the right foot.  i live 8 hrs away from him.in step the issue: at work i simply cannot openly answer the phone when he calls as i have to very literally scream for him to hear me- which is not pleasant for me nor my coworkers in a quiet building with offices etc.  nevermind that this is super stressful whenever we do chat.  mind you when he calls it is not a friendly conversation but to vent/rant etc.  i talk to him every day and 95% of the time i feel horrible after- re- a bad mood for at least 30 mins after.  to be honest it is not healthy for me to talk with him more than once a day and sometimes i think even once a day is really bad for my mental health- but i know he ‘needs’ this call time.  thus, i’ve tried to make a personal rule that i chat with him once every day but no more.  i often break the rule when he calls say 6 times in a row because even though it has happened a hundred times before i always think ‘something has happened- i had better make sure he’s ok.’  i’ve tried to ‘train’ him (sorry if that seems like a rude way to put it-but i’m not sure how else to phrase it) to call me at 5:30 every day- this way i can carve out time to chat.  it started to work for awhile (he’d still call say 3 times before 5:30 – but that sure the hell beats 10 times)- but it doesn’t seem to be sticking.  i plan to keep asking him to call at 5:30 and really push this as it’s the only thing that seems logical at this point.  help!  i know it is the weekend but i try to keep things the same all the time- and again- i woke up to 3 missed calls already today… nevermind that my inbox is always full- i simply can’t clean out the messages fast enough to ever have space when other people call.  there are a lot of other things to unpack with his care which is ongoing and so i’m leaving that all out here.  instead (baby steps) can you advise me with this phone thing: what should i do?  is once a day/set time good?  what about the 12+ missed calls everyday if i do that?  i’m constantly on edge.  another key thing is that in my big move my bf and i are now apart and i love to chat with him – texting mostly – meaning i can’t really  just turn off my phone during the day… tho maybe he and i can do skype messaging or something.  request to kind internet strangers: could any of you help me not feel like a jerk for not answering during the day, maybe give me ideas… burner phone for dad?  other?  *my sib just called me to say he had to block my dad (presumably short-term) as he’d called ~20 xs already today- my brother answered once or twice and it was as i described – venting and ranting and not much else."," could you get a new phone with a new number that's just for ""dad calls""? leave the ringer off all the time, and answer consistently at 5:30 only? that way you could still have your phone nearby so you could talk to your boyfriend, and your voicemail box wouldn't be constantly full.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/enbre3/help_loosing_my_mind_and_super_stressed_with/,"HELP!

"this is sort of a rant/vent and i’m sorry it’s so long.my mom has frontotemporal degeneration/dementia and can’t be home alone anymore. she has trouble doing simple things like even remembering to go to the bathroom without being reminded. i have been spending wednesday’s with her for the last year or so because i have that day off of work. my aunt and a caregiver take care of her the other week days and my father who is her primary caregiver spends nights and weekends with her at home. so here’s the deal, i’m pregnant for the first time with twins and it hasn’t been easy. i’ve been dealing with hg (severe morning sickness) since my first trimester and i also have ulcerative colitis which has been flaring up for the past couple weeks. it’s miserable. on top of that my husband and i are closing on a house first week of february and moving further away. we are also still in the process of showing our condo and i still work the other week days. i am so overwhelmed and feel horrible most of the time. i’m stressed about the pregnancy because i haven’t been gaining the amount of weight i’m supposed to and am constantly getting sick.i told my father that once we close on the house and move it will be very hard for me to help with my mom. this is the truth, but i also need a break physically and emotionally because i feel more exhausted than i’ve ever felt in my life. i can’t help feeling guilty, like i’m forcing this on my dad and abandoning my mom. i can’t help feeling like this is selfish of me, but even if i still made the long drive over there well into my 3rd trimester i’ll still have to stop once the twins come. i’ve asked him a couple times if he has plans for wednesday’s and every time he acts annoyed. he doesn’t have any plans yet but we’re just a couple weeks away from moving. i miss my mother. i won’t have her to help with my shower, i won’t have her there to help once the babies come. i would never ask my dad for that stuff, all i want is for him to make sure she’s taken care of. i’m worried she’ll end up home alone on wednesday’s. i know he’s going through a lot and i hate putting this on him. i hate nagging him but i wish i could get through to him. i don’t know what to do."," please don’t sacrifice your health and babies. the main thing is to realize that your family needs help.

"i didn't know how to explain it in a title... just recently (2-3 weeks ago) my grandma's dementia really started worsening. she began often confusing my mum with some other mysterious woman, she thinks that someone (some girl, or sometimes boy) came to visit us and then asks who that was (but i think it was me she saw but at the time couldn't recognise me), what school they go to and stuff like that. also she somehow remembered her cousin whom she hasn't seen in more than 30 years, and they've lost all contact. all of a sudden she thinks he came to our house and confuses him with my dad (her son). there are many more examples like that. so of course in the beginning my parents and me corrected her every time, and then she realises that she was confused but after a few minutes the whole situation repeats. my question is: do we keep correcting her or just go along with her stories? i'm beginning to feel it's better for her if we played along with her."," correcting them often ends up confusing them less.  if there is no harm by not correcting them, then don't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/en8xzc/do_i_keep_correcting_my_grandma_when_she_makes_a/,Do I keep correcting my grandma when she makes a mistake?
"my father has dementia - frontal lobe we think - almost zero short term memory. you can have a conversation with him, 20 seconds later he asks the same questions. but he knows everyone and otherwise his health is ok. a couple of years ago, my teen age daughter was gravely ill in icu and he actually remembered and worried about her for months after she was better. it was the only thing he remembered after several years of dementia. now this week, my younger sister’s only son (middle schooler) passed away suddenly from a tragic illness. mom told dad about it and he seemed to get it like before, was able to be sympathetic and comforting to his daughter when he saw her. however hours later he was confused about it. he knew something had happened and was agitated but couldn’t remember what. now we’re worried that he’ll forget and constantly ask her how he is (first thing he always asks after are his grandkids). i can’t bear the thought of my sister having to either lie about it or relive the tragedy every time he sees her. any advice about how to deal with this at all would be so much appreciated."," it's just one of the million terrible things about dementia. your sister might want to come up with the easiest way she can say it to him, or otherwise perhaps try some distraction techniques. it's hard to know what will work for your dad, but for mine a ""you already asked me dad, hey look what's on tv tonight"" or something like that usually works when he asks about something that's difficult to say again. that way you don't have to lie and pretend, which is usually the better option for dementia sufferers but probably not in this case since he'd then continue to ask ""and what has \_\_\_ been doing, are they doing well in school"" etc. but of course your sister would also find it extremely difficult to relay what happened- for her sake and for his. i think distract if you can, if it's possible, but if not, have something prepared to say for when he does ask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/en2hn2/help_with_bad_news/,Help with bad news
"i work for a company that handles workers compensation. there is a coworker of mine who suffered a terrible car accident some years ago, resulting in head injuries. following the accident, his memory functions are quite off. in fact, he came to me asking i printed up his request, but i told him that i never got any request from him. he got irritated and said he did send an email about it, but i show him my email and that no request came through. some other coworkers said that he has done some bad things while in court with attorneys, including throwing any of his coworkers under the bus and blaming them for not helping him finish his work. he has been disciplined for not doing his own work and that they remind him of certain issues. my boss told me that sometimes he can't remember what he did the day before and he can't remember the names of attorneys that he contacts. is this some kind of dementia forming or is there a different name for loss of memory functions from head injuries?", was he a good worker prior to the injury? or is he using his injury to get out of doing his job?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/emvh35/need_help_with_a_coworker/,Need help with a coworker

"heads up, this is going to be a bit of sleep deprived rant, but it's intention is a cry for help - my grandmother was diagnosed with ftd at 52, lived 10 years, mostly in a zombie like state and finally passed in 2008. this was obviously gut wrenching and also alarming given how young she was. fast forward to 2018 and my mom (at age 60), starts showing some of the same signs my grandmother did - socially inappropriate, angry outbursts, forgetful, going in the shower with articles of clothing still on, lack of empathy, etc. i thought at first she was just getting old and ornery, but it finally clicked. once it did, i couldn't believe i didn't put it together before. she hasn't been to a doctor for any of this or been diagnosed, but it seems fairly obvious what is going on. my mom currently handles everything - the bills, the taxes, the laundry, everything including taking care of her own aging dad.i talked to my step-dad and he also has seen these changes and is scared. he is a tough guy, so once i knew he knew something was wrong and is scared, my world sort of fell apart because now i know it's real. since this reality has sunk in, i'm in a full panic 24/7. i have not slept without waking up every hour in a heart thumping panic in weeks. what keeps me up are these realities and questions -   * my mom doesn't know anything is wrong. we don't want to tell her because we think she will commit suicide, but this poses many problems stated below. i also wonder if not telling her is ethically the right thing to do here. * her driving is fine now, but i want those who are getting in the car with her to know her condition before they decide to ride in it. i don't want her driving my kid, nor any others i care about, but how do we tell her this without letting on what is happening? what happens if she plows into a bunch of kids on the side of the road - that will haunt me as something i could have prevented.* we don't know what paperwork needs doing, but we know she does not have a will and is a homeowner with her husband, my step dad. what paper work should we get her to fill out now while she can and how do we convincer her to without telling her something is wrong? do we need poa's for anything? how does one get poa, fill out a form? where do we get the form and how do we make if official? so many other questions about paperwork.* **will i also get this?**  this sends a cold chill down my spine. the more i've read trying to find something comforting, the more i fall into total hopeless despair. i know i have a 50% chance, and for me and my pessimistic attitude, that means i will or already have it. **i feel suicidal over this**. i have never felt suicidal before until now. i'm 39 and have a wife and a young child and feel like the sooner i do it the better to try and give them as long as time as possible without me so that they can get over my death sooner. i know i can get the dna test, but i'm too much of a coward to get it. i realize this makes no sense if i am suicidal anyways. i also have an older sister who feels the same way. this is all so tragic given my younger sister did commit suicide years ago, and now the remaining of us also want to follow. life is bleak.* i feel like we should give my mom the option of suicide while we still can. i feel like as a family we should give her permission to do so and let her do things on her terms. i don't know how this would go down or the legalities involved but i feel like it should be her right to do so. i live in ca and there is no death with dignity conditions in the law here that allows for suicide of the demented. * how am i going to hold down a job carrying all this? i provide the sole income in our household. i need to help my stepdad with all this and can barely manage my own suicidal thoughts and anxiety. i also have a chronic illness that has me in pain 24/7 on top of it all. * how do i help my stepdad? i don't even know what needs doing or how to help myself. and because we are hiding this, i cant just call him all the time and talk it out - me and my stepdad never called each other before all this so my mom would be suspicious.* i need sleep. i take 600mg of gabapentin a day, lots of cbd oil in the am and in the pm, magnesium, chamomile tea, meditate, go to church, read books before bed, nothing helps and i'm going insane over it. or perhaps this is my own dementia starting?i know this is a lot, but if there is anyone out there that can give me some advice on what to do next, or how to cope, encouragement, anything i would appreciate it greatly. i feel lost and hopeless, without a future, sad for my kid, a useless coward and utterly defeated."," (crap i'm sorry.  please take that as a given, rather than me repeating it every other sentence here...)from what i've learned, here's my two cents:* my take: don't hide it.  don't hide it from her, don't hide it from others.  you need to be able to discuss it freely with her and her husband.* you might think it a kindness for her not to know.  but those of you around her can't deal with it well without discussing it with her.  and i guess she also has the right to know.* wouldn't you rather know, if you had ftd?  maybe if i was in a completely controlled, safe, happy environment like a cruise ship where i could magically live for the rest of my days, maybe i could be ok with not knowing i had ftd.  but i don't, and you don't, and she doesn't.  she lives in the real world and there are real-world issues that have to be addressed.* get her an appointment with a doctor a.s.a.p.  doctors have tests that will help make it real for her, and confirm what you suspect.  you need to able to address this.  the family history should, frankly, help.  ""mom, we need to see your doctor.  we've made an appointment.  you know there's a family history, we need to make sure everything's ok.""  this means it's not you or her husband being a bad guy, this is medicine, and something you all have to deal with together.  you're all on the same side.* you need to take the car keys away from her.  this **will** be difficult.  and probably impossible if she doesn't know about her ftd.* note i said ""take the car keys away from her"", not ""tell her to stop driving.""  she will resist.  driving, if you're in the u.s. at least, is independence.  even after you've discussed with her taking away her car keys -- and gotten her to agree... -- it will be impossible to enforce if you don't remove her car and give her other ways of getting around, readily available.* relevant story: after i found out my father had alzheimers and i took his car away, i heard from my mother that she'd been nervous when she was out with him because sometimes he would, for a second, drive aggressively at a bicyclist.  wtf.  she said she'd yell at him and he'd be ok.  wtf.  fortunately there were no tragedies.  fortunately i found out about his alzheimers in time to move across the country and deal with him, because my mother plainly couldn't... at least, she couldn't prevent him from driving.* you have to talk to your step-dad about all of this, to make sure you're 100% on the same page.  one of the things is he **can't** leave his car keys where she will grab them.  as she deteriorates (if she deteriorates), she will lose impulse control... she will lose the logic to say ""i shouldn't drive"".* she might... ""self medicate"" with alcohol.  my father did.  i assume it was easier for him to drink than to face the fact that he was losing his cognitive abilities.  i don't judge him for it.  however, alcohol can accelerate dementia, i think.  and it can further lessen inhibitions.  she and your step-dad might have to give up alcohol completely, if they drink.* set up an appointment for your doctor, immediately, for yourself.  right now, call them up.  you are stressed (correctly).  you have a lot to deal with, and you rightly realize that you will have a lot to deal with.  **you can do this.**  but suicidal ideation is never helpful, and... you ain't got time or space or energy for that now.  see what your doctor says.  tell them everything.  i ended up taking a low dosage of something that helped me not think about things i couldn't afford to think about, if you get my drift.  for a couple years.  then i didn't need to, any more.  it didn't inhibit my ability to deal with stuff, it just made it so i didn't fantasize about removing myself from the picture.* trying to put a positive spin on a bitch of a situation... it sounds like this is still kind of early.  you knew what to look for because your family had dealt with this before.  you have you and your step-dad to deal with this.  this is an opportunity for you to give back to your mother for what she did raising you.  none of this is ""fair"", by any means... but it is what it is.you can do this.  freaking out at first realization is entirely understandable.  but now, you can do this.  really.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ekjbqq/i_need_help/,I need help

"my father has been experiencing visual hallucinations for roughly 2-3 years now but nothing we considered distressing as he is roughly 80% blind. last winter he had his first episode of rem sleep disorder and ran out the house without me knowing, prompting me to put alarms on the door. the neurologist provided a 12.5mg dosage of seroquel at night for his episodes and refused to give a diagnosis. around the spring to summer my father began to have severe memory issues, more consistent rem sleep disorder episodes, more visual hallucinations, and general confusion. in the fall my father kept constantly begging to be ""taken back home"" when he was already home, i found these moments to be the most challenging as he felt nothing but fear and anger that i wouldn't let him run out the door. we finally decided to get a second opinion and looked to another neurologist. these past three days i was consistently gridlocked with my father on attempting to convince him that he was home, when that didn't work i attempted distraction but he just became agitated that he wasn't being ""taken home"" still. after a while he wanted to call the cops because he thought he was being held hostage by someone impersonating his son so i had to hide his phone. yesterday morning after a night of absolutely zero sleep attempting to keep my father stable and calm (he has many days of insomnia before), we had our neurology appoitment pushed to that day. after talking to the doctor, we finally got a diagnosis for lewy body dementia and an increase in his antipsychotics. i was given permission to increase his dosage with the pills we had till our new prescription was delivered and i did so as soon as we arrived home.holy. freaking. cow. the difference it made was absolutely insane. he took a 5 hour nap. woke up and knew he was home. cleaned himself up. put the television on on his own. didn't ask who i was or where he was. laughed and joked at the tv. enjoyed his meal. it was incredible, it was like having my father again completely. he went to his bed without fussing that it wasn't his and he's been consistently asleep for what's been 4 hours now and still counting.i know there'll be a harder road ahead now as things progress, but this little reprieve is more than i could ever ask for. what felt like an endless torrent of mind games, confusion, and an inescapable anxiety over whether this would be the rest of my life has all been calmed. please look for help. don't ignore the signs because they won't get easier. trust your instincts and do as much research as you can. above all else, antipsychotics are awesome."," parkinsons and lewy body dementia are closely related.both are due to misfolded protein alpha-synuclein. hence medications that work well for use are not used for alzheimer's (misfolded protein tau) but often some drugs are used to treat both in a class of  cholinesterase inhibitors.[lbda.org](   is a wonderful resource. if he is ever admitted make sure they follow parkinson's protocol (no dopamine blockers, never administer haldol)[",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ei16n0/a_little_relief/,A Little Relief

"so just throwing this out there as i'm at a loss. my father and my grandmother before him were diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (pick's disease). the illness took effect when my dad was in his early 50s, though in hindsight probably a lot sooner in life thinking a out some of his traits and behaviours. as i understand it there is a 50% chance that i will also have the condition which could take effect as early as 30, which i have surpassed. genetic testing can confirm whether i have a higher probability of having the disease and i honestly can't decide whether knowing is worse than never knowing. i'm at a time in my life where i consider family planning. eliminating the condition would reassure me that i would not pass on the condition to my children. however, confirming the high probability of having the disease would be devastating and i don't know what i would do with that information. i get forgetful sometimes, but this is probably normal and i have a heightened awareness of my memory.so what i'm asking here is whether there is anyone else in the same position who has made a decision either way about genetic testing and how to cope with knowing or not knowing. i feel alone with this and don't feel i can talk to anyone about this. talking about the disease scares my family and i worry it would damage my relationship if i talk about this with my partner.", same boat here. my mom is the fourth generation to get dementia. i've decided i don't want to know and neither does my sister. we're just making plans ahead of time... something mom refused to do. so now we have to guess at what she would want or refuse. one suggestion i'd have if you don't want to get tested and have the diagnosis hanging over you... look into long term health care insurance. it'll make it easier to get a place you'll be happier in rather than taking whatever you can afford at the time with medicaid assistance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ehsv40/genetic_testing/,Genetic Testing
"welp, i am at wit’s end, people. my dad always had a stubborn—and sometimes angry—streak, but his dementia has brought this trait to the fore. he now has almost no capacity for empathy. even though my mom’s doctors have all stressed the importance of her living in a smoke-free environment, dad only occasionally agrees to smoke outside on the covered porch. mom has to nag him about it—and sometimes physically push his wheelchair onto the porch when he rolls up to the threshold and lights up indoors. in response, he sulks, yells, generally makes her life miserable, and still won’t reliably smoke outside. the obvious answer would be “stop buying his cigarettes.” after all, my dad can’t drive, and it’s my mom who has to buy the cigarettes and bring them into the house. but if she refuses to buy them, he goes into withdrawal and gets angrier than usual. he refuses to use the nicotine patches my mom buys him or take the smoking-cessation medications that his doctor has offered to prescribe him. i know he’s sick. i know i wouldn’t get mad at a diabetic because his pancreas didn’t work optimally. but i’ve grown resentful of the position he is putting my mom in. maybe that’s wrong of me, but ... well, here we are. i’d tell her to leave him until he agrees to stop smoking indoors, but he’s not well enough to live independently for any length of time. yet he’s *too* well to qualify for nursing home care. aaaargh!i’m exasperated and don’t know what—if anything—i should do to advise or help my mom."," chewing tobacco, or taking his hand for a walk every time he lights.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ehe8n1/my_dad_57_has_dementia_and_wont_stop_smoking/,My dad (57) has dementia and won’t stop smoking indoors even though my mom (55) has asthma.
"hello.my husband is relatively young (62), but has been showing signs of either dementia or early-onset alzheimer's and i'd appreciate any feedback you'd care to offer.this is not simple forgetfulness, although that is definitely a thing. his behavior is becoming more and more bizarre. when we first met (13 years ago), he was very jovial, outgoing, engaged and humorous. in recent years, he's gone quite dark. always disconnected from life, obsessing over youtube vids and ignoring his online business. he goes into fits of minor rage if he drinks. he is dismissive of me and our relationship. he is - quite literally - eating himself to death, having gained a good 80 pounds in recent years. he is forgetful, yes. but, he is constantly confused, drives erratically, loses things constantly, and is losing basic communication skills at an alarming rate. if i say, ""wow, it got cold this morning."", he won't acknowledge the statement but will reply with, ""wow. it got cold this morning.""there were friends here the other night and they were talking about a mutual acquaintance. my husband went into long, elaborate stories (all false) about the person they were talking about. i was gobsmacked. nothing he was saying was anywhere close to reality. i have no idea where any of that came from.i have to repeat things three to four times for him to understand. he has forgone cleanliness entirely. he is losing language skills rapidly. we live in central america and he knew spanish when we came here 6 years ago. now, he can't speak a word of it. he is disinterested that it seems as though he just can't keep up. and, our life is pretty mellow.i know he's unhappy and i don't get that. we are in the best place of our lives. he is completely disconnected from it all. but, is this a senility thing or a depression thing? there is no way on earth he would ever submit to cognitive testing, so i need to understand what i can do to help him - or talk him into seeing a qualified professional. i think the latter is very unlikely.i'm worried that the next time he takes the car into town will be the last time. i love this man, but he has turned into someone i simply don't recognize. i don't want sympathy. i just want to help him, if i can.what can you recommend i do?"," yes, definitely take you husband to a doctor.  you will have to tell the doctor how your husband has been acting.  they look at him, then prescribe for a ct scan, which pretty quick and a memory test, which will might take a few hours. they will send the results to the doctor. the doctors will give you the diagnosis of either dementia, alzheimer's, lewy body dementia, or possibly something else. if its any of those.  the doctor will medications to help slow the disease & regress it a little, a long with what other meds he might need.  you gotta prepare to get a power of attorney (cheaper), or legal guardianship (expensive) to handle his legal and financial affairs, if you have adult children, they could get one too, it will help ease the load if some family members can help in areas which they have strengths.  because when you have to handle his affairs, and you say that you are speaking on his behalf due to his illness, they need a legal document saying you are in charge.  as disease progresses, you might need a home aide to help with feeding, bathing, and toilet issues.  especially be prepared for the disappearing act, when they get up and go during the night or when you go out and you lose sight of them.  this is going to be very draining. mentality, emotionally, physically, spiritually and financially because the person you know is going to transform into someone you don't know. its definitely going to take toll on the family, it will either pull you together or tear you apart. unfortunately i'm going through this with a parent and i have aunts and uncles who are victims of this disease.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ehcmcr/looking_for_advice_husband_may_be_suffering/,Looking for advice.

"i'm in dire need of assistance with a situation i'm caught in. i am living with my boyfriend and his father, and the two of us are helping to aid him because not only is he disabled (mostly blind), but he has also been showing rather extreme signs of dementia. the biggest issue right now, aside from him believing that his dreams are real, is a particular delusion he has often where he believes that he isn't home. he often thinks he's been to ten or twelve different homes that look exactly like his, that there are two of me walking around, two of my boyfriend, two of his dog.when he's in these states where he doesnt believe he is in his own home, it is extremely hard to convince him otherwise. my boyfriend talked to him about it for three hours today trying to convince him not to talk walk out of the house. if we try to talk to him about it, show him around the house, show him his things, make humor about it, remind him that his dog is here and wouldn't be anywhere else, he still doesn't believe it. not even a little bit. he'll often argue about it, telling us that we ""must be crazy because this isn't his house."" i have no idea how to go about these episodes. do we play along?? i see a lot of websites and advice forums talking about how you should play along, but that seems like it would only make the situation worse. i mean, if i played along, wouldn't he be more inclined to walk out of the house?i'm just so confused. i have no idea what to say to him or how to bring him down from the situation because it always ends the same way. he's always in distress because this ""isn't his home"" and no amount of proof will convince him otherwise. and it seems like it never stops?? almost like this is the most consistent delusion of them all. please, if anyone has any advice or pointers or anything at all to help, it would be greatly appreciated. i also greatly appreciate having a space to be able to talk about this, so thank you to anyone and everyone who reads this.", if you can’t convince him that he is home just say “we are staying here for now” and pretend that it isn’t his home. like just go along with it and be like “i know but we need to stay here now we can go home later”,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eh56j5/senior_refuses_to_believe_hes_home_when_he_is/,Senior refuses to believe he's home when he is
"i’m at my last chance asking reddit. i don’t know what to do anymore. i’m 25f and my father has been sick my whole life. my father is a 74 year old south asian male, 5’4 at his tallest, 92 kilos and has been sick for 25 years. he had a stroke the year i was born and a heart attack when i entered grade 1. he’s been known to be inactive and overeat (categorizing as obese in weight). 12 years ago he was diagnosed with parkinson’s and earlier this year - early onset of dementia and hypothyroidism, enlarged prostate and he has glaucoma. he’s been somewhat independent - using the bathroom on his own even though he wore briefs and eating by himself but other than that we’ve helped him in and out of bed.his current medications are: celexa, perindopril, raberprezole, stalevo, neupro patch, rivastigmine-5 patch. eye drops for glaucoma, synthroid, lipotor, dutasteride, senokot. the first week of december my dad who was able to use a walker with slow gait, started complaining of intense pain, had really low bp and we called an ambulance. he was diagnosed with a severe uti, bladder and kidney infection. the following days he became completely bed ridden and was unable to even move out of bed. a week after that he was discharged with claims the uti had cleared. once he got home he didn’t get any better so my mother called our family doctor. turns out, he was never well enough to be home and should be sent to rehab or complex care (health rehab). we live in canada fyi. he was admitted last week to rehab and has doctors who regularly see him. it’s essentially been a nursing home but with exercise. he’s sat up in his chair a few days but the exercise is exhausting him even more. he’s eating but has to be fed by my mom. the doctor’s haven’t changed his meds but won’t give us a prognosis. my mom is burning out and i’m staying with her during this time. we’re at a loss at what to do further. i want the hard truth - does this look like the end? is hospice in our future? what else can be done? what outcomes have you seen with patients?"," uti was the issue. blood infection impacts the brain, antibiotics clear this up.in a nursing home they are not good about our parkinson's manta ""medication on time, every time, wake me"".   we have a very specific regiment for medication. often the staff just doesn't have the time so gives medications at breakfast, noon, dinner, bedtime but we may need our medication every three hours.   50% of those with parkinson's are much worse after a hospital stay!in the usa we have ""aware in care kits"" to help those with parkinson's. we don't have resources to ship to canada (damn it!) please look over the kit and print out the pdfs.[kit contents (links on this page)[i've seen people recover from uti & hospitalization. it takes time, the first step is getting his medication back on schedule. for it is critical to get up and keep walking (longer we sit, the more our muscles atrophy, so it becomes a downward spiral. /r/parkinsons for those with and family and friends. /r/parkinsonscaregivers  for support of those.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eh0l06/is_this_end_of_life/,Is this end of life?
"so around two weeks ago my grandfather experienced heavy sundowning and in his anger and paranoia accused my mother of stealing from him and threw her out.i was pretty stressed out about the situation as it was never this hard with him before and normally he is a pretty happy and friendly person. i was worried it would get worse from now on and that christmas would be even more difficult.the next day he was still very angry with us, being suspicious and staying away in the bedroom not talking to us. we started giving him more of the antipsychotics and after another day he was completely back to normal. he was super tired and always asked what happened, if he did something wrong. we didn’t tell him what had happened, just told him that he was a bit more riled up than usually and had a hard time going to bed. the antipsychotics are working pretty good at the moment. but i also gifted him a picture book with old pictures of the city he grew up in, and since then he is even more calm and happy as he loves looking at these pictures and thinking back, telling stories. i realized that this is a pretty good way of engaging him in some kind of activity that isn’t tv or taking a walk (as it’s pretty cold at the moment and there is so much to do with my bedridden grandma, that it’s not possible to take him on a walk every day). we also noticed that he lost his wallet, maybe outside but also maybe inside the house. this is maybe what made him so angry and suspicious that night.just wanted to say thank you to this community as i appreciated all the kind words and messages from you. i was really breaking down that day and reading your comments made me realize that i am not alone in this.", i started watching 40 year old basketball games with my father that he remembered seeing when they were first played. it was the first real breakthrough he had.  i'm glad you've found your way in with your grandfather.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/egyj2l/update_grandfather_with_dementia_is_very_angry/,Update: Grandfather with dementia is very angry and refuses care - Thankful for this community

"i bought a book that my grandma could gift my mom for christmas. my grandma's journey down the dementia lane has been very slow, thankfully, but she's now at the point where she sometimes doesn't recognize her own home (she still know us - mom, dad, me, other relatives - though). i wanted her to leave my mom with something on paper this year, as i don't know how coherent she will be next christmas, or if she'll be with us at all.  she has trouble writing and organize her thoughts, so when i suggested her to make an inscription in the book, she was very hesitant and kept on making excuses (which she didn't realize where excuses, i think: she kept saying her eyes were watering, or that her hands were unstable, and so on). in the end, though, i managed to calm her down and she told me the main points she wanted to include in her message, so i just guided her to organize them in a sentence. the words and concepts were all hers, and pretty sweet (she's not a super sweet person, although very loving). she even wrote the message herself! a little wobbly, with a couple of easily fixable mistakes, et voilà! she was happy of the results and i am, too! the whole process took about an hour, and even though we were tired and she was all sweaty from the effort, i enjoyed it and i think she did, too. we took our time and built something together for my mom that will last."," that's very nice and sweet. my grandmother always says she's too shakey to write. i barely got her to sign her christmas cards this year. i had already addressed them and even wrote the love, part. she just needed to sign her name.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ef0j70/i_helped_my_grandma_write_an_inscription_to_my_mom/,I helped my grandma write an inscription to my mom

"approximately 2 years ago my mother was diagnosed with dementia by her geriatrition. of course the signs were there long before this, the repetition of stories, forgetting of names and tasks. initially these mental blanks were easily dismissed as ""chemo brain"" as mum had battled and beaten breast cancer, but deep down we all knew. mum had witnessed it first hand with her grandmother then with her mother, her father and in more recent years all her 3 siblings (but its not hereditary or genetic).prior to mums diagnosis there was the obligatory mild cognitive disorder (mcd) label, which like bad body odour causes people to steer clear. many of mums so called ""friends"" became more absent on those celebratory occassions to which they were invited and more forgetful in terms of inviting my mother to gatherings to which they were hosting. at first i was angry at them for excluding my mother, fortunately mum wasn't angry, mum wasn't aware. i set aside my anger at these fairweather friends, when our paths crossed  i looked into their eyes and saw fear and envy, fear of themselves falling into the clutches of dementia and the envy of wondering if their children would be there to support them through this journey. over time most of mum's acquaintances no longer maintained eye contact when we crossed paths, they quickly look away, anywhere else but to their destiny as if mum was their mirrored reflection. my father was supportive until he was hospitalized due to an unrelated condition and developed the uti dementia or delerium. over time dad recovered and returned home and the delirium subsided although he would be diagnosed firstly mcd then six months later dementia.when my mother received her dementia diagnosis we held a family meeting where my brother and i promised we would keep mum at home as long as we could, provided she was safe, mum took some comfort in that committment and life continued. there were subtle changes like accompanied visits to medical appointments, shopping in pairs instead of alone and assistance with stairs and uneven ground. we began to notice my mother withdraw from conversations and struggle with fine motor skills tasks. her frustrations grew as her hands and body wouldnt do what her brain wanted.my father struggled with the evolving nature of their 50+ year relationship, moving from husband to carer and the ultimately to the target of her frustrations and anger. my mother struggled with intimacy after revealing a childhood assault she had kept to herself over the years. my father also struggled knowing that his fate would be not to dissimilar from that of my mother. the fact he held a front row ticket seat simply amplified the cruelty.six months ago mum was assessed level 4 requiring a secure position in a residential dementia program, we stepped up the supervision and mum literally did nothing alone. we began key locking the security doors when mum began waking early (2am) and dressing for shopping trips. the decision was made 4 weeks ago when dad inadvertently looked away and mum prepared and attempted to eat boiling noodles resulting in quite bad burns to her chest.it was now time and in the intervening time we have toured and researched several facilities involving mum and dad in the process. final acceptance for a position was received thursday for an admission this friday 27th december. after several years of holding christmases with my parents  due to the inevitable, the inevitable has arrived.all being ok with my parents physical health this wont be the last christmas we share, but given recent events in respect to memories i suspect they will never be the same as the christmases we have shared.i take some comfort in the fact that my mother is becoming more oblivious to some of  the changes in her life, but i worry for my father whom we expect to struggle much more than my mother with his dementia, although dads most recent geriatrition appointment ended with dad proclaiming he was cured of dementia as the dr had proclaimed ""there was nothing else he could do for my father. ""as we enter this christmas my immediate family is struggling to come to terms with events, i have attempted to always be honest and upfront with my teenage children about the nature and progression of this disease. i remind them that the behaviours of my parents are symptomatic of the disease not the person. an acquaintance advised me of the perils of this particular journey to which i was initially indifferent. this disease has tested my resolve and the strength of the relationship with my loved ones, a test i believe i have passed and with my brother have honoured our committment to our mother. i will sleep better knowing she is safe and her needs are being met, but i know that in a short time she will lose her memory of herself and those she loves and that will be shattering for my father and my siblings.as i look back over the last 2 and half years and the effort involved i take a deep breath as i realise that its now going to be dad's turn and i suspect this ride is going to be a lot rougher..", this will be my family’s first christmas without my grandma with us. she’s in a home just up the road from us but we fear that she’ll struggle to cope with coming to ours on christmas day due to her difficulty moving and incontinence as well as her memory. shes quite settled in the home now and i worry bringing her to ours where all of her children and grandchildren will be will be too much for her because she’s struggle to remember much these days. i feel a lot of guilt about it but i take comfort in the fact that she’s well cared for and has a much richer social life now than she did when she lived with us. i just hope she doesn’t think we’ve abandoned her there because we’ve always spent christmas together.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eedfe6/admitting_parent_to_secure_dementia_facility_this/,Admitting parent to secure dementia facility this Xmas
"hey, new here, so hi everyone!really just wondering if anyone has experience supporting a blind family member with dementia, and looking for ideas to help them settle.my grandma's 92 years old, had dementia creeping in for a few years but had a real down turn in the last few months. my grandps had a fall and ended up in hospital for a few weeks, so grandma was alone in supported housing, but they've now both moved into a residential nursing home with full time care.since moving to the new home, she's become a lot more confused, distressed and started being violent.a lot of the advice i've found is around making things clear and easy to find, and having regular routines.. but i think the move's really thrown her as she's blind so has no idea where she is, what's around her, who's with here, etc.. really the worst confusion you could cause to someone with dementia!so, considering her blindness, any suggestions on how we could help her adjust to her new home? both getting used to it and the people there, and keeping her calmer and more settled.thank you for any help!"," i can understand how she feels. witrh everything in life shes now lst in whats her new home. i can think of a couple things. daily, someone patiently walk the room and bathroom with her and have her feel her way and count the steps so she can get an idea of the roo and how to get around. she may not remember so should be a daily routine. you can also if she doesnt , teach her braille...or at least enough that she can understand wall signs. have someone make her a model of her room. have braille signing on it so she can tell where things are. maybe a post for where she is so she can orient. get her a cd player and her favorite music. set it in a good location so if she gets turned around all she has to do is find the music. and dont let anyone move stuff around on her. we want her to be able to have a basic idea in her mind where she is and where things are. i dont know how big her room is or how much she has but if need be put guides on the wall she can touch and follow. you may just have to reassure her every day. if she is forgetting where shge is and why then she is extremely disoriented and wondering why she isnt home. she may fear that someone is doing something to her instead of her being taken care of out of need. best of luck and give her a hug for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eebzxm/comforting_a_blind_92_year_old_woman/,Comforting a blind 92 year old woman

"my 58 year old spouse was diagnosed with lewy body in late september. met with neurologist 9/30. was sent for testing about a week later. after two days of testing the therapist called neurologist. we were called back in and hubby was told he could no longer work. after 42 years in his career, it was taken in a blink of an eye. he was also told he could no longer use power tools. bless his heart. so now he spends all his time correcting me. lol if i say something is black, he tells me it is white.  if i fold a shirt one way, he will refold the shirt.  he is also in the bad habit of wanting to do nothing but watch tv. seriously, from the time he gets up till the time he goes to bed. is this normal behavior?", he loves to get into the conservation as long as it is about what he wants to talk about and he must be heard. lol,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ec7igj/most_all_conversations_end_with_him_correcting_me/,"Most all conversations end with him correcting me, ugh."
i should make a throwaway for this but i’m going to be trusting here. my husband has fahrs disease among other complications and i care for him full time. we’ve had a long grace period but december is typically rough. today and yesterday he was in what i call assholeland. he will say things very unkind but doesn’t realize they are unkind. most days he would not do this and in the past he never would have said things like this. okay... this is hard. my daughter #2 just had her second kid four months ago and put on some weight which so did i with the second child. they sent a christmas card family photo and it’s beautiful. but my husband floored me when he said: “i am not sending that to my mom or she will comment on c’s weight.” i got so pissed and hurt. it led to a fight and i told him how mean could his mom possibly be. i mean he’s right my mil who has alzheimer’s would probably say something. as if it’s any of her business. she comments on everybody’s weight all the time.   after i calmed down he then said he understood that having a baby can be rough on a woman’s weight but the dress she wore in the picture didn’t help matters. ugh!! i got mad again and left the house for awhile. my heart is broken because the old “j” is gone. his brain is mush and all i have of memories of him will be crap like this. he will not admit now that he even said any of this. he just acted like nothing happened but he knows. i don’t think he knows how to handle it when he “comes to” and realizes what he says sometimes.  he will be normal for weeks and then i get complacent before the next episode. i know if i confront him then he becomes the victim. i hate dementia i hate it. i try and try to live normally as i can then he throws me this curve ball. it makes my heart hurt. he could use another antidepressant but he takes so many meds as it is. sorry thank you for letting me vent.," my dad is like this with my mom now.  it’s like living with a time bomb, and you cannot see the countdown.   it’s very difficult to switch modes from acting “ normal” to dealing with an episode.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ec7dc1/horrible_day/,Horrible day
"my mil's deterioration coincided with the birth of my child. there were many stressors that occurred (death of her mom, sickness of her husband, flood that destroyed our community, etc). her husband died recently and either she has gone downhill fast or she was worse than we thought. my husband wants us to move in with her. she is willing to give us the master bedroom because she doesn't want to be in it anymore and it is fairly large with its own bathroom and a large closet we could turn into a kids room. the problem is i have a lot of mental issues surrounding her. i want to get over them because  i know how important she is to my husband and i do want to make sure she is okay and has the most comfortable end of life possible. the problem is i can't help how i -feel- and i have almost 3 years of built up animosity towards her and i fear moving in with her would be horrible for my own mental health. i had a very rough newborn stage. my baby cried nonstop, couldn't sleep on his back, had to be held all the time. i was lucky if i got to sleep 2 consecutive hours in the first year. i developed ppd and ocd like tendencies (imagining my baby dying in very vivid ways, having to make sure he was breathing every 5 minutes, etc) when i went to my husband for help he told me how great his mom was in caring for his disabled brother and i just needed to suck it up. when i went to her for help she told me she didn't know what i was talking about and her babies never did that and it was an awesome time. etc etc. i was completely ignored. no one helped me with anything and any requests i made (call before coming over) were completely ignored. i was really totally completely insane and no one seemed to even care or acknowledge it even though i was basically screaming it in their faces.  she revolves around my son when he is around and nonstop does things i don't want her to do (give him caffeine, feed him a ton of junk, is heavy handed on religion etc) probably is she doesn't remember what she has given him or that i don't want her to give him those things. if you press her on it she becomes dismissive or hostile etc so we've concluded there is no point because it just gives her bad vibes about us. she also sometimes forgets to close her front door and he has escaped out it without anyone knowing for a few minutes. i don't know what to do. i feel bad because i honestly don't know if i can take it. i don't have a family (not close to my mom or dad) or ever had anything. the only thing i've ever had is my baby and i feel like she tries to take him away, sometimes she even calls him by my husband's name, and i can't do anything about it because she is sick. this will be my only child and the only time i am able to experience being a mother and i don't want to feel like i am living in the shadow the entire time, but unfortunately i don't feel like i have a choice.  i finally feel like i am at a place where my mental health has been getting better but that this could send me to a precarious place. it isn't fair to my husband though as he is having a really hard time with the death of his dad and his mom's health. i have requested that he go live with her alone but he acts offended at that request."," hope you didn’t take her on. i had rough ppd too. and i’m no contact with my mil because of a terrible betrayal. it’s a terrible disease, and i’m helping for my grandfather because he’s always been a wonderful loving figure. someday my mil will need care. she has pitiful health. she won’t get it from me. having a terrible disease doesn’t all the sudden make you worthy of forgiveness. protect yourself. and demand more respect from your husband as well. you’re strong and have already been through a lot. you deserve it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ebxy48/getting_over_animosity_to_care_for_someone/,[deleted by user]
"so i am super stressed out about this situation, as it is christmas in a week and i am really struggling handling this. my mother cares for my elderly grandparents, my grandfather is 92 and has vascular dementia. my grandmother is 88, senile and at the moment mostly bedridden due to a fall. me and my mother are handling everything since summer last year - we do their finances, go grocery shopping, cook, clean and help them with their daily hygiene and everything they need.they still live alone in their apartment, my mother lives approximately 10 min away, so she does everything at weekdays. i come in at weekends as i live about an hour away and don’t have a car.so my grandfather experiences pretty heavy sundowning these days, and is now refusing my mothers care. he accuses her of stealing money from him, because he somehow checked his account balances and saw that someone withdraws money (for groceries etc). he threw her out and doesn’t want to have anything to do with her anymore.i don’t know how to handle this as i know it’s impossible to explain it to him. my mother won’t budge and does not leave them on their own as my grandmother needs help. she goes in there in the morning to wash her and brings them food at noon, but she does not stay for longer and leaves immediately after she is done.should we just leave him alone and ignore his anger and hope this will settle someday? or is there something we should try to calm him? i would love to have a nice christmas with them."," one of dementia's symptoms is anger and confusion and depression.  the anger can be dealt with a little -- there are drugs your doctor could prescribe, but frankly we're having excellent results with medical cannabis.  can you acquire an edible, and see how he does on 1/4 of a normal dose (1.25mg)?  that's usually a good dose to start them on.  please note that there's one dementia med that interacts horribly with cannabis, check with your doc first.  but if you're clear there, and he does well on that 1/4 of a gummy (or doesn't seem to do much on it) then you can keep the dose the same or increase it in a day or two.  frequently new cannabis patients have really big, remarkable reactions to the drug, and then the reactions settle down after they've used it for a while.  kind of like caffeine -- the first few mugs of it give you jitters, tingles, bigtime energy... then it's just a fine way to wake up.  so start small, only a quarter of a dose.  if you can't use cannabis or do use it and it's awful, then it may be time to see the dr and ask for the hard stuff.  show a video of the sundowning, get him evaluated, and talk to the hospitals patient advocate/elder care specialist/whatever they call it where you are.  you're about to need more help soon, it's great you're looking ahead so you can be prepared for when that day comes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ebxrgi/grandfather_with_dementia_is_very_angry_and/,Grandfather with Dementia is very angry and refuses care

"hi everyone, i’ll try to keep this short but i’m desperate for some advice.my grandmother is 84, and she has dementia. i phone her weekly as i live in wales with my mother and brother while my gran is scottish and lives in scotland. i am very close to my grandmother and have since i was a little girl. today we just got a phone call saying my grans partner/carer has bowel cancer and has been taken away. so my gran has been left on her own. my gran needs a 24/7 carer, so my mother has booked me on the first flight back to scotland for me to move in with my gran and care for her for the foreseeable future.. and i’m absolutely terrified. my gran needs her medication, she needs dressed, washed, fed and taken to her appointments. apparently she has been getting up in the middle of the night too and she can barely walk so there’s a fear of her falling in the middle of the night. i haven’t seen my gran in 4 years and now i’m going to be caring for her starting tomorrow and i don’t know what to expect with her. i’m only 23. does anyone have any advice for a new young carer or any advice on how to cope with someone with dementia?thank you in advance."," if she's not very mobile i would recommend getting a wheelchair that you can take her out for walks on good days. when she wakes up in the middle of the night she may not remember who you are, she might call you by a name of a dead family member. for showering i would recommend a stool for her to sit on and a washcloth or loofah.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ebijap/young_carer_for_my_grandmother_with_dementia_and/,Young carer for my grandmother with dementia and I’m really scared.
"i have had early onset (56) ftd for three years. i told the dr's i did not want antidepressants bc if i am crazy or losing my mind i wanted to know it. i made a minor mistake with my hbp and afib (the dr had made changes trying to get them under control). now my wife gives them to me. last night she had a gall bladder stone and had to leave immediately. i found out this cough i've had for 2 weeks was pneumonia so i can't stay up there. i got my medicine bag and she had to tell me what i needed to set out from the pill bag. in the bag was an antidepressant but she told me i was not on that any more. i know suspicion is a tell tell sign of dementia but like i said, i don't want to mask it. i guess i am on a rant from the puffer they have me on. all this to say, patients and care givers, what is your feelings on antidepressants? sorry for the long post. thanks"," antidepressants don’t make you crazy, nor they stop you from being crazy. they just make you feel less sad.basically, there’s a chemical imbalance in your brain that’s not supposed do to be there, and that causes depression. antidepressants try to bring balance again, a balance that was yours to begin with before getting sick.not everyone can take antidepressants, they don’t work for some and have negative effects in others, but the majority are fine with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eb85o2/antidepressants/,Antidepressants?

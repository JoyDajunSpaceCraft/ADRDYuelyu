[removed]," sorry to hear about your mother’s diagnosis. the first few weeks to months after a diagnosis will be overwhelming as you’re both adjusting to this new reality. i found that resources were definitely scattered and would find myself on google for hours on end. the action plan by helpmate ** really helped me - they provide you with a free personalised guide with all the steps you and your mum need to take as after diagnosis, from getting a power of attorney to setting up the home correctly. some content is specific to australia but a lot of the content is applicable internationally. good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s00mx8/new_caregiver_looking_for_resources_for/,New caregiver looking for resources for early-stage dementia
"i am not seeking medical advice, just some thoughts about quitting my father's medicationhe is 65 only but for the past 4 years his decline is steady downhill. he cant drive, he needs help to feed, dress...my mother is his main caregiver but me and my brother are here to help (i dont live with them but i spent some time here). right now he is still able to walk and wander around the house and keep asking nonsense questions and totally confused about who we are and where he is. and its quite sad and frustrating listen to him and answer the same things over and over everyday. he doesnt have any other health issue besides dementia.the problem is, not sure if medication is actually helping him. he is not stable, day by day he gets worse and he is sensitive to medication. maybe we should let nature follows its course?he takes both antidepressant and a anti anxiolytici will be honest and damn me for thinking cold like that: but i am afraid the final stages takes too long and my mother (60)  will be older as me and my brother (28/26) will need to take care of our lives, marriage, maybe children...it would be too difficult to deal with this in a few years. its better to end it before things get out of controlwe are afraid of how bad he will get if quit the meds. but if they are doing anything its just pushing the inevitable...i am writing all this considering the medication increases life expectancy, which i am not sure if it does..."," does he consume lots of healthy foods and drinks?if not, and that's been going on for years, what you're seeing now just may be the consequence of poor nutrition imo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rzy88t/thoughts_on_stopping_medication/,Thoughts on stopping medication?

"my father, 71, has vascular dementia as well as mini strokes. this is in addition to ckd stage 4, end stage renal, hypertension, type 1. just to name a few of the issues. normally he’s good w feeding himself, but he’s not allowed to use the stove or oven as he once almost burnt the house down by leaving a grilled cheese on the stove for an hour… which cost us over $3500 to repair, clothing himself (although he hides dirty underwear which i don’t understand) and taking his meds as given to him. we used to leave them out in the little pill slots but he started taking them wrong and hiding them around the house so we have to physically watch him take them. my wife and i (only child) were allowing him to still have his financial independence because it wasn’t proving to be much of an issue. that was until last month where he cancelled all his credit cards (because someone stole them to pay for his meds, spoiler, they weren’t stolen and he made the payment from his phone) and he went almost $800 in the hole in his checking acct. leaving him w no money for almost 3 weeks. he then wrote bad checks to make payments which all bounced. including the check he gave his grandson (my son) which bounced and fucked us over w our bank. this previous monday, we were at his pcp office and i spoke privately w the doctor about what’s been happening and he advised me it was time to exercise my poa and take over. oddly enough, later that evening he was admitted to the er for pneumonia. so we took the time having him out of the house to remove everything. cards, check books, everything. (he lives w my wife, our 1 yo son and myself.) so of course he came home last night and was upset. saying that we’re his jailers and we’re working w his doctors to hold him hostage and not let him have a life. now of course, w dementia, that’s not true at all. we sacrifice a lot for him, including me going from the breadwinner to being a sahd so i can care for him full time. he says he pays his bills on time, but he doesn’t. we have this from his accounts and credit reports. so we took the necessary steps to exercise our poa and a letter of mental incapacity  provided by his pcp to take over all the accounts. tonight, he was blowing up phones of my aunts (his sisters) continuously for hours to get them to tell me he doesn’t have dementia. spoiler alert, they all know he does and are on our side. then he called 911 and said we were holding him hostage. thankfully i know many of the officers in my small rural town and they know the situation as he has wondered off before when i’ve been showering or ran to the store on a small trip (30-60 mins). they did come but told him there was nothing they could do unless he wanted to go back to the hospital. of course he declined. so the next best thing we could do was turn off his phone through the provider and change the wi-fi passwords. otherwise he will just keep calling my aunts all night and 911. am i the asshole here? cause i feel like i am. my wife reassures me i’m not as she has dealt w this before with her late grandmother. but i still feel guilty. i’m just trying to protect him from himself. he tells people i want to steal his money but he has none. he couldn’t even afford to buy himself a new bed so we paid for it for him. he has no savings. no 401k. other than his pension and ss which are roughly 4k a month and cover his healthcare expenses, he has jack shit. i just, feel like a pos. and she tells me all the time my dad is verbally and mentally abusing me yet i’m still here. i still want to care for him because no one else will.  and i don’t want to see him go into a home. i’m just so fucking lost. i hate this shit."," no mate you are another unsung everyday hero coping with things most would have given up long ago.. stay strong... try to for your child and wife, they are also so very affected and real heros too..as for your father, it's not him, it's dementia, but still, it's hard man... you, me , noone's alone, try to keep strong man and best wishes for you all..",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rzke96/am_i_the_bad_guy/,Am I the bad guy?

"my grandma used to be an amazing cook and baker.  she suffers from dementia and isn’t able to cook, or even make her own coffee anymore.  despite her condition, every time she sees me she asks what can she cook for me. when i tell her that i’m fine, she insists. comically enough, when i sometimes accept her offer (just for laughs) she would say something along the lines of “just let me know how to make it, and i’ll do it for you!”.   before every birthday she would ask me which cake i would like, in addition to her usual gift.   she always told me that i shared her sweet-tooth, and would in fact bake two cakes. one for the birthday party itself to be shared with all of the guests, and one just for me- so i could continue enjoying it for days.   my favorite cake by far was her amazing banana cake. no one in the family is able to recreate her recipe, despite our best efforts.   iphones have this feature that every so often it would make a small montage of a few random pictures of videos. today a six years old video popped up. the video showed my mom and grandma working in the kitchen, and when my grandma looked up at the camera she said “working on your birthday cakes!”.   i just can’t believe how far she has changed in such a short time. she is still loving and funny, but honestly, it’s not the same person.  this dieses is awful. i believe that we have the best of it because we were able to get her a full time caretaker, and have her live just next door. it’s still unbelievably difficult seeing her bewildered  and confused eyes every so often. i just miss my grandma."," she loves you, and her love language is cooking (as it was for my grandmother).  i might suggest that you just crave a peanut butter and jam sandwich  ((but before you suggest it, make sure those ingredients are out and available with appropriate knife for smoothing ingredients on the bread, or you might be surprised at what gets substituted !  ))",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ryww4l/my_favorite_cake/,My favorite cake

"dementia is such an odd, awful disease. i'm just struck today (not for the first time) by the spectrum of mental capability my dad exhibits day to day. there is nothing linear about the decline (well, maybe from a very high level). at a low level -- currently serving as his caregiver until we get a professional -- i'm just struck by how different he is day to day. one day he'll do nothing but sit and watch television and really just stare vacantly. another he'll be belligerent and angry about the situation (as he perceives it which can also vary from thinking he needs to move to his ""real"" home or thinking he's staying in a hotel). yesterday he was as close to being my dad as he has been in 6-9 months. if i wasn't looking closely, i could imagine that we'd be just discussing golf or the football game or whatever we did 2 years ago. took his pills by himself, prepared his own meals, did things he hasn't done in a year (worked out!) and got to bed at a reasonable time.today? my dad is gone. he called me ""the electrician"" because apparently he needs some electrical work done in his bedroom (likely a burned out bulb lol). and, he acts as though he's in a motel and i'm the manager. the electrical work is needed in ""men's room"" which, i guess, is the bathroom connected to his bedroom. just sad today. i got a taste of how easy and nice things used to be around here when he was still around. but, it also has served as a reminder and i'm more convinced than ever that my time as a caregiver needs to end. he's only going downhill from here and his needs will only increase. his physical health is quite good which means 3-5 more years (probably) of ... this. then you have to ask yourself not only if you want to do this for 3-5 more years but more and more and more as his condition declines. i think i have to do what i've been avoiding and make 2022 the year of the professional caregiver or even a facility. sad times. but, time to get my life back."," this is almost exactly like my father. but i havent seen a moment of him in two years. you are ""lucky"" to get a small moment of himi still remember. i was leaving with my mom and he would stay alone for a few hourshe said:""i am alright, dont worry! i will be ok""but in his normal voice...and thats it",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rv1x1t/a_different_person_every_day/,A different person every day

"my dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate alzheimer’s a month ago and my mum isn’t being patient. they’ve been married for 50 years. the diagnosis was not a shock, for the last 12 months we’ve noticed changes.she’s 5 years younger and is super sharp. she’s not cutting him any slack, telling him he’s wrong about stuff, telling him to hurry up. pointing out that his weird stories about the past aren’t true (he embellishes stories about his youth but i’d listen to them all day long if i could) but she can’t let it go. she’s constantly pointing out that he’s losing/hiding stuff or dressing odd (textbook, harmless stuff). she understands (or seems to) that he lives in a slightly different reality now (even tho he’s still very much himself, most of the time) but sometimes it’s like she behaves like she can nag him out of cognitive decline. like she can nag him out of the new, unusual habits he’s forming, like her snapping at him for not following complex plots on tv will suddenly make him understand when in reality it is just making him feel like shit. i can’t get through to her that she is making herself the enemy which she cannot be if wants to be his caregiver in the future (which she insists she does). his perception of her will be that she is lying when she’s telling him he’s wrong which will erode trust. she doesn’t seem willing to adjust her behaviour, learn about how the disease will change his behaviour, learn about coping mechanisms and tiny little adjustments that she can make (even just laying out his clothes for him, instead of letting him pick his clothes which she then complains about.. if she feels so strongly about which clothes he should wear, why would she expect him to chose exactly what she thinks he should wear when she knows that decision making is something he will be struggling with now).i cannot argue with her about it, i know she’s struggling to adjust but it’s almost like she’s increased the nagging since he got his diagnosis, speeding up the pace of her conversations (that she knows he will not be able to keep up with). she and i have had some great, in depth conversations about how we as a family can make life easier for him and us but she is not putting any of it into practice. it’s almost like she lets him make the mistakes so that she can nag him about it afterwards. why is she doing this?i can feel myself getting angry with her for being so stubborn and i am biting my lip for fear of arguing with her but i am also terrified that if she doesn’t adjust soon, my dad will associate her with negativity as his condition progresses. i am very very close to her but i don’t know how to get through to her that her being like this is destructive. has anyone else encountered this? i understand that she is in the early stages of losing the man she’s known since she was a teenager but what happens if she simply can’t adjust?"," i have watched the same dynamic with my parents and regardless of how many times any of us kids have asked my mom to be more patient, the conversation ends with her saying ""i know i need to be more patient, i wish i was, i am trying my best""  and then she goes back to being impatient.  when she steps back, she knows what she needs to do,  but in the moment she goes back to the same behavior, then feels bad about it&#x200b;it has gotten better over time, and she's never ever been like ""you're so stupid or dumb or whats your problem"" , i.e. she's not insulting or berating or mean,  just scared and frustrated that the person she's loved for 50 years is kind of a child in many ways now.&#x200b;i have been around them a lot and i can say that my only course of action has been to try and lead by example.  give my dad a lot of time to answer questions or make decisions,  repeat questions as many times as he needs without getting mad etc,  and i hope it has helped but i don't know if it has or not.&#x200b;if your mom can't adjust then just do your best to make sure that absolutely everyone else your dad deals with is acting the way you would want your mom to,  extra patient and supportive and kind, gently correct mistakes etc,  and hopefully she will start to exhibit the behavior too.  it's not a quick fix, but it might be what works",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rul79h/how_do_i_help_my_mum_adjust/,How do I help my mum adjust?

ok so my dad was recently diagnosed with dementia and parkinson’s. he has been under the care of a pain clinic. they’re still in the phase of trying different things to find out what works. the last thing they did was put him on methadone and it was a disaster. he had a reaction to it for lack of a better word. it threw him into worse dementia temporarily. ge just came home from a tcu. now monday is his first appointment since this all happened. i have all poa and he’s signed the privacy papers that the doctor can talk to me. dad is getting very agitated. he doesn’t want to go and wants me to just go and tell the doctor everything that happened. i have no problem doing that but does it make sense? i don’t want him to just drop off since he is in a treatment plan but he’s so agitated about it. what would you do?," you can't go to the appointment alone. if you show up alone without warning them in advance be prepared to pay a cancellation fee or pay for the entire visit out of your own pocket since they can't bill his insurance if he's not there. remember, you are dealing with a person with dementia.  he has impaired judgement. don't try to follow his nonsensical plans. if he refuses to go and it's non critical, then you cancel. if it's essential that he goes, then don't discuss the appointment ahead of time and get him in the car and drive him there. telehealth visits might be an option in the future if the doctor only needs to talk with you two.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rtu8vv/dad_refusing_to_go_to_pain_doctor/,Dad refusing to go to pain doctor
"hi,my grandmother passed away on friday after a period of illness. my grandfather is very progressed in his dementia and has regressed to childhood memories only and his native language. he understands to some extent that we are family and sometimes that he has a daughter (my mom).. he has glimpses where he is more lucid but for the past months of my grandmother's illness, he seems to have thought that she was his mom. when he was informed of her passing on friday he broke down, by the time they arrived t the hospital to see her body he had to be reminded about why he was there.he seems to have lost the ability to form any new memories.. how should we approach this? is it more merciful to not inform him as he gets so upset? or should we keep at it?", you already told him. once is enough. it's cruel to keep telling him over and over and letting him suffer at hearing the news again and again. it's fine to not discuss it further or to go along with him thinking she's still alive if he discusses her.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rtt3di/help_grandfather_through_grief/,Help grandfather through grief
"hello, i would like some advice on what to do because this is seriously affecting my mental health. my grandparents and my grandma from my mother’s side came to my house for new years. my grandma from my father’s side was perfectly fine (she has dementia), telling her mostly made up or twisted stories to my other grandma, but today she has lost all sense of location, if that makes any sense. my grandma from my mum’s side left because she lives in the same city, but my other grandma lives in another city and today my grandpa decided they’d stay here. honestly, that was the worst mistake he could do. after my other grandma left, my grandma from my dad’s side kept requesting to leave to her house. we kept trying to talk her out of it but she insisted. i think she somehow convinced herself she’s in her house and tries to leave my house, thinking that it will lead to her house or something (can’t really understand but that’s what i assume). we are losing our minds honestly. i suspect it’s because she can’t do her daily routine of constantly walking around the house and messing around with her stuff. we took her outside many times to convince her but as we all know, that’s a waste. my grandpa is my biggest worry because he is her caregiver and he doesn’t really understand how to proceed, nor do we. does anyone more experienced have an advice for me?"," when she starts asking to go home, start talking to her about what she likes the most about her home, etc. then slowly turn the discussion away to other topics. sometimes you'll have to do it several times, but it should help keep her calmer. it sounds like your grandpa needs a break.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rtr2cw/my_grandma_has_no_idea_where_she_is/,[deleted by user]
"as the title suggests, i am looking for suggestions to improve my mum's quality of life.i am a 60m living 280 miles away from my mum. my brother and his wife are 5 mins away from her and are doing a very good job of taking care of her immediate needs. however she is 95, only able to get about with a 3-wheel walker, and her main problem with her condition is boredom. she has her own flat in sheltered accommodation, with carers visiting several days a week. unfortunately the place has had to go into lockdown again, so she can't go and meet her friends in the restaurant for lunch any more, and she only started doing that again a few weeks ago.she hasn't got the energy or strength for her old hobbies, such as sewing and knitting. she does sit and watch the tv, but the lack of movement isn't doing her much good, nor is the lack of stimulation. as far as her condition is concerned - vascular dementia - she has no problems recognising people or even knowing what she wants to say. but she does struggle finding the words now, and has to be given plenty of time to try and find them.she is not very computer literate and struggles to remember sequences of key presses. so far my brother has equipped her with an alexa screen so friends and family can drop in for a video call. though she gets weary after a while she does enjoy the personal contact.i have been looking into using alexa to read books to her, which is good because the reading speed can be adjusted. the only difficulty there is if she falls asleep while alexa continues reading and she loses her place. basically what i am asking for are suggestions of what she can still do to keep herself occupied. any good ideas out there?"," question: is it you who feels she needs to keep busy or is she feeling she needs more to keep busy?  she is 95, how much movement does she need? you also note she gets weary with the video calls.  personally i would let her be. one hopes restrictions would be lifted so she could enjoy her friends again and that would certainly lift her spirits. unless she is asking for help i would just let her be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rtppwp/how_to_improve_a_sufferers_quality_of_life/,How to improve a sufferer's quality of life?

"i posted a couple of month's ago about my dad being hyper paranoid. he believes people are after him. i was in denial about his declining mental state. i saw him for christmas weekend, and it was very evident he has been declining. he has lost 20 pounds and could hardly walk up the stairs. he stopped working out... he looks like an old man, and he has never looked like an old man. we spoke yesterday, and he went on about the people who are after him. he said they have his car keys, have been in his home. he said they haven't taken anything, he just knows they have been inside.  in the past, when he has talked about the people following him, i would ask questions about them, and he couldn't answer them, and he would get frustrated, and mad at me. i have become the enemy at this point. i have never told him i don't believe him, just asked questions he realized he couldn't answer. i feel like an idiot because the signs have been there for a long time. about a year ago he decided his friends who has known for decades were trying to sabotage his business. he has been more forgetful, but i just ignored it. now i'm at the point where i know i need to take him to the doctor, but i am so worried. we have always been close, but i have become someone he doesn't think he can trust. he has a heavy military background and very extensive fire arm training. i don't know how to break it to him that we are going to the doctor to get him checked out. i live about an hour and a half away, and my dad is more willing to trust my fiance. i am going to make the appointment but i am so afraid he will hate me or react very violently. i know there is no good way/good outcome, but what is the best way to go about it? thank you so much. i am lost and very overwhelmed."," he may not even remember why you took him- no guarantee of that, though.  my mom would be mad at me while we were in the doctor's office because i'd mention something she didn't want the doctor to hear, but the doctor or one of the staff would say something that would get her attention and it melted away.   come up with another excuse to take him. say it's for a ""mandatory"" physical for his insurance. be sure to give the doctor's office a heads-up about what's going on beforehand so they know what to expect when he comes in, call them and put the information in writing to deliver at check-in. keep things as chill as possible beforehand.  if he's already paranoid, being edgy and upset is going to make him even moreso. remember that most dementia patients until the later stages can hide their symptoms for a short while. without some information as a background to give the doctor an idea of what to look for and maybe where to ""poke"", he might be able to hide it.  maybe, if you're really lucky. the doctor will find that he has a uti or something else causing delerium instead of dementia and that's causing the paranoia.  i know mom's dementia always went completely sideways from any minor infection. insisting people were living in her suv, hiding in an old rv on the driveway, etc. her doctor said some of her patients got that way without the dementia, just with the infection.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rt6ai5/help/,[deleted by user]

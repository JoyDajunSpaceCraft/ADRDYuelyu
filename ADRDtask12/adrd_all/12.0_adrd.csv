[removed]," your first sentences made me laugh but then the rest of your post made me cry.  alzheimer’s is such a cruel disease that ravages not only the sufferer, but the family as well.  i think we mourn our loved one a little at a time as the disease steals away the person we knew.  when my dad died it was a relief that he was no longer suffering.  i am so sorry you are going through this.  sending you wishes for comfort and peace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/p0weqk/big_rick_and_his_elephants/,Big Rick and his elephants
[removed]," if she's writing things down more on a notepad and calendar, chances are that she knows her memory's getting worse. the best thing you can do is talk to her about it and ask her if she can get checked out by a doctor. reassure her by saying it's probably nothing but you just want to be sure because you love her and care about her. don't frame it like she's doing anything wrong, because that might make her defensive and she may refuse to see the doctor.to clear up a common misconception - memory loss is not just a normal part of ageing. if she's getting more forgetful, there's a reason for it. it might be something as simple as a side effect of some medication that she may currently be taking but it might also be a sign of something more. the only way you'll know is by getting her checked out by a doctor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/p0tloe/how_to_ask_somebody_to_get_help/,How to ask somebody to get help?

[removed]," i'm a hospice nurse in the usa. curiosity or needing information about his prognosis (how much time he has left) is not morbid.  understanding the chronic disease process and what his end of life will be like is important.  when you understand what is happening it takes away the fear of the unknown and makes helping him easier.a little practical knowledge first, if he is peeing in unusual places there are garments that you can buy or make that close in back or have a zipper all the way up the front that makes it harder for him to do that.if you are vaccinated against hep b and your mom is worried, there is a blood test that can check to make sure that you have antibodies against the virus.  has the doctor mentioned any reason that the risk would be higher that normal?finally, there are many factors involved that are taken into account when estimating how much time a person has left.  how much is the hep b affecting him, for example.  does he have jaundice or ascites(swollen belly)?  is he eating and drinking well or losing weight?  does he have other diagnosis could be contributing to his decline?  when the liver isn't working well it can cause a build up of waste products that are usually eliminated in the stool. those waste products affect the brain and can make dementia symptoms worse as well as shorten his life span further.many dementia patients die due to injuries from falls or infections, sometimes the part of the brain that controls swallowing is affected and this causes a respiratory infection because food or fluid is going into the lungs.  these are just examples of how decline happens and not meant to apply to your family member.for your research you might look up some things such as:  hepatic encephalopathy,(how liver disease can change the brain) dysphagia(swallowing problems), fast scale, palliative performance scale, (how to measure decline) signs and symptoms of impending death, fall safety in the home for dementia patients, skin changes in liver disease.  i hope this helps you understand more about what is happening and what to expect in the future and help you communicate with your health care team.  i know these are medical terms that might seem a little intimidating, please don't let that deter you too much from learning about what is happening to your dad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ozrv57/a_little_morbid_but_how_long_before_death/,A little morbid but - how long before death?

[removed]," hello. i'm a few days behind but yknow. my grandma is also going through medical issues perpetuated by alzheimers. honestly? idk. if i ever find myself with a diagnoses i think i would rather die as myself than live, dragged into a shadow of who i used to be. i am facing the fact that i might get that call someday soon. i am not new to grief. i have held the lives of days old kittens in my hands and felt their strength ebb. i have fought for them. i have held my childhood dog for the last time, before my parents chose to put him to sleep. i know well how to grieve, but how do you justify the death of the woman who raised you? do you say she lived a long, excellent life - despite the fact that you were too little to comprehend that when it mattered? do you remember her by the scraps of stories you managed to grasp over the years? do you relish knowing she will die knowing she is loved, when she doesnt remember you... or the act of going to visit her tears you apart? i dont know. i'm sorry, friend. my greatest fear when she passes will be the funeral. if i do not go, my parents and family will condemn me for not loving my grandma and i will be a social pariah. but funerals are not how i grieve. i do not grieve in public with people i do not know or trust. i like to keep a stoic and protective demeanor, which is impossible when i am sobbing. i would rather visit her grave in peace and quiet. but what do i tell my grandpa when he is alone at a funeral for his life long partner?we cant prepare for it. just remember to leave room to grieve",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ozdydc/update_from_my_grandpa_is_an_empty_shell_of_the/,[deleted by user]

[removed], you have to change the locks to lock from the inside. many families do this---just make sure you keep the old knobs and change everything back once he is gone because ultimately it's dangerous to be locked-in but more dangerous for people with dementia to wander.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ok5e8d/help_with_sun_downing_wandering/,Help with sun downing/ wandering?
[removed]," \[apologies for the lengthiness; take what you need and leave the rest!\]my strongest recommendation for you is to educate yourself about alzheimer's (check out [teepa snow's videos]( she's an expert in caring for alzheimer's patients -- but keep in mind, your dad may still be in the very early stages and probably not as debilitated as advanced alzheimer's patients). another strong recommendation is to make sure a responsible person in the family hires an elder law attorney who knows the ins and outs of legal affairs in this type of situation and can guide your family in protecting your dad's assets and rights. this will probably include taking over the financial duties for him. elder law attorneys know much more about the unique issues than general attorneys do, including ss benefits, medicare/medicaid, hospitalization, etc. they also have a network of connections regarding care and legal/financial help.don't be afraid of the ""weirdness"" you'll see in your dad. find the humor and allow him to be different than he used to be, but always remembering his best qualities!  when he doesn't make sense, or when he insists that something is different than reality, simply play along and don't try to reason with him or argue. for example, if he asks about his old girlfriend, simply say, ""we'll see her soon,"" or ""she said she'll call next tuesday,"" or whatever. such compassionate dishonesty is allowed as a calming device, because the truth is not always useful and often upsetting. instead of saying, ""but we live in idaho; you can't go back to houston anymore,"" just say, ""we're checking out times to go to houston next month. let's get some ice cream now."" avoid correcting or arguing with him as much as you an, because he won't remember the facts later and your impatience will upset him.  divert, distract, and redirect whenever possible, just as a gentle parent would do with an overactive toddler. we noticed my brother's decline more or less in this order: 1. ""repeating"" -- repeating the same stories, asking the same question several times.2. ""dropping the thread"" --  losing his train of thought (starting a sentence and not finishing it; starting a story and not remembering how it ends); inability to find words; inability to name objects or understand which object is being referred to.3. ""drifting attention"" -- dropping out of conversations; hanging back and not participating in conversations (after a lifetime of being the extroverted center of attention). 4. ""freezing"" -- being unable to remember how to do something and freezing in position; for example, during a family buffet dinner, he stood frozen in place with a plate in hand, not remembering how to load it with food. he also didn't know how to ask for help.5. ""lost skills"" --  he started having difficulty operating his computer but he had always been relatively computer literate.  he also became electronically illiterate and couldn't operate any appliances or products that required button-pushing. he could no longer remember how to warm up coffee in the microwave, start the dishwasher, or operate any remotes. we even had to reteach him how to use a light switch, because he froze at each one. fortunately, he gave up driving early on without protest (probably he forgot how to drive) and never showed further interest in the car.6. ""computer issues"" -- password maintenance became impossible. he started getting locked out of accounts, requiring him to change passwords frequently. then he would forget them or have a zillion of them written on random sticky notes or scraps. eventually, he couldn't remember his email address or familiar web addresses, or even how to open a browser on the pc. he lost interest and finally stopped trying -- no more computer use.7. ""who ya gonna call?"" -- smart phones, which he used when he was first diagnosed, quickly became too confusing for him to operate; his wife bought a simple flip phone and he couldn't retain enough to learn how to use it.  he could answer a landline phone but didn't know how to carry on a conversation (he must have been like a [""lenny""]( to telemarketers, confusing them). my sil often had to intervene and hang up.8. ""financial illiteracy"" -- writing checks that (shockingly) made it through transactions saying only ""today"" for the date; ultimately, he was unable to write out numbers at all. balancing a checkbook or monitoring accounts became impossible, but my sil didn't notice the mistakes and mishaps until the mess was huge. (tip: take over the finances or at least get added to their accounts so you can monitor & correct mistakes!)9. ""overstocked inventory"" -- when he was still driving and using credit cards and checks, he often bought irrational items or things he had already purchased. he bought golf balls but hadn't ever played golf or expressed any interest in it. at one time there were six 50-lb bags of dog food in the garage (for a cocker spaniel).10. ""repeated behavior"" -- he picked apples nonstop from a grove of trees on his poperty, stuffing his pockets full and bringing bucket after bucket to the house. my sil tossed most of the apples in the far woods repeatedly and used the best apples to make (many) pies and cobblers. he was always surprised to see the buckets on the porch that he had already filled, as if someone else was doing it. he also enjoyed folding towels, over and over again.11. ""geographic blindness"" -- inability to know where he was or how to go to a specific place. telling him to go the bedroom required pointing to the actual room or leading him to it. he no longer could say his street address or even his city or state. he would wander around outside and get disoriented or lost.12. ""possession obsessions"" -- he had always loved jackets (ll bean addict) and began spending a lot of time taking them out of the closet and spreading them on a railing and showing them to us. he would say, ""look! look at that! isn't that one great?"" and say the same thing about the same jacket 40 seconds later. he also liked putting them on (sometimes in several layers, even in hot weather). he also pulled folded clothes out of drawers and spread them on beds and chairs to admire them. sil put clothes away several times a day!13. ""shadowing"" -- he became clingy and would not stay alone longer than a few minutes. he began hanging near us and needing constant attention, following my sil or me around and asking what we were doing.  there came a time when we couldn't go to the bathroom without him worrying that we disappeared (he couldn't remember that we said we were going to the john); he'd be in the next room calling for us or just saying, 'hey! where is everybody? hey there!""14. ""instruction malfunction"" -- he couldn't follow directions, especially a series of instructions. ""your coffee is on the table by your chair"" was impossible for him to understand. we had to point to the chair while saying, ""sit down in your chair."" then, point to the cup or hand it to him, saying,  ""here's your coffee."" and after he was holding the cup, saying ""now drink your coffee.""  breaking up instructions that way helped him, but it was energy-draining for us!15. he was unable to follow tv programs or movies, especially the news. he would keep asking ""who is that person?"" about the newscaster and ""why is he talking? what is he talking about?"" sitcoms were easier for him to follow, but still confusing. he was aware enough to comment on famous / infamous people (for example, when he saw trump on the tv, he cursed at him). but if you asked him who was the president or what year it was, my brother couldn't tell you.these were the early- to mid-stage patterns we saw develop, and my brother grew increasingly unable to function without constant assistance. eventually, he had many out-of-bathroom experiences and his wandering into woods increased the danger of getting lost or suffering physical injury. that was the final push for my sil and she found a well-vetted memory care unit where he was welcomed and where he has settled in without any reluctance or complaints.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ojxms2/any_signs_to_look_out_for_with_someone_as/,Any signs to look out for with someone as Alzheimer’s progresses?

[removed]," what you described (specifically cognitive dysfunction after moving away from home to an unfamiliar place, then improving when returning home) sounds like [incident delirium]( to me. incident delirium is acute cognitive dysfunction and is usually discussed in the context of hospital admission. the paper i linked lists risk factors for incident delirium, which include stressful events, dementia, age, depression, and length of hospital stay. in this case, i think a stressful event and moving to a new, unfamiliar home is similar to being admitted to the hospital because, in both cases, someone is experiencing a sudden change in lifestyle and environment.i am not a doctor or neurologist, so please take this information with that in mind. incident delirium can have long lasting effects even after someone returns home, so much so that some hospitals have programs that aim at [preventing incident delirium]( this [paper]( claims that doctors fail to notice over 50% of delirium cases. i hope this helps!edited for punctuation and clarity, adding this anecdotal information: i've spent time with people experiencing incident delirium and with someone who experiences alzheimer's, and i can share more about my experiences, if it could possibly help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ojk4e9/doctors_dont_care_we_have_a_weird_case/,"Doctors don’t care, we have a weird case"

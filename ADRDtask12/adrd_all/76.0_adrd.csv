"does anyone know if any really good, and reputable charities (secular is a plus) charities for dementia? my grandmother passed away around 1:30 this morning after battling dementia and in lieu of flowers at her service we want people to either donate to the hospice facility that cared for her to to a dementia charity of their choice, but i thought compiling a few good ones may help in case others don't want to look into it too much. i'm about to search around but thought i'd ask here in case anyone knew of any. thanks all.", i like caringkind. lots of great free online classes. sorry for your loss.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p3ci99/charities/,[deleted by user]

"as is any story about a love one with this horrible disease, mine is no different. the cliff notes are as follows: my father committed suicide last june 25th and my mom was the one who found him. her dementia had been progressively getting worse but due her rage when the topic was brought up- he was never willing to seek help even after my pleading with him. add in covid and issues with their home and i know it was just too much for him to bear. my husband and i sold our home, i closed my mobile veterinary practice and now care for my mom full-time with help from or local “visiting angels” this last year was incredibly difficult on all of us as she is in denial that she has a problem and becomes easily annoyed and angered; most of it directed at me because i’m the one who’s here. we have come so far in 14 months and thought things were at least “leveling” out with us being here, etc. this last 2 weeks it’s like we went back in time an entire year. she has begun calling people and telling them that my dad just died and reliving it all again as if it just happened. it is beyond heartbreaking and sadly has caused her to be angry about the same things she was when we first arrived. side note: my mom is a semi- hoarder and gets incredibly agitated by anything being changed or done around the house. we have to do it all in secret or behind her back. it’s exhausting i’m not looking for answers or solutions - as we all know there is none. just needing to get it all out. my sadness and frustration have been at an all time high lately. i know you all understand. thanks for listening and to any of you that are in this shitty boat too- bless you and god give us all strength to get through one more day. tl,dr: my mom has dementia, my dad killed himself last june- my mom found him. we moved in with her and care for her and this last two weeks we have gone back in time to her believing he just died."," i'm so sorry for your loss of your father.have you had her checked for a uti? it seemed like when my mom drastically changed, it was always the cause.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p2pfr3/mother_with_dementia_weve_gone_back_an_entire/,Mother with Dementia - we’ve gone back an entire year in the last 2 weeks.
"posting on a throwaway for anonimity.my mil (mid 60s) appears to be showing signs of alzheimers/dementia. my grandmother had alzheimer's so i'm somewhat familiar with the signs and progression of the disease. her onset is eerily similar to my grandmother's, although almost 2 decades earlier. her symptoms are aggression or aggitation to others (especially those closest to her), stubborness, poor judgment especially when it comes to finances, incoherence, accusing others of theft, and frequently misplacing things. some incidents that stuck out was that she went to an atm to withdraw money but left the cash (several hundred dollars worth) in the mouth of the machine. she has forgotten where she had parked in the mall several times and called a cab to take her home, while leaving the car for my bil to locate and drive back. she has had always been bad at money but lately it's gotten so bad that she has to constantly ask us to lend (aka give, because she doesn't pay back) her money. she is on a pension but the amount she is receiving is sufficient to cover rent, bills, and food, with maybe a couple hundred to spare each month. however, it appears that she has been spending to the last cent on useless junk. we opened her trunk one day and found that it was filled to the brim with random items from the dollar store, including 3 hats and 5 pairs of sandals that were basically identical to each other. the most striking thing was that when my husband took her to the bank, she had basically only a few dollars in her account, and she accused the bank of ""stealing"" her money, even though she was the one who had withdrawn money herself. this is very similar to how my grandmother was leading to her diagnosis where she would accuse her care aide from stealing from her without any evidence and fall for obvious scams from telemarketers.my husband is aware of what is going on but seems to be downplaying it a bit or not understanding the urgency. he seems to think it may be related to her depression (which i think is morely another symptom, and not the cause of this behaviour). i think part of it is denial since obviously taking care of someone like this is a lot of stress. her sisters are in complete denial and think that she has always been ""ditzy"". i mentioned that he should take her to the doctor to get her diagnosed but he keeps saying that she is too stubborn and that the doctor said there is nothing wrong with her. am i wrong in being frustrated in him? my father was recently diagnosed with parkinson's and it took a while for us to convince my mom to get him to see the doctor so i understand the stubborness and denial but i think he should be doing more to push for it.", it’s a difficult place to be. my mom ignored it because it’s a hard thing to acknowledge and living with it it was easy to just ignore at times. my  dad had a stroke and while in hospital we all insisted on him being tested.  once he had meds he was great for about 7 years before he started getting a lot worse (he has vascular dementia).  alzheimers is much quicker paced it seems.  you husband has to step up and his choice if he doesn’t.  it’s easy for guys (in my experience) to walk away or not want to see what’s happening).  safety really needs to be the main concern.   i’d mention to her husband that maybe a scan to make sure no brain tumor or anything serious is happening. i have friend that it ended up being a tumor actually.  tak to them in a very concerned but in threatening way. say you’ve noticed some concerning things and it’s important to make sure there isn’t something serious going on with her brain. the idea or word dementia will make them shy from the possibility of it happening. speak to doctors beforehand so they know what you think is going on. it’s impossible to talk imin front of dementia patients without them getting pissed and going off deepens in my experience sadly.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p2mokt/stubborn_mil_may_have_dementiaalzheimers_husband/,Stubborn MIL may have dementia/alzheimers.

"hello all! my grandmother lives with me and has recent been diagnosed with moderate dementia during a hospital/rehab stay. she is aware and alert most of the time. she's even aware and jokes about forgetting things. it's most noticeable when she forgets i'm home because i went into another room and gets me and my mom mixed up often.i have a new job and we are moving to a new state. we've talked about it nearly every day, but she forgets. she does get excited about going to florida, she can't wait to go to disney again. i'm concerned about transition issues. i don't know if this could cause a decline or too much stress for her. i've been trying to research but everything is about moving to/between care facilities.anyone have any suggestions to help her transition easier? i've given her the tourism book thingy so she can see the area. i've also given her small tasks to do since she asks to help and i thought it might help her to feel more involved... and she has better handwriting than me for the moving labels.also any tips for the road trip there, itll be about 12 hours spread over 3 days so she's not stuck in the car too long. this is new for me, and i just want things to be as easy as they can be for her.thank you all so much!"," i moved my dad across five states at the beginning of my caregiving experience. he has vascular dementia, and also i hadn’t sorted out his meds at that point - so he was overmedicated and slightly delirious. (this was in june 2020, so the covid situation was relevant. the state we were headed to imposed a curfew while we were on the road. we also drove across multiple impacted indian reservations.)two things during the trip:he was very excited to be on the road again after being housebound - he used to be a truck driver, so highways and gas stations were a familiar thing he was excited to see again. he kept wanting to go into gas stations and talk to people and shop and touch stuff. he wanted to whack the tires and clean the windows and run the gas pump - this is when we didn’t know if you could catch it by touching things. i eventually had to give him a semi-rude talking to, hoping i could make a memory for him of “stay in the rv, don’t talk to unmasked people, and don’t catch covid bc it will kill you, you walking pile of preexisting conditions”. obviously i didn’t use those words but i had to connect a lot of dots to make my point and then use fear and his sense of responsibility toward me to evoke some intense emotion. he behaved for the rest of the trip. other thing, possibly related: he started asking the same questions over and over: “when are we stopping?” (sunset bc of curfew.) “where are we stopping?” (a campsite in flagstaff.) “how far are we going?” (x miles.) “when are we stopping?” he was getting mildly anxious, and the anxiety was making it impossible for him to remember the answers to the questions. the last ~45 minutes of driving that evening were peppered with the same questions with slight pauses in between. if i was doing it now, i’d probably give him a map with the trip highlighted on it. and every time he asked a question i’d probably answer short and straight, and then follow with something reassuring like: “we’ll be there soon” or “just a little longer” or “we’ve gone all this way and it’s been fine, so we have a little more and that’ll be fine too” or “this is going exactly like i planned” (it wasn’t, but that’s fine for me to deal with). i’m better at dealing with his unspoken anxiety now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p19nqg/tips_for_moving/,Tips for moving

my guess is that its like when you wake up from a dream but you forget what took place," at its absolute most basics, dementia is ""just"" memory loss (like my parents somehow continue to think despite my late stage dementia grandmother having lived with us for the past 6/7 years). but what no one seems to really get across is how deep ""memory loss"" goes. it's more than just forgetting your grandkids' names, it's forgetting all your personal history, like if you ever had sex, so now your daughter helping you with toilet needs is them molesting you. it's all the rules of life, like, 'when someone speaks to you, you respond because that's how a conversation works.' it's everything you learned about how to behave way back when you were a toddler, like 'spitting out food anywhere but in a napkin is rude and nasty'. it's ingrained muscle memory, like how drinking from a straw works. until you have ***something resembling*** an overgrown untrained toddler who hasn't napped in five days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p0uppr/what_is_dementia_like_can_someone_explain_it_to/,[deleted by user]
"my mom went missing in 2019 and we all knew something wasn't right before she went missing. long story short - she showed up somewhere and we called an ambulance that took her to a hospital. there, they diagnosed her with dementia and moved her to a behavioral hospital. she's been in a nursing home ever since. my stepdad had to move her after a year at the first one because it wasn't secure enough and she needed memory care. he would go visit her at least twice a week and they had a very solid routine. on july 10th, he was in an accident and passed away. i live a few hours away and traveled there as soon as i heard. i had to break the news to my mom and i had to go to the elder lawyer very quickly to take over as her guardian. she took the news hard but after about an hour, she forgot and we got her to eat lunch. the next day, it hit her suddenly, she remembered she lost him but with some redirection we were able to keep her calm. it must come and go though because she's ripping up photo albums. being a couple hours away is very difficult but she's doing so very well in the place she is currently in and they really care about her. i don't know if i have a question here or if i just needed to get it out. the dementia isn't new to me but being her sole guardian is because before it always felt like my step-dad and i could talk it out. we could figure out together the best decisions for her and now it feels heavier. at this point, when she says he's going to come visit, we just agree and move on. it seems cruel to make her re-live losing him over and over. i did take her to his funeral and she understood where she was but was quickly confused when people came to give their condolences. she saw his coworkers and said, oh we must find him so he can say hi. do any of you live far away from your parent/grandparent who is living in a nursing/memory care home? and to all of you, how do you deal with the guilt of it all? like if you can't be there as often as you like and the worry if someone is mistreating them? i'm still grieving the loss of my step-dad plus trying to figure out what to do for my mom. he handled all of her doctor appointments and everything. it's just so much.tl:dr - my stepdad died, i'm the sole person remaining to care for my mom and i feel so overwhelmed."," i’m going through something very similar with my mom right now. i live with her, and i’m in the middle of selling her house and moving us to another state. the move is really stressful for her, even though she agreed with it. yesterday, a cousin called her and told her that her brother was not doing well. mom wasn’t able to understand much beyond not doing well, even though she was an rn. i got ahold of another cousin who explained that my uncle is in hospice. he’s stopped eating and drinking, so it’s only going to be a few days at most.so now i get to explain to her that her brother is dying, that as much as she wants to visit him, she can’t, because it’ll be under lockdown before she gets out there, never mind that she can’t travel by herself, never mind that even if she could i’d say no because of the covid risk.this is a special kind of hell, watching her realize that her brother is dying, decide to be with him, being told she can’t, because of covid, and then realizing that i’m right, because she’s still got that steel heart of a nurse, and she won’t expose herself or others. it’s a special kind of hell, and i’ve done it three times today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p0tdg1/my_stepdad_passed_away_suddenly_and_im_now_my/,My Step-Dad Passed Away Suddenly and I'm now my Mom's Guardian

"i admit finding positives when caregiving isn’t easy because it can get so overwhelming. i just wanted to share a few very small things that have been positives for me lately and i am hoping members in this community are able to find some positives for themselves. one is my mother requires a daily nebulizer treatment. putting together the nebulizer and adding the pre-measuredalbuterol could be done by a 10 year old, but she can’t learn how to do it herself. so i have to go to her apartment and put it together for her. i willing took this on because i can’t justify paying $300-$400 a month for somebody to do this very simple procedure. when i started i was a bit angry that i was going to have to do this every day for the rest of her life. then i thought why not use the half hour and do something for myself? so while i am waiting for her to complete her nebulizer treatment (she does have the capabilities to hold the mouthpiece on her own &amp; when she’s unable to i can change her over to a mask), i have been using a language app to brush up on spanish and i’m finding those skills are improving every day. using the time wisely is a good feeling. another positive was finding a recommendation in this group about radical acceptance. i looked into it and in trying to practice it have found my mood has improved, and although there are days that are better than others, it has been a great help, so i want to extend a heartfelt thank you to the person who recommended that in a discussion thread. it has been a huge game changer for my mindset. and another positive that i am finding is by practicing the non-argumentative approach with my mother, and just saying ok when she gets insistent about something minor is spilling over into my other close relationships. a perfect example is my husband and i recently moved. he has ideas about decor and furniture placement that are not ideal to the room space and placing things in odd spots, like in areas that will narrow a walkway, etc. i’ve come to the point of saying ok. he will do it and a few days later he says, “this doesn’t work” and moves it back. applying this non-argumentative approach to so many things that just don’t matter is another game changer, providing a lot of inner peace. i am discovering that picking the battles and which hills i want to die on is leading me to the realization that there are so few with the battle. i hope someone is able to take away something from this and find their own positivities.peace to you all! ☮️"," i hate that you're right about resetting my sense of ""what needs to be responded to, right now"". i had been a self righteous know it all for so long and it hurts to look back on it. i pray i'm actually less of one now, but also somehow maintain my boundaries.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ozx2lx/finding_the_positives/,[deleted by user]

"me (45) lives in london my mother (60) lives with my step dad (73) who has deteriorated with dementia. they are about 3 hours from me. i try to help as best i can but an frustrated that i am almost unable to at all. he is very demanding and wont let her have any time to herself. when i visit it causes issues as i never got on with my step father growing up. each time i visit my mother is visibly deteriorating and is just plain exhausted. she refuses any external help and is too proud to have any home help. is there anything i can do. i am loathed to force the issue, because she doesn’t need more stress.  the best i have been able to do is keep an eye on / complete paperwork, make sure she is on the best phone tariff etc. but this seems pathetic to the situation she is faced with almost 24/7"," adult daycare is a great suggestion that someone already wrote. also, your mom needs outside help. at least hospice care, check the state government website for senior resources.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oyyyy1/how_to_help_my_mum/,How to help my Mum

"a relative of mine is under evaluation for dementia). mri shows some atrophy in the medial temporal lobes (common on alzheimer’s i believe). but, their short term memory is not that bad, or at least varies.what they struggle with the most is visual tasks. they showed simultagnosia on the “cookie theft” image. they struggle to do things like put a wooden peg in a hole in a child’s toy. they can’t identify the denomination of bills. they can’t figure out how to pass a credit card through a store’s plexiglass hole (continually hitting the plexiglass with their card). they can’t process maps.it seems fairly extreme and out of character with my understanding of “typical” alzheimer’s and other common dementias.we’re working with a neurologist but it’s very slow going and i’m wondering if this suggests anything to anyone that might be worth bringing up."," there was a time last year when my dad was still dispensing his own meds and his neuro med, pramipexole i think, was to be taken something like 3 or 4 pills 3 times a day. he was mismanaging his meds and was having issues and vicious swings. one issue in particular struck me. he would be sitting in a chair in his bathroom, wall mirror to his left and i walked in to stand to his right. i reach out to hand him something and he wa seeing me in the mirror and reached out to that image to take the item. he was surprised that i was not that image.two things happened to help him. his neuro put his med on a extended release kind and i started managing his meds. turns out he was really mismanaging them. he will have good and bad days and on bad days will at times fumble and seem confused. but he doesnt talk about a thing. it just seems like he cannot understand the concept. we look at something and understand what it is and its relationship to its and your surroundings. is it possible theres something else going on as well. just a thought, but does he comment when this happens, or does anyone ask him what hes seeing and thinking? just wondering if he sees things fine but doesnt understand or if his perception is off. i wish you folks all the best",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oyp08o/predominant_vision_issuessimultagnosia/,Predominant vision issues/simultagnosia
"my fil was diagnosed with alcohol-induced dementia after going sober since around march of this year. i suspect there may've been subtle signs of it in a previous (unsuccessful) attempt at sobriety a few years ago, but it was a fairly brief time period, so he received no diagnosis back then. we (my so and i) have been through a whirlwind of a few months- fil had a couple stays in a behavioral unit before alcohol-induced dementia was diagnosed and since then he's been back once because of suicidal ideation and has also been diagnosed with several other major health conditions that are related to his alcohol and nicotine use. most recently, fil had a seizure (after a few days where he would barely speak to us) and was in the hospital in a sort of catatonic state for a couple weeks. since, he's been better and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for physical and speech therapy. the facility recently had a positive covid case so we aren't able to visit fil in person, but fil is now present enough to call so a couple/several times a day and sounds astoundingly present. fil was able to point out a tiny correction that needed to be made in some paperwork were working on for the medicaid application that we would've never caught otherwise.i guess my question is - is this normal for this kind of dementia? if we don't have the medicaid app complete by the time he's released he'll be staying back with us and i know this is so hard to predict. but has anyone seen re-introduction to living with family as a positive this recently from a diagnosis for this kind of dementia? my fear is that when he was staying with us before, things always went downhill because we still have to be working full time, we can't engage with him 24/7. i know my so is getting optimistic that he'll be back to his old self soon, but i can't shake the fear that his current clarity is because he's in a place that can help and we can't rely on him staying as great as he is right now if he's back with us - where he can't get the attention and type of care he may need."," m m. m k,..k. ..m.j, mm nvm xq",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oy9eyo/alcoholinduced_dementia_seeking_advice/,"Alcohol-induced dementia, seeking advice"

i dont really wanna go into to many details my nan was recently diagnosed with dementia and shes currently receiving tests to see how fast it is progressing what happened is yesterday when me and my family went to visit she walked to the toilet and after a few mins she came out and as she was walking back to the living room she was still having a wee and she left a trail and she didn't realise when we said nan nan stop she just denied it and said i didnt wee on the carpet even though we see her do it.," i'm sorry. that must have been very upsetting for you and your other family members.there's this thing with dementia. the technical name is agnosia, which means 'lack of knowledge,' but what it means for people with dementia is that they are unaware of their symptoms or unable to recognize the symptoms for what they are. your nan isn't deliberately refusing to understand what's happening. she can't. the parts of the brain that help us keep track of ourselves and the other parts of the brain that can grapple with a problem and figure out what to do have been damaged by the dementia. she doesn't have access to them any more. all she knows is that she's just trying to carry on but her family members keep yelling things that make no sense at her. it's very difficult for everyone involved.one thing that caregivers learn to do with their loved ones is avoid arguing. it doesn't solve the problem, it uses up your energy, and it upsets your loved one. so you learn to redirect, distract, occupy, and refocus your loved one. ""oh, dear, nan! there's a big spill on your housecoat. let's get you cleaned up."" ""gosh, nan, i remember when you showed me how to wash my hands. how did that go? let's do it together."" it takes work. it takes practice. and, it takes a rested and unstressed mind to pull it off every day. it sounds like your nan is at a point where she needs help with what are called daily living tasks. this includes things like eating, going to the toilet, getting dressed, and doing chores. depending on where you are and what kind of health coverage your nan has, you can see if bringing an aide in is workable or if your nan is better off in memory care. it may be that her symptoms are too far progressed for simple assisted living.it's going to be hard. i'm sorry for that. try to remember to be gentle, not just with your nan, but with yourself and your family members, because you're all under stress and grieving.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oy1yqi/is_this_part_of_dementia/,Is this part of dementia
"i'm kind of grappling with something, and i'm wondering what other peoples' experiences have been. basically, my dad has been in memory care since may. we placed him because he got violent and we could no longer deal with his outbursts. it wasn't safe for us or for him to keep him at home.since then, i've visited twice. both times he saw me, started crying, and didn't stop until i left. it was miserable. according to the staff and his private aide (we hire her as a familiar face for him and extra pair of eyes), he's in a good mood until i turn up. then he just gets sad.now i'm wondering if i just shouldn't visit. it doesn't seem to make him happy, and frankly, i don't want to see him like that. i don't, at this point, feel guilty about not visiting. i moved in with my parents in 2016 to help care for him, and ended up having to manage most of his care because my mom was in denial for a long time. i was also the one who researched memory care and got him a spot in what seems to be a good facility for him. so i've done what i could - and rearranged my life and ended up with bad burnout and ptsd to do it - to make sure he has the care he needs. also, my mom, his primary caregiver, already visits 3x/week and oversees his care there, so if i were to stop visiting he would still see his wife and have his main care advocate. so to me it mostly comes down to: is there any additional benefit to him for me to visit? and right now it feels like the answer is 'no', but maybe my answer is being colored by the fact that i just really don't want to see him like this anymore. i'm just too tired and too sad.for anyone in a similar situation, what did you end up doing?"," we had this a little with my mother who went to a nursing home (memory care) in march 2021. you could try bring nice things into the care home. i bring in two biscuits and a chilled cordial that my mom loves. you not supposed to bring in food to the facility but that else are you to do, enjoy a cuppa together. i also bring in flowers and we arrange them together. try to keep your dad busy during your visit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oxzbpo/dodid_you_visit/,Do/did you visit?
"my parents are moving for the first time in 42 years. my father (76) was diagnosed in jan 2020, and my mother (69) has been an amazing caregiver/partner the entire time. i’ve (m33) been helping them get ready to move for a couple months and we’re nearing the moment when they will actually leave.his confusion has been getting worse lately as we get closer to leaving. that makes sense, as we’re emptying drawers and cabinets that he has used for decades, but are there things that i/we can do to make this easier for him in this moment? thankfully, he is perpetually positive and eager for an adventure, but small things are becoming increasingly difficult for him to accomplish and process. his daily routine is roughly similar to what it was, but his environment is obviously way different. are there things that i can/should do to help my mother at this time as she transitions to a more permanent caregiver role and begins to process losing a partner? sometimes i worry more about her, i can’t imagine what she is going though."," if i'm reading you correctly, you're more worried about your mother than your father, and that's completely understandable. if your father's care is in hand, there's not a lot to do for him other than keep him occupied and reassured.i'm in the same situation as your mother. i am moving my mom and i from california to kansas to be closer to family and to cash out the equity in her house. i am adulting at a level i have never touched before, and i am a nervous wreck. the first big thing that's helped is that nobody's second guessing me. discussions, yes. suggestions, always. but my younger brother regularly tells me i'm doing a good job and that he supports me. my friends and other family do the same thing, and as someone who's struggled my whole life to stay on top of things, it helps tremendously.the second big thing that helps is company. people coming in and visiting (everyone's vaccinated) means that i can take my eye off my mom for a while. it means a positive and happy change up. it means i get some socialization in, and my mom can stop worrying about me. it also means i get a lot of help with the packing and all the errands that have to be run.the third big thing is respite. my mom is at a point where she can't drive anymore and she can't be left alone for more than a couple of hours. mostly, it's her anxiety, but she's messed up her meds and taken more than she should have or started 'organizing' and 'cleaning' to help with her stress. she's lost stuff i needed, thrown out things i wanted to keep, wiped out hours of work, and would have endangered herself if i hadn't been there and checked in. so, i can't leave, not unless there's someone else who can stay with her. negotiating this is very delicate, because she's having an extremely difficult time coming to terms with her deficits. when it's a friend or family member, though, it's so much easier. they're just hanging out visiting while i run some errands. so, things you could do for your mom:\- take over some of the moving tasks she has to deal with (buying supplies, getting things fixed around the house for the sale, making appointments, finding documents, keeping tabs on emails)\- tell her regularly that you support her, that she's doing a great job, and that you're there for her.\- if you're close enough, stop by regularly to spend some time with them, helping, socializing, and stepping in.\- give her respite. stay with your dad long enough that she can go someplace else for a while. maybe all she needs is a couple of hours to get her hair cut, but it's a couple of hours where she doesn't have to worry, because she knows your father is in good hands. it makes a world of difference.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oxy56q/help_creating_a_calming_environment_while_helping/,Help creating a calming environment while helping my parents move - father has dementia.
"my grandmother (74f) has dementia and it's getting to be too much right now.she's been refusing to eat anything my mother makes her, calling it raw and junk, and only eats bland basic food like plain rice or tortillas dipped in chili. i bring her salads and other stuff from my job she used to love, but she's been giving them to the dog when i'm not looking. (my dog is fine. he's very chill around food and doesn't eat what she tries to give him)i asked her why she keeps refusing to eat and she went on this whole rant about how she doesn't want to burden us by eating food she didn't pay for and how my mother would flip her shit if she caught her eating stuff that was hers and how food doesn't taste good anymore. it was scary to listen to, since my mother has never said any of that and is actually trying to get her to eat more food. same with drinking water, which she refuses.right now, she's bawling her eyes out because my mother doesn't let her wash clothes or do dishes anymore because nothing she does is right and how if we don't want her help, we should just ship her to mexico to die. my mother doesn't let her do chores since she can barely stand, let alone walk, and breaks the dishes whenever she tries since mugs are too heavy for her now. the few times she managed to sneak her way into the basement to do laundry, she got stuck at the bottom since she couldn't lift her legs enough to walk upstairs.she snuck out while my aunt was asleep to tend to my garden and plucked a lot of unripe plants since ""i'm not doing it right and she was sick of asking me to pick my tomatoes"". this resulted in her falling over and not being found until an hour later at 11am when she managed to push herself up and walk back inside. when we asked her why, she started crying and calling us all abusive and evil for not letting her do anything.she's also been claiming some really bad things about people. like, when she was hospitalized with covid, they had to restrain her since she kept trying to wander off and started screaming that the nurses were taking her blood to sell on the black market. after she got out, she told the entire family that we all hated her and left her to rot in the hospital alone without visiting her, even though my aunt took a week off work to stay with her 24/7. just today, she said that my mother threw all her blankets at her face and told her that she's not allowed clean laundry anymore. my mother's been at work all day.is this normal?", take it day by day and find the components that she can do and let her help. could she fold laundry? put socks inside socks? even if it’s not done the best. when she refuses to eat because she didn’t pay for it go along with the idea that it’s a celebration or you worked hard to get it and it’s a gift and she can buy the next meal. if food doesn’t seem to taste good you might want to ask her doctor and see what can be done. senses do change as we ate. my grandma wouldn’t drink water later on because she wanted sweet tea. food coloring helped her stay hydrated. changes in perception are also normal and even though it’s hard to hear what she says and it might not be true it’s a perception. please let me know if you need any help.  i’m here for you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oxy283/is_this_normal_smallish_vent/,Is this normal?

"disclaimer that i do not know a lot about dementia and i have been fortunate not to have anyone close to me suffer from it. i would love any education or resources on the subject i’m about to discuss, thank you! i have a neighbor with dementia. she lives completely alone in the house next door and was never married and never had kids. sometimes caretakers come by but they aren’t there 24/7. her extended family seems to have estranged her, or they don’t live anywhere nearby; regardless, i firmly believe they aren’t really trying to give her the support she needs, but that isn’t really my business. the matter which concerns me is that when she’s alone, she screams constantly. she sounds like she’s being tortured, brutally murdered, you name it—and this screaming goes on for hours and hours, sometimes all night long. she says things like “no, no, please!” and “thats everything i have!” or “please get out!”, “please help me!” her screaming is bloodcurdling and it disturbs the entire neighborhood, particularly my family, because she truly sounds like she’s in pure agony (and i know she might be). none of the neighborhood seems sure what to do about it, because no one really knows her personally, but it’s really difficult to just go about our lives while it sounds like someone is being constantly tortured a few doors down. i feel awful. she’s been my neighbor ever since i was little and the only time she interacted with me was to tell me not to park in front of her house, so i can’t imagine she built a good rapport with many of our other neighbors either. but i still feel bad hearing her go through this, and on another hand it is not sustainable to deal with this type of disturbance every night when we’re trying to rest, etc. so what can i do or who can i call in a situation like this, to come help her and try to calm her down?i’m a black woman and i’m incredibly reserved about calling the police into my neighborhood, especially in a nonviolent situation like this, so would prefer not to have to do something like that. it’s also already been done before but didn’t seem to be of much help. thanks!"," as to your edit - i don't think you should threaten them with ""elder abuse"".  sure, call aps, but don't tell them that she's being abused and that they're trying to get her money. you don't know what the whole story is and that's a very  serious charge. the assisted living facilities that have wait lists are the low income facilities and if they have to sell her house to pay for it, then she's not rolling in money.you can't force someone to move even with a poa. you can't force someone to allow a caregiver into their home.  even a person with dementia has free will and can assert themselves and it takes a lot to be able to legally override their wishes.  she may have refused to move, she may have refused more care, we don't know.my lo refused to move, refused in home care, rejected the idea that she needed more help for years.  i was doing all that i could for her but i live far away and can't be there all the time - and she kept kicking out caregivers.  one of her neighbors called me and screamed at me.  she had no idea how much work i'd been putting into constantly getting new caregivers and screening them, getting all of her legal work in order so that i could step in to care for her, and all of the time going to different facilities touring and getting pricing - on top of managing all of her daily living needs.  i work full time and have a young family and live hours away.  this isn't easy or quick and i am but one person.my situation doesn't appear to be much different than what you're describing here. if someone threatened me with ""abuse"" it would be very offensive.  please don't assume the worst and make such comments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oxsugu/what_can_i_do_to_help_my_neighbor_w_dementia_who/,What can I do to help my neighbor w/ dementia who lives alone and screams a lot?

"i am so mentally exhausted and am running out of options. my (25f) mom (56f) just got diagnosed with frontal temporal dementia and this is a terrible disease. she was involuntarily committed twice over the past month and both times were very traumatic for her and she has lost trust in everyone in our family (she blames us for putting her there) and the medical system. she was discharged last friday and i wish they held her longer. she is delusional and thinks she can start her teaching job in two days but that keeps stressing her out and gets her wound up. she is verbally abusive to me and anyone else who tries to help her. i don’t want to commit her again but the meds aren’t working, we don’t have any outpatient resources, she’s too mean to have a live in aide, she’s running out of family members and friends who are willing to help her, and her next psych appointment is in three weeks and we can’t wait that long. scrolling this sub helps so much. i know i’m not alone but it sure feels like it. life was so normal and happy two months ago and now that’s all gone. i’m starting to come to terms with the fact that i have already had the best moments with my mom and now it’s only downhill from here."," i'm so sorry. my heart breaks for you, to be burdened with this, and at such a young age. my dad has a different type of dementia, but he's delusional and violent and has acted out in all kinds of ways that made it impossible to keep him at home, so i can relate on that level. we know they can't help it, but knowing it doesn't help us when they engage in these crazy and impossible behaviors. and they just don't stop and they can't be reasoned with. so no, you're not alone.can you call adult protective services or your local equivalent? it's clear you can't (and shouldn't have to) care for her, given her behavioral issues, and i've heard of situations like this where the patient was violent, went into inpatient care, and the family simply refused to take them back for fear of their own safety. the patient was transferred to a nursing home/geriatric psych ward. no, it's not what you would have wanted for your mom, but the way she is now isn't something you can or should deal with - especially not at your age, when you should be working on getting your own life on track. (trust me, you do not want to sacrifice years of your working life to caregiving. been there, done that, probably will never be able to retire as a consequence.) and, as others have said, if you do have power of attorney, use it now.

my mom (75) has had dementia for at least 6-7 years. 5 years ago my parents gave me poa but i don’t really understand what i do with that. my dad is still competent to make decisions for my mom and himself but soon that may not be the case. can someone explain in layman’s terms what poa is supposed to do? i feel like a moron asking this but need some input. i don’t want to broach it with my parents bc i feel like i’ll be accused of money grubbing.," the easiest way to explain a poa is that it gives you the legal right to pretend to be her. you can make any decision on her behalf for her. short story long, i was made poa of my mom several years ago but didn't start using it until about 3 or 4 years ago. started out as a bit of a convenience....it was easier for me to sign for her. then it became more necessary as i noticed her mind slipping and her doing less and less.for us, she first gave me rights to some accounts. that went great until it didn't. then i switched to being her poa. for us, i became poa immediately. there was no waiting period or compentcy test. at first, i felt like a huge jerk using it. she was a bookkeeper and used to manage a household incredibly well. then one day she stopped....the turning point became when i used it to move her into an adult family home. that was f***ng tough! but she no longer had the executive functioning skills to make that decision for herself. i let her make some decisions, but watching and observing my once sharp as a tack mom no longer no how to make huge decisions....i got over whatever hang-ups i had and used it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oxj9sq/poa_responsibilities/,POA responsibilities

," my neighbors across the way for the past 11 years are in their mid 60s. the husband was the friendliest man in the whole world and went to work everyday as maintenance at the community college. he was always in great shape for his age and we would help each other clear off the neighbor’s cars when it snowed. he was not some frail person. i didn’t see him much through covid but when i saw him again, probably 4 months ago, he was totally unrecognizable. he didn’t seem to recognize me and looked right through me instead of the same greeting we had for years upon seeing eachother. he was walking in an unrecognizable gait, super small, shuffled steps. he looked like he lost a ton of weight, i even though he might of had cancer until a neighbor told me he was having problems otherwise. in the past few months, he has twice now been very disoriented and tried to kill himself, extremely uncharacteristic of how he was before. the first time, his wife called the cops because he was becoming unhinged in the house, and he tried to steal the cops gun to kill himself. tonight i came home to a ton of emergency vehicles and he apparently downed a ton of pills. i can’t emphasize enough how much i don’t think this is just anxiety or depression, though i am not underestimating their severity. there is 100% a neurological component here. i know they’ve seen a neurologist and a psychologist but obviously that’s not enough, there’s no diagnosis yet and clearly treatment is not helping dull any symptoms. i’m wondering if this could be lewy body dementia. if so, does anyone have any tips on getting a diagnosis? any information or guidance would be appreciated. i’m so fearful that if he even survives through today that he’s going to kill himself or both of them one day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oxgoa3/neighbor_in_his_60s_has_deteriorated_since/,Neighbor in his 60s has deteriorated since October into what appears to be a different person.

my mom had to move my grandma into our house bc of her dementia. obviously my grandma with dementia forgets she has dementia and gets confused why my mom is controlling her life. this makes her kinda resent my mom deep down and talk abt leaving.my grandma said today “sometimes i think i hate ur mom but she does so much for me”. i took this as my grandma being vulnerable and understanding that she’s been ungrateful and seen the situation unclearly. and also complimenting my mom in a way that says “i know i treated u bad bc i was wrong but u have been amazing to me. i was wrong” my grandmas first language isn’t english also.my mom got mad abt how my grandma told her she hated her. i don’t know if my mom is latching onto the negative or just simply unable to understand social things. what if my mom has a form of autism. but my mom told me to go talk to my grandma bc appearantly hours later my grandma was in her room upset. my moms wanted me to tell my grandma that she told my mom she hated her. i didn’t. i found my grandma almost crying and saying she wants to leave and upset. i told her my mom heard her wrong and that she didn’t say anything mean.," sometimes it can be hard for people to see their parents in these kind of states and separate who they were before, to who they are now. a lot of olderish people also don’t have a very good understanding of what dementia can do to our loved ones and may put more emotion into situations like this than needed.  maybe try showing your mom some youtube videos and stuff about how to interact with people with dementia and what to expect. it’s not your grandmas fault when she acts out but it can be hard to understand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oxdlus/mom_is_constantly_kid_communicating_with_grandma/,Mom is constantly kid communicating with grandma who has dementia

what is the serial threes test (stt) for? how is it used? is it a good indicator?," it's used for all sorts of cognitive awareness. sometimes it will be given to persons with suspected concussions, for example.  but i don't think it's all that valuable a test.  some people have great mathematical awareness, so counting back from 100 by 3s (97, 94, 91, 88..) is a breeze for them, even if they can't remember what they ate for lunch.  others who are perfectly competent otherwise but have trouble with math might find it very challenging.  or if you're fatigued, or if you're running a fever, or stressed... there are a lot of factors that might make counting backwards by 3s (or 7s, as sometimes used) difficult, but you're otherwise very competent in daily tasks and interactions.  i have trouble doing math after or during exercise, for example (counting laps or figuring out average pace is a pita).  so alone, i don't think it's a helpful metric.  i think more often it's one of several tests that help doctors to determine whether a patient has dementia.   there's also that ""person, woman, man, camera, television"" test that assesses a patient's ability to recall a series of words in short-term memory and other tests when used together can help assess a patient's cognitive abilities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/owos6y/serial_threes_test_stt/,[deleted by user]

"my mother was diagnosed with dementia about three months ago. it began with my sister and i wanting to get her off of narcotic pain medication that we suspected was making her memory worse and degrading her personality. once the painkillers were gone we realized it was something else. she's been having intense hallucinations for months now. sometimes it's benign, like a mouse in her house or horses walking by the windows. lately she's been going up and down, and the down periods include some very intense delusions and paranoia. she thinks her husband, who suffers from parkinsons himself and both are home 24/7 most days, is cheating on her. she says that when nobody else is there, he has another woman an whole new family. she says she wants a divorce because he's just trying to steal her money and he keeps putting stuff in her food. these thoughts are very, very abstract, including physically impossible things such as people having the ability to make themselves invisible or hide instantly inside of chairs/couches as soon as someone else comes into the room. she swears that there is pornography all over the house and she sees naked women on her husband's bed. it's not just that these things are really bad in terms of dementia progression, but they're absolutely heartbreaking for me to hear because i know they're causing her severe emotional trauma. she really believes that her husband is cheating on her and has this whole other family. she tells me she just wants to live out the rest of her days (she's only 60) in peace and doesn't want to deal with an unfaithful spouse.my parents divorced when i was just a teenager (36 now) and it was because my father was unhappy in the marriage and while he didn't actually cheat, it was emotional cheating (if that makes sense) with another woman and it really broke my mom's heart. now she's reliving all that horrible stuff again, but this time it's not even really happening. sorry for the rant. i'm just looking for advice from anyone who might have dealt with this kind of thing in the past. how can you help someone trust that you're telling the truth when they see things with their own eyes that tell them differently? she's on aricept and seroquel and we were trying the exelon patch but after just two days she had this really bad spell and now no longer wants to use it. i'm really at my wit's end here and i feel absolutely powerless and hopeless."," she sees naked women on her husband's bed.\^this sums it up almost perfectly.  when my mom lost her marbles, it was a routine of my dad cheating, bugs on the ceiling or walls, ghosts floating down the corridor, somebody in their house with them.  now that i think about it, i wonder if the hallucinations got darker over time or if her ability to filter them diminished because they did get darker as time went on.  i'm sorry you are going thru this, i used the time with my mom as a creative outlet.  i would ask her the names of my half siblings my dad had fathered with his mistress, where they lived, etc.  i took that one so far as to complain that i hadn't received all the birthday cake i deserved as a kid since we didn't go to the half siblings birthdays.  sometimes i would catch the bugs for her, ask what the ghosts were wearing.  it doesn't get easier, unfortunately.  you have to take time for yourself and your sanity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oweamy/how_to_deal_with_a_severely_paranoid_loved_one_lbd/,How to deal with a severely paranoid loved one?

"so, she'll say that she has to go to the bathroom and, some of the times, i'll seat on the toilet and she'll go. other times, she'll just sit there and nothing will come out over something like a period of 5 - 10 minutes. i'll suggest to her to pee, but she doesn't know what to do; she doesn't know what that is. then, i'll stand her up, walk her to and sit her on the bed (with a protective pad), and start positioning her to put on a clean adult diaper, at which point, she'll indicate that she's about to go. most of the time, i manage to get her back into the bathroom and seated on the toilet in time, the other times...anyone else experience this and have suggestions. thank god that doesn't happen for poop."," my dad had dementia and while he was mentally all there , he told me you start off as a baby and you go back to being one. that's what happen to him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/owbsv4/she_pees_but_she_doesnt_know_how_to_pee_if_that/,"She pees but she doesn't know how to pee, if that makes any sense."
"grandma has passed and i am glad for it. i feel free in a way i never have in my life. i feel i can finally move on with my life, do things guilt free. for so long, everything was a compromise. every single extended weekend, every holiday or vacation, i had to weigh my options. would i see her? would i not? if i did not see her, i would have to see her soon to make up for it. i sacrificed so many years to her, and now it’s over. i wish could say i feel bad, that i am mourning her death. my husband says that i have been mourning her, for a long time. this is true. i truly lost my grandma a long time ago. my grandma was never the soft and fluffy sort, but she was mine and we loved each other. my mother (her daughter) died when i was young. we used to say that we had a special relationship, closer than other grandma’s and grandchildren. we used to tell each other that the other was our favorite person. she truly was my best friend at one time. her stubbornness and paranoia caused her to turn away from medical help. i don’t know when she first got her dementia diagnosis. she always kept her medical history private. my honest guess is that she was demented for at least the last 15 years, perhaps even 20. the last 10 years sucked, the last 5 were terrible. this last and final year was nothing short of fucking hell. i’ll never forget the look in her eyes as she lay in her bed of urine and told me that she was going to kill me. what was my offense? i hadn’t properly warned her of a nurses visit and the nurse wanted to change her. she liked to be warned so that she could showtime. the truth is that i had warned her, multiple times, she just forgot. i know that my feelings will change. that i am going through big changes in my life. later today, or tomorrow i might find myself crying in the shower remembering things, feeling the loss. i don’t feel that way now though. and i think that’s ok. i am really happy her suffering is over. she was in constant pain from her tumor. she was confused and afraid all the time. i have read the sentiment over and over in this sub of “i will not go out like that”. and i have to say, i am no different. i have thought about my end of life a lot at this point (like many of us here). i don’t know how i will die, but i will not go out like my grandma. covered in my own piss or shit, threatening my loved ones. getting poa for her was so difficult. she used to be an attorney. i only managed to get poa 4 months ago, and even then she hired an attorney and threatened to sue me. the only reason the suit didn’t happen was because i asked the attorney to get her signature in person in order to release private information. this stopped the suit. she knew that anyone who saw her with her tumor, in her state wouldn’t take her case. covid helped her deceive people. her final days were spent in a board and care facility. putting her there was hands down the most difficult thing i have ever done. i will always be haunted by the primal screams and cries as the paramedics took her. it was harrowing. it was also the right decision. she didn’t get to die in her home like she wanted. but she was clean, medicated and cared for. she didn’t die in pain. i am glad it’s over. i feel good. i am sorry that i do. i just feel so happy to finally be free."," so much of your story is the same as mine. i’m my grandmother’s sole caretaker and she’s gone under my care as a smart independent woman who always had to fight for her independence, and she’s not stopping now. my heart goes out to you. sounds like you did what kept her healthy and cared for until the end. keeping her “happy” wasn’t going to be possible, under any circumstance. it’s so hard, but we do what we have to take care of them. hopefully you’ll remember the best times with her the most. be proud you carried that burden for so long, but don’t feel bad that you’ve been able to release it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ow3u60/death_is_a_gift_to_the_dying/,Death is a gift to the dying.
"we moved my grandma into assisted living on july 5. her entire circle of family, friends, and doctors believed she would thrive in that setting.fast forward a month later and my grandma is doing miserably. her mind seems to have been broken by the move.the first day she moved in, she was aware it was assisted living. the second day, she started believing she was living in a shoe store in the mall.her number one request prior to moving was that she could bring her dog with her. we moved her dog out a week ago and she hasn't even noticed.i was her main caregiver for nearly 4 years and she doesn't recognize me most of the time.she started wandering the halls and getting lost. she made her way downstairs twice and started yelling she was being held hostage in the mall. it's just been bad. very bad.there was a plan in place to get her into a routine this week that included day visits to memory care. she has always thrived on a routine. if she didn't adjust, the community would recommend we move her into memory care.unfortunately, the plan has been derailed by 2 hospital stays. she fell yesterday and was transported to the hospital because she sounded like she was slurring. she was checked out, deemed fine, sent back to the community where she immediately fell again and hit her head and is now under 72 hour watch in the hospital.my dad and i have a meeting with the community today to secure a room in memory care for her to move into as soon as she is discharged from the hospital.my question is: will memory care be appropriate, or are there other options we should be looking into? we just want her to be safe."," memory care all the way. some assisted livings can handle mild dementia, but it doesn’t sound like she’s an appropriate fit for her current environment. i’ve worked in memory care for 4 years, and it sounds like she would greatly benefit from a routine-oriented environment. beware though, strange behaviors like the ones she’s experiencing now are very common the first two months or so when they move to a different environment. so don’t freak out if she isn’t any better when she moves. it takes time and lots of love and patience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ovwp8r/will_memory_care_be_enough_or_are_there_other/,Will Memory Care be enough or are there other options we should look into?

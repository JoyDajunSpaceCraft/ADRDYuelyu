" after talking to many people about this i have to stop and think how my personal and my professional experiences with alzheimer's and dementia have changed my thoughts, my behaviors, and how i react to situations.   i used to have a type-a personality and even though i don't consider myself old, i can still change, you know why? because that is the only constant thing in life change! i read that somewhere. follow the story....

"some of you maybe have seen some of my posts before. my dad is 71 and has been a 'mr. fix it' his entire life, but now after heart disease with quadruple bypass he had over fifteen years ago, barely managed diabetes, kidney stones, and he was finally diagnosed with dementia just a few months ago. he had brain swelling 4 years ago then had a drain put in, he got like 75% better but now he is just absolutely infantile, but absolutely dangerous.his fits became really bad during the beginning of the covid19 pandemic, not being able to leave for frivolous items at the store made him angry. my mother is going through chemo and is high risk for many others reasons but my dad's also high risk so i'd go to the store for their every need. as time went on he would get worse and be verbally abusive upwards of 12 hours. i remember mom and i calling his doctor and she said it doesn't sound like he should even be driving so take the keys and just go to the store for him. one day i notice on the tv a caller id bubble pops up saying it was our local towns police department, my dad answers and thanks to his loud voice i heard him saying ""my daughter is holding me here against my will"". they immediately spoke with me i explained the situation they cops didn't want to be involved, my dad heard that and headed towards the garage to grab a hammer to smash the car window open. i had to get between him and the car and i called 911. thankfully the cop he spoke to showed up so the cop knew what was going on and deescalated the situation.  for the rest of the day he was telling me he was going to go get the gun and blow my head off, my sister's head off, mom's head off, and his own. that's when we had to move the guns into my room.next day he actually took the hammer to the back window, it didn't break. he was threatening to kill himself simply because he wasn't allowed to drive, so off to the hospital he went. they didn't put him in psych they kept him in a regular room because his diabetes was so mismanaged his sugar was like 400. they wanted to send him to a nursing home and we stupidly didn't think that was a good idea due to the infection rate of covid19 at the nursing home they wanted him to go to. thankfully dad wouldn't shut up about his license so the doctor decided it was a good idea to medically revoke it. no one thinks he is safe to drive. he went to the hospital one last time for suicidal and homicidal ideation, he said it infront of a cop so he had to go. after three days he got out and did well for one day. they gave him a s riot of low dose seroquel which only helps sometimes i noticed.so this is how it goes with anything my dad shouldn't or can't do anymore. he makes a huge fuss about it, to the point he will threaten to shoot you.he for some reason shredded his wallet, and tried shredding all important documents so that was all moved to my room as well. but he doesn't comprehend he isn't getting his license back and he obsessed about it all day everyday. harassing you to take him to the dmv(even on sunday).he also has been trying to work on things that aren't even broken, then breaks them in the process and i can't get through to him that he needs to not touch anything if he thinks something needs fixed and come get me. he can't even turn on the tv anymore, he somehow broke the sound and it took me hours to fix. i mean this is how many things we have had to replace lately:-john deere mower-cable hookup on house-wifi-garage door/door openers-flag pole--disengaged various car wires-surround sound-6 remotes-grill-computer desk-smartphone-ipadand he still thinks attempting to fix things...and driving are things he should be doing?he demands i take him to the bank to get his driver's license. he wants me to take him to the hospital to get his debit card.then he constantly is falling victims to scams so we are considering only giving him a prepaid card instead of having a regular debit card.i also have to figure out how to get his name off the vehicles. babysitting him is like an all day everyday job, i just don't know what he will do next but i know he's going to be mean every step of the way.why does dementia have to be so terrible?"," if you don’t already have financial & medical power of attorney over him, that’s a must. he is not capable of making medical decisions. also, take his money now. you can either do prepaid or just give him a little cash. they debit cards for teenager that you can preload with a certain amount. depending on the type of dementia, there should be an organization that might be able to help you find care. for example, the association for frontotemporal lobe degeneration has a search for places in your area that actually treat ftd. their site might be helpful even if he doesn’t have ftd since most facilities that treat ftd treat general dementia & alzheimer’s. they also have help lines for questions. many doctors don’t understand dementia. i would think that nurse who accused you of using the hospital as respite care would fall in that category. at this point, he needs to be medicated until he is calm. considering covid he may need a little more while you wait for care. if you have family or friends that could calmly & safely over power him, that would be much better than the police. they are not often trained to deal with mental illness & that can end violently. you should also call their non-emergency number to tell them not to respond to his calls & so they know he is a possible flight risk. good

"hi all,i am a student at the georgia institute of technology.  because of covid-19 having in-person meetings with those affected by mild cognitive impairment (mci) and other degenerative diseases has become almost impossible.  we are conducting research to assess the needs that can be addressed through potential product design and need information from those affected by degenerative diseases and their families about hardships found with daily tasks.  the study is mostly targeted at people affected by mci, but mci is seen as a precursor to other diseases such as alzheimer's and dementia. if you are affected by or have a loved one or friend affected by any form of degenerative disease please fill out the short survey linked below.  the survey shouldn't take any longer than 5 minutes.  all information will remain confidential and secure throughout this process and your responses will be used to help my team and i create potential products to improve the quality of life for those living with degenerative diseases.  i apologize for the long post and hope you will take the survey.thank you.&amp;#x200b;survey link: ["," actually what happens is the caretakers are still having to go take care of the mci and beyond patients, covid or not, because (at least in some cases) they can’t take care of themselves.  i gave you several suggestions for things that would really help us (mom lives alone, caretakers 4x/week) including timed oven/stove shutoff, burners that work like plugin spindle teapots and won’t work without something in the pot, and a super simple remote that by-passes streaming menus and has a limited number of channels and controls.edit: what do other caretakers want?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hfp08m/survey_for_product_design_to_meet_needs_of_those/,Survey for Product Design to Meet Needs of Those With Degenerative Diseases
"hello all, thanks so much to everyone in this group. i am sending much love to you and your loved ones. i appreciate your honesty and dedication. ultimately, i am looking for next steps since this is all a bit overwhelming. myself (35f) and my brother (30m) are growing increasingly concerned for my mom (66f) and want to make sure she has what she needs during this time. my mom's mom had dementia which i learned recently otherwise i think i would have moved on this much sooner seeing there was a recurring theme here. she lives (1+ hour away) with my brother, his two kids (6 and 10) and their mother. today, he let me know that he can see her declining rapidly and that we need to start moving forward with either meds (not sure if they will help) or possibly looking into a living situation for her to ensure she is safe. she has access to her car and stuff right now which worries us.we haven't received a diagnosis which makes this a little more difficult (imo). i've booked and taken her to appointments for memory tests and to get current on her check-ups (she has had breast cancer twice). my brother took her to her last appointment in february (pre-covid) where she freaked out and declined an mri. i felt like this would have been a huge step to figure out what we needed to do next.  my questions:1. how would you proceed with her appointments if she is refusing mri and with the pandemic situation?2. what sort of documentation do i need to be able to make decisions for her in the future? i am currently authorized on her accounts (bank, medicare, doctor's visits, etc.) and i don't believe she has a will.3. are there things to keep in mind if looking into housing for her to ensure she is safe?thank you for reading this and any insight is appreciated."," she is pretty young for alzheimer’s and the rapid progression is of concern, hence the mri.  even with a power of attorney which is what you need to make medical decisions you would be hard pressed into forcing her into get an mri.  i’m assuming she has had basic labs done, so your best bet is bargaining with her to get the mri because a specialist won’t waste their time without the relevant images.  i wish your family the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hfo75h/66_yo_mom_is_declining_refused_an_mri_4_months/,"66 yo mom is declining, refused an MRI 4 months ago, need advice on what's next"

"found out last week that my dad touched someone and made some very vulgar comments to them. he thought the person was my mom at one point, but then later i'm not sure if he thought it was my mom or not. anyway, i don't live there and mainly go once a day for meds, but i've called the doc to change up that med so that i don't have to be there (when he went in the hospital they put him on insulin for his diabetes, his doc had been trying to get him on it for years because he has never taken care of his diabetes, and since he was already on it, we just left him on it, but since i'm the one that gives him his shot most days, i asked about just adding back a diabetes pill we had stopped. i know his diabetes won't be controlled good, but unless someone is willing to step in and agree to be there for the shot everyday, that's the option i have) he has called me mom several times and i didn't like it before this happened and this only makes it worse. so, i won't be alone with him. anyway i called his doctor and he suggested he go see a geriatric psychiatrist, but i know that won't happen. he will only deny that it happened and truthfully, whenever anyone has called him out on anything for years (10+) he just denies it and says either we are lying or he doesn't remember. i was wondering if we could talk to the psychiatrist without him seeing him, but i realize that probably isn't possible since no-one has poa. any ideas? i thought about trying cbd oil, does anyone know if this helps? but he's on lots of medicines already, so i don't know if that would even work."," same with my dad! he made so many poor choices in life and really never had to atone for them. even before all this, i didn’t like being around him much. honestly, i just keep my distance now and try to not compare my situation to that of someone who had a very sweet loving caring and responsible father, which my father was not. so yeah, those folks would be doing more, calling more, etc...but like i said, he needs to suffer the consequences of the bridges he burned and it’s not our job to build those bridges back!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hfkjsx/disturbing_behavior/,Disturbing Behavior

"hello. thanks in advance for any replies; people’s generosity here is amazing. my mother has alzheimer’s and lives alone in a central, busy area of sydney (i see her twice a week and she gets a couple of visits from friends). she’s been managing at home okay, although i handle almost everything for her. she still goes out to get a coffee everyday and most days to the supermarket to buy food (just fruit, cheese etc) or gets takeaway. otherwise she’s at home. her memory is very poor, both short-term (in a restaurant she’ll ask if we’re going to order literally 1min after we’ve just ordered) and long-term (forgets that her brother has died, where she grew up as a child). her movements are very limited; everything she needs is within 50m of her house—which is basically the supermarket, her doctor, one favourite restaurant. but, she has just started to get confused about where these places are or how to get to them. she also knows where she lives but couldn’t tell you her address. her gerontologist said it’s probably time to put her into a home. his main concerned are getting lost, getting hit by traffic, or falls—mine too! but my mother also seems quite sprightly and ‘aware’. i toured an aged cafe facility this week and the vast majority of people looked severely incapacitated. it would be shocking to her to be amongst them.my question is: when is the right time to put someone in a home? mum can still organise food for herself, do basic shopping with cash—can’t remember how to use a credit card—even some basic reading. but she is increasingly confused. often asks me if she is dreaming or ‘is this really happening’. the last few weeks she has asked several times when i’ve called ‘is this my home? i know i’ve lived here a long while, but is it my home? i can’t remember where my home is’. she’s also starting to experience urinary incontinence. despite all this she’s quite happy and totally unperturbed by her condition. i could certainly organise a carer for a couple of hours a day to take her out to the shops to ensure she doesn’t get lost, actually puts her shopping in the fridge, helps her to be careful walking etc, although i’ve suggested this but she insists she’s completely fine and able to manage (right after asking me if this is a dream!). of course mum would also forget they’ve been 30mins after they visit and is still likely to ‘pop out’ to grab a coffee. ie it’s not guarantee she won’t still get lost, get hit by a car etc. moving her will be quite traumatic i think. but the reality is she will have to go into care at some point and it would be worse to go in with a broken hip. was there a turning point that made you decide to move someone into a home? thanks for any advice or thoughts."," if they offer it where you are, perhaps look at booking her in for a respite stay? or perhaps they have some daytime activities that you could book her for, to see if she likes the kinds of programs they run? it is a very difficult decision to make. my dad is not at the place your mom is, but he is going to be having surgery later this year, and judging by how he was after his first surgery 16 years ago, i expect he will have a marked decline for several months afterwards, if he recovers at all. i am in the process of moving him to just assisted living, if he declines much further he would have to move again, to long term care. hard to judge which is the right move, you know?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hct7w8/when_to_put_into_someone_into_dementia_care/,When to put into someone into dementia care?
"this researcher suggests that marijuana strains high in terpenoids and flavonoids may have the best results in terms of the treatment of alzheimer's disease: [ i would not entirely discount the importance of the ratio of cannabidiols to thc in the treatment of alzheimer's disease, but the importance of the flavonoid and terpenoid levels is likely of much greater significance.  terpenoid and flavonoid compounds are both important antioxidants and anti-inflammatories and can potentially reduce the risk of alzheimer's disease and potentially help treat the disease.", at a facility i worked in there was a resident taking dronabinol (marijuana pills) for appetite stimulation.  he seemed to be the happiest guy there and his dementia progressed very slowly.  he was still alive when i left and had been a resident for 10+ years.edit: he was one of a few residents that could actually manage keeping their own door key and would walk back to his room after meals.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hcsas1/medicinal_marijuana_flavonoids_and_terpenoids/,Medicinal Marijuana: Flavonoids and Terpenoids

"hi! been a lurker for a while and it’s been amazing. it has made me felt like i am not alone in this journey. sorry in advance if this might be long... im just starting out as a caretaker for my grandma. my mom and i (f 20) take care of my grandma (f 70) who has vascular dementia. she had hallucinations before about “suspicious people” who had “pointy eyes” holding rosaries. she thought they were planning something bad about our family so she would keep asking me, my dad or my mom who let them in and why did we allow unknown people into the house. i never know what to answer... but i try to explain that what she thinks is a person is actually a chair, or a lamp, or a vase. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. she got started on seroquel (quetiapine) which has honestly helped significantly to lessen these hallucinations although sometimes she still has them. what am i supposed to respond to her? she would call my mom or i into the room and say there’s someone staring at her or talking to her. we always try to be reassuring and say that no one we don’t know can ever get in the house because we’re like 5 people living here and watching my grandma. next, when she gets mad, she is m a d. she would really throw things (almost threw a glass at my mom), and rush to the person she’s mad at (idk what she would do as i always physically stop her before she gets to them because im afraid of what she can do). sometimes her madness lasts for hours or even the whole day (im amazed at how she remembers this for the whole day). we’d allow her time/space for herself to cool down for hours and get surprised when she returns to the kitchen still mad and kinda heavily handing kitchenware. other time she is mad that we cannot go out (due to covid) so she shouts at our maid asking for the key to let her out. what we’ve been doing, as per advice of her neuro, is to take her to the gate of our village and let the guard explain to her and tell her she cant go out. this works sometimes however she will just forget it within the day and repeat the same thing tomorrow. she is also still smart and can “lie” to the guard about where shes going just to let her out. i’ve tried redirection twice during these “mad” moments and they’ve worked so far... but while we are talking about my redirected topic she would insert a small line like “yeah i was mad about —- earlier because —-“ and i’d just have us go back to topic. bringing me to my third question, how to redirect? i guess it comes easy for talkative people however i really did not have much conversations w my grandma before this so i dont know what to talk about... what do you guys use to redirect? snacks dont work. she has no hobbies. used to love gardening and cooking but has stopped. she just watches tv all day. would also appreciate suggestions on what activities to do :(( havent tried puzzles but i think shes not interested although ill try. lastly, she wakes up multiple times in the middle of the night to urinate (nocturia due to diabetes). sometimes she goes straight to bed, usually walks around for a while opening cabinets and checking if there are people outside the room (none). if its bad, she wakes my mom and i up saying we aren’t home we fell asleep in — (a hospital, a shop, a church, etc) and we have to go home since its night time. my mom and i try to act asleep as much as we can but when she really tries to wake us up we say we are home we are sleeping and i show her the time on my phone. sometimes this works. if not, i invite her into the living room to show her our family pictures to prove this is our house and this has worked 2 out of 2 times i’ve tried. sorry if this was so long... i just need advice as a newbie in handling all of the things that come with this disease. sadly we are grieving them already even though they are alive. thank you in advance for all the advice", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hcmi1w/help_with_hallucinations_aggression_night_time/,"Help with hallucinations, aggression, night time restlessness and how to redirect (Vascular dementia)"

(he’s always compared me to my mother who he despises) one incident i literally got out of her way so she could take her walker down the hallway and she says “god you’re such a bitch” i’m completely shocked it was common respect to let her go by and my father continues to thank her for calling me a bitch and in front of my daughter to. anywho the actual point to this is. i think my father is manipulating her into thinking she has dementia. and using it as a strong use in their legal case trying to get all the money back that the people stole from her. my dad wants her money. i think she signed the stuff over them drunk and didn’t remember. she drank the moment she woke up to the moment she passed out. i think sge did it while she was drunk and after falling and then realizing the stuff is missing. my father stepped in to try and get that money he feels belongs to him back. and he’s using the dementia as a case because it looks bad if she was drunk. and that was on her. so they wouldn’t get the money back. other reasons to back up my theory;- she never ever goes to doctors visits -no hospital papers or medical papers of diagnosis- the only medicine she takes is over the counter and vitamins - the only people my father is ever on the phone with for her is insurance people trying to get the money back (not doctors) - she remembers everything he says to her about me enough to where every time i leave she tries to lock me out- she got a stimulus check and older citizens legally being taken of by others did not qualify for a check so there’s no proof he’s her legal care taker-she never has doctor letters of bills in the mail -she gets a social security check my dad freaks out over. he hates me checking the mail or grabbing their mail with my own to be helpful because he doesn’t want me to see their mail. -while on the phone with the insurance people he makes sure to tell them it’s alzheimer’s that she has not dementia. and that’s why she can’t do it herself. but always tells me it’s dementia. - she’s in very good health. she can take care of herself, she moves around by herself, puts her own clothes on, showers on her own, washes dishes fine. she has no symptoms. my father uses it as a clutch so i have to obey because he’s very controlling of every aspects of my life. and if he feels like i’m my own person, he does things to knock me down so i know i won’t ever be anything without him or ever be better than him. i think he started being so terrible to my boyfriend who is like a super human and very respectful because he was threatened by him because he is everything my father wanted to be man wise. anyway i’m just mainly trying to get some opinions on this subject. do you guys think she has dementia / alzhimers? or can you compare how someone you know that has it acts? i’m curious. because something is very sketchy around here and i just want to get away from them."," just get yourself as far away from these toxic people as humanly possible.  there's nothing here that we can use to guess whether she has dementia, or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/had17z/manipulationlying_about_dementia/,Manipulation&lying about dementia?

"hello all,my father is 71 years old and has been fighting dementia and other such issues from the time he was about 65. he's a vietnam veteran and worked in construction his entire adult life. he retired at 64 and within a year was in two car accidents that clearly happened due to lack of reaction time and slowing mental capacity. the first accident was significant (the front axle of his truck fell out after he clipped the back right of a turning car when he didn't see its left turn signal until the last two seconds). the second he clipped another car in a parking lot while leaving. this is when we stopped letting him drive. brain scans after the accident did not indicate anything out of the ordinary.he really began to decline from 68 on and was diagnosed two years ago with pca (posterior cortical atrophy) which is considered an atypical form of alzheimer's and there is some debate on whether he has parkinson's disease or not. from what i have read, pca mostly affects visuals but anyway, he's clearly in the throes on dementia. he cannot be alone, he's losing his memory, asks the same questions over and over again, struggles with walking, etc. my mother makes too much money apparently to not receive any assistance through the va and he did not plan for his retirement and thus does not have long-term care insurance.my mother is in the midst of starting a divorce so that he can apply for medicaid without draining my mother of all of her assets so that we can put him in a suitable home. we have fought for two years about whether dad needs to be in a home but everyone has come to the conclusion that dad needs professional care full time.my sister and i watch him on our alternating days off. my mother is younger and still works full time. my other sister just had a baby and cannot assist. a family friend who is a professional caregiver takes the day-shifts two-three days a week. my two older half-brothers (one who is well off and the other who is not) live out of state and refuse to get involved despite my pleadings. my mother is a difficult woman to get along with and has too much ""pride"" to continuously ask for their assistance (trust me, i've tried).we do not want to put dad in a home currently if we can avoid it for the short term because of coronavirus. he survived lung tumor surgery at 50 and had 1/3 of a lung removed so that would definitely not go well.he can still feed himself, shower himself, go to the bathroom, brush his teeth, shave, etc. he cannot dress himself without assistance. as i said, he cannot be alone anymore, other than for an hour in the morning when he's waking up. after that, his anxiety is too high and he panics when he's alone for more than 5 to 10 minutes.he does experience sundowners during the day that is sometimes super hard to deal with. my sister has gotten medical marijuana for him and that does help somewhat.also, as i've heard with other dementia patients: the man will not sleep.he will sleep for an hour or two at the start of the night and then gets up every hour after in the night to go to urinate. he had his prostate ""steamed"" a year ago due to frequent urination (he was on flomax before that of course) and his lack of sleep was unbearable to everyone. but it has not helped. he cannot retain urine. he needs to urinate at least 7 or 8 times a day and all night like i said. when he urinates, it's rarely more than 50ml at a time.his neurologist says that it is completely dementia related and anything we try to do with a urologist is useless. melatonin has no effect.we finally had a geriatic doctor give him benzodiazepines a few months ago and it had absolutely no effect on his sleeping habits, he continues to get up every hour of the night.does anyone that has experienced a similar situation know of something that will help my father sleep through the urge to urinate? his lack of sleep is leading to premature deterioration and i refuse to believe that nothing out there will work. i hear that they will not prescribe dementia patients certain sedatives because of fall-risks but we need something to help him until this pandemic has subsided and he can get professional help without immediate risk of his life.anything we can ask the doctor about is greatly appreciated."," was he on the ground in vietnam?i work out with some vietnam vet's and horrific nightmares and parkinson's, due to agent orange, is common for that population.with parkinson's, it affects all our muscles, every one of them. urination/bladder issues are common. i can not empty my bladder (parkinson's bladder issues) but it was much better with parkinson's medication.lack of sleep is another. i was sleeping about three hours a night. hallucinations are out the door due to lack of sleep. turned out a sleep study spotted central apnea and dangerously low oxygen at night. so cpap and medication helped.i was on a benzo for two weeks, i slept but hated feeling so groggy the next day. so we dialed medication around. the best thing i ever found for sleep was thc cbd edible. eight hours of a sound sleep was amazing. my cognitive was so much better, i just did much better with sleep. so i need to keep on a schedule (sleep hygiene) but exercise, eating sensible, and good nights sleep make a huge difference.the lung cancer is also interesting. of four vets i know with parkinson's, three have had lung cancer. something goes haywire with our skin (distinct scent) but also with a specific type of lung cancer. odd coincidence.  doc's went after my lobe, due to nsclc-adenocarcinoma, but couldn't remove it due to complications.please find a movement disorder specialist (neurologist who has additional training) to have him evaluated. if he is a 'nam vet who was on the ground and parkinson's, it's a fast track for full va benefits. if he currently has va, keep pestering the hell out of them! some locations just suck, other locations are fantastic. [a huge one, until it is known what he is dealing with, do not administer haldol. that is routinely given to confused alziemhers patients but could be fatal to those with parkinson's or lewy body dementia.  melatonin: those with parkinson's need 9 to 15 mg! normal dose is 1 to 3. 3mg never worked for me, 5mg was no effect. 15mg is fantastic. the catch is one or two nights every two weeks. if you take it daily your system builds up and is not effective. i use it to help reset my sleep.i'm 10 years younger than your dad. i was first noted with parkinson's in 1983. just doesn't seem possible. i never ran in my life, but with help from friends, i learned to run a few years ago. knees are shot, so sticking with swimming and cycling, but had a blast doing a triathlon. my biggest supporters are my friend in parkinson's boxing classes. my wife just thinks i'm crazy.enjoy every sunrise and espresso is a great way to start the day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/h943f8/looking_for_advice_on_medications_to_ask_a_doctor/,Looking for advice on medications to ask a doctor about for my father who has dementia and refuses to sleep at night.

[this]( study saw great improvements in behavior problems and rigidity in severely demented patients. here they used a small amount of thc along with cbd. we may try this, perhaps it will help more with agitation. i will say that i took him for a walk shortly after his second dose today, and he felt a bit dizzy. it was extremely hot though, i’m not sure if that’s partly why. hopefully the weather will be better tomorrow and we can see if it’s that or if we should reduce the dose. but i got to see my old dad today. my mind is blown, i can’t believe it.

"my mother is 74 years old and was officially diagnosed with vascular dementia 5 years ago but the signs began over 10 years ago.  aside from my sibling, my family chose to ignore my suggestions that something was wrong along with my pleas to seek testing / treatment until they arrived to their own conclusions to do so years later. my soon to be 76 year old father has been her caregiver up to this point with the last year being a full time job each day eliminating any ability to live his live outside of providing her care.  her confusion has increased greatly in the last month with a memory retention of roughly 5 minutes most of the time with frequent delusional.  this change has resulted in her having an extremely aggressive and threatening behavior towards him with no way to calm her during these outbursts.  i do not have the best relationship with her and have spent the better part of the last decade being estranged, but in the past few years i've visited 1-2 times a year at her request until recently when i've made several visits to to her after she began calling me at all hours of the day accusing mistreatment by my father.  i have wholeheartedly confirmed these claims are baseless as my father is the most peaceful and non-confrontational man i've ever met.  my sister has remained in close contact with her during the years of my estrangement and both her and my father have told me the stories of the reality exists compared to the ""front' she puts up when i visit her at the holidays.  i've since observed the worst of her behavior first hand and it seems she is no longer able to put on the facade she would do for a few hours in order to see my wife and i for the holidays.  she suffers from kidney disease among other health issues and i'd estimate her life expectancy is less than 12 months, but i said that a year ago and here she is still today.  at this point we've collectively convinced my father that her needs have exceeded his capabilities in terms of being a suitable and compassionate caregiver at no fault of his own.  he's agreed it is time to place her in the care of those trained specifically to handle her condition while providing the highest level of compassionate care for her which is no longer possible for him to do in their home.  the biggest problems she is having currently is she no longer believes her current home of 47 years is her primary residence and she challenges my father each day as he attempts to give her the medications she has been on for years for her various conditions.  she believes they own multiple properties including the last home they rented prior to buying the house they live in today and accuses my father of drugging her multiple times a day.  she argues that she wants to know when they can ""go home"" on a daily basis, accuses my father of having an affair because she believes the clothes in her closets / dresser are not hers.  i receive daily voicemails from her at all hours which show confusion of which of their ""houses"" they're currently at vs. where she expects them to be instead, and in a span of 60 seconds she'll tell me she's at different properties in her voicemails. we've found a suitable assisted living facility that specializes in memory care residents after a thorough search for one that meets our requirements and resources.  they've accepted her as a resident and we're preparing all of the arrangements possible to ensure her the highest level of comfort at her new home.  she is completely unaware of her pending relocation and any discussion about it with her will end in her becoming verbally and physically aggressive with us.  as many in her position feel, she believes she can live on her own and at this point wants my dad to leave their home due to her disagreements with him as a result of her warped perspective of reality. our current plan is to deliver the furnishings and have her new room fully configured with cable and phone service before she is taken to the facility, which will be done under the guise of being a visit to a new neurologist to get her to comply with taking the trip, a required deception with no alternatives in our mind.  due to the covid-19 restrictions of the facility, we were told a week ago that we're not allowed to go past the front lobby with her, and honestly it is probably a good thing both due to her reactions and for the safety of the current residents due to the pandemic.  i feel horrible that we'll be tricking her into a shocking change in her life and that the ""news"" of this being her new home will be delivered by strangers, but the reality is it will be impossible to get her to accept her fate beforehand and it is unknown whether any attempts to do so will even be retained in her very short memory span at this point. yesterday we were informed by the facility that we're permitted to perform the ""move in"" and spend a few hours with her to help her adjust to the new room.  honestly, nothing good would come from doing this other than causing a large disturbance to the other residents of the facility.  our presence will result in what i consider extreme trauma for her, but at the same time i feel extremely guilty to do this to her without giving the explanation i know she will not accept. she's going to be forced to quarantine in her private room for 14 days upon her arrival with meals being brought to her (which is the current pandemic response to all residents, or was when we spoke a week ago during a remote tour of the facility).  since convincing my father of the need to change her living situation, we've been working with her pcp to get her on a long term medication to treat the outbursts caused by the panic of her internal struggles with reality around her, and we've since requested a short term faster acting medication to use on move in day and for the staff to treat her with until the long term medication cakes effect in 3-5 weeks.  these medications should have been started long ago in my opinion, but my relationship status and my father's reluctance to admit her needs exceed his capabilities prevented this from occurring.  it is unknown if he'll even be able to get her to take the new medication that morning as she currently believes the number of pills presented to her each morning and night exceed what she remembers she should be taking. i was wondering if anyone could provide suggestions regarding the best approach we could possibly take.  i plan to discuss this with the staff of the facility on monday as well, but i appreciate any outside perspective this community can share. i apologize in advance for what will likely be anything from several hours to a day of delay between this posting and my ability to respond to any follow up questions, but please know i will be reading and responding as soon as i am available to do so during this hectic period of time.  i sincerely appreciate your time to read this far and any advice you may be willing to give. thank you,brutus"," to ensure she will take the new medicine you absolutely need her to take on moving day, drop anything that’s not essential.  is she taking any supplements, nsaids,

her.  just get her in the car and go.  no advance notice will actually make it go more smoothly.  i agree it would be better, for her, to hand her over to the staff and leave. you know how she will

"hi, i just found this place. might someone with experience be able to tell me something useful?my mother was diagnosed with early onset dementia. she's in her late 60's. she's getting worse but it seems as though she can't see it.she'll ask me things that are totally out in left field, or things that don't make sense. sometimes she'll combine 2 unrelated things into a question/statement. and she gets this blank expression of confusion on her face where her eyes gloss over with a ""dead"" look like she's not there. the lights are on but nobody's home.she accuses me of intentionally making her feel stupid but i'm not. i try to explain that she's not making sense or that i don't understand what she's asking. this always ends in a big fight when she's around. i can tell that she's struggling or frustrated but i don't know how to help her.when a situation like that occurs, is there a right way to explain i don't understand while diffusing the situation? how is this handled without coming across as aggressive or humiliating?thanks so much. any suggestions are helpful."," can you split them into different questions? so lets say she combines it. can you take part of the question and see if she can clarify what she meant? if she can, answer that question. you may have to go even vaguer and just mention the general theme and see if she can clarify herself more. for us, i think my grandmother's verbal skills made her seem more confused than she was. maybe i'm in denial (even a year post her passing) but sometimes i think back to some of the random stuff she said and i think it was just misplaced in context (ie she was remembering a topic from yesterday) than just not being cognitive of anything. unfortunately, it's going to be hard, especially when the person may not be able to mentally process the diagnosis due to the diagnosis or just not wanting to accept it. give her room to talk. even if she's going off course and see if you can pick up a theme. otherwise, like people said, if you can't figure it out, drop it and just say ""well, we'll figure it out later. how about we (start talking about something else)."" when my grandmother was super persistent, we either had to admit we didn't know what she was talking about or we'd finally get it after a while of back and forth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gw7n6k/is_there_a_correct_way_to_talk_to_my_mother_when/,Is there a correct way to talk to my mother when she's on Jupiter so it won't end in a fight?

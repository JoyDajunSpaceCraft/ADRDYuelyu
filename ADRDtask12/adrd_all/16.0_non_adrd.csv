im 25 years old taking care of my grandmother (82 yr old w/ dementia). i live with my grandmother and 5 nights a week i must be here as she needs 24 he care and wanders at night sometimes. and then i'm also here all 48 hrs straight on my 2 days off of work. we have caregivers come on the weekends to help out me and my sister.  also my mom(her daughter) helps out but she has a drug and gambling problem so its just super sketchy and gives me anxiety lol she has 2 sons too both with gambling problems (and live in vegas)and just total idiots and do not help at all or let alone call her. so it's mostly just me and my sister. my sister has 4 kids tho and also has to work soo i have to be here every night and some of the days. it's soo depressing sometimes being 25 and single and having to always be stuck  at home i love my grandma so much but yeah super lonely sometimes especially with no one really my age to relate with.. i try and vent to friends but no one really gets it which i don't blame them i'm still learning as im going myself.. she sees and hears people sometimes and can also be a little aggressive and dmeanding at times. im usually pretty good at getting her calm but its super mentally and physically exhausting sometimes but yeah just trying to vent mostly thank you for listening!," i know this is a late post, but i too am taking care of my grandmother at 24 years old. i've been taking care of her literally 24/7. i only get a few hours off every few days and that is mainly just to do errands for the house like buying groceries and equipment for cleaning up the place. despite all the work i do around the house while taking care of my grandmother, she consistently says how this house is a mess and her garden looks awful and that everybody living here is just lazy and we should hire a cleaner because nobody here can lift a finger etc etc even though i tell her that i take care of it but i can't have the whole house perfectly spotless every minute of the day. her expectations are almost impossible for me to achieve and to be quite honest, it sometimes really gets to me and i simply break down (i suffer from depression and anxiety). i have put my entire life on hold to take care of my grandmother and while obviously i'd prefer it if i could live my own life freely, i don't find it a burden to take care of my grandmother because i care about her very much. i just wish that she'd understand that i'm doing my absolute best despite everything that's going on. my 25th birthday is coming up soon and i've pretty much lost contact with all my friends so even if i did have the day to myself, i wouldn't really have anybody to spend it with. sorry, didn't mean to rant but i just needed to get this out somewhere because it has just been building up in my head and i can't take it anymore.edit: formatting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/76apu0/any_2030_year_olds_taking_care_of_grandparents/,,Any 20-30 year olds taking care of grandparents?
"my hubby's 92 year old grandma recently fell and broke her hip.because she is amazingly healthy she had surgery, went to rehab and is now at home.  she has always had a bit of dementia(my diagnosis not a doc's) but now is doing some really weird stuff. really weird.anyway, her care has always been a team effort but she's attached to me, i'm like her safe person or something. our kids are good to help out when they can.lately she has become exactly like a child throwing a temper tantrum (i think) because her daughter will soon be homeless and we won't let her live with us.grandma has become extremely demanding.  if you come within her line of site she will call you to do something for her and before you finish she's asking you to do something else and before you really get started on the second request there is another and she would go on and on and on all day.because i'm very straightforward i have no issue telling her i'm not doing that-that i have other things to do and i walk away.  if the requests were important i would take care of them.  but my children and my husband really don't know how to deal with this.  i think they are afraid of hurting her feelings but in private they go on and on about it.  it's annoying to be honest.she tells you she wants cheese in her eggs for breakfast for example.  so i take her that. a minute later i hear her buzzer go off. i ask if she needs anything she tells me no, and then the buzzer goes off again and my husband comes up and she says ""john take my plate i cant eat these eggs they have cheese in them."" and her tone is awful!  he makes her new eggs.  she doesn't eat them. she gives them to the dog when no one is looking. (i've made the rule no one feeds the dog because i'm the one cleaning the gigantic messes) the dog goes all over the kitchen floor.she circles through the kitchen, dining room and living room endlessly(with a walker, lord that scraping noise on the floor is so irritating) talking loudly to the animals- this goes on almost all day and part of the night. if we manage to distract her and she sits down it's only for a few minutes and she's right back at it.  she won't talk to me, she talks at me. like i am her servant.  she is really, really mean to my husband.  it's taking a toll.  i'm getting angry with this. mainly because it seems like she is doing this on purpose, but part of me feels this is dementia.  it just seems like its on purpose because it ramped up after we informed her that her daughter would never live with us.i'm really dying to confront her on it, but i know that would make no difference.  i'm getting to the point where i am not sure i can do this anymore, but if i say that and she goes to a nursing home it will be because i couldn't do it, and i think hubby would resent it.thank you for letting me vent. i am open to any and all ideas on how to deal and not lose my sh*t  ;p"," the first step is getting her diagnosed for her issues. it may be dementia, but there are other issues that this could be linked to as well. from the description, she sounds manic ( sleeping little, needs to constantly be in motion, and other things) look up ""manic episode"".  having her see a mental health professional, along with her primary care physician would be great first steps. they can provide more information on what she is going through, and how you can handle it, or if more rigorous treatment would be a better fit. definitely look up your counties health and human services department and see what programs and assistance they may be able to offer. i wish you luck, and feel free to pm me with location and i can try and find more resources to help you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/74wurh/grannys_broken_hip_and_dementia/,,granny's broken hip and dementia
"i was a natural caregiver all of my life. even as the youngest child, i always tried to care for my mother and older sister. this was my nature with friends and lovers, too. i never had children, but always had a strong maternal instinct. i helped my mother care for my grandmother after a stroke and then dementia, but she was already in assisted living and we had a lot of help. my mother was diagnosed with cancer in the spring of 2014 and by september of 2015, she was gone. i worked full time and cared for her daily. her first round of chemo had to be administered in the hospital. that caused congestive heart failure, but she was given meds to reverse it and continued on with treatment. ladies from her church group organized a weekly schedule to take her for chemo. i would work all day and then go directly to her house to make sure she had whatever she needed and see that she was alright. i went to the pharmacy, the grocery store, and visits to see her oncologist. i did all of her cooking, housework, and helped her with baths. i had to ask about, keep asking, and finally complete a will for her online. my sister helped very little during all of this time. she would help if i asked specifically for her to do something, but she'd do as little as possible and then accuse me of being irrational if i complained. i was so disappointed and frustrated with her throughout that time. my mother was very strong in her faith and believed that she would receive a miracle, so the entire time she was dying, she was making plans for the future, which made talking to her about what i needed to do to get her affairs in order almost unbearable. mother refused to come stay with me. finally, when i could no longer lift her, the pain and symptoms of dying were unmanageable on my own, i had to make the decision to call in hospice. i had to tell her. she accused me of giving up on her. my rational mind knew that the disease and chemo had affected her mentally, too, but it still broke my heart to hear those words and see her eyes. i tried so hard to take care of her, and there's a lot more about the condition of her house that i had to deal with but won't go into it here. it was the hardest time of my life. after she was gone, i was so indescribably lost, and still so busy with probating the will, sending death certificates, making sure her mortgage was paid, cleaning out her house and eventually selling it. i had missed so much work in the last six weeks of her life that i had to go back immediately after her death. i could never stop. i had to keep going, just like before, except i also was grieving and beyond tired. i was exhausted in every sense of the word. i still am. i hadn't really recovered when my sister had to have rectocele surgery in january of 2016, three months after mom's death. the recovery for her was not easy. she stayed with my fiance and me for a couple of weeks to allow me to care for her. i took off a few days when she first came home but then had to go back to work. she would leave our house during the day when i was working and go to her house or do whatever she wanted, then come back for me to wait on her hand and foot during the evenings. i was frustrated with her, but showing her a ton of grace. a couple of months later she was diagnosed with breast cancer. she had a bilateral mastectomy but opted not to endure chemo or radiation because it was caught early, very small, and completely contained and removed. don't get me wrong. i am overwhelmingly grateful to still have my sister and to have her cancer free! her mastectomy july 2016. after the absolute hell of tissue expanders, she opted for the biggest implants her plastic surgeon would allow. incisions never completely closed. areas of thin skin around both incisions worsened rapidly. both were infected and had to be removed and replaced with smaller implants. again, thin skin and infection caused one of them to have to be replaced with an even smaller implant. now, fluid is leaking from the incisions again, which have been sutured and re-sutured to no avail. she will have to have both implants removed and has scheduled another major surgery for breast reconstruction, diep flap, for january. i've been caring for off and on for the last year and she has stayed with us multiple times and seems to enjoy me waiting on her. i never fully recovered from caring for our mom for more than a year. almost ever since she's been gone, i've been caring for my sister in a completely different way, but when will it end? why do i feel like such a heel for not wanting to care for her anymore? she doesn't have a companion or anyone else to do it. before the second set of implants didn't take, she was planning to have cosmetic surgery to have her lady parts revamped, and she sort of seemed to be informing me so that i would need to help her. i just kind of went off and told her that i could not support a decision to have any kind of surgery that wasn't absolutely necessary, and that my well had run dry. she has backed off of that crazy idea, but now another major surgery is scheduled and i just feel depleted of the ability to give care. i'm sure i'm not alone with the guilt and shame. i just don't feel like i'm the same person anymore. i wish everyone well but i don't want to care for anyone, but myself. my heart goes out to all caregivers. i know the amount of time i've endured doesn't hold a candle to many other stories."," presuming she has insurance to pay for the surgeries, would that insurance pay for in-home care? if so, that would reduce the wear and tear on you.

"it's my first time posting here and i'm pretty new to reddit so i'm sorry if i mess it up.i was wondering if anyone here has any advice regarding getting frustrated with a relative with dementia.  i want to preface this with i know that she can't help it at all, and i feel awful for letting this bother me so much, but i'm only human and this is getting to me.i'll give you some context. myself and my mother are the primary carers for my grandmother who has dementia. i have absolutely no problem doing this and love my grandmother to pieces, but several times per day we have the same conversation. she asks how my now ex-husband is? she still has my old wedding photos up. it wasn't the most amicable of divorces and the conversation brings up pretty painful memories.now obviously this doesn't affect the way i care for my grandmother, or the way i feel about her at all. but i come back from hers and end up crying my eyes out.i can't help but feel awful about the fact that i'm letting this get to me and i feel that i'm being so selfish about the whole situation since she honestly can't help it. i was just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to tackle this."," when i was caring for my mother she did this same thing.  i'd already came to peace with the fact that my mom, my real mom, was gone and this person was just the shell of the woman she once was.  when she'd ask about my ex-husband i'd give her a positive but limited answer.... her:  how's bob doing?  me:  he's doing great.  i'd never bring up the fact we were divorced or that he's really a jerk because it's not relevant information in her world and just confused her more.more or less, i'd just give the appropriate/expected answer.  for example: she'd ask me about dead relatives and i'd just say ""i haven't seen them in a while.""  she'd ask if they were ok and i'd say yes.her:  how's your mother and daddy? (lots of times she didn't recognize me).me:  my parents are doing great.her:  have you seen my mom?me:  no i haven't seen her lately.when she'd have lucid moments and recognize me, she'd ask where  daddy (my dad, her husband) was.  i'd always say he was at work.when she was having a bad day she'd get mad and say, ""why do you keep calling me mother?!""  i'd just smile and say, ""because you remind me of her.  i had the best mom in the world.""i'd also use redirection.  i'd redirect her attention to something else to break that thought process.  she's ask me for the 100th time what she's supposed to be doing and i'd say, ""look at that cloud, looks like it might rain.""  i think the key is to join them in their world, their reality.  trying to make them join your world confuses and upsets them.  i used to tell people it was like mental gymnastics....always jumping around and totally exhausting.  don't try to explain things in depth to her.  her mind can only do one thing at a time now, so keep everything simple, like you would with a toddler. it's hard, but don't sweat the small stuff.  pick your battles wisely. don't take her comments and questions personally. i found it easier to call her by her first name and kind of distance myself from the situation.  don't ever feel bad about venting or ranting.  cry when you need to.  laugh a lot (even at inappropriate things).  this is the hardest job in the world.  everything will be ok in the end, but getting to the end is stressful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/6i1twx/dementia_advice_needed/,,Dementia advice needed.
"i am caring for my mom who has dementia. about a year ago it had advanced to the point that she can't live alone anymore. i have a long distance relationship and have not been able to go see my boyfriend in a year. i have two siblings, but neither even calls me to see if i'm doing okay, although they talk to my mom. i spoke to my counselor and she thinks it's reasonable for me to ask to be paid to do this, and my mom can afford it. it would only cost her part of what she gets every month, and would not touch any of her savings.i am also searching on google but would appreciate any help.i want to know if any of you have done that and what to watch out for please.i also think it's reasonable that some of it should be retroactive, but i'm concerned that that would be the biggest sticking point.i lived here for a little while before she started getting to that point so i think that might muddy the water, but i am not sure.my counselor suggested that i make a list of everything that i do for her, but i'm finding that's making me somewhat uncomfortable, but i still want to do it. it seems reasonable.i feel that this is reasonable in every way shape and form, but i am pretty nervous about my sister and brother arguing with me or shutting it down or any number of other things.also, i mentioned some things like this on another forum and felt the responses were overly critical. i don't need any criticism, just some input and hopefully some kindness.as i read this it seems somewhat choppy, but i still need to get some of this done so please excuse my lack of writing skills today.thank you in advance.edit: yikes, this is longer than i realized.tl,dr: i think it's reasonable for me to get paid for caregiving and i would like to know how to best present it and defend it to my siblings.", one of my coworkers did something like this before and was getting paid for being the caregiver through medicaid.or check with department of elder affairs to do a cares assessment to determine if she needs a higher level of care and she might qualify for medicaid waiver programs for a long term care facility.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/68bj9b/trying_to_get_paid_for_this/,,Trying to get paid for this

"hello,a few years ago my dad became very ill and had to go to the hospital. while in the hospital it was determined that he was no longer capable of living on his own primarily because of his mobility issues. before he was showing signs of memory loss, but while in the hospital, his memory deteriorated further. naturally, it was decided that my father would move in with us. at my lawyers advice we had my dad sign a poa before moving in with us. this became a major issue. we had forgotten that we had taken my dad to make a poa over 20 years ago, which named me and my brother joint poas. in addition, we were unaware that my brother had taken my dad to sign a new poa that made us joint poas and also drafted a new will that was to my brothers families advantage, in secret. me and my brother have had a toxic relationship for years. when my brother found out about the change in the poa he was understandably upset. he demanded that we retract the most recent poa and honor the poa that he had taken my dad to make in 2009. at the same time he started trying to convince my father that his finances were under threat and that i was taking advantage of him, and that he would take him to make a new poa.several months later we sold my father's house, as it was no use to him anymore, and shortly after my brother served us with a court application alleging that my father lacked the mental capacity to sign the new poa while in the hospital and alleged that me and my family were siphoning money from my father's account. the legal proceedings dragged on for more than a year. during this time my father was assessed and informally deemed incompetent. we passed the accounts and my brother objected to virtually every disbursement and tried to argue that my father's finances were being handled incompetently. he demanded that we reimburse my dad most of the money. in addition, he argued that we should not be compensated for managing his property or for the personal care we provide, on the basis that his previous poa explicitly stated that the poa would not be compensated. finally we went to mediation and a settlement was reached. essentially, he acknowledged the legitimacy of the most recent poa. he agreed on a management plan that was based on how we had been spending my dad's money since he had moved in with us. he agreed that the compensation we had been taking for personal care was reasonable. we did not have to reimburse my father for any of his disbursements. we agreed that we would send him the accounting every month and receipts upon request. although he accepted the most recent poa, there was a caveat. we agreed not to take compensation for managing my dad's property for the period within the passing of accounts, but were paid out a similar figure from my dad's estate to cover our legal fees as part of the settlement, anyways. the partial minutes explicitly state that my brother reserves the right to challenge us if we try to claim compensation for management of property in the future.we're getting ready to pass accounts again and are wondering how successful we would be if we were challenged by my brother. he's going to claim that the last poa stated that no one is to receive compensation, therefore we shouldn't. our thinking is that (1) in his own affidavit he stated that my dad started showing signs of dementia almost a year before that poa was signed and (2) the previous poa had no such provisions and it doesn't seem in my father's character to not want to compensate us.  (3) that stipulation seems incredibly out of character for my father. he has always compensated us for any help we've provided. it's just the way he is. (4) throughout the legal proceedings my father maintained that he strongly he thought it was fair compensate us to his lawyer on numerous occasions. my father's lawyer made this clear to the other lawyers and mediators during the proceedings. and (5) even if my father didn't want to compensate us, managing his property is a huge undertaking and we feel it isn't reasonable to expect anyone to do it for free.  this is what hull and hull says. again, my question is realistically how successful we would be if we were challenged by my brother?"," this is the sort of question that is above the paygrade of free advice from internet strangers. go see your own lawyer - not your father's, and at a different firm - for a consultation.

"so, as the title text says, my dad has suddenly had to move in with us, and i'm absolutely overwhelmed. the story is as such: a couple of weeks ago i got a call from the police. apparently my dad, who lives alone 3 hours away since my step mom died, had called the police to complain about people having a sit in on the front lawn, and having broken into his house. the cops arrived, and my dad is talking to bushes and there's no one there. he's been bothering the neighbors about it too, who saw nothing. the police said they couldn't admit him to the er, as his vitals were good, but he refused to go back into the house, and then drove to the local gas station and started having a fight with an invisible person in his car, and the police were called again, and so i drove up the 3 hours, and took him all the way back home with me, where after a good deal of sleep and some discussion about the possibility of hallucinations (he was an er nurse and understands the concept very well), he calmed down and seemed to go back to himself, though i could notice a considerable disruption in his normal cognitive abilities. we took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway. so they set us up with an outpatient appointment the following week, and we set dad up in the guest bedroom. we've since had the outpatient appointment, and the psychiatrist basically said that he thought dad had a mini stroke, and it caused an onset of dementia, and he didn't think dad should live by himself anymore based on how he answered the questions. so now dad is moving in with me.first off, dad seems able to take care of himself in many ways, like hygiene and self feeding, but has issues with more complicated aspects of living. he can't really work the tv (he could if it was just turn it on and change channels, but the whole smart tv thing and multiple remotes has him stumped constantly, even with a regular cable box and two remotes). he also has a hard time working the keurig, with its 3 buttons, and can't manage his dumbed down little flip phone, accidentally deleting phone numbers, etc. this is a man who used to work regularly in excel for a clinical trial management service, and the man who introduced me to the internet, set up a computer in our house when dos was the os, and had an atari 2600 from release, so he wasn't a luddite, but now he can't use a computer to save his life. it's heartbreaking to see him futz with his seatbelt for 3 minutes, or with the ac knobs, or the tv remote we got him which only has about 6 buttons, but i used to work in mental health, and patient care isn't something i have a problem with.my problem is this: how do i begin dealing with all of his stuff? he has a whole three bedroom two bath house filled with 40 years of stuff. he has two cars and a truck, a rental house, and two empty parcels of land, all 3 hours away from us. and, i found out after going up there and going through all of his stuff, that he got depressed after my step mother died and hadn't dealt with any bills in almost a year, and his taxes and god knows what else were all kinds of screwed. the first thing i did was get all of his bills paid up, and i'm trying to deal with his finances, but i've found so much stuff i'm out of my depth on, like that he never made any claims on my stepmother's life insurance or anything, and he gets money through investments but he can't really tell me how that works tax wise or anything.here's where i am right now:- i've got his bills paid for april, and i'm working on may's. i have years worth of paperwork to go through and i'm trying to sort through it a little at a time.- we went up this past weekend and i had him label everything he wanted to bring down, and everything he wanted to keep or put in storage.- i put one car in the shop because he just left it in the garage for a year, and we got a new battery in the truck, and drove it back down to our house. the other car is so old i don't think it'll make the trip.- i got his neighbor to cut his grass for the time being, after getting dad's permission to tell him what's going on.- the current tenant of his rental house wants to buy, so i guess i need to figure out how to sell a house without a realtor, which i've never done before.- i've gotten the name of an estate sales agency, to maybe go through and sell all dad's other stuff, which is the only thing i can think to do to deal with all the stuff we can't keep, and i've gotten the name of a junk remover for whatever is left.- dad's house will bare minimum need a major landscaping overhaul (he's let his land grow up significantly, and there are trees down in the yard), and possibly a new roof and definitely new flooring if we're going to sell the house. he owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless. i don't know.- i've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and i'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if i'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.- i let dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now i'm managing them for him.the whole time this is going on, all i can think is am i doing the right thing? how is this going to affect my life? how is this going to affect his life? am i missing something? and i'm constantly second guessing myself and my actions and whether i'm doing the right thing at the right time.i have no resources. my wife is still employed, thank the gods, but i've been laid off due to the virus, which is the silver lining to all of this because i'm getting unemployment with the extra money for the time being while i use my time to help my father, but eventually that's going to run out or i'm going to have to get a job to maintain our home and pay for him until we can get his finances figured out.so, i apologize for the long rant, but i guess what this post is about, is that i need help and though i know more than some i've never dealt with this and i feel like i'm drowning in stress, i don't know if i've missed anything important, and i don't know what resources might be at hand for this.and hell, in the midst of all of this, how do i actually care for my dad!? i'm managing his meds for him, and making sure he gets food, of course, but i'm at a complete loss for how to occupy his time, and help his life be worth living, especially in the midst of this virus stuff.and, selfishly, i need to figure out how i make sure that my dad's life doesn't consume my own? i know my life is derailed currently, and there is now a new normal, but what's on track for me going to look like going forward, etc.any advice, or resources, or anything at all is helpful at this point."," \- get power of attorney so you can deal with his finances, his property and other matters. his wife's insurance money will come in handy once that gets settled. \- put his name in for an assisted living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. my mother's place has assisted living and memory care in the same residence, just different floors. it seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. \- if he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. before my stepdad even started hallucinating, he would get lost and sometimes even ended up in the ditch. finally his kids started ""borrowing"" his car for weeks at a time until he was diagnosed with lewy body dementia and was told not to drive. \- check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. many places have senior's social workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a seniors' center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. \- it sounds like you are doing all you can so far. it will be challenging but the hardest part  is now when things are in such a mess. he is lucky to have you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/ggvuc4/dad_71_coming_to_live_with_my_wife_and_i_after_a/,,"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia.

"my 72 year old mother has been forgetful (getting her dates wrong for major events like weddings, misplacing things, forgetting to pay bills) as long as she's been my mom, but her memory has been steadily getting worse over the last few years and she is now acting weird in other ways.she loses her train of thought mid sentence and just starts stating facts that are sort of related to the thing we were talking about. she asks me the same questions repeatedly, although this might be loneliness and her trying to keep me on the phone. she makes really weird decisions and gets super defensive when you ask about them. this year she started taking out large sums of cash and carrying it around on her. she couldn't have a bag on her at work, so she'd stuff bills in her pants pockets and every time she stuck her hands in her pockets and pulled them out she'd drop money. she was dropping multiple $20 bills every week. i know there must be a reason- she's forgetting her pin or losing her wallet or something, but she gets angry and refuses to speak to me if i push the subject.she has short bursts of very petulant, childlike behavior and paranoia. they usually only last a few minutes, but they are very different from her normal behavior. this is what concerns me the most, she has a different look in her eyes, like she's confused and frightened.this week she left a tap running for hours and flooded her bathroom.i've looked up early dementia signs online, but most of them assume the parent previously had the ability to perform essential self care tasks, which my mother never has. she lost most of her teeth by 40 because she wouldn't brush them or go to the dentist. she has never been able to feed herself regularly, pay her bills often enough to not have services cut off, etc. she has always been bad at looking after herself, which makes it really hard for me to tell if this is cognitive decline or just her norm + aging. my sister has mentioned a few moments when she seemed ""off"" to her, but doesn't believe there is anything majorly wrong. she was working full time up until the pandemic. she seemed to be performing fine at work, her coworkers speak highly of her abilities when i interact with them.i feel like i should suggest she see a doctor to be assessed, but it may cause her to become angry and secretive. she would rather lie than have people worry about her. she once purchased a second kindle because i asked to borrow her kindle and she didn't want to tell me she didn't know where it was. if this is fairly normal for a 72 year old and she's probably going to be stable at this level of functioning for a while i don't want to push her and cut off any truthful communication. if this is actually concerning behavior i'd like to talk to my sister about  how we should approach it with my mom."," you should definitely not ignore this. make an appointment with her primary to discuss what you are seeing and what she is experiencing. if they discount what you have noticed it is time to switch doctors and find someone who has a better understanding of dementia. in the meantime, contact your local chapter of the alzheimer's association for guidance. you do not need a diagnosis to get help. they will be able to provide a lot of guidance and education for you as you figure out what is going on. they also have lots of support groups for caregivers and for those with dementia or alzheimer's. find your local chapter here:  [ hope that helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gf0bam/how_worried_should_i_be/,,How worried should I be?
"i’m not sure if this is a rant or a call for advice. basically my grandfather and his wife had a workplace affair in the 60s, and one day decided to walk out on their spouses and children to be together. i say “walk out on” but she left, while he kicked my grandmother and their four children out of their home with a few days notice. they’ve lived a purposefully isolated and reclusive life ever since. my mother and i are the only ones who ever came around and she was very clear that she would rather we didn’t, and only put up with us because he made her. i hadn’t been around in a couple years due to distance, but recently moved a bit closer (2 hour drive). my grandfather passed away last week. apparently, she’s been living with dementia for a few years. she should have been placed in an assisted care home long ago as she cannot even be left alone, let alone care for herself in any capacity. we found out she hadn’t showered or changed her clothes in 3 months. she won’t eat unless you put a cooked meal in front of her. most of her day is spent sitting at their small kitchen table, and going in the bathroom every 10 minutes to smoke. mom and i are taking turns staying with her and everyone involved hates it. mom is power of attorney/proxy, and i am the alternate. her children made it clear they want nothing to do with the situation or to help in any way. she has about a 10 minute “reset” time as we’ve been calling it. following the doctors advice we initially planned to tell her he died once, and then remain vague. but she’s so mean (was when she didn’t have dementia) and keeps telling us to leave her alone. my mom lost her patience and started telling her over and over that he died. now i can’t go back to the vague answers because while she can’t quite remember, she’s been told enough that she has a vague idea (saying things like “no...something else happened”) and getting combative until we tell her. she’s convinced that we just need to leave and that she can handle their house, their 7 cats, and her own care by herself. it’s clear that she can’t because she doesn’t even think to feed the cats or do anything for herself. we’ve been in contact with a few nursing homes and one seemed like they’d take her. we even had an appointment on monday where we took her there and they talked and they said they’d give us a decision in 24-48 hours but now they’ve just been ghosting us even though they have 12 open rooms. we’re in a pretty rural area so that was pretty much our only nearby option. my mom is now under the impression that at the first sign that somethings wrong with her (she’s been complaining of a pain in her head for a few days) that she’s going to take her to the hospital, where we can hopefully get adult protective services involved since we also can’t get them on the phone. it’s making us physically sick to be in that house since they both smoked inside of it for half a century. my mom has to do the bulk of staying there since i’m still working and like i said, live two hours away. my mom and i are both so exhausted from caring for this woman that always hated us and to be honest we never cared for her much either, that i’m worried for my mom’s sanity and my own safety. i’m just so exhausted and i drive all day for work on top of the drive there all the time (on top of my job which is very high stakes and stressful because of covid-19) that i feel like i’m constantly on the edge of falling asleep or passing out. i know my mom isn’t the type to do anything rash but if you make someone suffer physically, put them on the end of verbal abuse from their “stepmom” 24/7 all while trying to process the death of a parent, i’m worried she will do something in the spur of the moment. we’re both just so angry with the situation, that he put this on us, and that it’s all happening during a pandemic which makes everything 100x harder. we don’t even have death certificates yet to access his bank account so everything for her and his cats has been coming from us, and we both struggle to support ourselves too.", wow that's really hard.  you and your mom are good souls for taking care of her despite the fact that i kind of feel like she's not really your problem. have you considered getting any county or state agencies involved since her family doesn't really seem to want to take care of her?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gbhwca/grandfather_passed_his_wife_has_dementia_and/,,"Grandfather passed, his wife has dementia and hated us when she didn’t.

"apologies for posting so much, things are crapping out here. i will be calling his doc tomorrow and if she wont callback i guess ill have a caretaker out for a few hours. and cal social services. my dad (93) stroke dementia and parkinsons, tied to a walker on his good days and lucky to get around on his bad days hes also a narcissist so everything he says or does is god.  he has horrible balance issues. getting up from his chair to his walker is often an ordeal that involves struggling to get up and falling back into his chair. ive picked him up off the floor a few times and this morning he was callig cause he was weak and couldnt use his walker. tbh i never quite know if hes telling me the truth or hes running a game. even at his age and condition he still tries to manipulate.there is no one else to take care of him and he cant do anything. all i ask is he do things safely. but he doesnt use proper judgement. i see hime struggling to stand and ffer a hand and he gets belligerant. tonight he was hanging between his chair and walker, barely balancing and looked stuck, so i genty placed my hand on his back and he made it, then was pissed. i explained to him hos this is done and tgat if he had a nurse or caretaker here thgey would chew his ass for being unsafe and then give him a hand. he just spits venom. he was calling for help this morning but then tonight its 'i dont fucking need your help'. on the one hand i want to just say 'ok, fuck you, if you fall you fall'. if that happens im not waiting in him, he'll have to hire in someone. aight, sorry, but am i just being a idiot wanting to help him since he always complains of weakness and has horrible balance issues?  what i see when he tries to get up is he sticks his butt way back and that pulls his center of gravity back. ive told him that but of course he knows all. should i just let him alone and when hes trying to get up say goodnight and walk away?at tgis point i will try and talk to his doctor and if that fails social services or a carenurse. as far as i know fro someone like him he should not be allowed to do what hes doing but im damn tired of the belligerence and idiocy. he expects that he can jut tell me whatever and ill just go...huh? gosh ok well i guess i let you fall then, have fun.tbh im alone in this, will be searching for a caregiver supoort group, probaby online, cause at this point it feels like im lsoing the fight to mr knowitall.  i moved back to go back to school. lost my job and decided to study for a career change. mom passed and dads been going steadily downhill. he has 2-3 bad days then hopefully 5-7 good days. these last two down cycles were hell. if it gets any worse then i cant  take care of him. but despite all the crap it has been beneficial in that i do the chores and i get a place to stay and food. but here lately i can get anything done and it seems like im upset every night. hes starting to gaslight and thats not acceptable. unfortuantely i wouldnt find a jhob in this economy so i think im fucked. but am i correct to try and keep him safe or should i just let him struggle and walk away."," my papaw had the exact same issues you describe with standing, especially when getting out of his recliner. i got him a set of grab bars with handles that he could use to push himself up easier. (they are on amazon, under able life universal stand assist.) all of the physical therapists with home health who came to see him were impressed; none of them had ever seen anything like it and most asked me what they were called and where i got them so they could tell their other patients. they might be worth looking into for your dad.my grandmother is the narcissist in our family, and i am fairly sure she has dementia now too, but it is so hard to tell what is dementia and what is her usual  personality. she complains over literally everything; even if she loves something to begin with, she will complain later. (for example, i bought her new cordless phones a few months ago, and every time i’d ask if she liked them she would say yes, they were perfect. two nights ago she sends me a text asking if i still have her old phones because she doesn’t care for these.)it’s really hard not to let her attitude get to me, but i try to remind myself that she is making a choice to be miserable, but i don’t have to let her make me miserable too. if she’s in a mood i don’t indulge it, i carry on as normal and leave her alone as soon as i can. one way you might be able to tell what is dementia vs. narcissism with your dad would be to have someone else come in to help him. sometimes dementia patients are difficult with family but not with strangers, and will be perfect angels when a nurse tells them what to do. if your dad is hateful to strangers too, well, at least then you know that it’s nothing personal towards you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g9he21/when_to_know_they_need_help/,,when to know they need help
"hello world of aging parents. i have a challenge to overcome. i’ve been taking care of my mother. my husband and i have lived with her (in tight quarters) for over a year now. she’s on a dementia medication which improved her condition greatly. she has refused to take any medications recently, so she’s no longer on her anxiety/mood medication. the only diagnosis i ever heard for her, psychologically speaking, is borderline personality disorder, which appears to fit.my feelings oscillate wildly. often i think it’s not so bad. and then i go to places where i think the plan to move and leave her with an aid (to make sure she’s covered, needs wise) is all she deserves. she can be incredibly mean and also incredibly supportive and that’s her struggle. but i’ve felt that she let the worst parts of her get the better of herself. so i’m having a hard time biting the bullet and signing off for a lawyer to get her on medicaid and get her at-home care and disconnecting myself from the responsibility. my mom is against having her finances interrupted and having ‘a stranger’ help her with anything. this would mean both of those things. i also signed on to work out of state at the end of the summer, and my husband and i agreed that we should take some time to ourselves out there to get a foothold before having her come out, around 6 months of time. that means it is imperative to get that care set up for her. so there’s really “no option”.questions, comments, words of constructive criticism and/or support are all welcome."," the adjustment will be hard, but it sounds like it is what is best for all involved. reassure her that you are not disappearing forever, but want to go back to enjoying the role of daughter. it will be a good thing for all of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g4w5oj/support_needed_afraid_to_sign_papers_send_check/,,"Support Needed: Afraid to sign papers, send check for retainer to get mom community care"

"probably just grasping straws and sinking but im wonderingmy dad 93...stroke 2 years ago, dementis mild and parkinsons. he has tremors in his arms and hands and at times head and body upper. he uses a walker and has been steadily degrading over the past 2 years. his biggest issues are tied together, sleep and strength. he has a sleep med and a parkinsons med and an alzheimers med it goes in cycles usually and varies in severity and i cant help wondering if theres anything that can set it off.  usually theres a down day or three followed by a string of good daysm maybe a week or so. but i think its getting worse. last sunday/monday he was so weak he couldnt get out of bed or get around. all tests at the docs were ok. starting tuesday he rapidly recovered and was stronger than ive seen him in a long time. he even walked without his walker for two days. but last night he didnt sleep and today hes been very weak. he did nap some this afternoon and this evening but it doesnt seem to help. his sleep med im sorry i dont remember the name but his parkinsons one is pramipexole (sp?). what struck me is that he was strong all wekk and wasnt taking his pramipexole, he started that again last night and didnt sleep and is very weak.  probably no correlation but any chnace reasonable that the pramipexole  is messing with his sleep or making him weak? i know hes had same issue for longer than hes had the drug but odd to me he cant tell a difference when hes not taking it then he starts again and the floor drops out. sincerely hoping he can come back cause that too weak to get out of bed and get around may see him go into a home. neither of us want that",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fv7bx6/med_conflict/,,Med Conflict

"my mother will be 68 in july.  i'm 30 and an only child.  my father is 76 with alzheimers and starting to slow down severely.   ever since she married my father she never really had to pay bills.  she always had an obsession/addiction with spending money and shopping since i can remember.  she has been on social security for the last 6 or 7 years.&amp;#x200b;i have another post describing my backstory in more detail, but the main issue is that she is absolutely obsessed and fixated on attempting to get a 'loan' by any means necessary.  my parents still have a mortgage of around 190k on their home, which is in somewhat rough shape, and probably $50-150k in credit card debt for the two of them combined.   last year she started doing gift card scams and basically throwing her social security check away every other month to these scammers.  she continued on through the rest of the year and even convinced (and one month straight up took money from him) my father to give him money so she could get her big payday, totaling to $4300 (in 3 months time) and they missed 3 mortgage payments.  i feel awful for my parents because these people now call their home phone all day, every day, according to my elderly father with dementia; he is very fed up with it.  and they call mom's cell phone non stop it seems like.  everytime i am with her these people are calling her.&amp;#x200b;i have control of my father's ss benefits now ($\~1600), they go to my bank account and i have control, and we can slowly catch up on the mortgage ($1050).  but the problem is that she is getting \~$800 a month that she has been throwing away.  in january she gave it all away, in february the scammers cashed a check for around 500 and she closed her account with that bank and got $200 out and then immediately bought a gift card, and this past march she sent her whole check away in a money order to some guy.&amp;#x200b;i have durable power of attorney and healthcare power of attorney for both parents. i have sent my healthcare poa to her doctor and now have the ability to talk to him about her medical stuff, but when i called last week the nurse wouldn't let me speak directly to him and the only option i had was to make an appointment.  i think this week i'm going to call back to the hospital where he doctor works and just tell the nurse everything i was hoping to tell the doctor over the phone in hopes they understand how dire the situation is.  because i have asked my mom the past few days if she will go with me to talk to her doctor and she is very hesitant because i think she knows where that path will lead.    she also wanted me to put the payment for her timeshare \[that i'm not even sure she will be able to go to\] on my credit card ($900) and at one point told me to 'just do it' and i knew i had to put my foot down, so i didn't pay it.  i told her i would pay it if she signed over her ss benefits but she refused.&amp;#x200b;what the fuck can i do?   i'm almost certain she has some form of mental regression or mental cognition issues, i don't know what to call it really.  she has been on ambien for at least 10 years and i think that has caused some issues.  she has a terrible memory and often tries to tell me that things i know are true, aren't (like her taking $4300 from my dad for her scams).&amp;#x200b;the only other option i know of is contacting adult protective services (social services) and hoping they create a case for her.  she told me about 2 weeks ago that someone had already contacted her from social services because someone else had called in about her anonymously but i don't know if that gained any traction.  if you met her you wouldn't think she is that bad but she is 110% obsessed with these scams and it is making my life so much more stressful and difficult.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;i am covering their electric bill, groceries, car insurance, health insurance, and other things here and there for my parents, with a high interest credit card.  i know this is a terrible choice financially, and the interest is starting to kick my ass, but its my only option unless i go no contact and go back to social security and tell them i can no longer manage my father's funds.&amp;#x200b;i may also have to take out another loan to purchase them a new car at some point. they both drive older cars and i'm not sure how much longer they will last.  my mom drives about 25 minutes to take care of her elderly mother (98) once a week for two nights).&amp;#x200b;lastly, they always talk about how they need to 'sell this house' and pay off the mortgage to then move and have some money to work with, but the house is 4k square feet, needs about $50k in repairs roughly, and they can't even get it clean enough to a point to have it shown. they're home almost every day but both so depressed i think they never get anything done. the house is pretty disgusting by most peoples standards.&amp;#x200b;can i go to a lawyer and try to have her declared as incompetent or something? i was reading an article earlier and it somewhat confusing about these things.  because you have declarations of 'capacity' coming from the healthcare side, but on the legal side you have 'incompetence'.

"my parents are both their early 70’s.  my mom has early stage dementia.  both are relatively healthy physically.  because of what’s going on, i’ve severely limited my visits.  before this i visited with my mom several times a week.  i call daily, or sometimes several times a day.  i bring over things that they need so they don’t have to go out in public too much.  i have two older sisters.  they hardly ever call.  they don’t help at all.  this isn’t new to the situation, but because of the situation the lack of communication for my mom has made my mom an emotional wreck who calls me crying that she wished she had just died last summer (she had a small stroke and spent 17 days in the hospital) and asking why they let her live, that she feels useless and that no one loves her, etc.  i asked my one sister if she could call mom once a week and let her know she is ok.  my sister works in a hospital, so my mom is sick with worry.  my sister lashed out at me and told me that with all the pressure she is under she doesn’t need a guilt trip too.  she got nasty, so i ended the conversation.  i called my other sister and asked if she could call mom or at least answer the phone when mom calls or respond to a message and i got a load of excuses and false promises.  my mom was a good mom to us, so there isn’t any reason to be like this.  no bad family history or anything like that.  i will say that my moms filter has dissolved quite a bit and she has a tendency to “say what she’s thinking” a lot.  i’ve learned to basically ignore that or change the subject.  but it’s the dementia talking.  last week my mom called to wish my nephew a happy birthday, but she was a day early.  she got her dates mixed up.  my sister said “it’s not his birthday, it’s tomorrow” and my mom said “oh, i’m sorry, i’ve got my dates mixed up.  i’m having a hard time remembering what day it is” and asked to wish him a happy early birthday.  my sister said “i’m done with this conversation” and hung the phone up on her.  my mom called me sobbing,  my dad confirmed this conversation.  i’m taking all the emotional load here, and soon it will be a lot more, as you don’t recover from growing old.  i need help, i need someone to occasionally tap in so i can tap out.  i can’t just ignore my mom as i wouldn’t do that to her.  how do i get my sisters to help?  i know some of you will do the “not my job to facilitate a relationship”.  i’m not trying to, i want them to take their share of the care of our aging parents."," i'm in the same boat. i have a sister and two brothers who do nothing to help. my dad (88) moved in with my husband and i last year (hubby is awesome for this imo). my sister lives about 5 hours away and is currently battling lung cancer so i give her a pass, although she could call occasionally. oldest brother is a jerk. enough said about that. other brother lives an hour away but is so self-absorbed he can't be bothered. it's like my siblings think ""dad is with deb now so we can get back to life"". thankfully i don't work outside my home. the downside is the reason i don't work...i have had anxiety and depression my entire adult life and was forced to retire 15 years ago due to it.why don't my siblings understand? why don't yours? i don't know. i wish i had help but i'm not going to beg. it's just a shame for all of us who have to do this with no help. especially from people who should help. i definitely feel you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fsp90i/siblings_that_wont_help_how_do_i_handle_this/,,"Siblings that won’t help, how do I handle this?"

"i know ive posted more than my share but one more, because things are strange. i know its probably because i dont understand. from my perspective...i havent been living near any close relative who passed away. then a couple years after i moved back my mom passed. she was 93 and always very energetoc until the two weeks before she went. i think she somehow knew her time was short. the last week she napped all afternoon every afternoon. i didnt see any of the signs. my dad is 93, had a stroke a few years ago and started going downhill which has increased . he has parkinsons and dementia and is a narcissist. which i mention because it means he thinks he knows everything and better than anyone, even the doctors. thats part of why he is where he is. he walks now with a walker on good days and a wheelchair now on bad days. he insists on being over his own meds and gets offended if i try and help with anything. that said i have caught it a few times before he has mistook his meds. we made a trip to his doc a couple weeks ago and the walk to the garage had him gasping for air. halfway down the hallway to the office he had to sit on his walker and rest, i pushed him the rest of the way, all very abnormal for him. normally he sleeps til 11ish, watches tv all afternoon and crashes after the 10pm news. there was one day, maybe friday that he tooks a bunch of his meds rt before dinner on an all but empty stomach. messed him up bad. his tremors were the worst id seen em and he was very weak. the next day he was normal again and told me what hed done. he wont be doing that again. sunday and monday he was so weak he couldnt roll over or get out of bed. good that we had his wheelchair. he also didnt have bladder control. and he had pronounced brainfog. no fever or throwing up .  i talked to the er doctor and she set up a urinalysis for next day at his docs. took me 3 hours to get a urine sample from him and then got him a rush appt, urine and blood no issues, we then did a lung xray and it was clean. tuesday he was better. i walked thru his morning and evening routines and he was ok. buthes sleeping almost all day. sun-wed only awake for meals and get ready for bed. sun/mon he also either had a couple very lucid dreams or hes startin g to hallucinate. this morning he swears he was in the bathroom and he got a call from a house maintenance company he uses. no voicemail so i have no clue how he heard anything. tues and wed progressively stronger. today stayed awake all afternoon, i think, and walked across the house on his own, went and sat on the porch. is now at 8:30 snoozing. bad thing is i have no idea if hes taken any meds.  and standing rule since he does have trouble sleeping is dont wake him up. i dont understand why sun/mon he took a deepdive on his health and his brain went loopy, tests were all good. a few days later he was the strongest ive seen him in a long time. i know life/health is all ups and downs but the swing is bizarre. im afraid of another downswing where hes incapable . and im afraid that since they found nothing else that his heart is wearing out, im afraid that since hes is suddenly sleeping so much he is about to pass. i went thru all this with his doc but since his tests were all ok she is satisfied.one other question....my dad has had throat issues since the 4 years ive been back. he does cough alot, claims drainage, has allergies. when he eats or drinks he often will cough and at times choke and he passed it off as drainage. he will not admit to a weakness or problem. ever. i always notice he doesnt drink enough water, his neurologist says it could contribute to his weakness. then says hes just old. i am beginning to think that the prevailing attitude of medicine in us as regards seniors is not to care. theyre just old. anyway, he may get 2 glasses of water a day, needs 4. when i took his urine sample in it was dark yellowy brown. def dehydrated bad. we talked about that monday night, he was really out of it so i think he told me the truth but i can never tell with him. he said he drinks water until hes full. i asked how he knew he was full. he said he drinks until hes full and he knows cause if he drinks any more it comes out.couldnt quite understand cause thats not how things work. he said if he leaned over right then water would come out. thats when i put it all together. he has swallowing issues. he drinks and eats but it may not always go down. but where is it going? hes not coughing and choking on phlegm, hes coughing and choking because the food and water didnt get swallowed and pass down into his stomach. it gets caught somewhere. but where. this also could explain why he wheezes alot and sometimes makes gurgling noises when he breathes. even his doctor noticed and wondered yet that all she did. but the problem is he wont admit he may have an issue. ive brought it up and suggested he get it checked out but as he doesnt understand how that could be then its false and he wont see about it.he also has sleep issues and with the sounds he makes when he breathes i thought maybe this interferes with his sleep or he has apnea. he wont get that looked at either. anyway, sorry for this mess. am kinda numb after this week, really dont understand. but will see if he sleeps on thru the night and how he is when he wakes up. one thing i can guess, he didnt change his adult undies so will be doing laundry tomorrow. ok i will stfu now. you folks take good care and stay healthy."," i also had a parent who suffered with parkinson's for many years before passing away. the swallowing became a big problem in my dad's last year of life, he would choke and get food down into his lungs as others have described below; turns out that more parkinson's patients die of aspirational pneumonia than anything else. anyhow, once the swallowing problem became more pronounced my mother had to add this thickener to everything he drank, and mash up all of his food. he hated it, hated living like that, it really took away a big pleasure of his life, one of the last things left, eating and drinking!  i felt terrible for him but told him that it was unrealistic to think that any of us were going to stand there and watch him choke to death because he couldn't swallow his food, so he was just going to have to accept it. with parkinson's, people have to give up one thing after another in a humiliating cascade, and it's really heartbreaking to watch. i still tear up thinking about all my poor dad went through in those last couple of years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fpoi6w/confused_and_fearful/,,Confused and fearful

"hi, i want to apologize for the wall of text but i truly am lost, i am drowning and struggling to keep my head above water. (trigger warning for death.)i grew up with my grandparents, they took me in as a newborn because my mother didn't care to take care of me/was responsible enough to take care of me. they were in their 50s by then. growing up was fine and things were easy until my grandpa got a blood cancer diagnosis in 2011. it was manageable since he was in his 60s by then; i was still in high school but this is when i started taking my first steps into caretaking. i had to watch out for temperature spikes, i had to watch out for signs of pneumonia, blood clots, and other general things the more his disease progressed. in 2017, things took a turn for the worst and his health decreased more and more. 2018, i was officially in full caretaker mode; i didn't go back to school to finish the handful of credits i had left, i left the comfortable job i had there in order to be there to make sure he was okay which i never minded. my grandpa and i were closer than anyone in my family, so i felt like it was only right that i do this for him. in october 2018, i went on a short trip out of town without knowing how unwell my grandpa was, and he told me i should go, even though i desperately wanted to stay. but i bought the plane tickets and the person i was going to see in not so many words didn't want me to cancel the trip. four days into my trip, my grandpa went to the hospital and died of kidney failure as a result of his cancer. i feel guilt over this every day and it's hard to forgive myself; what do you do when a seemingly routine hospitalization turns into the last time you'll see them? this is where my grandma comes in. we've never been close, and she's been mildly abusive to me my entire life (verbal, emotional and sometimes physical) but the death of my grandpa made me feel as if i needed to reconcile and put the past behind us in order to make sure she was okay. she's turning 80 this december, and while i love her things have gotten exceptionally hard, even harder than it was dealing with my grandpa's frequent hospitalizations and incontinence. she went into the hospital august 2019 very sick, and i didn't know with exactly what until the doctors told us she needed to have emergency gallbladder removal. after her surgery, they moved her to physical therapy rehab to help her regain her movement since she was in a hospital bed for almost a month. it's at the rehab/long term care facility that the doctors told me she's in the early stages of dementia.while in the rehab, i tried to help the doctors and physical therapists with making sure she did the exercises (physical and mental) that she was supposed to be doing; but if she wasn't ignoring and yelling at the doctors, she was ignoring and yelling at me and it reminds me too much of my childhood. they wanted to send home help in the form of weekly physical therapists and cognitive therapy and medication except once she was home, she yelled and ignored them to the point they stopped coming with no notice all together. i felt too guilty after that to make her take the pills; i regret this, because maybe things would've been better. so now, it's just me taking care of things like cooking her meals, making sure her medicines and doctor's appointments are tended to, making sure she's keeping herself busy instead of staring at the television except she still fights me. she refuses to eat when she's upset with something i've said, she doesn't sleep normal hours, she won't let me ask the other family for help because it's gotten to the point where my health is finally plummeting. i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was 11, and living with her without my grandpa around to talk to has made my mental health worse. i can't see a therapist or make appointments for my health as often as i'd like because she has separation anxiety when i'm gone, and i can't talk to her about how i'm feeling because she takes it as personal attacks, calls me crazy or sometimes downright turns her head away from me in an obvious show of ignoring me. we argue more and more until it's gotten to the point i can barely get out of bed for fear of what she'll say that day to make me feel terrible or to make me cry, but it's the guilt of my grandpa and knowing he'd want me to take care of her that keeps me here. i feel guilty that i don't want to do this. i'm 24, i was only two years into my degree and now i'm not sure if i can even go back because i've forgotten almost everything in the midst of death and grief. i don't have any friends, and the only people i can talk to are people on twitter but. no one wants to hear about something so depressing all the time so i slap on a mask and pretend i am coping but i'm not. i haven't felt this unwell since depression first stepped into my life and not since my first suicide attempt (that my grandma initiated). i have two aunts, a mother and even an adult cousin that all have more resources than me except they're the ones taking trips, going to work and living their lives without any regards to us. they only call her to make sure she's not dead, they never call me. i've never gotten along with them either, except for one of my aunts but it still feels so unfair that this is all my responsibility. i hate the bitterness i feel, because you're supposed to do this for family, right? except i feel like a shadow of myself, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't recognize myself anymore. i don't feel pretty anymore, i don't feel like i have worth anymore. and it's hard trying to take care of someone else when it feels like they hate you every single day but cry and say they need you when you want just an inch of space. i'm not sure what to do anymore. i need help but we don't have the income for home help i don't think. any advice would desperately be appreciated because i feel like i'm failing her and my grandpa, and myself. thank you to anyone listening, not many do lately.", danghey tell your family she's their grandma too they fucking better step upguilt them into ityou did right by your grandpa you were present as much as possiblenowwwww it's a bit much. got to get a caregiver to hang out sometimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fh5i36/taking_care_of_my_grandparents_fell_on_my/,,"taking care of my grandparents fell on my shoulders, except i'm getting crushed under the weight of loss and grief."

"hello fellow carers. i have a question that up till now i have not been brave enough to ask out loud to anyone about advanced parkinson’s. i am caring alone for my father who is 19 years into parkinson’s, and recently developed associated parkinson’s dementia. it is pretty clear that he is at the advanced stage by now. it goes without saying that this is emotionally and physically just horrible.i am just wondering (please excuse any insensitivity) how long the advanced stage can last before the inevitable end? crikey i hate even writing that.....i have not posed this question on any parkinson’s forum, because i am aware there are those suffering from parkinson’s who read and post on there and so do not want to hurt or scare anyone.however, this has been playing on my mind a great deal. as much as i love my father and don’t want to lose him, i hope it’s not unkind to not wish him to be suffering much longer like this. some days he is doing ok, but other days like today, he is lost and bent double shuffling and all that comes with this bloody awful disease."," sorry i don't know the answer, but i just wanted to tell you i'm in the same boat. my mother has not suffered from pd nearly as long (she was probably diagnosed about 4 years ago, but symptoms were showing many years before that), but her decline has been so rapid. it's absolutely heart wrenching to watch and have no control over it, especially when you care for the person who is suffering and you knew how they were... before. it really sucks, and i wish you the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f90an4/how_long_can_advance_stageend_stage_parkinsons/,,How long can Advance stage/End stage Parkinson’s last?
"whining and crying with frustration and self pity just drives me insane! i can take the middle of night diaper changes, bathing and feeding, medication management and frequent doctors' appointments, cooking and cleaning and laundry, whatever whatever whatever... but please! don't fill my ears with whining and crying!mom is usually so easy to take care of. she is generally cheerful and cooperative and pleasant to be around. but, every now and again she will get a uti, get very weak and her dementia kicks in, then she gets so frustrated that she can't feed herself, toilet herself, get up from her chair without help, and the crying and self pity begin. i remind her ""mom, you have an infection, you are on antibiotics now, you should feel better in about 2 days. this has happened many times before."" that helps for a bit, but then the crying, and to top it off it drives me so nuts i lose my temper (tell her to ""stop it!"" in a firm voice and walk off) and i feel so guilty :(.i know this isn't that bad, i should forgive myself, we all have triggers. but i snap at mom for crying when she is frustrated and i feel like a little shit.any advice? i know we all have triggers... how do you keep from reacting?"," well, i found a solution last night. i am not sure it is the best answer, but it is the best that i have found so far. since others confront the same issue, i am sharing in case it is something useful to you.mom's crying reminded me of when my kids had temper tantrums: born of legitimate frustration, perfectly understandable, and sets me on edge. when the kids were little and tantrumed, i didn't judge or shame them, but didn't give them attention or energy and removed myself from them as much as possible until they played out. so i thought i would try the same, see if it would help.when mom called me to help her to the bathroom with a voice full of whines and tears, i quickly came and in a kind and even voice i told her she was having a hard time, so rather than struggle with the bathroom i  would help her into bed and change her. she wasn't too keen on the idea, but since i change her once or twice a night when she needs it she was familiar with it, and knew it required minimal effort on her part. she let me help her onto the bed, urinated into her depends, then i changed her quickly and with no fuss. i then told her to rest while i got her dinner.when i came in with her dinner, rather than her sitting in her chair with her table in front of her, i kept her in bed and i hand fed her where she had no struggles and no reason to fall into frustration. after a few minutes she asked if she could get up and feed herself, and i told her she could if she thought she could do so without having so much trouble she cries. she agreed, and when she was seated with her food in front of her she calmly, slowly (and somewhat messily) fed herself. i sat near her and kept her company and helped her with anything she needed.a little later she apologised for giving me ""so much trouble"", and i told her i loved her and i was happy to help her, always, with whatever she needs.so, yeah, brought back the methods i used to raise my kids (who are now outstanding citizens, btw). i don't like treating mom like a kid, but it worked, was still full of love, so i guess it is the best that i have, so far. putting it out there, in case somebody else can benefit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f7n35d/cant_take_the_crying/,,Can't take the crying

"i graduated my bsn with a minor in gerontology in december 2018. i have had my cna for over 7 years by that point that i figured i should just study for my nclex in the coming months. living in the bay area in ca became too expensive i had to move back in with my folks in the greater la area. health issues flared again and money ran out, so of course my procrastination kicked in. i had to pick up another cna job. no hospital would hire me despite all my experience!! maybe my recent degree scared them as i would only be there for short period of time. so nursing facility it is... but then the cna license expired last summer. only other jobs available were home health. took the first one... woman running the agency said “oh she’s a sweet lady but has vascular dementia and alzheimer’s with recent stroke in june 2019 but is in a outpatient rehab recovering but she’s a catholic nun that’s starting to hit.” nothing against them. their community has been great. long story short new blood clots formed in her legs and she stopped being able to walk, so now she’s home hospice and bed bound now. this was back in august 2019.i am still here. i was working 12 hour shifts with her 3-4 day’s a week with her but her aggression and agitation was just becoming so bad i hated going to work. i burned out. i now just so 6 hour shifts a couple of times a week. my first cna job was hospice but at least we kept our residents comfortable. they don’t do anything for this poor woman. tylenol that’s it for her pain! she’s got severe arthritis/inflammation in her knees you can feel the warmth radiate when your hand just hovers over her. she screams every time i reposition her (no pressure ulcers yet. she still eats 3 meals a day with my help).i don’t take things personal. i worked in a major county general hospital ed with an interesting population and was told every degrading word in the book. she tells me to go to hell and shut up all the time. she tells me she’s going to kill herself and she wants my foot to kick her in the head. and she tells me she’s in pain her legs and back hurts. i tell her “main” nun/sister all this stuff but she says “oh that’s just part of the disease.” ummm no shit? i went to nursing school and worked in multiple units of a hospital... i know what i’m working with but just because she can’t tell you doesn’t mean she isn’t in pain. she grimaces all the time and she’s been literally laying in bed since august so i have no doubt she is very sore and in pain. the pressure on her pelvis and back must be so terrible. i do rom often but she is soooo stiff. i have yet to see the doctor come to do an assessment on her. only an lvn comes out. i voiced my concerns but he doesn’t listen. i reminded him 3 times to get me dicloflenac gel for her arthritic knee. she is prescribed 1mg xanax but of course the nun in control of her medication cuts in half so she doesn’t get her full dose. she claims it works for her but i’m the one with her most of the day and i’m the one that gets the lashing all day by this poor frustrated catholic nun. i need to get my nclex asap so i get out of this place but it’s just so hard to watch this lady essentially suffer. i’ve worked in a phenomenal hospice/palliative care facility and i feel we are failing at providing comfort to this women. i come home so agitated and helpless. i’m in no mood to study. the agitation, restlessness, loud vocalizations is just getting worse and the nuns that live in the house with her just close the doors. she apparently had a possible small tonic clonic seizure before my shift started this morning but i do see any signs of post ictal or high bp. though i know she’s very risk for it. sorry for the long post. i actually go on and on! i’ve been trying to watch teepa snow’s videos for some more resources.", why don't you take the test already??????,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f2xels/so_overwhelmed_with_my_11_demented_nun/,,So overwhelmed with my 1:1 Demented Nun
"i want to start this off by introducing myself and explaining my situation.i have been a caregiver for members of my family since i was 20? or so years old.it started with my grandma, then both of my grandparents until my grandfather died. i went on to help my grandma until she was eventually placed in a home where she currently resides. they both have/had severe alzheimers/dementia and my grandma is a diabetic. i would cook, clean, and administer meds for them both. because of my experience with this, it was naturally expected of me to be there to help my mom adjust to taking care of my dad after his 3rd stroke. his first was in 2015 and his third and final was in march of 2016.i had been living with a friend for the past year and would occasionally visit my parents. up until the 3rd stroke, they were doing great on their own and they actually had a healthy dynamic. now some backstory: my parents have an extremely toxic relationship. my mom was a lifelong alcoholic until last year (explain later in post) and my dad was almost never home while i grew up. i am the oldest of 4, 3 girls and 1 boy as the youngest. i was expected to take on many responsibilities from an early age because of my mom's alcoholism. i constantly got into verbal fights with my mom while trying to defend myself. i would get in trouble for stuff my siblings did, i would fight back about how unfair it was that my youngest brother and sister were never made to do chores or clean. this affects their adult lives, with my brother only learning how to do basic things from his gf and my sister turning into an unchecked ego. ithere was a lot of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse that happened pretty much my entire life. my parents constantly fought and would refuse to divorce because they wanted to stick together for my brother. long story short about my brother: he is the christ child and can do no wrong. they worship him. standard sexism in the family unit stuff. my mom would bend over backwards to make sure my dad and brother got everything they ever wanted, while myself and my closest sister were treated like the help. i was the only one that was ever hit and anytime i did something that upset my dad, he would spank me and blame the pain on me, saying stuff like this hurts me more than it does you. i would get my behind shredded for making a b in 3rd grade. stuff like that. the one time i told a teacher about it, she contacted my parents and told them everything. i was having trouble sitting at school because my dad had beat my behind the night before for not cleaning my room in a timely manner.anyways, i will move on to the current situation. a few months after i moved back in with my parents to help out, my mom broke her back. burst fracture if her l1. turns out if you have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis, and you drink heavily every day for 30 years, you make your bones so brittle that a sneeze could break your ribs.who knew right?so i was suddenly not just helping, i was taking care of both of them.now keep in mind the emotional abuse i had experienced in the past.my dad's emotional filter in his brain was basically destroyed. he lost his left side to paralysis. he would verbally lash out at me and my mom for little shit and on a few occasions he tried to hit us with his cane.he could have actually killed my mom if he had hit her but thankfully that did not happen.fast forward to now. i have become their full time caretaker and take care of literally everything.i could go on and on about all the shit that has happened in the last 4 years but this post is already too long. now i am completely burnt out. i can't be around my dad without being triggered violently and i have to stop myself from blowing up. my mom is a narcissistic guilt trip master and i literally cannot leave the house unless it's to take them to doc appts or to buy groceries. the few and far between times that i can leave the house, they both guilt me and make me feel terrible and treat me like a child. i'm gonna be 30 this year. i have no life. i have one friend. i almost never leave the house. we are living off of my dad's social security disability check which isn't enough to actually survive on. my mom is waiting to get on disability but they are taking their dear sweet time. we haven't paid rent in the last 2 months because if we did wouldn't have any money for food or for medicine and that's a whole other bag of dicks right there. both of their meds together cost roughly 800 a month. and that's even with my dad now being on humana and medicare.i don't know what to do. i desperately want to escape and get on with my life. literally everyone i talk to tells me to get out and i know i need to.but here's the thing...i would feel so guilty, despite everything. i would feel like i'm abandoning them. i have tried to reach out for help. nothing is working.both of my parents are technically capable of taking care of some things themselves but they won't do it and when i try to explain how it would help me greatly, it turns into a ""you're so ungrateful and selfish"" argument.i have to make phone calls for them that they could make themselves. fill out paperwork they could do themselves. i even have to talk to their docs for them because if i didn't, they wouldn't care and wouldn't advocate for themselves. there is an extremely unhealthy attachment going on here and i just wanna hear from anyone who is or has experienced something similar. i just need help. i am so fucking tired and i'm scared that i will send myself into a cardiac episode or worse because i'm under so much constant stress. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'm sorry if i have posted in the wrong area.

"when your mom or dad’s [dementia]( or [alzheimer’s]( care requires more than you can reasonably provide, it might be time to start thinking about transitioning to a [memory care]( community. [a variety of memory care levels]( exist, from providing simple medication reminders to full care communities assisting residents with bathing, dining, and ensuring they won’t get lost. before considering a move like this, be sure to verify your loved one matches behavior associated with [the early signs of alzheimer's and dementia,]( and consult a trusted physician.## transitioning to a memory care communitythe first thirty days can be the most difficult as you and your parent work through the shift from independent living to a memory care community. in many cases, your loved one may not always remember why the move is a good idea and might become upset or argumentative. being patient but firm, and leaning on the staff and administration at your chosen community for help, can aid you through this process and make your mom or dad feel at home.## explore before the movetaking your mom or dad to enjoy lunch or recreational activity at their chosen memory care community can help give them familiarity with the building, grounds, staff, and other members of the residence. associating positive feelings and memories with the community can make it easier for them to feel at home once they move in. you can also discuss various alzheimer’s care options with the staff, and see how other residents enjoy their lives in the community setting.## share information with staffthe caregivers at your loved one’s chosen senior living community should have as many questions for you as you do for them. be prepared to tell them as much as you can about your parent’s life and interests. knowing which foods they like and dislike, what things they were passionate about when they were young, and other personal pieces of information about your mom or dad can help staff personalize your parent’s care.## initiating the actual movethe chaos of moving can be even more confusing and disorienting to a loved one living with dementia or alzheimer’s. having one friend or family member spend the day with your parent while the rest of you arrange the setup of their new room can help.choose belongings carefully to create a space that feels familiar as well as offering staff insight into your parent’s personality and interests. focus on items with personal value and sensory input, like a soft quilt or family photos.## take time to visit frequentlyyears ago, the standard recommendation was for family and friends to stay away for the first week or after transitioning to a memory care community. at the kensington falls church, we encourage family members to visit our[ memory care communities]( frequently, and even have a pet-friendly policy so you can enjoy time with the entire family while your loved one adjusts.by planning visits for a specific time of day, you can create a defined routine helping your mom or dad get used to the idea of you coming, leaving, and reliably coming again.## adapt your interactionsunderstanding memory loss can help you learn how [alzheimer’s]( and [dementia]( affect behavior.you may need to adapt the way you interact with your loved one. if they insist an impossible event took place, or that a fact (like the year) is different than what you know to be true, realize that this is their reality. arguing may only lead to unnecessary unhappiness. instead, enjoy listening to their stories and find small, meaningful activities to do together, such as sharing a meal or going for a walk around the grounds.## practice self-careit’s important to take care of yourself to make the most out of your time together. if you are experiencing grief or frustration, there is a good chance they will also pick up on your emotions and become upset. you may want to consider talking with a friend or therapy professional about your feelings as a way to work through your role in the transition.the better you care for yourself, the better you’ll be able to help take care of your mom or dad.## know that it gets easierthe initial transition into a memory care community can be challenging, and at times your loved one may say or do things that are hurtful. but remember, it isn’t personal.they are coming from a place of uncertainty, confusion, and frustration. accept that their unhappiness is temporary. they will have good days and difficult days.by attending to their care with compassion and love, you are ensuring that they are safe and will continue to have every opportunity for a fulfilling life beyond dementia.find out more about how the kensington falls church can help your mom or dad transition to the

"i genuinely don't know what on earth to do anymore. before i get into everything, let me give you a little background on myself. i'm 18 years old living in a household with my mother, my father, four cats, and recently my grandmother. i'm in my last year of highschool so i've been super busy with school and basically getting ready for college. but besides that, i'm having a problem that i literally have no clue how to fix. my grandmother has been diagnosed alzheimer's for a little over 5 years now, and she's only been living with us for about 9 months. she hasn't been too bad or anything, she actually has been doing amazing lately, but my dad sees her as this burden. he always makes it seem like my mother and i never help him out with her (even though he leaves me for a day or two while he's hanging out with a friend at a brewery or something) and he constantly says how he is frustrated with life. the worst part is that it is now influencing my grandmother, having her say ""i want to die"" and ""no one wants me around"". what am i supposed to do in this situation? i know i'll be leaving for college soon, but i don't want to leave my mother in a toxic environment like that. how do i make him see that he is effecting the whole house with his attitude?", i suggest you contact the alzheimer’s association. they will be able to direct you to support groups in your area as well as what services are available for your grandmother.i hope this is helpful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/dqbmt6/my_dad_is_making_everything_worse/,,My Dad is making everything worse.
"typing this out just to vent. it's been a hell of a day. quick background. my dad died suddenly almost 2 years ago and we found out mom was farther along with alzheimer's than we'd known. i've spent the last two years helping as best as i can, and we finally got her moved into assisted living a month ago. but i feel terrible. i've taken here out of a familiar house (~45 years), taken her dogs away (she really couldn't care for them properly) and the new place is great with awesome staff and good food, but it's just not what she's used to. the transition is not going well. today we've been called by nursing staff twice. first time, i was already on my way up with her dog and we had a great afternoon. she seemed in great spirits and we walked the dog, talked, everything seemed good. late tonight we got a call again. she's upset, bad headache, talking about wanting to kill herself. i feel like i had to get her out of a 'living alone' situation. but i can't help feeling like i've messed everything up. we've sunk like 15k into the assisted living so far. i'm trying to sell her house to help fund things for the next several years. but if it's not working then i have no idea what to do. part time home care, live in home care, moving in with me or siblings, me or siblings moving in with her... all these options were weighed and i thought we made the best choice.how do you stop yourself from despair when the plans you make don't seem to work out? i feel like i've messed everything up and there is no hope. what a terrible disease. it just eats up everything and everyone. i can't believe how few options there seem to be and how bloody expensive it all is. most days all she wants to do is end it all and we can't even help her go out on her own terms. i feel like i've tried my hardest and failed spectacularly. how do you all do it?", i don’t know but perhaps at the two month mark things will be better? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/a6lyhr/what_a_rough_day/,,what a rough day
"tldr: mums getting further into alzheimer’s and i have no family to ask for help - what steps do i take? ps it’s awkward cause mum and i aren’t that close...so i’m 24 female and my dad past away last year. mum’s (62) been developing early symptoms of alzheimers in the last 3-4 years but is now getting worse. i don’t have any family i can contact to help me - i don’t know what to do in terms of getting her assessed or anything! i’ve been trying to research but i’m scared off because if i act too soon she might rage at me and threaten to kick me out. my parents were in a domestic abusive relationship for my entire life - my mum being the abuser - i cop a lot of the shit now that dads passed but what use to be cruel is now just bizzare behaviour coupled with really bad memory loss and basic functioning on the decline - so i’m not so much being abused as i am concerned for her own wellbeing and sanity. she has plenty of money so she’s been able to get by with just sitting around for years doing nothing - meaning no outside pressure or responsibility for her condition to be tested by others. i’ve got no idea what to do, it’s so awkward and weird considering my relationship with her is only just started to improve. she can’t even remember core elements of my teen years or things she use to do everyday in routine! she can’t remember big holidays we went on, no memory of visiting other countries or birthday parties we had. some days she will say “was it yesterday that you walked the dog or today” when i walked the dog only two hours ago. she’s extremely negative, will constantly look out the windows and verbally judge the neibours in a very creepy way. a few days ago she told me she waited till the neibours left home so she could go have a “sticky beak” at their yard - she hopped their fence to get in.... then explained how horrible and dirty their house was. the next day she went up the back of our property and said she was looking down into their house to watch what they do at night....she also mentioned watching the man of that household leave to go do groceries asking suspiciously “where does he go that idiot”.my mum has always been negative and horrible but she has never been this stalkerish...sigh i feel like this is crossing the line into a stage that i need to get checked but i really don’t know what to do or where to start :( p.s. she does this really strange thing where she laughs for 10mins at a time really loud and it doesn’t even sound like a laugh. when i ask her what is so funny she won’t tell me...it’s scary :( i hope what i have written does not offend anyone - i’m not trying to be insensitive i’m just feeling really alone and helpless in this situation. i’m dealing with someone who has never really been a mother to me so it’s hard to connect to her in good health let alone bad. thank you for reading.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/9y3ka7/mum_seems_to_have_alzheimers_and_i_dont_know_what/,,Mum seems to have Alzheimer’s and I don’t know what to do!

"so, as the title text says, my dad has suddenly had to move in with us, and i'm absolutely overwhelmed. the story is as such: a couple of weeks ago i got a call from the police. apparently my dad, who lives alone 3 hours away since my step mom died, had called the police to complain about people having a sit in on the front lawn, and having broken into his house. the cops arrived, and my dad is talking to bushes and there's no one there. he's been bothering the neighbors about it too, who saw nothing. the police said they couldn't admit him to the er, as his vitals were good, but he refused to go back into the house, and then drove to the local gas station and started having a fight with an invisible person in his car, and the police were called again, and so i drove up the 3 hours, and took him all the way back home with me, where after a good deal of sleep and some discussion about the possibility of hallucinations (he was an er nurse and understands the concept very well), he calmed down and seemed to go back to himself, though i could notice a considerable disruption in his normal cognitive abilities. we took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway. so they set us up with an outpatient appointment the following week, and we set dad up in the guest bedroom. we've since had the outpatient appointment, and the psychiatrist basically said that he thought dad had a mini stroke, and it caused an onset of dementia, and he didn't think dad should live by himself anymore based on how he answered the questions. so now dad is moving in with me.first off, dad seems able to take care of himself in many ways, like hygiene and self feeding, but has issues with more complicated aspects of living. he can't really work the tv (he could if it was just turn it on and change channels, but the whole smart tv thing and multiple remotes has him stumped constantly, even with a regular cable box and two remotes). he also has a hard time working the keurig, with its 3 buttons, and can't manage his dumbed down little flip phone, accidentally deleting phone numbers, etc. this is a man who used to work regularly in excel for a clinical trial management service, and the man who introduced me to the internet, set up a computer in our house when dos was the os, and had an atari 2600 from release, so he wasn't a luddite, but now he can't use a computer to save his life. it's heartbreaking to see him futz with his seatbelt for 3 minutes, or with the ac knobs, or the tv remote we got him which only has about 6 buttons, but i used to work in mental health, and patient care isn't something i have a problem with.my problem is this: how do i begin dealing with all of his stuff? he has a whole three bedroom two bath house filled with 40 years of stuff. he has two cars and a truck, a rental house, and two empty parcels of land, all 3 hours away from us. and, i found out after going up there and going through all of his stuff, that he got depressed after my step mother died and hadn't dealt with any bills in almost a year, and his taxes and god knows what else were all kinds of screwed. the first thing i did was get all of his bills paid up, and i'm trying to deal with his finances, but i've found so much stuff i'm out of my depth on, like that he never made any claims on my stepmother's life insurance or anything, and he gets money through investments but he can't really tell me how that works tax wise or anything.here's where i am right now:- i've got his bills paid for april, and i'm working on may's. i have years worth of paperwork to go through and i'm trying to sort through it a little at a time.- we went up this past weekend and i had him label everything he wanted to bring down, and everything he wanted to keep or put in storage.- i put one car in the shop because he just left it in the garage for a year, and we got a new battery in the truck, and drove it back down to our house. the other car is so old i don't think it'll make the trip.- i got his neighbor to cut his grass for the time being, after getting dad's permission to tell him what's going on.- the current tenant of his rental house wants to buy, so i guess i need to figure out how to sell a house without a realtor, which i've never done before.- i've gotten the name of an estate sales agency, to maybe go through and sell all dad's other stuff, which is the only thing i can think to do to deal with all the stuff we can't keep, and i've gotten the name of a junk remover for whatever is left.- dad's house will bare minimum need a major landscaping overhaul (he's let his land grow up significantly, and there are trees down in the yard), and possibly a new roof and definitely new flooring if we're going to sell the house. he owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless. i don't know.- i've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and i'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if i'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.- i let dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now i'm managing them for him.the whole time this is going on, all i can think is am i doing the right thing? how is this going to affect my life? how is this going to affect his life? am i missing something? and i'm constantly second guessing myself and my actions and whether i'm doing the right thing at the right time.i have no resources. my wife is still employed, thank the gods, but i've been laid off due to the virus, which is the silver lining to all of this because i'm getting unemployment with the extra money for the time being while i use my time to help my father, but eventually that's going to run out or i'm going to have to get a job to maintain our home and pay for him until we can get his finances figured out.so, i apologize for the long rant, but i guess what this post is about, is that i need help and though i know more than some i've never dealt with this and i feel like i'm drowning in stress, i don't know if i've missed anything important, and i don't know what resources might be at hand for this.and hell, in the midst of all of this, how do i actually care for my dad!? i'm managing his meds for him, and making sure he gets food, of course, but i'm at a complete loss for how to occupy his time, and help his life be worth living, especially in the midst of this virus stuff.and, selfishly, i need to figure out how i make sure that my dad's life doesn't consume my own? i know my life is derailed currently, and there is now a new normal, but what's on track for me going to look like going forward, etc.any advice, or resources, or anything at all is helpful at this point."," \- get power of attorney so you can deal with his finances, his property and other matters. his wife's insurance money will come in handy once that gets settled. \- put his name in for an assisted living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. my mother's place has assisted living and memory care in the same residence, just different floors. it seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. \- if he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. before my stepdad even started hallucinating, he would get lost and sometimes even ended up in the ditch. finally his kids started ""borrowing"" his car for weeks at a time until he was diagnosed with lewy body dementia and was told not to drive. \- check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. many places have senior's social workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a seniors' center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. \- it sounds like you are doing all you can so far. it will be challenging but the hardest part  is now when things are in such a mess. he is lucky to have you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/ggvuc4/dad_71_coming_to_live_with_my_wife_and_i_after_a/,,"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia.

"my 72 year old mother has been forgetful (getting her dates wrong for major events like weddings, misplacing things, forgetting to pay bills) as long as she's been my mom, but her memory has been steadily getting worse over the last few years and she is now acting weird in other ways.she loses her train of thought mid sentence and just starts stating facts that are sort of related to the thing we were talking about. she asks me the same questions repeatedly, although this might be loneliness and her trying to keep me on the phone. she makes really weird decisions and gets super defensive when you ask about them. this year she started taking out large sums of cash and carrying it around on her. she couldn't have a bag on her at work, so she'd stuff bills in her pants pockets and every time she stuck her hands in her pockets and pulled them out she'd drop money. she was dropping multiple $20 bills every week. i know there must be a reason- she's forgetting her pin or losing her wallet or something, but she gets angry and refuses to speak to me if i push the subject.she has short bursts of very petulant, childlike behavior and paranoia. they usually only last a few minutes, but they are very different from her normal behavior. this is what concerns me the most, she has a different look in her eyes, like she's confused and frightened.this week she left a tap running for hours and flooded her bathroom.i've looked up early dementia signs online, but most of them assume the parent previously had the ability to perform essential self care tasks, which my mother never has. she lost most of her teeth by 40 because she wouldn't brush them or go to the dentist. she has never been able to feed herself regularly, pay her bills often enough to not have services cut off, etc. she has always been bad at looking after herself, which makes it really hard for me to tell if this is cognitive decline or just her norm + aging. my sister has mentioned a few moments when she seemed ""off"" to her, but doesn't believe there is anything majorly wrong. she was working full time up until the pandemic. she seemed to be performing fine at work, her coworkers speak highly of her abilities when i interact with them.i feel like i should suggest she see a doctor to be assessed, but it may cause her to become angry and secretive. she would rather lie than have people worry about her. she once purchased a second kindle because i asked to borrow her kindle and she didn't want to tell me she didn't know where it was. if this is fairly normal for a 72 year old and she's probably going to be stable at this level of functioning for a while i don't want to push her and cut off any truthful communication. if this is actually concerning behavior i'd like to talk to my sister about  how we should approach it with my mom."," you should definitely not ignore this. make an appointment with her primary to discuss what you are seeing and what she is experiencing. if they discount what you have noticed it is time to switch doctors and find someone who has a better understanding of dementia. in the meantime, contact your local chapter of the alzheimer's association for guidance. you do not need a diagnosis to get help. they will be able to provide a lot of guidance and education for you as you figure out what is going on. they also have lots of support groups for caregivers and for those with dementia or alzheimer's. find your local chapter here:  [ hope that helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gf0bam/how_worried_should_i_be/,,How worried should I be?
"i’m not sure if this is a rant or a call for advice. basically my grandfather and his wife had a workplace affair in the 60s, and one day decided to walk out on their spouses and children to be together. i say “walk out on” but she left, while he kicked my grandmother and their four children out of their home with a few days notice. they’ve lived a purposefully isolated and reclusive life ever since. my mother and i are the only ones who ever came around and she was very clear that she would rather we didn’t, and only put up with us because he made her. i hadn’t been around in a couple years due to distance, but recently moved a bit closer (2 hour drive). my grandfather passed away last week. apparently, she’s been living with dementia for a few years. she should have been placed in an assisted care home long ago as she cannot even be left alone, let alone care for herself in any capacity. we found out she hadn’t showered or changed her clothes in 3 months. she won’t eat unless you put a cooked meal in front of her. most of her day is spent sitting at their small kitchen table, and going in the bathroom every 10 minutes to smoke. mom and i are taking turns staying with her and everyone involved hates it. mom is power of attorney/proxy, and i am the alternate. her children made it clear they want nothing to do with the situation or to help in any way. she has about a 10 minute “reset” time as we’ve been calling it. following the doctors advice we initially planned to tell her he died once, and then remain vague. but she’s so mean (was when she didn’t have dementia) and keeps telling us to leave her alone. my mom lost her patience and started telling her over and over that he died. now i can’t go back to the vague answers because while she can’t quite remember, she’s been told enough that she has a vague idea (saying things like “no...something else happened”) and getting combative until we tell her. she’s convinced that we just need to leave and that she can handle their house, their 7 cats, and her own care by herself. it’s clear that she can’t because she doesn’t even think to feed the cats or do anything for herself. we’ve been in contact with a few nursing homes and one seemed like they’d take her. we even had an appointment on monday where we took her there and they talked and they said they’d give us a decision in 24-48 hours but now they’ve just been ghosting us even though they have 12 open rooms. we’re in a pretty rural area so that was pretty much our only nearby option. my mom is now under the impression that at the first sign that somethings wrong with her (she’s been complaining of a pain in her head for a few days) that she’s going to take her to the hospital, where we can hopefully get adult protective services involved since we also can’t get them on the phone. it’s making us physically sick to be in that house since they both smoked inside of it for half a century. my mom has to do the bulk of staying there since i’m still working and like i said, live two hours away. my mom and i are both so exhausted from caring for this woman that always hated us and to be honest we never cared for her much either, that i’m worried for my mom’s sanity and my own safety. i’m just so exhausted and i drive all day for work on top of the drive there all the time (on top of my job which is very high stakes and stressful because of covid-19) that i feel like i’m constantly on the edge of falling asleep or passing out. i know my mom isn’t the type to do anything rash but if you make someone suffer physically, put them on the end of verbal abuse from their “stepmom” 24/7 all while trying to process the death of a parent, i’m worried she will do something in the spur of the moment. we’re both just so angry with the situation, that he put this on us, and that it’s all happening during a pandemic which makes everything 100x harder. we don’t even have death certificates yet to access his bank account so everything for her and his cats has been coming from us, and we both struggle to support ourselves too.", wow that's really hard.  you and your mom are good souls for taking care of her despite the fact that i kind of feel like she's not really your problem. have you considered getting any county or state agencies involved since her family doesn't really seem to want to take care of her?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gbhwca/grandfather_passed_his_wife_has_dementia_and/,,"Grandfather passed, his wife has dementia and hated us when she didn’t.

"apologies for posting so much, things are crapping out here. i will be calling his doc tomorrow and if she wont callback i guess ill have a caretaker out for a few hours. and cal social services. my dad (93) stroke dementia and parkinsons, tied to a walker on his good days and lucky to get around on his bad days hes also a narcissist so everything he says or does is god.  he has horrible balance issues. getting up from his chair to his walker is often an ordeal that involves struggling to get up and falling back into his chair. ive picked him up off the floor a few times and this morning he was callig cause he was weak and couldnt use his walker. tbh i never quite know if hes telling me the truth or hes running a game. even at his age and condition he still tries to manipulate.there is no one else to take care of him and he cant do anything. all i ask is he do things safely. but he doesnt use proper judgement. i see hime struggling to stand and ffer a hand and he gets belligerant. tonight he was hanging between his chair and walker, barely balancing and looked stuck, so i genty placed my hand on his back and he made it, then was pissed. i explained to him hos this is done and tgat if he had a nurse or caretaker here thgey would chew his ass for being unsafe and then give him a hand. he just spits venom. he was calling for help this morning but then tonight its 'i dont fucking need your help'. on the one hand i want to just say 'ok, fuck you, if you fall you fall'. if that happens im not waiting in him, he'll have to hire in someone. aight, sorry, but am i just being a idiot wanting to help him since he always complains of weakness and has horrible balance issues?  what i see when he tries to get up is he sticks his butt way back and that pulls his center of gravity back. ive told him that but of course he knows all. should i just let him alone and when hes trying to get up say goodnight and walk away?at tgis point i will try and talk to his doctor and if that fails social services or a carenurse. as far as i know fro someone like him he should not be allowed to do what hes doing but im damn tired of the belligerence and idiocy. he expects that he can jut tell me whatever and ill just go...huh? gosh ok well i guess i let you fall then, have fun.tbh im alone in this, will be searching for a caregiver supoort group, probaby online, cause at this point it feels like im lsoing the fight to mr knowitall.  i moved back to go back to school. lost my job and decided to study for a career change. mom passed and dads been going steadily downhill. he has 2-3 bad days then hopefully 5-7 good days. these last two down cycles were hell. if it gets any worse then i cant  take care of him. but despite all the crap it has been beneficial in that i do the chores and i get a place to stay and food. but here lately i can get anything done and it seems like im upset every night. hes starting to gaslight and thats not acceptable. unfortuantely i wouldnt find a jhob in this economy so i think im fucked. but am i correct to try and keep him safe or should i just let him struggle and walk away."," my papaw had the exact same issues you describe with standing, especially when getting out of his recliner. i got him a set of grab bars with handles that he could use to push himself up easier. (they are on amazon, under able life universal stand assist.) all of the physical therapists with home health who came to see him were impressed; none of them had ever seen anything like it and most asked me what they were called and where i got them so they could tell their other patients. they might be worth looking into for your dad.my grandmother is the narcissist in our family, and i am fairly sure she has dementia now too, but it is so hard to tell what is dementia and what is her usual  personality. she complains over literally everything; even if she loves something to begin with, she will complain later.

"hello world of aging parents. i have a challenge to overcome. i’ve been taking care of my mother. my husband and i have lived with her (in tight quarters) for over a year now. she’s on a dementia medication which improved her condition greatly. she has refused to take any medications recently, so she’s no longer on her anxiety/mood medication. the only diagnosis i ever heard for her, psychologically speaking, is borderline personality disorder, which appears to fit.my feelings oscillate wildly. often i think it’s not so bad. and then i go to places where i think the plan to move and leave her with an aid (to make sure she’s covered, needs wise) is all she deserves. she can be incredibly mean and also incredibly supportive and that’s her struggle. but i’ve felt that she let the worst parts of her get the better of herself. so i’m having a hard time biting the bullet and signing off for a lawyer to get her on medicaid and get her at-home care and disconnecting myself from the responsibility. my mom is against having her finances interrupted and having ‘a stranger’ help her with anything. this would mean both of those things. i also signed on to work out of state at the end of the summer, and my husband and i agreed that we should take some time to ourselves out there to get a foothold before having her come out, around 6 months of time. that means it is imperative to get that care set up for her. so there’s really “no option”.questions, comments, words of constructive criticism and/or support are all welcome."," the adjustment will be hard, but it sounds like it is what is best for all involved. reassure her that you are not disappearing forever, but want to go back to enjoying the role of daughter. it will be a good thing for all of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g4w5oj/support_needed_afraid_to_sign_papers_send_check/,,"Support Needed: Afraid to sign papers, send check for retainer to get mom community care"

"my mother will be 68 in july.  i'm 30 and an only child.  my father is 76 with alzheimers and starting to slow down severely.   ever since she married my father she never really had to pay bills.  she always had an obsession/addiction with spending money and shopping since i can remember.  she has been on social security for the last 6 or 7 years.&amp;#x200b;i have another post describing my backstory in more detail, but the main issue is that she is absolutely obsessed and fixated on attempting to get a 'loan' by any means necessary.  my parents still have a mortgage of around 190k on their home, which is in somewhat rough shape, and probably $50-150k in credit card debt for the two of them combined.   last year she started doing gift card scams and basically throwing her social security check away every other month to these scammers.  she continued on through the rest of the year and even convinced (and one month straight up took money from him) my father to give him money so she could get her big payday, totaling to $4300 (in 3 months time) and they missed 3 mortgage payments.  i feel awful for my parents because these people now call their home phone all day, every day, according to my elderly father with dementia; he is very fed up with it.  and they call mom's cell phone non stop it seems like.  everytime i am with her these people are calling her.&amp;#x200b;i have control of my father's ss benefits now ($\~1600), they go to my bank account and i have control, and we can slowly catch up on the mortgage ($1050).  but the problem is that she is getting \~$800 a month that she has been throwing away.  in january she gave it all away, in february the scammers cashed a check for around 500 and she closed her account with that bank and got $200 out and then immediately bought a gift card, and this past march she sent her whole check away in a money order to some guy.&amp;#x200b;i have durable power of attorney and healthcare power of attorney for both parents. i have sent my healthcare poa to her doctor and now have the ability to talk to him about her medical stuff, but when i called last week the nurse wouldn't let me speak directly to him and the only option i had was to make an appointment.  i think this week i'm going to call back to the hospital where he doctor works and just tell the nurse everything i was hoping to tell the doctor over the phone in hopes they understand how dire the situation is.  because i have asked my mom the past few days if she will go with me to talk to her doctor and she is very hesitant because i think she knows where that path will lead.    she also wanted me to put the payment for her timeshare \[that i'm not even sure she will be able to go to\] on my credit card ($900) and at one point told me to 'just do it' and i knew i had to put my foot down, so i didn't pay it.  i told her i would pay it if she signed over her ss benefits but she refused.&amp;#x200b;what the fuck can i do?   i'm almost certain she has some form of mental regression or mental cognition issues, i don't know what to call it really.  she has been on ambien for at least 10 years and i think that has caused some issues.  she has a terrible memory and often tries to tell me that things i know are true, aren't (like her taking $4300 from my dad for her scams).&amp;#x200b;the only other option i know of is contacting adult protective services (social services) and hoping they create a case for her.  she told me about 2 weeks ago that someone had already contacted her from social services because someone else had called in about her anonymously but i don't know if that gained any traction.  if you met her you wouldn't think she is that bad but she is 110% obsessed with these scams and it is making my life so much more stressful and difficult.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;i am covering their electric bill, groceries, car insurance, health insurance, and other things here and there for my parents, with a high interest credit card.  i know this is a terrible choice financially, and the interest is starting to kick my ass, but its my only option unless i go no contact and go back to social security and tell them i can no longer manage my father's funds.&amp;#x200b;i may also have to take out another loan to purchase them a new car at some point. they both drive older cars and i'm not sure how much longer they will last.  my mom drives about 25 minutes to take care of her elderly mother (98) once a week for two nights).&amp;#x200b;lastly, they always talk about how they need to 'sell this house' and pay off the mortgage to then move and have some money to work with, but the house is 4k square feet, needs about $50k in repairs roughly, and they can't even get it clean enough to a point to have it shown. they're home almost every day but both so depressed i think they never get anything done. the house is pretty disgusting by most peoples standards.&amp;#x200b;can i go to a lawyer and try to have her declared as incompetent or something?

"i know ive posted more than my share but one more, because things are strange. i know its probably because i dont understand. from my perspective...i havent been living near any close relative who passed away. then a couple years after i moved back my mom passed. she was 93 and always very energetoc until the two weeks before she went. i think she somehow knew her time was short. the last week she napped all afternoon every afternoon. i didnt see any of the signs. my dad is 93, had a stroke a few years ago and started going downhill which has increased . he has parkinsons and dementia and is a narcissist. which i mention because it means he thinks he knows everything and better than anyone, even the doctors. thats part of why he is where he is. he walks now with a walker on good days and a wheelchair now on bad days. he insists on being over his own meds and gets offended if i try and help with anything. that said i have caught it a few times before he has mistook his meds. we made a trip to his doc a couple weeks ago and the walk to the garage had him gasping for air. halfway down the hallway to the office he had to sit on his walker and rest, i pushed him the rest of the way, all very abnormal for him. normally he sleeps til 11ish, watches tv all afternoon and crashes after the 10pm news. there was one day, maybe friday that he tooks a bunch of his meds rt before dinner on an all but empty stomach. messed him up bad. his tremors were the worst id seen em and he was very weak. the next day he was normal again and told me what hed done. he wont be doing that again. sunday and monday he was so weak he couldnt roll over or get out of bed. good that we had his wheelchair. he also didnt have bladder control. and he had pronounced brainfog. no fever or throwing up .  i talked to the er doctor and she set up a urinalysis for next day at his docs. took me 3 hours to get a urine sample from him and then got him a rush appt, urine and blood no issues, we then did a lung xray and it was clean. tuesday he was better. i walked thru his morning and evening routines and he was ok. buthes sleeping almost all day. sun-wed only awake for meals and get ready for bed. sun/mon he also either had a couple very lucid dreams or hes startin g to hallucinate. this morning he swears he was in the bathroom and he got a call from a house maintenance company he uses. no voicemail so i have no clue how he heard anything. tues and wed progressively stronger. today stayed awake all afternoon, i think, and walked across the house on his own, went and sat on the porch. is now at 8:30 snoozing. bad thing is i have no idea if hes taken any meds.  and standing rule since he does have trouble sleeping is dont wake him up. i dont understand why sun/mon he took a deepdive on his health and his brain went loopy, tests were all good. a few days later he was the strongest ive seen him in a long time. i know life/health is all ups and downs but the swing is bizarre. im afraid of another downswing where hes incapable . and im afraid that since they found nothing else that his heart is wearing out, im afraid that since hes is suddenly sleeping so much he is about to pass. i went thru all this with his doc but since his tests were all ok she is satisfied.one other question....my dad has had throat issues since the 4 years ive been back. he does cough alot, claims drainage, has allergies. when he eats or drinks he often will cough and at times choke and he passed it off as drainage. he will not admit to a weakness or problem. ever. i always notice he doesnt drink enough water, his neurologist says it could contribute to his weakness. then says hes just old. i am beginning to think that the prevailing attitude of medicine in us as regards seniors is not to care. theyre just old. anyway, he may get 2 glasses of water a day, needs 4. when i took his urine sample in it was dark yellowy brown. def dehydrated bad. we talked about that monday night, he was really out of it so i think he told me the truth but i can never tell with him. he said he drinks water until hes full. i asked how he knew he was full. he said he drinks until hes full and he knows cause if he drinks any more it comes out.couldnt quite understand cause thats not how things work. he said if he leaned over right then water would come out. thats when i put it all together. he has swallowing issues. he drinks and eats but it may not always go down. but where is it going? hes not coughing and choking on phlegm, hes coughing and choking because the food and water didnt get swallowed and pass down into his stomach. it gets caught somewhere. but where. this also could explain why he wheezes alot and sometimes makes gurgling noises when he breathes. even his doctor noticed and wondered yet that all she did. but the problem is he wont admit he may have an issue. ive brought it up and suggested he get it checked out but as he doesnt understand how that could be then its false and he wont see about it.he also has sleep issues and with the sounds he makes when he breathes i thought maybe this interferes with his sleep or he has apnea. he wont get that looked at either. anyway, sorry for this mess. am kinda numb after this week, really dont understand. but will see if he sleeps on thru the night and how he is when he wakes up. one thing i can guess, he didnt change his adult undies so will be doing laundry tomorrow. ok i will stfu now. you folks take good care and stay healthy."," i also had a parent who suffered with parkinson's for many years before passing away. the swallowing became a big problem in my dad's last year of life, he would choke and get food down into his lungs as others have described below; turns out that more parkinson's patients die of aspirational pneumonia than anything else. anyhow, once the swallowing problem became more pronounced my mother had to add this thickener to everything he drank, and mash up all of his food. he hated it, hated living like that, it really took away a big pleasure of his life, one of the last things left, eating and drinking!  i felt terrible for him but told him that it was unrealistic to think that any of us were going to stand there and watch him choke to death because he couldn't swallow his food, so he was just going to have to accept it. with parkinson's, people have to give up one thing after another in a humiliating cascade, and it's really heartbreaking to watch. i still tear up thinking about all my poor dad went through in those last couple of years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fpoi6w/confused_and_fearful/,,Confused and fearful

"hi, i want to apologize for the wall of text but i truly am lost, i am drowning and struggling to keep my head above water. (trigger warning for death.)i grew up with my grandparents, they took me in as a newborn because my mother didn't care to take care of me/was responsible enough to take care of me. they were in their 50s by then. growing up was fine and things were easy until my grandpa got a blood cancer diagnosis in 2011. it was manageable since he was in his 60s by then; i was still in high school but this is when i started taking my first steps into caretaking. i had to watch out for temperature spikes, i had to watch out for signs of pneumonia, blood clots, and other general things the more his disease progressed. in 2017, things took a turn for the worst and his health decreased more and more. 2018, i was officially in full caretaker mode; i didn't go back to school to finish the handful of credits i had left, i left the comfortable job i had there in order to be there to make sure he was okay which i never minded. my grandpa and i were closer than anyone in my family, so i felt like it was only right that i do this for him. in october 2018, i went on a short trip out of town without knowing how unwell my grandpa was, and he told me i should go, even though i desperately wanted to stay. but i bought the plane tickets and the person i was going to see in not so many words didn't want me to cancel the trip. four days into my trip, my grandpa went to the hospital and died of kidney failure as a result of his cancer. i feel guilt over this every day and it's hard to forgive myself; what do you do when a seemingly routine hospitalization turns into the last time you'll see them? this is where my grandma comes in. we've never been close, and she's been mildly abusive to me my entire life (verbal, emotional and sometimes physical) but the death of my grandpa made me feel as if i needed to reconcile and put the past behind us in order to make sure she was okay. she's turning 80 this december, and while i love her things have gotten exceptionally hard, even harder than it was dealing with my grandpa's frequent hospitalizations and incontinence. she went into the hospital august 2019 very sick, and i didn't know with exactly what until the doctors told us she needed to have emergency gallbladder removal. after her surgery, they moved her to physical therapy rehab to help her regain her movement since she was in a hospital bed for almost a month. it's at the rehab/long term care facility that the doctors told me she's in the early stages of dementia.while in the rehab, i tried to help the doctors and physical therapists with making sure she did the exercises (physical and mental) that she was supposed to be doing; but if she wasn't ignoring and yelling at the doctors, she was ignoring and yelling at me and it reminds me too much of my childhood. they wanted to send home help in the form of weekly physical therapists and cognitive therapy and medication except once she was home, she yelled and ignored them to the point they stopped coming with no notice all together. i felt too guilty after that to make her take the pills; i regret this, because maybe things would've been better. so now, it's just me taking care of things like cooking her meals, making sure her medicines and doctor's appointments are tended to, making sure she's keeping herself busy instead of staring at the television except she still fights me. she refuses to eat when she's upset with something i've said, she doesn't sleep normal hours, she won't let me ask the other family for help because it's gotten to the point where my health is finally plummeting. i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was 11, and living with her without my grandpa around to talk to has made my mental health worse. i can't see a therapist or make appointments for my health as often as i'd like because she has separation anxiety when i'm gone, and i can't talk to her about how i'm feeling because she takes it as personal attacks, calls me crazy or sometimes downright turns her head away from me in an obvious show of ignoring me. we argue more and more until it's gotten to the point i can barely get out of bed for fear of what she'll say that day to make me feel terrible or to make me cry, but it's the guilt of my grandpa and knowing he'd want me to take care of her that keeps me here. i feel guilty that i don't want to do this. i'm 24, i was only two years into my degree and now i'm not sure if i can even go back because i've forgotten almost everything in the midst of death and grief. i don't have any friends, and the only people i can talk to are people on twitter but. no one wants to hear about something so depressing all the time so i slap on a mask and pretend i am coping but i'm not. i haven't felt this unwell since depression first stepped into my life and not since my first suicide attempt (that my grandma initiated). i have two aunts, a mother and even an adult cousin that all have more resources than me except they're the ones taking trips, going to work and living their lives without any regards to us. they only call her to make sure she's not dead, they never call me. i've never gotten along with them either, except for one of my aunts but it still feels so unfair that this is all my responsibility. i hate the bitterness i feel, because you're supposed to do this for family, right? except i feel like a shadow of myself, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't recognize myself anymore. i don't feel pretty anymore, i don't feel like i have worth anymore. and it's hard trying to take care of someone else when it feels like they hate you every single day but cry and say they need you when you want just an inch of space. i'm not sure what to do anymore. i need help but we don't have the income for home help i don't think. any advice would desperately be appreciated because i feel like i'm failing her and my grandpa, and myself. thank you to anyone listening, not many do lately.", danghey tell your family she's their grandma too they fucking better step upguilt them into ityou did right by your grandpa you were present as much as possiblenowwwww it's a bit much. got to get a caregiver to hang out sometimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fh5i36/taking_care_of_my_grandparents_fell_on_my/,,"taking care of my grandparents fell on my shoulders, except i'm getting crushed under the weight of loss and grief."

"i want to start this off by introducing myself and explaining my situation.i have been a caregiver for members of my family since i was 20? or so years old.it started with my grandma, then both of my grandparents until my grandfather died. i went on to help my grandma until she was eventually placed in a home where she currently resides. they both have/had severe alzheimers/dementia and my grandma is a diabetic. i would cook, clean, and administer meds for them both. because of my experience with this, it was naturally expected of me to be there to help my mom adjust to taking care of my dad after his 3rd stroke. his first was in 2015 and his third and final was in march of 2016.i had been living with a friend for the past year and would occasionally visit my parents. up until the 3rd stroke, they were doing great on their own and they actually had a healthy dynamic. now some backstory: my parents have an extremely toxic relationship. my mom was a lifelong alcoholic until last year (explain later in post) and my dad was almost never home while i grew up. i am the oldest of 4, 3 girls and 1 boy as the youngest. i was expected to take on many responsibilities from an early age because of my mom's alcoholism. i constantly got into verbal fights with my mom while trying to defend myself. i would get in trouble for stuff my siblings did, i would fight back about how unfair it was that my youngest brother and sister were never made to do chores or clean. this affects their adult lives, with my brother only learning how to do basic things from his gf and my sister turning into an unchecked ego. ithere was a lot of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse that happened pretty much my entire life. my parents constantly fought and would refuse to divorce because they wanted to stick together for my brother. long story short about my brother: he is the christ child and can do no wrong. they worship him. standard sexism in the family unit stuff. my mom would bend over backwards to make sure my dad and brother got everything they ever wanted, while myself and my closest sister were treated like the help. i was the only one that was ever hit and anytime i did something that upset my dad, he would spank me and blame the pain on me, saying stuff like this hurts me more than it does you. i would get my behind shredded for making a b in 3rd grade. stuff like that. the one time i told a teacher about it, she contacted my parents and told them everything. i was having trouble sitting at school because my dad had beat my behind the night before for not cleaning my room in a timely manner.anyways, i will move on to the current situation. a few months after i moved back in with my parents to help out, my mom broke her back. burst fracture if her l1. turns out if you have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis, and you drink heavily every day for 30 years, you make your bones so brittle that a sneeze could break your ribs.who knew right?so i was suddenly not just helping, i was taking care of both of them.now keep in mind the emotional abuse i had experienced in the past.my dad's emotional filter in his brain was basically destroyed. he lost his left side to paralysis. he would verbally lash out at me and my mom for little shit and on a few occasions he tried to hit us with his cane.he could have actually killed my mom if he had hit her but thankfully that did not happen.fast forward to now. i have become their full time caretaker and take care of literally everything.i could go on and on about all the shit that has happened in the last 4 years but this post is already too long. now i am completely burnt out. i can't be around my dad without being triggered violently and i have to stop myself from blowing up. my mom is a narcissistic guilt trip master and i literally cannot leave the house unless it's to take them to doc appts or to buy groceries. the few and far between times that i can leave the house, they both guilt me and make me feel terrible and treat me like a child. i'm gonna be 30 this year. i have no life. i have one friend. i almost never leave the house. we are living off of my dad's social security disability check which isn't enough to actually survive on. my mom is waiting to get on disability but they are taking their dear sweet time. we haven't paid rent in the last 2 months because if we did wouldn't have any money for food or for medicine and that's a whole other bag of dicks right there. both of their meds together cost roughly 800 a month. and that's even with my dad now being on humana and medicare.i don't know what to do. i desperately want to escape and get on with my life. literally everyone i talk to tells me to get out and i know i need to.but here's the thing...i would feel so guilty, despite everything. i would feel like i'm abandoning them. i have tried to reach out for help. nothing is working.both of my parents are technically capable of taking care of some things themselves but they won't do it and when i try to explain how it would help me greatly, it turns into a ""you're so ungrateful and selfish"" argument.i have to make phone calls for them that they could make themselves. fill out paperwork they could do themselves. i even have to talk to their docs for them because if i didn't, they wouldn't care and wouldn't advocate for themselves. there is an extremely unhealthy attachment going on here and i just wanna hear from anyone who is or has experienced something similar. i just need help. i am so fucking tired and i'm scared that i will send myself into a cardiac episode or worse because i'm under so much constant stress. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'm sorry if i have posted in the wrong area. this is my first ever post."," this is a truly terrible situation. wish i had better ideas for how to get you out of it, but someone already suggested calling adult protective services, which i

"when your mom or dad’s [dementia]( or [alzheimer’s]( care requires more than you can reasonably provide, it might be time to start thinking about transitioning to a [memory care]( community. [a variety of memory care levels]( exist, from providing simple medication reminders to full care communities assisting residents with bathing, dining, and ensuring they won’t get lost. before considering a move like this, be sure to verify your loved one matches behavior associated with [the early signs of alzheimer's and dementia,]( and consult a trusted physician.## transitioning to a memory care communitythe first thirty days can be the most difficult as you and your parent work through the shift from independent living to a memory care community. in many cases, your loved one may not always remember why the move is a good idea and might become upset or argumentative. being patient but firm, and leaning on the staff and administration at your chosen community for help, can aid you through this process and make your mom or dad feel at home.## explore before the movetaking your mom or dad to enjoy lunch or recreational activity at their chosen memory care community can help give them familiarity with the building, grounds, staff, and other members of the residence. associating positive feelings and memories with the community can make it easier for them to feel at home once they move in. you can also discuss various alzheimer’s care options with the staff, and see how other residents enjoy their lives in the community setting.## share information with staffthe caregivers at your loved one’s chosen senior living community should have as many questions for you as you do for them. be prepared to tell them as much as you can about your parent’s life and interests. knowing which foods they like and dislike, what things they were passionate about when they were young, and other personal pieces of information about your mom or dad can help staff personalize your parent’s care.## initiating the actual movethe chaos of moving can be even more confusing and disorienting to a loved one living with dementia or alzheimer’s. having one friend or family member spend the day with your parent while the rest of you arrange the setup of their new room can help.choose belongings carefully to create a space that feels familiar as well as offering staff insight into your parent’s personality and interests. focus on items with personal value and sensory input, like a soft quilt or family photos.## take time to visit frequentlyyears ago, the standard recommendation was for family and friends to stay away for the first week or after transitioning to a memory care community. at the kensington falls church, we encourage family members to visit our[ memory care communities]( frequently, and even have a pet-friendly policy so you can enjoy time with the entire family while your loved one adjusts.by planning visits for a specific time of day, you can create a defined routine helping your mom or dad get used to the idea of you coming, leaving, and reliably coming again.## adapt your interactionsunderstanding memory loss can help you learn how [alzheimer’s]( and [dementia]( affect behavior.you may need to adapt the way you interact with your loved one. if they insist an impossible event took place, or that a fact (like the year) is different than what you know to be true, realize that this is their reality. arguing may only lead to unnecessary unhappiness. instead, enjoy listening to their stories and find small, meaningful activities to do together, such as sharing a meal or going for a walk around the grounds.## practice self-careit’s important to take care of yourself to make the most out of your time together. if you are experiencing grief or frustration, there is a good chance they will also pick up on your emotions and become upset. you may want to consider talking with a friend or therapy professional about your feelings as a way to work through your role in the transition.the better you care for yourself, the better you’ll be able to help take care of your mom or dad.## know that it gets easierthe initial transition into a memory care community can be challenging, and at times your loved one may say or do things that are hurtful. but remember, it isn’t personal.they are coming from a place of uncertainty, confusion, and frustration. accept that their unhappiness is temporary. they will have good days and difficult days.by attending to their care with compassion and love, you are ensuring that they are safe and will continue to have every opportunity for a fulfilling life beyond dementia.find out more about how the kensington falls church can help your mom or dad transition to the highest level of independence without compromising their safety.## recommended additional reading:* [how to pay for assisted living](* [dancing does an older body good](* [meet me at the memory

"i genuinely don't know what on earth to do anymore. before i get into everything, let me give you a little background on myself. i'm 18 years old living in a household with my mother, my father, four cats, and recently my grandmother. i'm in my last year of highschool so i've been super busy with school and basically getting ready for college. but besides that, i'm having a problem that i literally have no clue how to fix. my grandmother has been diagnosed alzheimer's for a little over 5 years now, and she's only been living with us for about 9 months. she hasn't been too bad or anything, she actually has been doing amazing lately, but my dad sees her as this burden. he always makes it seem like my mother and i never help him out with her (even though he leaves me for a day or two while he's hanging out with a friend at a brewery or something) and he constantly says how he is frustrated with life. the worst part is that it is now influencing my grandmother, having her say ""i want to die"" and ""no one wants me around"". what am i supposed to do in this situation? i know i'll be leaving for college soon, but i don't want to leave my mother in a toxic environment like that. how do i make him see that he is effecting the whole house with his attitude?", i suggest you contact the alzheimer’s association. they will be able to direct you to support groups in your area as well as what services are available for your grandmother.i hope this is helpful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/dqbmt6/my_dad_is_making_everything_worse/,,My Dad is making everything worse.
"typing this out just to vent. it's been a hell of a day. quick background. my dad died suddenly almost 2 years ago and we found out mom was farther along with alzheimer's than we'd known. i've spent the last two years helping as best as i can, and we finally got her moved into assisted living a month ago. but i feel terrible. i've taken here out of a familiar house (~45 years), taken her dogs away (she really couldn't care for them properly) and the new place is great with awesome staff and good food, but it's just not what she's used to. the transition is not going well. today we've been called by nursing staff twice. first time, i was already on my way up with her dog and we had a great afternoon. she seemed in great spirits and we walked the dog, talked, everything seemed good. late tonight we got a call again. she's upset, bad headache, talking about wanting to kill herself. i feel like i had to get her out of a 'living alone' situation. but i can't help feeling like i've messed everything up. we've sunk like 15k into the assisted living so far. i'm trying to sell her house to help fund things for the next several years. but if it's not working then i have no idea what to do. part time home care, live in home care, moving in with me or siblings, me or siblings moving in with her... all these options were weighed and i thought we made the best choice.how do you stop yourself from despair when the plans you make don't seem to work out? i feel like i've messed everything up and there is no hope. what a terrible disease. it just eats up everything and everyone. i can't believe how few options there seem to be and how bloody expensive it all is. most days all she wants to do is end it all and we can't even help her go out on her own terms. i feel like i've tried my hardest and failed spectacularly. how do you all do it?", i don’t know but perhaps at the two month mark things will be better? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/a6lyhr/what_a_rough_day/,,what a rough day

"mom (82) was diagnosed with a chronic disease a few years ago. i have taken care of everything during and since, including eight hospital visits (where she insists i arrive before official visiting hours and stay the entire day), doctor's visits, monthly medicine infusions, took over paying her bills, grocery shopping, etc., while holding down a full-time job and trying to live a life. (i do have full poa.) this was a big mistake - i should have insisted my parents hire help, but in the thick of things, all i could do was react. now she is 100% dependent on me. dad passed away end of last year. things were going relatively ok health-wise (she was living on her own) until a hospital visit in late june, and then another in early july. while she is in discomfort, these are things that are treatable. i put her in an assisted living facility closer to me for some respite, because in the past she would just wind up back in the hospital, even with my dad taking care of her, because she'd be confused/disoriented/dehydrated, and we'd have to go back for whatever fall she took. figured this would be better. boy, was i wrong. mom doesn't understand assisted living at all. she expects all meals delivered to her (the facility encourages the dining room for anyone who is mobile), all her medications be exactly on-time (they have a hundred residents, so they even say there can be a window of time for meds), she doesn't want aides touching her, etc. i hired, at ridiculous expense, an additional outside aide to be with her at night for safety for just a bit, but now she likes those aides and not the aides at the facility (probably because the night aides spend the entire night with her vs aides who are in/out serving the facility - we're dialing back the night aides this week and none next). she calls me all hours of the day and night with her complaints and ailments (about 1/6th of which are genuine and related to her illness, the rest is bitching and nonsense). i do think there is some dementia going on, but most of it feels flat-out manipulative. i keep thinking maybe i should drop her back at her house and just stop answering the phone, but i think it will just start the cycle all over again. i have spent days (years) vacillating between mom-the-needy and normal-mom. my heart is consistently broken. on the one hand, i don't want her alone and scared. on the other, the toll this is taking on my health, my husband, and my life is unacceptable. i honestly think i am going to have a heart attack, and am becoming deeply depressed. sleep depravation is becoming serious. one day she says she wants me to have a life and wants to die, and the next says she can't live without me and will be stronger and better because she doesn't want to lose me. our relationship has never been exactly healthy - i've spent my life making sure she had whatever she needed. she keeps saying ""you're doing too much"" while asking for more and more. this is abuse, right? this morning i looked up the definition of narcissism. i wish i had done that thirty years ago. it's her, to a t. so, how do i go on from here? how can i guard and heal my heart? how do i stop feeling like a bad person? what limits can i set? how do i push back without giving in? how can i stop caring so much, so that i stop getting hurt? and yes, i know, i probably need therapy."," are we related? i could swear this is my mother! acts exactly the same way in al and i've done exactly the same thing you have. first, realize you are a good person, dealing with a bad situation.the limits you can set are that you need time away, and to let her figure out the al. pull back on the extra care and tell her you'll be gone for two weeks unreachable, but tell the staff they can reach you if something goes wrong, which it will. yes, you do need therapy. that's the only thing that's helped me. the therapist can help you set boundaries, let you know when you've crossed them, and give you a plan for self-care. at some point you have to say to yourself, you can't help her with everything. pick a few things and do that and leave the rest up to her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/w22nvn/coming_to_terms_with_manipulative_mom_vent/,,Coming to Terms with Manipulative Mom (vent)

"bit of a vent. my parents are a mixed nationality couple living in a third country, and as luck would have it a few years ago i got a job in the same town. for a long time, my mum has been the main breadwinner and my dad worked freelance, more or less successfully in terms of impact in his field, but not financially. he’s dealt with depression throughout his life, and their relationship has been relatively poisoned for quite a long time. there is a vast difference in their status: let me introduce my mum (m), 65, successful no-nonsense businesswoman  who has always taken her health at least somewhat seriously doing things like swimming and marathons, but also drank heavily and has had a benign tumor xrayed to hell as well as thyroid and occasionally weight issues. has had three children and at least one late miscarriage. strong, “protestant” work ethic, quick temper, but adoring of her children. fuck around and you’ll find out what a tongue lashing is kind of woman. creative, charming and can be very funny! today, she has a keen awareness of her (potential) situation, a fear of being alone (hence no divorce), and of her own mortality. furious with us kids that she has no grandchildren yet. they may yet appear. we all mostly love our mum to bits even if she can be a bit of a narcissist and difficult when the topic of children - inevitably- is brought up. has always given us space to do our thing and our mistakes but provided unlimited support of all types. seriously people are jealous of me for having her as a mum and i honestly get it. i’m proud of my mum. now allow me to introduce my dad (f), an obese 65 year old man with a distinguished but financially irrelevant career in his field. a vast network of acquaintances and former colleagues around the globe. f is the funny parent. he has made jokes and puns constantly since as far back as i remember. i have vivid and fond memories of f holding me and a buddy by the hand picking us up from kindergarten. it was pissing it down, and he kept pretending it was lovely weather and me and my friend were in fits of outraged giggles. in the last decade or so, i’ll admit it’s gotten a bit tiresome. obscure references as the punchlines of jokes, incredibly bad puns that border on the anti-joke, i’m the last who’s found these jokes actually hilarious. he’s pushing even with me though. he’s also the musician of our parents, playing a variety of types of guitar and being the “cool retro music guru” of my friends circle - and of my siblings. he’s a tender hearted man, someone i both look up to and occasionally have to stifle feelings of genuine angry exasperation for. aged 45 he had his first heart attack, and his physic and mental health have been at least impacted, if not worsened since. there followed 2 more heart attacks and later a a brutally botched triple bypass (they fucked up cutting him up but succeeded otherwise) that ruined any semblance for a normal looking chest he started getting *fat*. real fat, as well as a heavy smoker and drinker. bottle of wine a day kinda guy for several years now, and a fatalistic approach to life as his health declined and career with it. he’s been so incredibly tired. then, the unthinkable. christmas 2020, after surviving covid for so long, he has a pulmonary embolism after a few months before, surviving a stroke he survived by sheer luck (he even *drove* seeing double! i was so angry). that really hurt him because the stroke had already tired him out so much. he was exhausted. then they thought he had something else and they discovered polyps that urgently needed to be removed. surgery, and the back pains he’s had for a few years now flare up violently. something to do with a muscle relaxin, don’t ask me. my father has not slept more than a few hours since, and that was over a year ago. he cannot lie down, and that’s as someone who already had a low pain tolerance. now he broke his foot and the implant thing got infected and he’s been unable to move for the last four months - including preparing for and carrying out their move to my mum’s home country. it’s lucky i was there to do so much, i only have the worst scenario in my head when i think about it. in her home country , my mum is gonna live with my dad in a new flat. however my grandma, nearly 90 and falling apart, is expecting to spend a lot more time with her. and receive her care and basically have an assistant now until she dies.i can tell she’s terrified of turning into their full time carer and i couldn’t wish that on anyone. our other family helps but she’s the only daughter so my grandma thinks it’s only natural they spend more time together. i don’t know what to do. i’m far away, eight hours drive at least. i’ll go as often as i can but what else is there i can do to help and prevent my mum turning into a bitter shrew and my dad from feeling too much like a burden? has anybody had this disparity before? i watched my gran turn old taking care of my alzheimer’s riddled grandfather. she was broken from the work. my mum would do her level best to die if put in such a position for any length of time i think. it sounds bad but i can see her point as well: she did what she could to stay at least a bit healthy. neither my mum ‘s mother, not my dad really have a tall. they’re very sedentary, and my dad especially now that he doesn’t even have a dog to walk. not that he could anyway probably.  i’m looking after it. until they’re “settled”, whatever that means. i’m guessing not soon. my dad has not been in a healthy state for 3 years and it isn’t looking great. he’s gone from rugged to very weak looking in this time. he is skinny fat sometimes, but mostly fat in general. his weight fluctuates. this could get ugly and i’m not sure how to prepare"," oh dear. this is shaping up to be quite a compicated mess.  if it were me, i think i would try to focus on one issue at a time as they arise, because it it will not be possible to predict what is going to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/vwur6i/im_worried_about_my_parents_who_just_retired_and/,,I’m worried about my parents who just retired and went to another country
"my 78 year old mother fell and hit her head on weds, which resulted in a concussion. she was taken to a local hospital. i live in virginia and my mother lives in washington state. i am an only child. the hospital er did not contact me despite the fact that they had her signed hppa form with my name and contact information on it (i don’t know why they didn’t, but their medical records system seems to have major issues). instead, i found out third hand from a friend of my mother’s who learned from another friend who happened to see my mother  being taken away by ambulance. (my mother has amazing friends, for which i am grateful). i have since been able to talk to her, and her nurses and doctors, as well as her friends, but initially, i didn’t even know which hospital she was at. there was bleeding in her brain. at first they wanted to send her to another hospital in the region since their (only) neurologist is on vacation, but the other hospital was full, so she was admitted as a patient with the first hospital. the bleeding has stopped (thankfully), so that’s resolved, but now they’re worried about her cognitive abilities and vision - suddenly both seem much worse (she can carry on a conversation and sound like herself, but can’t remember what day of the week it is). she also has trouble walking (a lot of wobbling - her balance has always been bad, but again now seems worse). which means they can’t send her home in her present condition, although she desperately wants to go home (she lives alone). it’s still not clear to me what’s going on (maybe she’ll get better?), but the cognitive issues scare me. her mother had alzheimer’s, and the idea of my mother losing herself like my grandmother did is terrifying and heartbreaking.part of me is in denial, and agrees with my mother that they’re overreacting and should just let her go home, and that she’d do better there. but after hearing from her best friend about how confused my mother was today when the friend visited, i fear that the medical folks are right. i am probably going to fly out to wa on monday. i’m nervous about flying with the current covid-19 strains that are around, and worried about suddenly taking leave from work (they’ll understand, but there’s a lot going on) but i feel l need to be there in order to get a handle on the situation. it’s looking like she’ll probably need to be in assisted living, which would mean getting that worked out (i have no idea how feasible that will be or how long it’ll take), as well as dealing with her house. i just hope we can find a place that would allow her beloved cat to come along…..", edit: moved comment down to where i meant to reply,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/vuuz92/the_future_is_suddenly_now/,,The future is suddenly now
"i had to move my dad 1000 miles last summer to live close to me because it turned out his girlfriend had committed beneficiary hijacking and had 80% of his assets directed to her adult children upon his death. (it was all very sneaky and took a while to unwind. we were initially alerted by his bank.)i am dad’s poa for health and money, and manage all his health care, finances, etc. i have a sister that lives where he moved from who has always been a taker. when dad didn’t have dementia he always strove to maintain equity in what he gifted my sister and me, at least on the surface. she is a hard core mooch, and i think hit him up for stuff way more than i ever did. and while our family makes more than hers, she makes a solid middle class living, good retirement, etc, with support also from wealthy in-laws. she is just weird about money. anyway, the first thanksgiving she was away from dad, she asked us to help pay for her family’s travel to visit from his money. with airfare (she can only fly comfort plus!) and hotel (we didn’t have room for the whole fam) it came to over 3k dollars. at the time, i told her as dad’s executor that i would eventually be balancing this out, as it was kind of a big gift that was never extended to my family when we travelled to visit him for over 30 years. (we never asked, because we are/were grown adults and expected to pay our own way.)we are putting das’s money in a trust to help curtail this kind of thing, so my question is, do i balance the scales now before the money is sort of locked down for the next 5 years? my hesitation is when i try to explain to dad about making it ‘even,’ he doesn’t understand - it is a level of abstraction he can’t really do anymore. so, it feels a little creepy, but i am sure that pre-dementia dad would have been fair about this. it just really bugs me, as i am the one here doing all his support, and don’t really ask for anything. also, the amount is something negligible to him financially. tl:dr dad w/dementia  ‘gifted’ sibling a certain amount of money- should i balance the scales as his poa if he would have done so pre-dementia?"," if the 3k is negligible, let it go. as executor, you are entitled to be paid for the work you do when wrapping up his estate, this amount can vary be state.don’t bother him with financial issues, he is not aware of what is going on. just try to manage the money fairly, try not to let your sister bug you. in the long run, if you do things fairly as best you can, you have done the right thing. you’ll sleep at night.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/vtgo84/dementia_and_a_money_decision/,,Dementia and a money decision

"first time posting here so please be gentle with me. i have been my mother and father’s full-time, live-in caregiver for years. i recently quit from burnout, huge stress and built up anger and frustration from harassment, massive interference in my job and a hostile work environment and more! my sister, who we can call ‘j,’ is a bald faced liar, gas lighter and emotionally unstable, devious person after complete control of my mother and all my parents money and possessions. this has been demonstrated time and time and time again and believed not by just my ‘good’ sister and i but by others as well. several different professionals we’ve worked with to find housing or regarding my mother’s health except have commented on how out of control and emotionally imbalanced j is. she has been formally diagnosed for several years and has a psychiatrist and therapist and is taking medication. i privately told my mother i was taking a 2 month break and then would come back to work. i did not tell my sister because her modus operandi is to mangle and ruin my plans as thoroughly as possible.my mother agreed very much that i needed a long break. i have worked very hard for them with many emergency room trips, chronic long term illnesses and caring for them when we were all sick with  covid etc. etc., etc. my poor father got a serious infection and so i had to start working again to take him to the er and to visit him when he was hospitalized for a month because he especially needed the support and encouragement.  my mother didnt go to see him very much because she has been incredibly tired and was sleeping most of the time. then she started taking more oxygen and was able to visit him for shorter periods of time.my mom tends to agree with whoever is she spending the most time with. so she knows my sister is mentally ill and doing strange and dangerous things but then when my sister comes and spends time with my mom my sister will convince her of completely different things.  my sister and my mom have always had a weird relationship where she’s the favorite and golden child. it’s weird in that my mom doesn’t want anyone to say anything bad about j, the mentally ill child or often readily believe anything bad about j even though she knows that she has a mental illness that can cause her to do things that people without mental illness wouldn’t do. but if i sit down and slowly, gently explain about her mental illness and how this can affect her she will usually come around. the problem is is that she has mild dementia and it’s worsening and i think it’s more difficult as she gets more confused for her to know what the truth is. she’s still able to to know what the truth is at this time but i don’t know how long that will last for.anyway i’ve been in this field 20 years and have been a caregiver for about 10. i’m an educated person and i’ve done a lot of research and learned a lot. we’ve been working with an elder law lawyer re my parents trust but my sister fired her because she manipulated my parents into deciding not to leave the house to me. they wanted to leave it to me for a source of income and if i were to ever sell it…it was to be divided among the rest of the kids.my sister put adult protective services on me. they cleared me and they turned around and now they’re investigating her. they will visit her unannounced tomorrow while she is staying at my mothers home.i had to leave my home where i had a wonderful downstairs apartment in my parents house because my sister got my mom to believe that i was a danger to her. she was trying to set me up so i had to leave fast. so i’ve not only lost my job but i’ve also lost my wonderful apartment because i’m too frightened to go back there because my mom favors my sister so and i know my sister is capable of a great many evil things. i’ll probably let you know what happened after they the adult protective services visits. i don’t have much money and a lawyer isn’t really in my budget although i could possibly hire one just for a little while to suggest a lawsuit and then i think she would back down. but she still will come back fighting and try and try to screw things up again. anyway i have a lot of faith and i am believing that somehow she will be massively exposed for who she is and what she’s done. thank you so much for listening. i feel better just having said this.", it's always good to get it off your chest. sometimes a rainy is the best thing in those moments. i'm really sorry you're going thru this.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/vj4fuu/rant_for_starters_mother_financially_and/,,(Rant for starters) Mother Financially and Emotionally Manipulated By Mentally ill Sister With Disastrous Results
"was i wrong to think it could have helped?i’m between a rock and a hard place with my mom and her aunt. i have lived long term with my mom, always financially supporting her, while my aunt lived in the area. they’re both ss income only. no friends. no relatives but me and my sister who barely acknowledges them. aunt had a stroke last year and became homeless, now on medicaid in nh, wants to live with us. i care for her and want to find a solution for her. mom on the other hand is a raging narcissist with life estate in our house and there is no way she can pay for its upkeep. over the past year she has become increasingly unhinged and abusive. no dementia (we had her checked). falling every month, sometimes with er trips. i have tried to explain the seriousness of the overall situation and finally got her to agree (or so i thought) to me hiring a gcm to arrange for necessary services well vetted by gcm, etc.gcm is very pleasant and knowledgeable. made great suggestions sensitive to our budget. mom hates her. hated the aide who was hired and that lasted one week. mom doesn’t want to wait for gcm to arrange install of proper grab bars and went behind my back and hired dodgy handyman. gcm came for monthly check in visit and mom treated her rudely. it was humiliating. this was supposed to be the outside help that was desperately needed to keep my mom out of the er. wanted to stabilize my mom’s situation so that we could see if my aunt could move in with us. but it’s been a disaster. and i refuse to let my aunt be subjected to this situation, as bad as her nursing home is. (and it is a bad one). how do i move on from this? i’m trying now to focus on my aunt and finding alternatives for her, but all we have to work with is her medicaid. she can’t live alone and can’t afford assisted living or a home aide all day. i’ve even considered us getting an apartment and her going to pace adult day care or even me quitting my job and being a cdpap caregiver for her.i cannot let myself or my aunt be dragged down by my mother’s destructiveness. it is too much.", if you have access to pace that might be a good working option for your aunt.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/viuy1q/hiring_a_geriatric_care_manager_has_been_a_failure/,,Hiring a geriatric care manager has been a failure.

"i need advice on my 90 year old mom. i (49m) have no siblings left, family close by and my dad passed away 11 years ago. i’ve been her caregiver for the past 5 years or so as she has alzheimer’s/dementia. she recently got covid and went the hospital and is now in a skilled nursing facility. i am considering a long term care facility for her because i cannot help her to the bathroom, get dressed or shower and she is now a fall risk. when did you decide it was time for a ltc facility? i feel a lot of guilt should i make that decision."," my mom’s doctor at kaiser permanente looked at her history during a hospitalization--yet another fall over the past 5-6 years.  he basically ordered a social worker to evaluate her and that she could not be on her own anymore.  my mom’s alf evaluated her themselves, to determine independent or assisted status, and what level of assistance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/vimint/needing_advice/,,Needing advice

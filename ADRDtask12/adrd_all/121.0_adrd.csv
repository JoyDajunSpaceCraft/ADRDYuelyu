"bit of a tricky situation. my grandma lived with her son, my uncle, and he was her full time carer. she was very dependent on him. sadly, he died last week after a short illness, totally unexpectedly, and now we're all a bit stuck.basically, every few hours she forgets what's happened and asks where he is. if we don't tell her the truth, she gets very anxious because she can tell something is wrong (because we get sad!). if we tell her, she gets very upset very briefly and then literally spends hours asking over and over again who will live with her now, who will move in with her, why can't we move in with her, and it is exhausting and frustrating. we're all grieving my uncle whilst caring for her, taking it in turns to spend days and nights here until we have a care plan put in place, and we're just knackered. is there a better way for us to be dealing with this? is telling her the truth the best thing?"," my father died a year ago.  my mother, who'd been married to him for 61 years, is hallucinating his presence.   it sucks.contradicting a demented person doesn't help.   when you contradict them, they re-experience the grief, *and then they forget it all over again*.   this is hard both on you and on your grandma.a thing about dementia that sucks:  you need to start lying to the demented relative.  i do mean ""need"".   when telling the truth causes 30 minutes of grief, followed by complete forgetfulness of the grief, all you're doing is tormenting both yourself and the demented person.   lie.  say ""oh, he's just run out on an errand.  he'll be back.""  redirect the conversation.  telling the truth doesn't benefit anybody.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b8v3uj/explaining_the_death_of_my_grandmas_son_and_carer/,Explaining the death of my grandma's son and carer
"i have asperger's and am a live-in caregiver for my grandfather with dementia while i hold down a part-time job.  i'm also trying to get my ducks in a row so i can get back into college and finally get an undergrad degree so i can finally find a career and not just a job.  i drive a 15-year old car and live rent-free thanks to my father who also lives with my grandfather and i, and i recognize how lucky i am and i am truly thankful to be in this position. &amp;#x200b;however...  i'm so stressed.  all the time.  everything is so stressful.  i'll be sitting in bed at night watching netflix and i'll find myself clenching my jaw.  i'll be trying to go to bed at night and find it difficult to breathe because my chest is tight.  i don't know exactly what i'm stressed about, but everything is so damn stressful and anxiety-inducing.  i've started taking xanax before bed, and i don't like how often i'm having to take it just to be able to breathe.&amp;#x200b;now, i need a new car.  it's either spend $1k on repairs/upkeep or start paying $250-$300/month on a car payment for the next five years.  i only make $750/month and i live for the vacations that i take to get away from the stress of my home life.  the only things on this earth that i look forward to are my vacations.  i'm afraid, with a car payment, i wouldn't be able to afford those vacations at all.&amp;#x200b;i *need* to be able to get away.  i'm an anxious ball of nerves just living my day-to-day life in trying to keep myself above water, emotionally speaking.  i don't know what decision is best for me right now: the new car or the repairs.  i'm so stressed about it all i'm near to tears.  if my home life were easier, i could easily get a full-time job like i used to have, or even pick up a second job, but i'm having such a hard time managing my depression that i'm calling out of my current job more often than i should and more often than i'd like.  it's just so hard.&amp;#x200b;if anyone else has felt this way or understands on any level, i'd love to hear that i'm not alone.  i sometimes feel as though this anxiety isn't well-deserved and my brain is exaggerating things or i'm being over-dramatic.  like, other people can handle doing all this and more, why can't i?  but then the logic part of my brain tells me that everyone is different and i shouldn't compare myself to others.  i do still need to be able to afford to live, though.  life is so hard.&amp;#x200b;thanks for letting me ramble, i know this is barely on-topic for this subreddit, but i thought maybe people here would understand better than elsewhere.  thanks again.", you're allowed to feel that way. of course you are. being a caregiver is fucking hard. it is stress beyond stress. can your grandfather qualify for medicaid? or maybe some part time home nursing from medicare? that could help a lot. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b8cq6z/i_dont_think_i_want_advice_i_just_need_a_safe/,"I don't think I want advice, I just need a safe place to rant."

"i don’t have anyone to talk about these things with, so please excuse the enormous length of this rant. it’s basically a novel. (tl;dr at the bottom for convenience).    a little backstory: i just turned 27 (female). about two years ago, both of my parents passed away less than a month apart. i was extremely close to them and took care of them due to health issues from years of substance abuse. my maternal grandmother lived down the street from them. besides my elder brother who is not a great person and is irrelevant to this story, there’s no other family here in this state. everyone else—including my grandmother’s 3 sons (my uncles)—live up north.  one son hasn’t been heard from in 15 years, one son hasn’t seen her in 15 years but sometimes calls, and another son saw her two years ago for a day and hasn’t for about a decade before that (and he calls sometimes).   &amp;#x200b;when my parents passed away, i felt obligated to step up to the plate as my grandma has been showing signs of cognitive decline for years and as i said, there’s no one else around. she’s 91 now for reference. she has that typical depression-era coldness often found in people her age. she’s always been quite snooty, judgmental, and unaffectionate. she had expressed on numerous occasions that she’d rather die than go to a nursing home and i get that. while i could never establish a close bond with her, i do love her and care about her. i thought that since my parents were gone, i would just move her in with me to spare her that experience. i am used to caring for people and while she’s snooty, she has generally been pretty docile. over the years, her vascular dementia has inevitably advanced and she’s had a couple mini-strokes (tias).   &amp;#x200b;to sum up her entire current condition, she is pretty close to being bedridden. it’s just around the corner. she barely remembers moment to moment, conversations go in loops, she makes up stories, she has sundowners, sometimes she thinks i’m her sister, develops obsessions about time/date/year/holidays. she’s stuck on the week of christmas. i don’t correct her and just reply simply. i basically know the drill regarding how to interact with her and i’ve read all about it on dementia websites. every once in a while, she will surprise me by having a good day.  &amp;#x200b;she’s pretty immobile without aid and a walker; she can barely see; her hearing is awful; she wears diapers as she is totally incontinent and sometimes has bowl movement accidents of all varieties; makes messes with food that are worse than a toddler would make; is constantly picking in her nose, mouth, ears, and eyes; she somehow gets literal shit under her fingernails; she has skin cancer lesions which ooze; her skin cells get everywhere like snow. she’s basically a biohazard. i spend so much time cleaning her and cleaning up her room/bathroom to deal with all of that. from changing her diapers, to dressing her skin lesions, to scraping under her fingernails. everything. i do it all. i do have sitters who watch her while i’m at work/school and i have cameras set up so that i can see her from my phone. however, my whole life basically revolves around her and her care. i can’t venture too far and have to consider her every need. i signed up for this, and i understood these were things i needed to do. it still isn’t very fun and is quite frankly frustrating. being caretakers yourselves, i’m sure you get that.   &amp;#x200b;the gross things do suck, but they don’t bother me as much as her personality. i can clean her messes all day, but it’s interacting with her that is the most exhausting thing to do. she yells at me for changing her diaper and tells me that i better make it quick. if i say one thing, she has to say the opposite. for example, if it’s her idea to go to bed…i will say “great, i’ll help you into bed.” then immediately she forgets it was her idea and says it’s too early to go to bed, and acts like i’m \*utterly ridiculous\* for bringing it up. another example of her personality is that i brought her to an adult day care so that she could get some social interaction. when it was over, she stated that she’s above all of those people and they’re all retards who are not capable of conversing with her on her level. honestly, she was the worst and oldest one there. i observed her from afar and she talked to no one. she just sat there chewing on some cookies by herself, looking lost. somehow she forgets every single thing, but remembers that one time i brought her there. when i suggest it again, she says they’re all too stupid for her. in other words, she’s extremely narcissistic and always has been. when i was younger, she would say similar things to me. if we were in a store and i said i liked something, she would say “i don’t much care for it. i have expensive taste, you know.” what kind of thing is that to say to your kid granddaughter? she’s just always been snooty with little self-awareness. she has to say “oh-pal” for opal, or “ad-ver-tiss-mint” for advertisement. she’s not from some fancy place, she’s from harlem.     pride is definitely her sin of choice. her hearing is on borderline deafness (she refuses hearing aids). instead of admitting that she can’t hear me, she says i pronounce things weird because i’m from florida and she can’t understand me. it couldn’t possibly be her fault. um, what? so i talk a little louder and slower (but in a neutral or nice manner), and she accuses me of yelling at her. another thing is she loves to play the victim. i’m surprised at how manipulative she can be despite her severe dementia. i’m not sure she actually formulates this consciously (because i cannot say it enough, her dementia is almost end stage) but it just seems to be ingrained in her. she makes up stories to suit her playing the victim to the two sons who do call. they don’t really care about or know me on a personal level, and they don’t believe she’s as advanced as i say. i’d like to say now that i know she has no idea what she’s saying or doing. it’s not her fault at this point. i do not treat her poorly, do not correct her, try to make things as easy as possible for her, am gentle with her. i genuinely feel bad for her and know that aging must suck ass. i always find myself feeling immense pity for her despite thinking she’s narcissistic. \*this leads to the whole point of me making this post…\*     today i put her on the phone with one son who talks to her a couple times a month, and usually she doesn’t talk too much shit about me which surprises me. she does talk shit about everyone else (her other sons, people she used to know, people she makes up). sometimes she talks shit about the son she forgets she’s on the phone with, lol. anyway, the point is that today i heard her say that she needs to move in with a better person because i’m not good to her. she was laying her victim story on pretty thick. this is the first time she’s said something like that. i honestly couldn’t help but feel super angry, knowing that i am basically sacrificing some of my youthful years for \*her\* after just losing my parents who i am still grieving for every single day. i change her disgusting fucking diapers, cater to her every whim, and i’m not good enough? i know she can’t help that she said that. i know she has no idea what she’s doing. but holy hell, did that piss me right off. i think it pisses me off so much because i know her son will think it’s true. then it will spread to the rest of the family who has no fucking business with us at all. i’m not really looking for advice on how to handle her because i do it all by the book despite the thoughts inside my head that i have expressed to you. but if anyone can relate, it’d be cool to hear about that. i hope i never get like that. that’s the scariest part about it all…we could end up just like them one day. if i get like that, i hope i’m one of those cute, old sweeties. i really don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or be a burden. also, it kinda sounds like i'm playing a victim here and i get that i might sound hypocritical. please keep in mind that these are my thoughts and i don't usually express them.     tl;dr: after years of caring for her in all ways possible, gma with vascular dementia is starting to tell distant family over the phone that i’m basically not treating her well so that she can better play a victim. it upset me even though i’m aware she doesn’t know what she’s doing. also, aging sucks!"," i'm so sorry for what you are going through. >i think it pisses me off so much because i know her son will think it’s true. then it will spread to the rest of the family who has no fucking business with us at all.in mine & my husband's recent experience, the ""family"" doesn't care what goes on, as long as they don't have to deal with it.  i know it's hurtful that she or they will ""talk"" about you, but you know that you are giving the best care possible, with no outside help.  i wish you the best of luck.

"my dad has early onset dementia and we finally moved him into an assisted living place (he’s early 60s). he hated the idea initially but the facility is actually super nice and i think he’s ok with it now although he keeps asking how much longer he has to stay.he has to wear a wander guard, but his dementia isn’t that bad so he’s not in a memory care unto and is out with the rest of the old folks. so most of them don’t have a wanderguard. my biggest issue with the place is the alarm for the wanderguard when we take him out. i was visiting him yesterday and we went in and out of the building multiple times (shopping, outside to the pool, etc). and the alarm kept going off. the staff member would get up with us to walk over to the door, stand there and wait for us to go out, let the alarm go off, and then turn it off. there was one staff member who was also definitely not in a hurry and kept telling us to just walk out the door and would let the alarm go off for like a minute. i know there’s no way for them to predict when we will come back in, but is there no way for them to temporarily disable it before we walk out? all the old folks kept asking why the alarm kept going off and for so long and i also heard some old ladies gossiping about “white bracelet” people on the day my dad moved in, so it’s clearlh a stigmatizing thing. does the system force you to make the alarm go off? you can like put in the code before the person walks out? i’m asking here because i’m wondering if this is something it’s possible to complain about because it’s definitely putting a damper on my dad’s experience and he’s already mentioned to me some of the old people have said he can’t sit with them and i think it’s further stigmatizing him. i just don’t get why the alarm on that specific door can’t be turned off for like the 30 seconds he walks through it instead of letting it go off for a minute and everyone staring at him. is it the same at all facilities?"," where i work is kind of the same: people who are elopement risks wear wanderguards, but they do not set off a loud alarm. rather, nurses and caregivers receive an alert which we immediately respond to, but no one else can hear. there is no stigma. if someone asks what the bracelet or anklet is for (some ppl wear them on the ankle which can hide them under the pants ), we tell them it’s like a life alert and contains some important medical info like allergies and whatnot. the wanderguards also have a button which can be pressed for help from anywhere. sometimes the non wander risks ask why they can’t have one! loledit: the alert we receive when someone attempts to elope comes to our pagers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b7p5bq/wanderguards_at_assisted_living/,Wanderguards at assisted living

don’t hate the person – hate the disease. they can’t help it. (it’s not only ok to hate the disease with every fiber of your being it actually helps) 
don’t ask – tell. decisions are hard. if you’d like to include them and give them a choice then never ever more than 2 choices. if they look confused ask them if they want you to decide. they always will. 
you are, by definition, exhausted. you almost undoubtedly won't realize how exhausted until it's over. it’s a (a steel plated royal bitch) job. take breaks. take a “minimum day”. (also known as the “don’t die before they do” rule) 
clean and comfortable is all that really matters. note that “fed” is not on that list. often they just 
can’t or won’t eat. that’s ok, don’t worry about it. you can try some ensure if it's bothering you. butter pecan is popular. 
therapy helps more than you will believe. you can talk about the things you can’t tell anyone else, 
especially family. and get help coping. and a good therapist can help you recognize your triggers. my dog leaving the room when i'd get worked up was an excellent signal. my therapist was all over that. 
lying is completely acceptable and necessary. if it helps, lie your ass off. what good is it going to do to tell them their sister died? if they think they’re in houston when you’re in chicago – what possible difference does it make? 
making agreements doesn’t work. they won’t remember it and all it will ever do is aggravate you. they  really do mean it that very second but it’s gone almost immediately. again, don't ask - tell.
never, never, never turn down help. even if you don’t really need it right now. you’re laying a 
groundwork. (my biggest mistake)
your grief process is going to be completely different from most. in fact, when it finally happens people  who don’t know might see a long-term caregiver as uncaring. you’re not, you’ve just already been through a lot of the process already. that's not saying you're not going to be devastated, you will be, but you do know it's coming.it's still going to hurt though. bad. ...........as an aside to all this. my sister was really worried about me. what i finally told her was i'm -never- going to be the same ""good"" i was. but i will be ""ok"" at some point. and that ok will be my new good.", staggeringly helpful op....thank you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b789ag/my_wife_died_very_recently_from_vascular_dementia/,My wife died very recently from vascular dementia and ischemic strokes.

"everything is set and scheduled to move my sister with ftd from her apartment of 8 years to a memory care facility.&amp;#x200b;i'd love some advice or tips for making this as smooth as possible.  my sister is opposed to moving and has severe memory problems.  we've discussed the need to move for months and she often agrees with it in theory, but turns 180 degrees when it's presented in concrete terms.  recently have told her she has to move by the end of this month (which is true), but she forgets most of these conversations and in her more lucid moments is determined not to move because she believes nothing is wrong with her.  in her less lucid moments (which are much more frequent than her lucid ones), she conjures up fabulist thoughts like her cat is moving, or she's going to live with her other brother in germany or her friend is going to come and stay with her, or she's going to be locked up in an institution, or that if she moves everyone will think shes a ""freak"" and will abandon her.  none of that is true, of course.  we've not been able to get through to her most of the time and when we do, her understanding is fleeting and is often forgotten minutes later.&amp;#x200b;well now the move is this monday and we are debating the best way to approach move day.  right now we plan to get her out of her apartment early to go to breakfast - meanwhile the movers will come and transport the necessary items to the facility.  then she has in-processing scheduled for 1pm, which is about 2 hours before she usually starts sundowning.  what i'm not sure about is how forthright to be on that day - either tell her from the beginning that today is move day and deal with reactions for the rest of the day - which we we can't really predict - or wait until we show up at the facility.  once we do show up, her stuff and her cat (the most important thing to her) will be there and her close friend and relative (who has been living with her for three weeks), will also stay for the first few days, so there will be support and familiar things.&amp;#x200b;any thoughts or advice on how to handle move day for an ftd family member?  thank you for any experience and insight you can offer."," i just wanted to update my situation.the move went better than expected, but was still one of the more unpleasant experiences of my life.  it was definitely a huge benefit to have her stuff and her cat moved and set up in the new place before her arrival.  she was really angry initially, but calmed down by the end of the day and has been doing well.  she still talks about going ""home"" to her old apartment, but she seems to like where she is at.&#x200b;so i'm hopeful for the long-term that she will adjust and we are all just really happy that she's getting the care and supervision she needs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b6z6cg/how_to_handle_move_day/,How to Handle Move Day
"as my title says, i am really really struggling to cope with what i feel like is the loss of my my grandma due to her severe dementia because really it's like she hasn't been alive for the last 5 years even though physically she is still alive. i'll try to give some background information but i really don't know a whole lot since my mom and aunt have been handling everything but my grandma is early 70s and i am currently 22 but was around 17 when i feel like i really lost her to her dementia. no one else in our family has experienced dementia or alzheimer's or anything similar let alone in their mid 60's so it was something that was totally out of left field and i never expected and i don't think i have really processed it until this year to be honest. i'm graduating university in june with two degrees (esl and spanish), getting married in august and moving out of state in september. i always looked up to her so much and she was such an amazing, strong, independent and progressive woman and it crushes me that she can't see who i am now because i think she would be so incredibly proud of me. all of this may seem sort of childish but it's really been weighing heavily for the last nine-ish months that even though she is still alive, she won't be at any of these events and even worse to me is that i can't even let her know about all these exciting things in my life because she has such severe dementia. i'm just incredibly sad because she has always no matter what been extremely proud of me and loved me so much that i just wish with all my heart she knew about what i'm doing. i feel like it would all be easier to cope with if she had passed five years ago because that's so final and you can carry out the grieving process and such but instead this feels like such a purgatory since i can visit her and talk to her and tell her everything that's happening but i know that she cannot understand and it breaks my heart because i love my grandma so so so much and it's so heartbreaking to see her like this and to not be able to tell her about everything happening in our lives because yes her body is still here and functioning to the best of it's ability but she herself as i'd always known her has been gone for five years. thank you so much if you read all this i just feel like i've really been bottling this up and am now coming to the realization of how much it has effected me and wanted to reach out to a community who has most likely struggled with the same feelings and am wondering how any of you got through it or if you're going it through it now even."," i know exactly how you feel. my grandmother and i have always been extremely close, i was always with her throughout my childhood. she’s been struggling for years i’d say she’s in stage 6 and we as a family have to take care of her. we had her in a facility but they couldn’t look after her the way she needs. it has been incredibly hard to care for her and grieve the loss of who she was and knowing that i can’t talk to her anymore. if i’m honest i find myself wishing she would just pass. i feel so guilty for that but she’s not living she’s just existing. so yeah you are definitely not alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b6fl2v/how_to_deal_with_someone_being_gone_but_still/,How to deal with someone being 'gone' but still alive
"tl;dr : 5 day/24 hour caretaker/full time online college student/mother/homemaker, frustrated with this life, unfairly angry at my grandma for her loss of simple routine behaviors and for treating me and my kids in an almost abusive manner.  i know it's the disease, but i am drowning just trying to stay afloat.this ended up super long and it's a vent... i hope it's allowed.  sorry for any offense i may cause...hey y'all,i have been lurking here for the better part of a year and i feel like such a shit person for not being as understanding to the disease as many of you are.  i am so frustrated with my (maternal) grandma.  i have been taking care of her in exchange for rent to my parents for the last 2 years and 4 months.  my dad, because he is retired, helps out a bit, but is not a fan of being a caretaker so he can be as difficult as my grandma.  i have been caring for her, taking her to her appointments, washing her clothes, making sure she is fed, that she is taking her medication, and most importantly answering her questions and assuaging her fears.  &amp;#x200b;she has just, within the couple of months, begun another decline where she is becoming less and less sanitary.  she is not showering properly or regularly, though i am constantly reminding her when she gets up to shower before getting dressed, and it has now come to me getting all her clothes ready and walking her to the bathroom, she will shower but not wash or miss something, or get out of the shower and put on dirty clothes because she forgot that i gave her clean clothes.  when she uses the toilet, she will do one of two things, use too much paper and the toilets get clogged, or revert to her youth and throw dirty paper in the garbage can.  i have a 4 year old, and having dirty paper in the bathroom is putting a strain on me that i never knew i would have.  i am constantly disinfecting and cleaning her accidents, and i am so tired and i cannot bring myself to sit in on showers with her, nor can my mother, who is a nurse and her daughter.  &amp;#x200b;another thing that is getting to me is that she has sticky fingers.  i am always finding other peoples' things in her possession.  i have a ring that my boyfriend gave me about 5 years ago, if i forget it in the bathroom, she takes it thinking its hers and she will hide it so no one steals it and then won't remember where she put it.  she tries taking pots and pans and bowls from the kitchen thinking they are hers, and when i gently remind her that they are in fact my mom's, she gets angry with me saying specifically ""you don't know!""  in fact, this is what prompted my posting here, she said that a bowl she was eating out of was hers, though she never had a bowl similar to it in her life, and she got angry and started saying that i didn't know and i wasn't here when she brought it for salsa or menudo or something.  i told her today that what she was saying was very rude and she didn't have to be so rude to me, and she yelled at me that i was picking on her.  &amp;#x200b;i am a full time student, i have two kids, i am starting my first job in a long time in less than 2 weeks, and my aunts and uncles are resistant to helping out.  i have one aunt who takes her for a weekend once a month, my parents are 'on-duty' on the weekends, and i am 'on-duty' for the rest of the time.  while i know that having my rent taken care of is nice, it's not really taking money out of anyone's pockets for me to live in my parents' house rent free (it's always been the deal that if i am in school, i would have a place rent free), but i was (up until i was hired) contributing around $700 a month to the family in food and household necessities, so in a way i was paying my way.  my aunt (who takes her once a month) was controlling her money, paying her remaining bills and such, but barely giving me or my parents any of my grandma's money to care for my grandma.  we came to find out that she was woefully mishandling the money and my uncle (my mom and aunt's brother) has taken over the money and is now giving us exactly none.  probably because he is trying to fix what my aunt broke, but being told that i can't use her bank card to buy her medications or to pay for some groceries to feed her, is draining on everyone in my house.  &amp;#x200b;the problem i have is that i could over look all of this, if i liked her more. she wasn't the nurturing person that you would expect grandmas to be.  i remember being yelled at a lot, watching her hit my sister for being difficult, yelling at my grandpa who i loved dearly, and just kind of being there and loving out of obligation.  don't get me wrong, i love her, but i am finding it really difficult to like her, especially now that she is beginning to treat my daughter (who is diagnosed with add, depression, ptsd, and slight anxiety) like crap.  she will start yelling at her because my tween kiddo is trying to gently remind her that she shouldn't put \[someone else's item\] in her walker pouch but instead somewhere else, and my grandma will bite her head off.  about two weeks ago she shouted at my 4 year old son in his face because he got upset that she bumped into him.  i was pissed.  i grew up being yelled at and hit, then i was in an abusive relationship for 4 years that nearly killed me, so i am hyper-sensitive to these behaviors and i refuse to have my children know that life.  i don't know what to do anymore.  i am so frustrated that i sometimes want to throw her messes in her face and yell at her that we are not her servants.  i never will, and in fact, 90% of the time that i have these thoughts i have a conversation with my grandpa (who passed nearly 7 years ago) to apologize for thinking about treating her like that because i am mumbling under my breath about how angry i am at her and i believe that he can hear me.anyhow, thanks for reading if you read this all.  i am just really frustrated and i have no outlet where i can just release without sounding ungrateful or resentful to my family.&amp;#x200b;(according to [this]( she is at stage 6, only diagnosed with senile dementia.)"," i would really suggest a support group. when my mom was dealing with my stepdad with dementia, it really helped her to see that many people go through the same thing. some of the things you mention are due to the dementia because i remember him going through those stages. it also helps you have some compassion when you realize how afraid they are. they are reverting to childhood and in the process of

"this may get long, and i apologize for that, but i want to share my story in the hopes of helping others. my dad is in a care center (my mom has been deceased for 10 years) due to his dementia. he’s always been a bit forgetful at times but it became increasingly apparent that he could no longer be relied upon to adequately take care of himself. we found an amazing facility that has memory care and he is well taken care of. of course, he keeps saying he hates it there and has nothing to do, but when he doesn’t know we’re there and can see what he’s doing, he’s having fun with activities and chatting with others. on to the real reason i’m writing this. he grew up on a small farm with an older brother and sister. the sister is in another state and the brother is here in the same town. 15 years ago (when dad was still clear headed) my uncle went to the farm and burned the buildings down. the house, the barns, all of them. they were rotted and leaning, the cows on the property were pushing them over, it was just an unsafe situation. there was nothing salvageable when he did this and it truly was the right thing to do.  the past year or so my dad has been exceedingly distraught about this. he keeps saying uncle “bill” burned the buildings last week and he shouldn’t have because they were in great shape, they just moved off the farm! *i need to mention that my dad knows everything and everyone, it’s just all on the same time plane. he lives down the street from my brother, when i’m actuality they lived in the same street 35 years apart. he knows both events happened, just not that there was any time between them. he has been upset and we’ve told him that uncle “bill” burned them down 15 years ago but he fights that thought. so, i decided to ask why he was so upset. he said it was because “bill didn’t even ask for my permission to do it!”  i decided i needed to fabricate a story to make him feel at ease. the story facts now are as follows (to make them easier to follow and understand):-bill asked me if it would be ok to burn the buildings (false) which eased dad’s mind -bill looked at every piece of wood (false) and saved those that were salvageable (true) but he told no one but me (false) so only i have access to any of the old wood (false)what i did do was go to the lobby of hobbies and buy a small bundle of old barn wood slats. i then fashioned them into a [cross]( i told dad that this wood is from his original home and that anytime he looks at it he can remember that he still has a piece of home with him. he hasn’t had a single issue since. i don’t even feel guilty for lying. it has put his mind at ease. he is no longer agitated or upset with his brother (who is understanding and compassionate) and he has a “piece of home” with him. one thing i’ve learned, as long as the lie doesn’t physically harm them (causing agitation or discomfort), whatever we can say or do to keep them happy is fine. i know one lady in the center who “won the lottery” every day that i see her. we chat about how she’s going to spend her money. it keeps her happy and she enjoys it. who am i to crush her joy?"," my dad's caregivers call it ""therapeutic lying""  (it's a thing, look it up).  it was hard for me at first but my dad could not get over similar issues about his car and house. i just tell him something to ease his mind.  he also asks about family members who have passed away.  easier to just say ""they are fine"" then to have to explain (again!) how they passed.  it is also a way to end the arguments that just seem to go round and round.  just agree and move on.

"hi all, i need your help.tl;dr:does anyone have any resources/suggestions for older individuals experiencing anesthesia induced cognitive decline?my mother had frozen shoulder surgery over a year ago and is still experiencing complications, mostly neurological. she has intense vertigo (the doctors have ruled out any inner ear issues or stroke though), nausea, inability to control eye function (she can't make her brain tell her eyes where to look). sometimes when she is reading action words it's almost like her brain thinks she's experiencing it and gets sick and dizzy. i've also observed some mild memory and neurocognitive decline. she is seeing specialist after specialist and none of them can diagnose her. it has deeply impacted her quality of life and this is something i have no experience with and don't even know where to begin to treat it. from my research i see that anesthesia can trigger cognitive decline/alzheimer's in individuals predisposed to it. does anyone have any resources/suggestions for individuals experiencing anesthesia induced cognitive decline or any other similar experiences? i would love to help my mom heal. i am also worried that last year's surgery has started her on the path to dementia.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b5c28n/cognitive_decline_due_to_anesthesia/,Cognitive decline due to anesthesia?

"my mother (69) has dementia and lives with my stepfather (71).  he is stable right now, but has had health challenges in the past that land him in the hospital for long stretches (1+ month). the last time he was in (last year), my mother was okay being alone but needed one of the kids (there are 6 of us between the two of them) to drive her to the hospital to visit him and to help her grab groceries. she has now gotten to the point where she cannot be left alone. my stepfather is getting overwhelmed and exhausted. he has had some denial over the years. he knows she has dementia but he has been two steps behind each of her stage changes. whenever she loses a skill, he is surprised. i have been concerned for a while about what happens if he goes back into the hospital. he is finally getting around to dealing with this scenario. however, his solution is to sign her up for respite care at a local memory unit. i feel like that would have been a solution last year, but now i think she needs to be in a memory unit full time. my concern is that if he goes back to the hospital, he will leave in an ambulance and it will take time for one of us kids to get there to bring my mom to the memory unit for her respite stay. the closest kid is about 20 minutes away. i am an hour away. my mom will probably be stressed about him leaving in an ambulance--how do we know she will be safe while we drive out to get her? in addition, there's no guarantee that there will be a bed available for her. what then? we all have children at home and jobs. it would be incredibly difficult and disruptive for us to move in with her while we waited for a bed to open up or for him to come home.i am pretty sure at least two of my siblings would support mom going into a memory unit, but the others seems to worry more about how hard this is on my stepfather (and it *is* hard--everyone on this subreddit knows that) and are more willing to disrupt their lives to cover for him. however, even last year when he was in the hospital, they got burned out and they didn't even have to be there all day. i cannot even imagine having to work out all day coverage for her. this is the ""frustration"" part of my title. the guilt part is that i feel incredibly guilty for not wanting to disrupt my life to care for her. she had actually left her full time job and took a part time job when my grandparents' health started failing, so i feel, emotionally, like a precedence has been set for how a good child should act. rationally, i know it's not the same because she was already an empty nester. we kids were all well into adulthood (careers, marriage, kids) when she left her full time job. in contrast, even her oldest grandkids are in college and still living at home over breaks. other grandkids are still in elementary school, middle, and high. those of us with high schoolers (including me) are looking at paying for college, which is another concern with needing to work full time.anyway, just had to get this off my chest. my job is incredibly stressful and i have been looking for alternate work for about two years (still full time) that requires fewer hours, but i am not even getting called in for interviews. it's demoralizing. i feel like i could handle the stress of my job indefinitely, or the stress of my mom indefinitely, but the two together are burying me. sometimes i just sit at my desk and cry because i am so overwhelmed. honestly, i would love someone to tell me i am not a horrible, selfish person for wanting to put my mom in a memory unit. i know it will suck so hard and that both my parents will struggle with the transition. i just worry about her being left alone and i think it will be easier on her, in the long run, if my stepfather is well and can visit her everyday while she adjusts (as heartbreaking as it will be for him to live without her)."," i used to work in, and now oversee, a memory care unit. we have lots of families that bring their loved ones in for respite-some because they ‘need a break,’ and some who want to trial care before committing to a facility. in the years i have been there, only one very lucid woman came and returned home.  the first month is absolutely the hardest. residents, family members, and care staff all ride the roller coaster of emotion and behaviors. what i can tell you, is after that 30ish day adjustment period, we watch residents settle in, feel at home, family members regain their ability to function again, and one huge collective sigh of relief. dementia is not easy. it is unforgiving. there is no point where you will feel great about this decision, but with the right support and facility, you will find solace in knowing you have done what you could in a seemingly impossible situation.  you will find a new normal, in deciding when you visit, making new memories (even if they are just your own), and relief. you deserve to be happy. you deserve to enjoy the life you have built.

"this part deals with a lot more recent issues.my grandpa is now in a care facility.both of my grandparents are so emotionally and mentally demanding and being in my last year of a very intense qualification, both intellectually and physically means i come home tired and snappy most days so having to repeat conversations and ""just deal"" with my gran taking my things from the fridge/ cupboard without asking me first just grates on me.   i got real mad at my mom for keeping some things from me (towards the end and basically the climax of this post) because we never used to hide stuff like that and having my gran in the house really fucked up our family dynamic. i haven't been able to have a real conversation with my mom in two weeks because my gran is taking up all her free time and by the time i get to talk to her, she's either too tired, or doesn't want to talk about that depressing stuff anymore. my granny has decided that since moving to our city/suburb, despite being able to drive and follow directions, she doesn't want to and my dad must drive her everywhere. my dad is currently unemployed and has been since april last year. due to his race and age, it is highly unlikely he will get work before the state-determined age of retirement that most companies adhere to. he had found some work doing programming and it was paying pretty well. everything was fine and he was actually starting to really enjoy what he was doing until my grandparents moved in. suddenly he had to entertain my grandparent and drive them around to see the are and get more comfortable here. my grandpa would ask what he does for work and he would respond with: ""when we get back home, i will continue my programming.""grandpa would be cool with it until they actually got home. then he would nag my dad about being a bad host because he wasn't talking to them. my gran at this point had decided that because she wasn't the only one in the house with my grandpa anymore, she has no more obligations to be his primary caretaker and my dad was there to help at her call. this left my dad with little to no time during the day to get his programming done and he ended up staying up way later than is healthy for him just to finish his work. my mom and i were both at work/college respectively. recently, his sort-of boss let him know that his services were no longer needed but didn't say why until my dad managed to arrange a coffee meeting with him a week later. in the meantime, he sat and stressed that it was because of his lack of productivity that made him unnecessary to the company. we have since learnt that this isn't the situation and it is in no way my dad's fault he is once again unemployed.  my dad lost his temper with my granny and made it very clear that she is still very independent and as such he will no longer be doing things fro her repeatedly. he will demonstrate how to perform a task/activity but she must be able to do it herself as he will not do it for her.  she did not like this and promptly bitched about my dad's behaviour to my mom as soon as she got home. the most recent issue and the one that broke the metaphorical camel's back for me:on friday i came home from a very long and very bad day at school. a person who i detest decided to use me as a desk to write her notes on while the lecturer was demonstrating the next task we had to complete. on top of my food/ control issues that i mentioned in part 1, i also have severe personal space issues when it comes to people i don't know/like/am comfortable with. i got very annoyed but i am severely non-confrontational in public. so i have had this awful day and i just wanted to come home and have a big glass of my favourite lemonade (fizzy drink that isnt homemade). i walk in the door, mom and gran are have a pleasant sounding conversation and i go to the fridge, open it and i can't find my colddrink -i am literally the only person in the house who drinks it aside from the super rare occasion my mom makes this amazing alcoholic beverage called a pimms- i am also the only one who buys it and therefore it always comes out of my allowance. i look over to my gran and she cheerily says she stole it because its the only thing that my granpda will drink lately. i looked at her blankly, closed the fridge and left the room without saying anything to either my granny or my mother. mom comes into my room later, after i bawl my eyes out quietly because i have had enough of the disregard for my personal belongings and boundaries. mom says that she just explained to gran about my food/control issues and gran is very sorry and will buy me a replacement. i said don't bother, i would rather be paid back and to please not force me to eat dinner with her later. mom said i will be eating with everyone as granny wants to apologize to my face. it happens and i am a completely blank human the whole time.  later i went back to the kitchen, after granny had gone o bed, to apologise to my mom and the first thing she says to me - before i can apologise for my behaviour- is: ""i am mad at you but i still love you. your behaviour to granny was very rude especially after she apologised and said she would replace the drinks. ""i responded that it was very hypocritical of her to be mad at me for feeling like my personal space has been violated and acting on it but then expect me not to be mad for what basically amount to theft. i still apologised fro my bahaviour but let her know that it was unacceptable for her to expect me to be cool with someone in my space all the time- i had to give up my own bathroom for my grandparents when they moved in and i still don't use it at all even though my grandpa moved out as my granny still uses it. i am not comfortable sharing that kind of space with anyone and i was so happy to finally have my own bathroom when we first moved into this house 5 years ago after living in a one bathroom house for most of my life. having my own space and being able to set some boundaries regarding it made me feel a little more grown up and now i feel like i had to regress just so my granny doesn't have to give up her personal space/comfort.eventually, i lost it with my mom yesterday because she kept dodging my attempts at civil discussion with her regarding gran's boundary pushing and complete disregard for my personal items. eventually i got it out of her that my gran is pretending she isn't having any dementia-related issues and is blatantly ignoring symptoms.they both are still alive and likely will be for a while but they are not the grandparents i used to know an to be honest i don't particularly want a relationship with them anymore beyond the one monthly visits we used to have. my dad is very upset about his because he thought i would finally be able to rebuild my relationship with my gran when they moved down here because she would be closer and have more free time to do the things we used to do together like movies and baking but she has no interest in spending time with me and i am uncomfortable with her in my space now. he's upset because i never got to do any of this with his mom as she passed when i was too young to remember her and now he sees my last relationship with my grandparent deteriorating to where a i can barely tolerate them. this move was honestly the worst idea in my opinion and i wish it never happened but i understand how my mom wanted her parents closer in the event that something happened to either or both of them.and that is how i lost my last remaining grandparent. thanks fro letting me vent about this.", i’m sorry you’re going through this. it’s not fair at all. i understand 100%. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b25jdl/i_have_offically_lost_the_last_of_my_grandarents/,I have offically lost the last of my grandarents part 2
"hello everyone, ftp and on mobile and my thoughts are a bit everywhere so i apologise for any mistakes or if things are unclear. i just need some advice.my grandmother who i love dearly (the woman practically raised me and my 2 siblings as my parents were negligent and absent for a variety of reasons) has vascular dementia and has been diagnosed with it for about 10 years now.  although she doesn't walk anymore (she broke an ankle a few years ago and can't remember which one so she told us that since she can't remember they both hurt) she's still quite lively and has no issues recognising us or our voices when when speak to her on the phone.the thing is my grandfather, her husband of 50 odd years passed in his sleep earlier this week.  they were in staying in separate rooms which i didn't agree with but my aunt and father were the ones in charge of their care especially as my siblings and i live in another country 10 hours away so although we suggest things it goes ignored.  anyways, he passes and she asks my parents if he is gone and they refuse to answer her and do not want to tell her at all.  they also do not want her at the funeral because it will be too much work to get her ready and they 'do not want another death to happen'.my siblings and i highly disagree with this. although hard and heart breaking, she loves that man with all her might and i know she would at least want to know and have the choice to decide whether or not she wanted to attend.i've done some reading on people who were faced with the same issue and so far the consensus is that they deserve to know and grieve at least once. she will notice he's not they as they always ate their meals together and spent the day time together watching tv.  hell, i've not lived back home for almost 10 years and she always asks when i'm next going to visit because she hasn't seen me in ages.my mind is all over the place because i'm grieving and trying to get through the day and plan all the things i have to do when i arrive for the funeral as i am the oldest grandchild so there is a lot of societal expectations on me.  i can't trust my family because over the years they've never been trustworthy and as i've gotten older i've seen how spiteful they can be (stealing things from the house, refusing to fix my grandfather's hearing aids, practically starving him at one point, not getting my grandmother physical therapy after her injury).has anyone ever been in this situation or even have advice? i appreciate anything you guys can give."," this is a tough one. i want to side with your aunt and your father, because they are the ones who've been in charge and local. at 10 hours away and only having contact on the phone, you are just not going to understand your grandmother's needs and condition like someone who's close by and seeing her frequently at various times of the day.that said when my fil passed we faced this same decision. ultimately we did take mil to the funeral. but we hired a nursing assistant to come with us. this relieved us so we could do our own grieving. if things had gone poorly, the nursing assistant could take her back to the memory care unit. the assistant took her back before sundowning, and we could stay on visiting with the relatives. getting mil back into the memory care unit after a certain hour had become a total nightmare, frequently requiring the fire department to be called in. so we were relieved of that burden on a day when we just couldn't face a scene like that. because we were not just grieving for fil, mil's dementia was one long grieving session in itself. perhaps your aunt and father feel the same way. too much of a double whammy. things went fine. not sure mil knew it was her husband's funeral. she had a 6 second memory at that point. sometimes she realized it, sometimes she didn't. she was cracking jokes throughout the funeral. shed no tears. but she was always very social and definitely enjoyed seeing all the relatives afterwards. she may not have remembered her grandchildren, but she never forgot her sisters and brother. flash forward. she'd ask us repeatedly where is fil? she quickly forgot he'd died (if she ever realized it). initially we'd remind her he was dead and she'd gone to the funeral. she'd grieve all over again. it was horrible. so we decided to lie as that was much kinder. we'd tell her he was working late. every now and then, she'd have a lucid moment and remember. but those occasions were rare.her brother passed next and fil's funeral was the last time she got to see him, and he got to see her, so we were glad of that. we did not take mil to that funeral, and we never told her he had passed. again it just seemed kinder.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b23upm/grandmother_has_dementia_and_her_husband_has/,Grandmother has dementia and her husband has passed away.

"tl/dr:my mother with frontotemporal dementia requires assisted living which she can’t afford &amp; strongly resists. she has multiple influential acquaintances who are encouraging her to resist her diagnosis and the efforts of her family to assist her.--------------------------------------------------------------------hello to you all. i’m sending my best wishes and empathy to you as you struggle with your own hardships, before you read about mine. this sucks. i appreciate you providing a venue to vent, and discuss.  hang in there.*my mother is in her mid sixties. she lives in the (us) state of wisconsin. she has been a compulsive hoarder for the past 20 years, without health insurance or psychiatric care/diagnosis of any kind until reaching seniority. beginning 5 years ago, it became more apparent that she has worsening cognitive issues. subsequently, a psychologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment (mci), and a neurologist further defined this as frontotemporal dementia (ftd). her doctors recommend that she be placed in assisted living and relinquish her driving privileges. she displays no self-awareness of her condition and maintains that she is in perfect mental health.she remains physically active and healthy.she maintains several harmful close friendships, made since the beginning of her cognitive decline. they encourage distrust of her doctor’s advice, and her family. i suspect that these individuals are trying to posture themselves to receive her limited assets, under the guise of assisting a small fringe church which they mutually visit. we have attempted to reason with these individuals, to no avail.my sibling and i have been caring for her this winter. we are removing items from her home, and keeping her in a temporary apartment where we provide her with all necessary supplies. this arangment will no longer be available to us soon.we have been able to keep her from driving for the winter months, although she has become increasingly combative about being kept from driving. her doctors have been quite vocal about disallowing this. she resists this.we intend to sell her small home on her behalf and to put her finances in a burial trust, as the upkeep of the home is obviously beyond the scope of her abilities. she resists this.we have activated financial power of attorney and are managing her accounts. she obsesses over the details of these accounts, regardless, and attempts to intervein.a medical poa has been signed and is kept in reserve should it be required.her income is limited to her medicare/social security benefits, very meager pension allotment from a previous marriage, and a state grocery allotment. her income is approximately $12k annually. and the possible sale of her home which is in very poor condition may result in a trust containing $90k.my sibling and i are seeking advice/ideas from the community regarding:1. how best to proceed in a manner which will allow her comfort within the limitations of her financial resources. additionally, have we overlooked $ resources available to her?2. how to limit the influence of predatory acquaintances.3. how to assist her in coming to terms with her new limitations."," first off let me say i'm sorry you're going through this. my father recently passed after a long battle with ftd. as you probably know ftd is a horrible disease for everyone but the patient. they don't notice the decision, behavior, or memory problems they have. to them everything is mostly normal. we had a very tough time trying to get my dad to understand that something was wrong. he was a machinist and could fix anything and it took him breaking many things in attempts to fix them for him to realize something is wrong. from what i could see wisconsin doesn't have much for support programs. they have a couple of geriatric phsych wards in the state for temporary housing if she becomes violent. as for the friends. if they are just leaches looking for payout from her estate tell them you're in legal control of it and they will get nothing. otherwise maybe public shaming at the church/facebook?  you could ask r/legaladvice if there's some restraining order you could get.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b1ypfz/ftd_diagnosis_with_few_resources_for_care_and/,"FTD diagnosis, with few $ resources for care, and harmful outside influences."
"this is going to be long. sorry.first time poster and honestly very new here but i feel i need emotional support and an outside perspective. i am an only child and as such have not had to share my parents time with anyone but them and this is how i was raised. we have a wonderful family dynamic. i also have serious food control issues in that there are certain things only i eat/drink in this house and if someone wants some, they ask. it has become second nature to my parents (this may come up in pt 2).both of my dad's parents are sadly gone from this mortal coil. but both of my moms are still around and literally kicking at 92 (grandpa) and 86 (granny).  grandpa has been diagnosed with dementia but every time we visited it was good day so we thought it wasn't as bad yet.they used to live about 2 hours away from us and we are their closest relatives (distance wise). we are currently in the process of building a cottage for them on our property and when we first informed them of this decision, they were very open to it but insistent that we not be in each others pockets all the time. all was going well until about a month ago when my granny phoned mom up for their usual weekly call and let her know she sold the house they were living in 2 hours away because ""surely the cottage is finished by now) -spoiler: it isn't. my mom then has to explain that they will have to live in the guest room in our house for the next 2-3 months while the cottage is finished. grandpa is not happy.they move in with us on a saturday and have to put all their furniture into storage aside from beds and two chairs. gran also decides she is going to be bringing a whole bunch or useless/redundant knick knacks with like half-finished pens etc. technically we still haven't officially moved in and we've been living here for three years already and now suddenly they want us to move all of our stuff out of its place to fit theirs in. (lots of home improvement to do before certain things can be unpacked.)the first two nights go relatively okay with me having to re-introduce myself to grandpa about 16 times. granny keeps rug sweeping his mildly no behavior. no one in our family smokes or drinks alcohol for various reasons and apparently this is unacceptable to grandpa who throws a fit about not being able to smoke in ""his own damn house"". we then had to explain that this isn't his house, it was ours and they were staying here till theirs was finished. his response: "" this is a terrible hotel! i can wait to leave. it is awful and ugly and no one is allowed to smoke or drink-theyre taking all my fun away."" one things that start really grating on my nerves is grandpa coming into my room at all hours of the night thinking it's his room as his is right next to mine. both of my doors are always shut but his is always open  one of my doors sticks and he forced his way into my room and started reprimanding me about locking my doors. i told him, "" grandpa,this isn't your room,it is mine and i close my doors for privacy as i am doing homework."" he grumbles and turns around before heading to his room and again opens the wrong door, my second door ( my bedroom is two smaller room with the wall in the middle knocked down but both doors are still there and they both open). once again i have to tell him that this isn't his room and he gets angry with me. gran calls to him a nod gets him into his rook but doesn't even acknowledge me. later that night (and for the next 4 nights) he comes into my room every time after going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, at least 5 times every night. i am a 3rd year college student who lives half an hour away from college but recently my shutty government decided they needed to completely shut down my usual route (and  most others who work in the cbd or further north) and as such this detour now adds another 45 mins to my travel time and i have to be up super early every morning. can you see why him waking me up 5 times a night because he's in my room is an issue?!later that week, on the thursday, we had him committed to the alzheimers and dementia care centre down the road from us. tonight my mom told me that my granny is starting to lose time and get muddled more often which has led to a whole bunch of issues i will continue in my next post should this one be allowed here. i have grown up with these two people and when had a great relationship but now that they were/are in my personal space all the time, i am starting to feel violated and even worse, i feel so frustrated that i can't talk to them about these violations because 5 minutes later the conversation never happened.i have talked to my parents about this and my dad is also getting annoyed at my granny for the things she does (part 2) but my mom keeps asking me to be patient because there is ""no point getting upset about it"". thanks.", tell your parents you have to make this situation work for you too and ask if you can put a lock on your door to keep your grandfather from going into your room.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b1urqv/i_have_officially_lost_the_last_of_mygrand/,I have officially lost the last of mygrand parents. part 1

"this is going to be a rant? or not i’m not sure. anyways.i’m 22 this year and i live with my grandma who’s 94 this year and her dementia is rapidly declining. my late grandfather who lived with me as well had alzheimers/parkinsons so my family knows first hand experience of the symptoms. he passed away when i was 18 and i don’t have many memories with him because we were just kind of distant despite living in the same house, and he was non-verbal for the last few years of his life.in 2016, grandma showed signs of dementia soon after grandpa’s passing. it wasn’t so bad,  there were times where she put detergent in her sugar bowl or ask where the younger version of me is. in june 2018, she had a severe attack of arthritis and her foot went through necrosis. when she had to get her foot amputated, it was like her memory just went from 75% to 50% during her stay at the hospital. it was painful for the family to watch her lose her memories but she was still talking and i would always talk to her when i’m not at school and eat breakfast with her. in addition, i would help change her diapers and shower her. my father is her primary caretaker, although the aunts would come over during the day (when my father is working). miraculously, her foot healed up really fast too and she was going strong albeit the loss of memory.about 2 weeks ago, my grandma suffered from a stroke and heart attack within 2 days, and now she is unable to sit up, talk, or even stay awake for 5 minutes. she could mumble a few words like going to the toilet, comb, sit, and eat, but she cant hold a conversation. her eyes don’t look straight anymore, only on occasion when she’s lucid. previously her left arm and leg were very weak but now there’s some movement. i was too optimistic that as a sign of recovery and that she’ll go back to her own self but mentally she hasn’t showed any progress. i’m so sad because i was the apple of her eye (my grandma has 10 kids.. too many grandchildren to count) and she raised me. although the middle parts are blurry i still cherish the moments with her when she’s most forgetful. i can’t bear to see her like this. i still try to talk to her everyday and feed her, i am a big believer of positive reinforcement and tell her i love her and say nice things to her everyday even if she might not be able to hear me.i feel so helpless. there’s no telling when she will go, but my heart just hurts thinking about her regression which was so sudden."," you know what? you’re still the apple of her eye, she just can’t tell you now. but she probably knows you’re there and takes a lot of comfort from that. so you are giving her the one thing she needs most right now, comfort and a tether to her family - even if she may not be able to recognize them or talk to them. just keep doing what you’re doing; talk to her, hold her hand, give her a mini massage, put lotion on her, brush her hair. all of these things bring comfort and a sense of connection. you’ll be so glad you gave her so much attention, some day, when she is no longer here.

"looking for some advice. my father has memory issues from a tbi back in 2014, and his neurologist has been treating my father with a protocol similar to someone with dementia. in early january my mother passed away suddenly in her sleep, and she was the main care taker of my father so when she passed we had him temporarily move in with my wife and i until we could figure out a sustainable long term solution. every day while with us he would ask when my mother was coming home from the hospital... at first we would have the long, hard conversation that mom had passed away. he'd cry, be upset, etc. the next day he would again ask when my mother was coming home and if we could go visit her. after a week of the questions we started to play into his question and lie to him saying we spoke to her earlier, she'd be coming home soon, etc. this was on the advice of several people including my mother-in-law who works in a memory care unit. she said that if telling him the truth every time he asked was too hard for both him and myself then maybe it would be best to lie to him. fast forward to now - about 2+ weeks ago we moved him into a senior care center with a memory care unit. he's not a patient at the memory care unit, but they deal with dementia and alzheimer's patients and we feel like it's a good fit for now. almost immediately from when i left after moving him in he began calling my phone constantly asking if we could go see mom, when is she coming home, etc. then he started calling all the local hospitals, and in a panic called me asking what was going on and why couldn't he find mom. i drove over to the senior center and we had the long, hard talk again. he cried, got upset... the usual when we would have the conversations. but then the next day he remembered our conversation... and again he remembered the day after. we went out for dinner and he remembered 4 days after i told him. he would ask me what happened, how did she die... questions like that. i was so relieved that maybe things were getting better. then day 5 - he calls me and asks when mom is coming home again.   i'm basically at a loss. if i tell him the truth, he doesn't remember. if i lie, he calls me every 15 minutes asking when we can go visit, are there any updates on mom, etc. i haven't had more than 12 hours away from him to even begin grieving the loss of my mother, and i seriously don't know what to do anymore. last night i couldn't even go out to dinner with my wife for our anniversary without him calling me every 5 minutes. i had to turn my phone off - i felt so awful doing so but i'm at the point where if i don't shut it off i'm going to lose my phone. &amp;#x200b;has anyone dealt with some sort of similar situation and if so - do you have any advice? like i said - i'm at a complete loss at this point as to what i should do. i appreciate any and all help / advice. thanks."," similar boat with my father. i learned long ago that at this point in life, i do and say everything to simply make his moments easier. if there is anything we can learn is that being with someone with dementia is learning to truly appreciate the moment. focus on his intention, which is that he loves your mom. it’s hard. and at times you’re going to want to scream. soothe yourself, accept his situation and respond with kindness as much as you can. it’ll make you feel better. i once lost it after being frustrated by the same questions , and i was the one left upset and angry,  because a few minutes later he already forgot. i now know that no matter what he says it’ll pass.

"i have always had what i would consider a rough relationship with my dad. he is a recovering addict and due to years of abuse he has hepatitis. last year he finally saw a doctor about his bouts of confusion along with some other troubling health related issues and was diagnosed with early onset dementia. i haven’t seen him in almost 5 years and we have talked more since his diagnosis that we have in maybe 10 years.  i have planned a trip and bought plane tickets to see him at the end of the month and i’m sort of terrified. i will be there for 4 days and that will be the most time we’ve spent together since i was maybe 7 years old. when he was first diagnosed he would be a little fuzzy on details or would have a bad dream and call me at 5am worried about my kids. most of our conversations revolve around him planning long motorcycle rides or to move back up north(even tho he is not allowed to drive anymore) or he is mad because “”they” won’t let him drive. recently tho he has gotten worse. doesn’t know what day it is, who my husband is or that we have been together 20 years. he thinks i’m coming to stay for a month with him and we should go to jamaica together. i’ve gotten past the point of crying uncontrollably every time i talk to him and now i just try to enjoy whatever he wants to talk about and let him share his old stories. i occasionally remind him what’s going on but i don’t want to frustrate him as he seems to get worse when he’s stressed. are there any tips you can give that may make this trip easier? any suggestions at all? i am trying to mentally prepare myself for seeing him and having some hard conversations and i fear with his other health issues that this may be the last time i see him. my kids also want to visit but i’m not sure how well they would handle it."," glad you reached out for support.first of all, if you can afford it, i strongly recommend that you stay at an airbnb or motel. if you are sleeping over at his home, you will feel like a prisoner and it could be overwhelming. and i would recommend this even if he didn't have dementia, because he is also a recovering addict and speaking from experience, having a parent with addictions is challenging enough, let alone also with late-stage, early-onset dementia. you will need some breathing room after each time you hang out with them.i think if his dementia is that advanced, it could be traumatizing for younger children. i don't know how old your kids are. if they are younger than 15 or 16, and if they don't get a primer on dementia ahead of time, they may be very uncomfortable and not get anything positive out of it.you are a very brave person. my mother had schizoaffective disorder (but refused treatment), early-onset dementia, and a painkiller addiction (due to rheumatoid arthritis), and she was so mean and abusive i estranged myself from her after approx. age 25 and only saw her a few times before her death (when i was 40 yrs old).give yourself some space to breathe and recuperate after each encounter. and try to plan short get-togethers, like a walk and a meal, or a visit to a local botanical garden. spending more than 2 hrs at a time could be very overwhelming.take good care of yourself. make self-care your priority during your trip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/azbz7q/nervous_about_seeing_my_dad/,Nervous about seeing my dad

"sitting here in the afternoon, stuck at home, because my dad only pays for a caretaker 5 days a week for 5 hours a day. the caretaker's hours specifically coincide with the times i'm most likely to be in class. just kind of needed to vent, if that's okay. my mom has been more aggressive lately, both verbally and physically. she punched my arm several times as i was trying to take away a bowl of oatmeal from her that she hadn't eaten. it had been sitting out for about 7 and a half hours at this point (i had been gone and hoped the caretaker might get her to eat it or refrigerate it, nope.) i called my mom into the kitchen to help me clean up to get her engaged, as she tends to eat/waste a ton of food and make a bit of a mess on the counter. my mistake was asking her to throw out the oatmeal and handing her the bowl. since it was oatmeal my dad made, she instantly went into the thinking that it's her angelic husband who has made this for her, she must eat it! food safety be damned. i firmly instructed her to throw it out and not eat it; she refused and began to try and eat it. i took hold of the bowl and that was when the punching began as she tried to get me to let go of the bowl. in her mind, i was hurting her and tried to break her wrist. i'm aware of the sensitivity one must have in engaging in physical contact with a dementia patient, but it's become difficult. she does things that aren't safe, she tries to get out of the house to bother neighbors, etc. i've recently taken to sitting in front of our door to keep her from going out; my dad has yet to install indoor locks. she rarely listens to me unless she's confused. i'm just sitting here, unable/unwilling to engage her in any meaningful way except turn on the tv and let her play with the dogs. i've left her well alone after the punching because i don't trust myself to not be angry with her. yesterday i felt like the worst person in the world, but i didn't want to do anything with her. i stayed in my room (with the door open) for 4 hours until the caretaker came. made sure she had breakfast, made sure she didn't go outside or do anything dangerous, but... i didn't want to keep her occupied or engaged. i'm so tired of this. i get paid with free rent and groceries to put up with this and watch my mom by myself about 30 hours a week, often having to watch her before i have to go to a difficult class. it feels like there's no way out.i know i have caregiver burnout, but what can i actually do? my dad has made it clear that if i were to move out, it would make things difficult on him, and he doesn't seem to want to have things be more difficult than they already are. i live in one of the most expensive states, so when i actually manage to get a job i can do without being exhausted from my mom's shenanigans, any money i get will go firmly towards university (i transfer this fall), gas, and toiletries. i don't know if i can even make enough money to save to move the hell away from here. a neighbor has continued to offer me a place to stay at her house but.. she's 3 houses down. my dad has every possible way to call me or ask me to come over to watch my mom.it feels like my life is wasting away along with her. i'm 27 and feel so old. i feel like i've been unhappy and depressed for so long. despite my mom still being able to walk and talk and do basic things for herself, she's so incredibly unable to do other things. she's difficult to redirect, and yet whimpers the entire time she's taking a shower. she can still talk, and yet won't wash her hands after using the restroom and sometimes just doesn't even wipe. my mom will be convinced that she is fine and healthy until the day she dies, or until her illness destroys the lives of her husband and daughter. i really don't know which will come first. all i know is that this experience has taught me that if the moment comes when i'm diagnosed, i'm driving myself off of a cliff. i refuse to put someone through this insanity and black hole of guilt, anger, sadness, confusion, and constant questioning. i always feel like i'm a bad person. i always feel like i'm not doing enough. i've posted here before with a another rant, and i'm sorry about that. i hope that with time, i can be more positive and helpful on this s/r instead of just always word vomiting. thanks for reading."," first of all i am sorry you are going through this, it sucks, and you should not be in this position as you are trying to build a life as a young adult.i'm sorry but your mom may not be able to put your needs first (or even think about them) due to her disease, but what's up with your dad?

this has happened multiple times and my mother tries to hide it most of the time. i’ve had to throw him off of her onto the floor before because he hits her in the face. does dementia cause this type of violence or could this have been a life long event that’s just escalated because of the disease? she also refuses to send him to a home because it will use all of her money up.," dementia can cause this type of violence to happen.  some people with dementia get paranoid and are sure their spouse is cheating on them.  some people get a thing called capgras delusions--where they think their loved one has been taken over by an evil twin, so they attack the evil twin.  i'm sure there are other reasons.you have a couple options.  call the police if your dad attacks your mom again.  they will take him to the hospital.  they won't be able to diagnose your dad with the exact type of dementia but they can get him medicated enough to where he isn't hurting your mom---then the docs and social worker will talk to you about how to find the right doctors and resources to get a better long-term solution.  another option is to contact his family doctor, make sure the doctor is aware of what is happening. he/she can set up an appt. (pretend it's a follow up for another medical issue your dad has)---then perform a cognitive assessment whie your dad is there.&#x200b;as far as your mom not wanting to send him to a home because it will use her money up....medicare doesn't help with long term care, but if she has a medicare supplement, they might.    some people are forced to go on medicaid to pay for long term care--ou have to spend a certain amount of your assets to be eligible for medicaid  (usually less than $2000 in the bank, only one car, sell your house).  but if you are married, then medicaid has a new anti-poverty measure that lets the healthy spouse keep a lot more assets.    come to think of it, medicaid is administered by the states, so each state has a different way of deciding how much money the spouse is left with.another option is for you to call adult protective services.  they investigate cases of abuse and neglect for vulnerable adults for senior citizens.  sounds like you have a complicated case.  your dad is being phyically abusive to your mom.  but it could also be said that if your mom refuses to put him in long-term care that he needs, she could be neglecting him.   the social workers will focus on figuring out the best options for your parents (get him diagnosed, get better meds), explain to her how the financial programs help to get her help with caregiving.  &#x200b;&#x200b;",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/awq8wr/father_84_domestically_abuses_mother/,Father [84] Domestically abuses mother
"my grandfather was diagnosed with dementia this week. i was told only hours ago, so i don't know what type of dementia it is, i only know it is not the alzheimer's. the doctor said that in this condition, my grandad is aware that his state is abnormal and that things are getting worse, however he can't do anything about it. that's probably what breaks my heart the most.  however, my whole family is completely new to this and we struggle with ways of communication with him. for the past few weeks, his short term memory rapidly decreasedand he gets confused easily. usually he is fixated on one issue for some time (an hour, let's say) and during that period, it's as if he doesn't really know what are we saying.  for example he keeps on repeating some kind of request or a statement, to which we answer: he looks at us, nods, obviously paying attention (or at least trying to) and a moment later, sometimes as short as a few seconds, he repeats the very same statement. i know it is important to try and talk to him, bring up some activities to engage him in, but we are really struggling with the how. what do we do if he is like this? calmly repeat the same answer, to little or no effect, again and again? try saying it in a different way? i guess reminding him that we told him already is not the thing to do, but i really am knew to this and would appreciate any advice.  we have yet to decide on management stuff, i am aware that there are things to be done and resolved. but at this moment, i just long for an advice on how to connect to the world my grandfather is in, so that i can be there for him throughout it all.

"my (24m) gram is 84 years old and has dementia. she played a very significant role in my upbringing and i love her to death. she made us and especially me her priority growing up couldn’t be any more kind, gentle and caring. my grandpa died three years ago and really set things in motion i think for the disease taking control of her life. she no longer can live by herself and has been moving back in forth between my families house and my aunt and uncles house 4 hours away, staying for about 4 months each time. she stays in a room next to mine which is connected by a door. each night, sometimes up to nine times, she opens that door and peeks in to see who is there. the disease doesn’t allow her to remember that it is my bedroom, therefor every time it’s as if she is seeing me for the first time that day, and is relieved. she asks if i want to come in and watch tv or look at pictures with her because she doesn’t like being alone. she was married to my grandpa for around 63 years and honestly was not alone very much of her life, so this i understand. i also understand that she no longer recognizes our house our house. when i watch tv with her in her bedroom at night, she will say things like “why are all my things here? we’re leaving tomorrow morning to go to the next house”. she also has paranoia about other people being in the house, so she will say she needs to pack her things just in case the people think about stealing something of hers. her bags will be packed in the morning. she will often times pace the house late at night, and i will sometimes find her and take her back to bed and explain to her that we are home. “my parents are asleep, my siblings are asleep, and your room is right next to mine. it’s okay gram, it’s just us and we are perfectly sound and safe, let’s get back to bed”. she will go back to bed and feel better after that. every morning she wakes up and does not know where she is. sometimes it’s as if it is 2008, sometimes it is 2000 or sometimes it is 2019. she will peek through the door to my bedroom in the morning and see me and be instantly relieved she sees someone she knows. it makes me really happy to see her happy in that moment. my gram is also to the point where bathing and self care has declined. she can go weeks without showering but when asked says she showered this morning. it’s also to the point where she doesn’t brush her teeth, and when she goes to the bathroom it is always diarrhea, so cleaning herself is a necessity. when asked to bathe or shower she gets defensive and counters with remarks such as “you’re the one who needs to shower, you smell.” it has become an extreme stress for myself and my family. my gram also has glaucoma so her eyesight is iffy, causing her to have paranoia with what she sees combined with dementia. she will think she sees people in the yard while looking out of the window, and think they are stealing things out of the shed. she hasn’t driven in years, but thinks on the daily her car was stolen because it’s not in the driveway and she drive here this morning. her overall personality is changing, along with her memories and perspectives. it is hard to think positive most days because dementia is a disease that has no positives, only negative declines. i am mostly a reader here on reddit, but for some reason felt the need to post what is going on an what i’m feeling. with past dealings of depression and anxiety within myself, dealing with the progression of dementia within my gram has been really difficult.", this is also a very good and active group - [,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/awpv92/my_grandma_has_dementia/,My grandma has dementia

"about six or seven months ago, my husband and i and our children moved in with my mom (66). she had been in not-so-great health for a while and showing occasional signs of cognitive decline. i am her only child and my dad died 25 years ago and she never remarried. before we moved in with her i missed her and worried about her all the time.shortly after we moved in, i started seeing more bizarre behavior. her forgetfulness was increasing but she could still work 2 days a week and pay her bills, things like that. but what was deeply troubling was her anger and hatefulness. this was new. she particularly hated my husband in a paranoid way, frequently insinuating that he was abusive to me and the kids, telling me lies about him (or things she remembered wrong? she sometimes confabulates real memories into composite memories that didn't happen. i don't know.) if he breathed wrong, she would take offense and sulk. i wasn't exempt- if i disagreed with her about anything, in the most casual and polite way, she'd sulk for days. she'd give the grandchildren (5 and 1) the silent treatment just to get at me. every other day, she was sulking and/or being nasty. one time she didn't like that we made the 5 year old finish his hot dog before he could have dessert, and she threw her entire dinner in the sink and wrote on the walls in sharpie. we only were able to live there for a few months when one day she started banging on the walls and calling my aunts &amp; uncles, telling them that we had basically taken over the house and that we were mistreating her, that we don't let her sit in her chair (????), and who knows what else. when my uncle came over she was screaming that i had yelled at her for cussing (she doesn't cuss and i don't mind cussing, this did not happen) and that i yelled at her about the garbage cans (this was a confabulation. 3 nights prior, i had told her i don't mind being the one to take the trash out, and that she shouldn't worry about it. later that night, she was being mean to my husband for no reason again, and i asked her to stop. but i didn't yell)so, she was having a crazy episode of fury and now all my extended family was involved, so my family and i grabbed some stuff and got an apartment, and did not go back. she called and left nasty messages a few times right after. we have seen her 1 time since then (that was december 30th), on my 5 year old's birthday. she acted as if nothing had happened, as if our entire relationship wasn't destroyed. i know she didn't forget, she just didn't want to talk about it. i am having a lot of trouble deciding how to look at this. on the one hand, she is not the mother i grew up with. she very obviously is dealing with some sort of decline. i know it's hurting her badly to be suddenly alone and to not see her grandkids. i feel for her in that her entire immediate family is gone and rarely speaks to her now, and she probably doesn't have an accurate memory of whyon the other hand, she's not so far gone that she's oblivious to reality. like i said, she can take care of her affairs, work 2 days a week, and intentionally keep herself together long enough to fool people who don't live with her. so she has awareness most of the time. and i can't stomach the way she treated me and my family when all we wanted was to be there for her. if she had a diagnosis or was so far gone that she was obviously obviously losing her whole mind, i would feel worse and get over my anger and try to help her. i don't know what to do. i don't want to be spiteful or cruel to someone who is sick, but i am just so disturbed. please help. ps: she will not ever go to a doctor. never. if i even tell her to get checked out, she will be so offended it'll be another fiasco."," my grandmother went through a period where she was fairly mean to my mother and also would not go see a doctor. her sister, who lived outvof state, i suspect was the same way as i had heard she had become impossible to deal with and had alienated everyone. they both ended up in a nursing home after falling and breaking a bone and that is where they stayed.if your mother was actively having one of these fits, if you are in the u.s., you could call 911 and say she is acting abnormal and see if they will 5150 her for observation.it's important for her to be properly evaluated because this behavior can be caused by various medical conditions, some treatable. even if it were progressive dementia, there may be drugs to help slow it at this stage and manage her paranoia.i believe some of my grandmother's more confused/paranoid moments are due to low blood sugar because she often won't eat unless prompted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/awcs30/possible_early_dementia_and_too_mean_to_deal_with/,Possible early dementia and too mean to deal with
"my 86 yo mil lives with us and has vascular dementia. she has issues eating, she gorges food and talks with her mouth full. we are done trying to encourage her to eat a certain way, use a mirror and everything pt were telling us to do, we don’t want her to choke. it has become really hard because she has meltdowns. she also has bathroom issues as well that we are trying to get a handle on. she has left sided neglect that is getting worse. her social skills are great you wouldn’t even think she had any issues. we had her on melatonin per her neurologist because she has no concept of time and cannot sleep well at night. well that was a big mistake, she got really depressed wanting to die, had a meltdown and now here we are at square one. there’s not really enough info on all the particular issues with this damn disease now is there, it’s a trial and error. bless everyone who is a caregiver.", this whole dementia thing is awful. it’s sad to see our loved ones decline and it’s hard on the family not being able to fix or make things better. today was interesting and now it’s almost over. we’ll pray for good long sleep tonight and peace for all those battling dementia. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/awc9va/this_sucks/,This sucks
"i want to preface this by saying i am genuinely concerned. i had started a list of things that my chemistry teacher did that annoyed me as a way to get it out of my head because it was driving me crazy. i've been explaining some of the stuff she does to my mom, who was a caregiver to her mother who had dementia. as time keeps going, things have been happening so much i don't even write all of it down since it has just become the norm. [here's a link to my list.]( along with these, i have heard her tell students she has been teaching since my school was created (early 2000s) however, i looked her up and she didn't get her public teaching license until 2015. a friend of mine has shown her the same assignment physically 3 times and followed up with her a handful of times asking why it wasn't put in the gradebook. each time, she says she doesn't remember checking her work, and insists that she usually remembers checking student work. (she doesnt collect or mark people's work when it is due, even though that has been proposed as an easy solution to the whole situation) she frequently repeats the same things over and over. not only are people's grades suffering because of her forgetfulness, but some of the students are forced to teach the others the material during class because she doesn't answer people's questions coherently. i just don't know what to do or who to talk to about this. my mom genuinely thinks she may have early onset dementia, because many of the things she does remind my mom of things my grandma did when she got bad. but i wanted to hear some other people's thoughts. i know a lot of kids at school have issues with her and think she is just the worst but i just want to try figure out what is going on because something is clearly very wrong.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/avy192/possible_early_onset_please_let_me_know_your/,possible early onset? please let me know your thoughts.
"let me give you a little history. my mil is 87 years old with the usual list of aches and ailments for a person her age. she doesn't get around real well because of a bad back and arthritis. she has had some short term memory loss but she was still pretty sharp mentally but something changed in early january 2019. she had several recurring urinary tract infections that can cause confusion and overall weakness and fatigue. in early january she fell at the assisted living facilty where she lived and sent her to the emergency room. she was admitted to the hospital for several days to get her uti under control. during that stay she started seeing things that weren't there. squirrels running across the hospital floor and bugs on my wife. she was released to a rehab facility for therapy and more things continued. some days  she would talk without making much sense. she ""went"" to a birthday party for a friend and saw him and his family and told us all about it. the friend died 20 years ago. her cousin doris started ""working"" at the rehab facility. doris died 5 years ago. she physically got weaker and more unstable. after a couple of weeks she was released back to her assisted living facility. two days later she had a day where she spoke in nothing buy unintelligible gibberish. she was alert and carrying on full conversations in gibberish. that night she fell and broke her wrist so back to the hospital she went. she quit talking gibberish but became more pleasant but still talked abut all types of crazy stuff that made no sense. she was happy and most of all she was not cold and did not complain about any physical aches and pains. ts woman has been cold for decades and she always complains about how bad she hurts so this was a total change of personality. she was released from the hospital to a long term skilled care nursing facility where she continued to be happy and smile and talked nonsense but she wasn't cold and didn't complain. this state lasted for several days and then two days ago she became more coherent, started talking and making sense, started complaining about aher aches and got cold again. she was more like her old self than she had been in weeks. she had not been diagnosed with dementia or alzheimer's but we feel like something is going on in her head because of the changes i've described. have any of you ever seen similar symptoms in a family member or friend?thanks for your time."," fwiw i saw my grandma go through something similar (hallucinations, incoherence, speaking to people who weren't there) when she was admitted after falling and breaking her hip. she recovered completely and went back to her old self for several more years and died from unrelated causes.we never really inquired as to what caused this. someone here mentioned hospital induced delirium. i also recall that the doctors there may have forgotten to give her her regular xanax (she'd been on it for years), so an abrupt withdrawal may have caused this.it was horrible to see but only lasted a few days and alzheimers or dementia never surfaced in the several years she lived after that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/avs2fb/thoughts_on_my_motherinlaw_and_her_condition/,Thoughts on my mother-in-law and her condition?
"the nursing home called. my grandmother apparently isn't doing well. if they don't keep her sedated to the point of being too knocked out to eat, she screams ""help me!"" all day. it's not a mystery to us why she does this; she will do it for big and small reasons alike or no reason other than the fact that she thinks she is in a hospital and thus she is unwell and thus needs help. we've discovered that car rides calm her down but it's a challenge to transfer her between the wheelchair and the car and sometimes trying just causes her distress.does anyone have any suggestions? is there something to keep her happy that won't sedate her?"," i would suggest a low stimulus environment if she isn’t already in one. sometimes people with dementia can be over stimulated by things such as a noisy environment, bright lights, lots of movement etc. so see if it’s possible for her to spend some time in a quiet space, dim lights, maybe some of her favourite music playing softly in the background? or if she’s cognitively sound enough, simply ask her what the matter is. hope these suggestions help! good luck!!

anyone feel like they ‚Äúbeat‚Äù hereditary dementia because of taking estrogen?," are you 80+ to confidently say that you've made it through a normal lifespan without dementia? do you have similar aged siblings who didn't transition who suffer from dementia?  since women outnumber men 2:1 for dementia diagnosis, i'd be inclined to think that taking estrogen (hrt) will actually make you more likely to end up with dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ted3ys/hrt/,HRT?
"should i be concerned about my mom's memory? for context my mom is 51 and has always had a bad memory i'd know i've got one just about as bad. but idk thinking about dementia has got me concerned for her even though there's been no real family history of it. she does forget words or what she's going to tell me but usually remembers it a sec later and the stress from my dad being out sick for a few months might be also affecting her idk, i just wanted to vent a bit of my worries.", scan brain for plaque ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/teahqo/should_i_be_concerned/,Should I be concerned?
"really sorry about the format and rambling, this post is mostly me just getting all of this out of my head right now.¬†for reference, we're in the uk (england),and my husband is 61.quick recap of how we got to this point...saw the gp at the beginning of the year re concerns about memory/panic attacks/general anxiety.¬†gp made a referral to the memory clinic for a nurse assessment, which we had about 3 weeks ago.¬†as a result of that, the nurse made a referral to a psychiatrist for a further assessment and possible diagnosis. we had that appt today.¬†unfortunately, neither of us (mostly me) feel that he focused enough on the memory and related issues, instead the impression i got was that he (the consultant) thought the memory issues were caused by depression and anxiety, rather than the depression and anxiety being the result of memory issues. whilst at the appt today, we found that my husband had scored 71 on the addenbrookes assessment, which i know is..... not good.¬†the consultant we saw today is reviewing the information gained from today's appt, and is discussing it with his superior (the psychiatrist who is head of the department), and will call us tomorrow to give us his findings.¬†my questions really are about how do i properly and fully convey my concerns about this? i honestly do not feel he really took our concerns as seriously as we do.my thoughts are that the consultant we saw today thinks the memory issues are caused by the depression and anxiety, rather than the depression and anxiety bring a result of the memory issues.¬†i absolutely do truly feel that my husband does have a form of dementia, but i think the consultant is reticent to diagnose that because of my husband's age (he's 61).does anybody have any ideas or information as to how we/i can help the consultant to fully understand this?"," i just wanted to say thankyou to those that have replied.mini update: my husband got the call back yesterday, and the junior consultant wasn't sure what was going on, so he's referring for an mri and neuropsychiatry assessments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/te64em/questions_about_consultant_appt_for_possible/,Question/s about consultant appt for possible dementia diagnosis
"hi all,i've posted before about my grandpa who has vascular dementia, and need some advice again. the way my grandpa takes pills has always caused anxiety for me and my mom as we knew it would cause problems, but my grandpa kept saying that he hadn't lost a pill before so he didn't need to change. however, over the last few weeks we've had quite a few instances of losing pills. thankfully we've been able to find them and figure out which pill it was so he's never gone without all of his meds. this weekend however two pills were lost/unable to remember if he took them/couldn't be found, so he went without what we assume are two meds. despite this, my grandpa is still refusing to change how he takes pills, and it's causing lots of fighting. for those curious, one of the pills was found in the tissue box, we have no idea how it got there.the way he takes his pills is that he dumps them from a small cup onto the table or sometimes from the cup to his hand to the table and separates his 5 pills to take separately (3 small pills, 1 big pill, and 1 big pill). he then throws the pills in his mouth, similar to throwing popcorn. his hand and mouth never meet, he has absolutely horrid  hand-eye coordination, and he is usually in a rocking recliner when he does this. pills have been lost in numerous ways from rolling off the table to being thrown and rolling into his recliner. we've tried to help by having 3 separate cups for how he separates his pills and telling him to just dump the pill from the cup directly into his mouth, but he won't do it. even with the pills in separate cups he still dumps them on the table before throwing them into his mouth. what can we do differently so we don't have to worry about lost pills? do we give him each pill separately since he's refusing to stop and that way we would at least know which pill he dropped/lost? do we keep forcing him to do it the way we think it safer?", you could just crush them (with dr say so) and stir then into pudding like they do at the memory care places...,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/te43sl/losing_pills_and_need_help/,Losing Pills and Need Help

"hi everyone. i want to start off by saying that i am a teenager, and i live with my 68 year old grandmother who was diagnosed with dementia sort of recently. she moved in with us a few months ago from another country. i don't live with her full time, i live with my mom also and my grandma lives with us for one week and with my aunt the next week, they each have her on alternating weeks. the thing is, my mom and aunt are unfit to care for her. they try their best and i know that they do, but they get easily frustrated, angry, tired and are burnt out at this point. my mom and aunt argue with each other all the time about her and they both argue with my grandma as well. they both work full time and have kids so it hasn't been easy on either of them and they are both just upset all the time, always angry with everyone because they're angry at the situation they're in. it's been hard for me because i'm currently in school and i often have to miss out on lectures or come home straight after class rather than do homework at the library or something because my mom needs me to watch my grandma, and i always do it, but this along with all the fighting and negativity surrounding this whole situation has become unbearable for me, for my mom, for my aunt, for everyone. i think for everyone's sake, finding some kind of facility that will care for her would be the absolute best thing to do.the problem is, every facility or nursing home my mom has looked into is really expensive. even with my aunt's help (who is already struggling financially), there just wouldn't be enough to cover these costs. what also adds to the problem is the fact that my grandma is not a us citizen (we live in the us). she has a visa which allows her to be in the us for 6 months at a time. that is how my grandma is here now. during this time, my mom is trying to get her citizenship worked out but i honestly don't know where she is in this process. i don't know how any of this works, so i'm not sure if she can get health insurance and if that can help cover the costs of a nursing home. i've tried researching what we can do, but nothing has really been clear to me because i really don't understand a lot of what i'm reading. our state is north carolina. i'm wanting to know if there's anything we can do to get my grandma full time care that won't cost an arm and a leg with her citizenship status. my grandma is really sick. aside from dementia, she can't walk, bathe herself, feed herself, she wears diapers and my mom and aunt change her, she is completely dependent on someone else. she couldn't live on her own and her dementia is worsening rapidly. i'm really hopeful that there is something that can help us, this whole situation has been so miserable for everyone, i just want to come up with some kind of solution.so, i guess my question is if someone knows anything regarding what we can do for her care under these circumstances, or if anyone can point me in any direction with knowledge about this kind of thing from our state, just any advice really. i think she is going to pass soon. i'm not really sure what my mom and aunt have arranged, but these nurses come to each my moms and aunts house when my grandma is there several days a week to bathe my grandma and give her medicine. it lasts for an hour each time they come over. like i said, i'm not really sure what it is exactly, but i know my mom has these nurses in her phone as ""hospice"". i believe this is some kind of program that provides this for us, and they also allow us to put my grandma in a facility for only a week once a month, but we've only done that one time. i wish i had more knowledge on this program and what it is exactly, but my aunt took care of it for the most part. i know that we had to apply for it and my grandma was approved because of how sick she is. i know that its free. they've provided us a bed for my grandma and they gave my aunt one too, and a recliner chair and wheelchairs, all for free. since this was possible to do for my grandma, i'm really hopeful that there's something else out there available to her that will ease this situation for all of us. it is something that helps out a lot but since the nurses only come for an hour 3 days a week, it's not exactly enough, i want to find something for her full time. i know that probably won't be free, i'm just wondering if there's something out there that's affordable. i apologize for my very limited understanding of how things work, i am still young and my mom doesn't talk to me much about these kinds of things, i help out with my grandma when it comes to cooking her something or shifting her position in bed when she's uncomfortable but that's really all my mom wants to involve me in. thank you for reading and i hope to hear back from someone soon"," i am no lawyer, but i highly doubt your grandmother will be eligible for any kind of government supported long-term care in the us.  regardless, this is your mother's and aunt's problem, not yours.  obviously, you love your grandmother but there is substantially nothing you can do. study well. that's your job right

"brief background: i love my mother and want to take care of her. she is in her 70s, i am in my 30s. most women in our family end up with some form of dementia. she has been forgetting things every now and then but she's aware of it. why i'm posting is this: i once read that making a playlist of music that the person with dementia loves helps them in some way. what other little things like that help? we have family photos. she loves words with friends and that probably stimulates the mind. i'm just curious if anyone has had personal experience with something that helps their parent or patient. also, what are some phrases i should say or avoid as this advances? i ask because of an incident that will always stay with me. when aunt p had advanced dementia, we were told to avoid bringing up her deceased daughters (drunk driving accident) and to not ask if she remembers certain things. and aunt m ignored this and asked aunt p if she remembered my cousins doing something and then my aunt p was confused and started asking where her daughters were despite them being deceased since the 1980s and started crying that they weren't there. i just want to be somewhat prepared so i'm not going into this blindly and i've seen people on reddit help folks out so i thought i'd ask. my apologies if i didn't format this right or if this is in the wrong place. thank you!"," my dad still has a sense of humor sometimes and it also seems he enjoys having people around him talking and interacting just not asking him a bunch of pointed questions etc. i think it makes him feel sort of like there's a party going on around him and that it keeps him company. sometimes we leave the radio on for him so they're just kind of low background noise. he likes npr so it's mostly news lol. i don't think he actually listens to it, thank god!my dad definitely likes to be outside and he likes to plan nonsensical things, course it makes sense to him lol. he was an economics teacher so he likes to write things in a notebook when his hands aren't too shaky and i'm thinking he might enjoy messing with a calculator lol we'll see! the hard part for me is try not to insult his intelligence by giving him baby toys. having dementia is not the same thing as being stupid :-) early on he was concerned about having money in his pocket so we bought some play money off the internet. it is much more realistic than monopoly money lol. because he spent so much time in his life with money, he could tell the difference by feeling the paper! he called me (when he could still work the phone) and said that he thought i had been given circus money when i went to the bank! lol lol! i was so busted :-) i didn't argue with him i just said ""oh my goodness i'm sorry i grabbed the wrong thing when i left the house today. i must have grabbed the kid's play money""! he was mostly just concerned that i had been ripped off!sometimes he will tell me something that he believes and instead of arguing with him i ask him if he wants to know what i think is going on. if he says no i don't press it and i just try to live in whatever reality he's in at the moment.here's an example... he is currently suffering from some bed sores on his fanny that he got from being in the hospital. he is currently at a rehab facility and i was visiting. at one point he said ""do you want to know what's really embarrassing""? this was a new thing for him and so i said ""well yeah of course""! he doesn't usually talk about his feelings. he said, ""i've been sitting in this same underwear all day long and when somebody comes to help me change, the underwear is completely stuck to me and they have to peel it off""! he did say it with a different type of sentence structure lol but i understood what he was telling me.well, what's really happening is they do have to take off the adult diaper ""underwear"" which is kind of peeling it down i get that, however... he was misinterpreting what was happening. when they change his ""underwear"", they often need to change the bandages on each buttock to make sure the bed sores don't get an infection. so yes, the nurse is peeling something off of his behind but it's not actually his underwear that has gotten crusty from sitting at all day lol. when he told me that i said ""oh that would be embarrassing""! then i said ""i think i know what's going on and i can tell you something about that if you want me to"". he said he wanted me to and so i explained about the bandages. he said ""oh that makes sense"" and then he felt better. it only lasted about three seconds before he started being upset because he has bed sores! i did not call them that, i called them pressure spots but i know he understood what i meant. he was only unhappy about that for a few minutes because i then said ""they are getting better every week and i'm glad they're taking good care of you"". someone told me one time that the dementia patient often only hears the last few words you say in a sentence so hopefully the only thing he focused on was the phrase ""taking good care of you"".sorry for such a long response! my dad was very analytical and very smart person so his personality responds well to a kind of calm analytical sort of reasoning method. even about the ridiculous things that he wants to talk about... such as how 2 start a 50 barrel a day production run of beer lol! this man has a plan all worked out let me tell you lol. anyway from my point of view the best thing you can do is keep a really good sense of humor, try to treat your loved one as if they are not fragile and breakable but still capable and strong, and that you are not sad but cheerful and happy to see them. of course this might mean then you have to go out to your parked car like i do and scream and cry for 20 minutes before you get home.if he wants to talk to me about something serious or about something he's worried about, i try to be very straightforward but also very upbeat. at one point he remembered that his brother had passed and he said that to me. i said ""yes he did i'm sure you must miss him"". he said ""yeah he was pretty great"" and then he moved on with his day. i think if i had pressed him to have a feeling about it, it might have upset him but he was able to put it behind him thankfully due to dementia! not many chances to be grateful for the problems of forgetting but sometimes it comes in handy.mostly they just want to know they're safe and that you love them and if you can ever make them laugh that's wonderful. good nutrition is also great but you know some junk food if they can eat it is a wonderful thing. milkshakes, chocolate candies, pretzels, marshmallow peeps at easter, stuff like that. he talked once about a really spicy chili like his dad used to make so i made a big pot of chili and took him some and he really loved it!you'll do great! mostly only because you care not because of the actual things you do. there will be lots of mistakes but hopefully lots of love. at one point dad had trouble feeding himself because he was weak. i was not especially great at feeding him! he likes to be tidy so i was especially distraught with myself when i would accidentally spell his drink when trying to put it to his mouth or accidentally get food on his mustache etc. i would laughingly apologize and tell him ""i can't believe i'm not very good at this and i'm really sorry"" as i cleaned him up. he would always say ""oh that's okay"". so, mistakes will be made, tears will be shed, but keep in mind the biggest thing is the love you share. they pick up on feelings much easier than they did before dementia i found. if you come in tense and upset over how hard your day was oh, they will feel it! much better to wait until you yourself feel kind and giving and loving. also another tip! there's absolutely nothing that has to happen immediately or perfectly unless it's life threatening in the moment. they want to wear an ugly sweater, who cares? they only want to have a piece of cake for breakfast, okay! want to knock down the jenga stack over and over and over and over and over? okay just don't get hurt:-)much prayers and love sent in your direction! you're going to be fine! your loved one is extremely lucky to have you so make sure you take care of yourself even if it's really really hard. i struggle to even wash my hair on a regular basis lol but the upside is i am losing weight yay!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tdj7mw/first_time_poster_wanting_advice/,First time poster wanting advice

"hello everyone. i am new to posting here but have browsed this sub recently. i am really mentally struggling right now. i have noticed since around november-december that my mom (74) has become increasingly confused and forgetful. she cannot remember what day of the week it is or any dates. the doctor asked her what the year was and she said 2000, but then changed it to 2020. she has also trouble with recalling the name of certain items and she no longer drives. the doctor‚Äôs have diagnosed her with dementia but are still trying to determine the type and cause. tested for uti (negative), no thyroid issues, no b12 issues.my mom was the caretaker for my daughter (2 years old) up until i began to notice the memory struggles. she is obviously upset with not taking care of her each day as her (only) granddaughter is her world.we are in the process of moving my mom in with us. all this being said‚Ä¶ how do you mentally handle this? i am struggling more than words can express. i am not finding joy in things that i used to and am losing significant weight. my mom was my only family member growing up and losing my mom in this slow process is killing me. i don‚Äôt know how i can make it."," hi there. i am in a similar situation with my mom, though the onset has been slower. she was just diagnosed with alzheimer's. it's been all i can think about. i don't have answers, but please know you are not alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tcsw2k/i_need_help/,I need help
"cw: mentions of abuse/trauma i think my grandma had a traumatic childhood. she won't really speak about it, but my mother says that my grandma's mother was awful. my grandma was heavily abusive to my mother growing up (and then in turn my mother was incredibly abusive to me) and has never been a pleasant person. my mother, who is abusive and manipulative, even cut her off for six months over a fight they had. that entire side of my family from what i've found out over the years have dealt with untreated mental illness, addiction and other traumatic events. my family  don't believe in seeking help for mental illness or trauma (thankfully, as an adult, i've been able to seek it out myself) my grandma has always been snippy, unpleasant and bitter. i have sympathy for her, but when i was on the recieving end of her fury it has been hard, and made us have a very bad relationship for a long time. she was also extremely racist and homophobic and constantly talked about religion and god and how i was a sinner and would go to hell. she had a fall a few years ago now and fractured her back. she started having a really hard time with her memory and cognitive functioning and could barely hold a conversation. she lost so much weight and became very weak. she recovered slowly physically, but her memory and cognitive function seemed much worse, though it did improve after the fracture healed. my mother has been helping her, and a month or so ago she was diagnosed with vascular dementia. she is not the grandma i remember from my childhood.. . she is so nice now. she used to be so bitter, resentful and spiteful. now, she is so grateful for the help i give her and she is so kind. she used to be so mean and i used to dread even having to be in a room with her. now, whilst she is struggling with some aspects of conversation (repeats herself, but will realise she is repeating herself and get upset) she is much kinder, and she has completely stopped talking about god and religion and she also does go off on racist rants any more. she will do what she can to be helpful and in general seems like a different person. she's very happy to talk at lengths about previous parts of her life, like when she bought her current house.it's like she's a different person. she's a sweet old lady now. maybe she has gone back to the parts of herself before the trauma and the addiction? maybe her past is not as painful any more?my grandpa (on my dad's side) had alzheimer's, and he was vicious and nasty. he had always been a bit of a strict and mean man, but when his alzheimers got worse, he became awful, trying to fight people constantly but the worst aspect was that he would molest/sexually assault any woman he could get close to. i am prepared for her to revert or for her to become spiteful again, but i just wanted to know if anybody else has experienced this with a family member."," this is somewhat anecdotal, because i barely knew him and he died when i was 8, but by all accounts my opa was a huge asshole most of his life, physical abuse and so on towards my dad.  he had an accident on his bike and got a brain injury since he wasn't wearing a helmet, and it was like a switch flipped and he was just a lot nicer to be around afterwards.  i believe he also had dementia later on, i only ever remember meeting him once and he was in a small care home.and less anecdotally, my grandma was a pretty nice lady until the dementia started setting in, and she became a physically violent, aggressive, paranoid asshole until she died, almost 2 years ago now.  the brain is a strange organ.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tcivwv/personality_change_but_for_the_better/,personality change - but for the better?

"i hope this post makes sense and hasn't been covered already. i tried looking through but could not see an answer. sorry if it's a bit all over and will try to keep short.i'm 29, my dad is 67 and my mam 57. they live together. around five years ago my mam first phoned and said i may notice a difference in my dad, he's forgetting things more. as i didn't visit home often, i didn't really notice much. it wasn't until covid that i really noticed, and the last six months, have got particularly worse. a few years ago, he had memory tests and passed, but he's had more recently and did not do well. it's to the point now where every conversation we are repeating. taking a list to the shop for two items is pointless because he forgets he has a list, doesn't brush teeth, struggles with movies now etc.however, this is not the only thing we've noticed. my dad gets extremely down and has very sudden mood swings, he's restless to point that he's taken two months to do some invoices that should have taken days. he can be quite insensitive when talking to people - rude, almost cruel, sometimes pretty vulgar, and not realising it. he can be so angry, and his mood changes so quick and he gets down. he struggles in group situations and will become withdrawn because he can't keep up with conversation, and when replying his response doesn't make sense or relate to the topic. it's the personality change that has been really difficult to see - he is so angry, down, fed up, withdrawn. he constantly wants to go out somewhere with my mam (who is often tired from work) and gets really upset/angry when she wants to go out with a friend as he feels he is being left alone. i'm trying to come home more to help, i work from home, but he often wants to go out somewhere and it's hard to say no.he has had memory tests, ct scan and is having an mri scan on sunday. after looking at the types of dementia, we thought all the personality changes could mean it is a form of frontotemporal dementia - but of course this could be totally wrong, he just has all symptoms listed.it's been five years since they first went to the doctor. the awful thing is my dad still believes he is just getting old and this is standard forgetfulness, but as i said, we can barely have a ""normal"" conversation now. we still have not had a diagnosis, but something is definitely not right, whatever the outcome is after mri. we were at my dad's brothers funeral today (72, parkinson's). it is the first time we have mentioned it to my aunty as we are not close and she told us you are much better trying to sort power of attorney before the diagnosis. my friends mam also said this, as she had to with her own mother. we were planning to talk to my dad about this after more results come through but now we think it is best we talk to him as soon as possible. to be honest, we are both concerned about whether he will get much worse before we get the diagnosis and then it will become much more difficult.does anyone have any advice with the situation? the big concern is waiting for a diagnosis and by that time he could be much worse, but he is a very proud person and it's going to be an extremely difficult conversation.thanks for reading and sorry if i went on abit, or this has been answered."," i was able to get a poa for my mom without trouble after diagnosis. she could only sign her first initial, and that only with help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tabmtt/power_of_attorney_pre_diagnosis/,Power of Attorney Pre Diagnosis

"about 4 years ago, i was going through a divorce and in need of a place to stay.  so i crashed in my mom's spare bedroom, intending to only stay a few months while i figured things out.  but, about three months after i moved in, she was diagnosed with dementia.  so my siblings and i discussed things with her, and being that it was early stages, she pretty much understand everything we were saying.  it was decided that i would just continue to live with her to ensure that she was safe.  plus i became her chauffer as the doctor forbid her to drive anymore.  and the slow decline began.  it really wasn't too bad.  especially compared to what others have gone through.  she never got aggressive or violent.  she got frustrated at times, like when she looked at picture of someone and couldn't figure out who it was, but she knew that person was important to her, because otherwise why would she have a picture of them.  and she would get depressed when i would tell her who it was.  it was heartbreaking to see her not recognize her father or her sister or her grandchildren.   but, overall, things weren't bad.  she never wondered off or anything like that.  then 2022 happened.  she tested positive for covid on the jan 7.  she recovered from covid, but never got her strength back.  on feb 4th, she went to the er. she was diagnosed with a severe uti and spesis.  she was admitted to the hospital.  on the 2nd night her oxygen dropped to 48% and she was rushed to the icu where she spent 2 days.  after that she was moved back to a regular room and spent a total of 10 days in the hospital. she was then sent to a rehab center.  she has not made any progress and today the rehab center informed us that they will discharge her  on the 18th.  but, she needs 24/7 care now.  so, she will have to go to a nursing home.  and i guess she will just spend the rest of her life in a bed.  frankly, i've reached a point that i never thought i would.  if she's not going to get any better, then i'm hoping the rest of her life isn't going to be very long.  my prayers are now asking god to take her.  let her go to heaven and be with my dad and with her parents again.  dementia sucks.", you probably already looked into this so please disregard if so. i'm so sorry for your pain. would she qualify for hospice? she could come home and caregivers would come in to take care of her. it's covered by most insurance and also medicare. my mom was on hospice in the nursing home but only for a week before she passed. if i had to do over again she would have been in my home for sure. that's why i move my dad in with me because i don't want to go through that again. the care they gave her there was good but not being with her when she died was horrible. just a thought. hang in there this is a really hard time.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t9yhla/mom_isnt_coming_home/,Mom isn't coming home.

"a question for those who have dealt with dementia patients who developed difficulty swallowing - did it show up with certain food is particular and as hiccups?my mom is pretty early on, but realizing she is doing the above plus repetitive mouth motions lately (when not talking or eating)‚Ä¶ are these more signs?", it's spelled dysphagia. could tardive dyskinsia or another movement disorder be causing her repetitive mouth motions? this should be reported to her doctor if it's something that started recently. it may be related to one of her medications. the repetitive movement you describe is not related to dysphagia and neither are hiccups. people with dysphagia usually have more trouble with certain consistencies of food or liquid. it's different for everyone.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t7lum3/dysphasia_showing_as_hiccups/,Dysphasia showing as hiccups?
she‚Äôs had dementia for years now (13+) and i‚Äôm just over it. she just called me that she‚Äôs leaving her care home again. it wouldn‚Äôt matter where she was placed it wouldn‚Äôt be good enough for her. she was horrible before dementia and she‚Äôs more horrible with dementia. her name is donna and growing up she had the nickname prima donna - that gives you a hint as to her personality. i‚Äôm so done with her yet i‚Äôm the only family left. the disease sucks but it‚Äôs especially hard when the person sucks too.," wow op - i feel this. my mother has never been diagnosed but i am sure she has bpd and our relationship has been strained if not nonexistent for many, many years. she lives clear across the country (near a good amount of relatives but they are all estranged as well except for her one sister.) she‚Äôs not a horrible/mean person at all but her mental illness doesn‚Äôt help her in the friends/family department. anyway, i just found out yesterday that she was visiting my aunt, seemed ok, then when she left, starting driving east. waaaay past her house. 3 hours past. she got in a minor accident and the police took her to a homeless shelter (i don‚Äôt know the details of this part yet‚Ä¶why not the hospital? she was in an accident!) she was there for 3 days in a disoriented state until the shelter decided to take her to the hospital. severe dehydration and a uti. after researching today, i know symptoms of a severe uti mimic dementia but also know that it presents even more when there is an underlying mental situation.last we talked (couple years), i could tell she was forgetting things, retelling stories, etc but i kind of chalked it up to just getting old. seems like more now. i feel absolutely obligated to step in and get things situated but with my own giant anxiety, being across the country, currently unemployed (i‚Äôm good but added expenses would be awful), etc. is freaking daunting. currently i‚Äôm waiting to get the whole story from my aunt to see how we‚Äôre moving forward. any tips for navigating this would be lovely. thanks for listening üòä",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t7lh0w/my_mom_was_difficult_even_before_dementia/,My mom was difficult even before dementia.
"idk if this is the right place to post this, but i‚Äôm done. i am a grand daughter who has been constantly abused, accused and not appreciated for almost 9 months caring for my gma. and i‚Äôm not sure if she is experiencing dementia but she has hallucinations, extreme anxiety, extreme, memory issues and paranoia plus more and i just can‚Äôt. not to mention she also is a narcissist on top of that so that‚Äôs been fun. i have tried to be patient, kind, understanding and accepting. it just makes me think back to this post i saw where this person was shaming family who left their elderly relatives behind and wouldn‚Äôt come see them anymore. some people are pure rotten, even in old age. i know my grandma could hide it well when she wanted. refuses to go to doc appts she previously agreed to, accused me of anything even if it doesn‚Äôt make sense. accuses me of not telling her information i have repeated many times. refuses to accept any responsibility if she is ever wrong. starts arguments on purpose when she is in a bad mood to release her own stress. gaslights me. and more. and i‚Äôm done, i have had it. i have gotten nothing in return for helping her and even tried to save her from family who were doing shady acts and/or trying to kill her off! all i‚Äôm saying is that it may be important to look at both sides of an issue before accusing family of neglect. maybe they tried everything. maybe that ‚Äúnice old lady‚Äù you know was incredibly abusive in her youth and continues to be now. she has done it to almost every member who was actually being helpful but refuses to yell at those who openly tricked her or don‚Äôt try to help. sorry for the rant but i just had a breakdown."," you do not owe her your life! don't sacrifice yourself!! sometimes this kind of angry acting out is a stage they go through. once their dementia gets worse sometimes they become much nicer. from what i understand depending on what type of dementia they have, some of them have big personality changes one way or the other. it's not a bad thing to dip out oh, and it's not a bad thing to expect more from your relatives. you should not have to do this by yourself and it's not on you to protect your grandmother from her own children. if you are really concerned you can contact adult protective services to let them know what's going on with you and your grandma. they will not think you're a bad person i can guarantee that! they will see that you were handling more than you should have to deal with on your own and truthfully it will be much better for your grandmother if people outside the family can help her. that way your grandma is protected and you don't have all the stress and bonus is the family will turn on protective services not you lol. if you are concerned about it you can do what i have done which is get a small recorder and turn that thing on anytime you are dealing with your grandma or any of the relatives. you can also get one of those nanny-cam type things and set it up in the room where your grandma spends most of her time. just sort of a cover-your-ass move in case anyone ever tries to say that you're not doing everything you can. it might even be something for you to say i can't do this now but if things change maybe i can later but somebody else has to take this up right now instead of me. good luck to you i know how you feel. my family is not always very supportive either although i can say that my dad is still very sweet. earlier maybe six months or so ago, he said some pretty hurtful things to me and acted in a difficult way but he has changed and things are okay now. i'm still really sad and i know it's going to get worse but i'm going to help as long as i can until i reach my breaking point. if i hit that point i will definitely dip out. good luck i'm sending you a lot of love.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t7ijbd/mental_breakdownrant/,Mental breakdown/rant

""early-onset"" alzheimers is considered to be under 65, and the majority of those older are older than 50. whatever your condition is, it's very likely treatable!!! whereas dementia is not. get some bloodwork done, make sure your vitamins, hormones, thyroid are all balanced. b12 is a common deficiency especially if you're vegetarian. if you're a woman taking birth control pills, that may be the cause. could also be adhd, anxiety, depression, stress. did you suffer a car crash, fall, concussion, or hit your head? a tbi can cause some of those symptoms. did you survive violence, a disaster, traumatic event? ptsd can also cause amnesia.after the doctors rule out the low-hanging fruit and you still have worsening symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist. the neurologist may do a sleep study. you could have something like sleep apnea and not even know it. if you never have a full nights' sleep then obviously your brain won't be very good at forming new memories!!!! on the extreme and rare side, possibilities could be a brain tumor or hydrocephalus but you would be having much, much more severe symptoms like loss of balance, hallucinations, etc. and even those are most often treatable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t77t1y/19/,19?

to any u.k. people‚Ä¶ big piss-taking culture in my family (like a lot of families i suppose). so much of it is misplaced since my dad‚Äôs diagnosis of mixed dementia. uncle (mum‚Äôs brother - who has also just received dementia diagnosis) just made lighthearted comment about my dad getting a disabled badge for his car (that only my mother drives since his diagnosis - grey area with dvla) and dad forgets or doesn‚Äôt believe his diagnosis so comments like this must feel like having his heart ripped out. any experience with this?,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t6ngkk/to_any_uk_people/,To any U.K. people‚Ä¶
"my family and i just started grandma on seroquel , she is  in moderate stage of dementia. getting close to end of middle stage. she is having increased sleeping problems, anxiety and depression and also real bad paranoia and delusions. we had her back in at specialist and they recommend seroquel. they kinda labeled it as a wonder drug for this. they said it could have her sleep. mood. and the paranoia delusional side. i was wondering if anyone has had there loved one on it and how did they respond?. any side effects? any positive outcomes? things to watch for ? just your story would be appreciated. anything to help in this trying time.thank you"," one of my kids was on seroquel for a short time and it caused drooling, lethargy, and incontinence.  i'm not saying it would have that effect on an adult, but if your grandma suddenly exhibits any of those things, don't chalk them up to the dementia without considering whether it's a side effect of the drug.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t6izie/started_grandma_on_seroquel_any_input_stories_how/,"Started Grandma on Seroquel, any input?

"i‚Äôve posted and commented before about my mother with advanced dementia and the sad ride that‚Äôs been but this post isn‚Äôt about her. it‚Äôs my mil.my husband‚Äôs father passed last summer (95, copd) rather suddenly. fortunately dh (dear husband) was able to be there the last two weeks of his life. unfortunately they live 1700 miles away and with covid we hadn‚Äôt visited for 2 years. we didn‚Äôt realize how much his dad had slowed down and things were in great disarray when dh arrived; unpaid bills, no home maintenance done, etc. so dh spent 3 months back there getting things in order for his stepmother. fast forward to now, 7 months later and we are both visiting, following up on previous action items that she did nothing on and to do her taxes. been here 3 days and it‚Äôs apparent she has pretty advanced dementia. i‚Äôd put her about 1-2 years behind my mother in progression.i feel like i‚Äôve been smacked in the head with a bag of bricks. and i‚Äôm not looking forward to the sh!t that‚Äôs sure to be coming, this is going to be even tougher because of the distance involved.no way she will agree to move out west so we can better help her, she‚Äôs already too far gone to comprehend the impact her disease will have on us. she forgets everything, repeats things incessantly and has already been scammed out of $2000. i‚Äôm sure there is more of that to come. dh is already medical poa, has access to all her accounts online and is co-owner of her bank account.she‚Äôs 88 &amp; has a brother in the area but he is older and not much help.we‚Äôre going to the gym at her church tomorrow and i think i‚Äôll slip off to ask what assistance they can offer. i‚Äôll also give the local agency on aging a call.this is so depressing. btw, she‚Äôs in louisville, ky if anybody knows of any good resources here."," thanks for all the suggestions - so far we've added alerts to her checking account, signed up for usps mail alerts to our emails, and got a list of her doctors. tomorrow i'm calling area agency on aging, setting up spam blocking on her email and phone.  need to start a list and just work thru it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t6gqi8/dementia_strikes_again/,Dementia strikes again

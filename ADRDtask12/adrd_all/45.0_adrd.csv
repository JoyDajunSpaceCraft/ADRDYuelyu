"hello all -after reading the following article about a mayo clinic study on alzheimer's, their conclusion is that the main driver behind the disease is malfunctioning tau proteins (as opposed to the other widely suspected culprit, amyloid proteins).  assuming this is the case, i am only aware of one proposed drug that is currently being trialed which addresses this pathway: lmtx by taurx therapeutics.interestingly, this drug is really just an enhanced/refined version of methylene blue which is more easily absorbed.considering that methylene blue (i.e. methylthioninium chloride) is an ingredient in many urological tract medicines, although at significantly reduced levels; 10 -20 mg v. the 138 mg minimum effective dose for lmtx, is anyone familiar with these drugs being used as a treatment for ad? best regards.            references :"," ha. some years ago when my mother first came to live with me with fairly advanced ad, it researched methylene blue and after discovering there's be no real chance of her suffering any ill effects, ended up buying some of the right quality and diluting it to the right strength, and trying her on a dose for a couple of weeks. and there was one striking effect: she seemed suddenly really enthused and comparatively compretent about figuring out things that involved numbers, like the cost per litre, how long it would take to do something, whereas she'd been completely indifferent about them before i started her on the trial mb.so i stopped the med, took her to her drs and asked them to check if the mb story had any legs or whether there were any trials we could get her one. but the drs were completely indifferent and disinterested. her physician told me that he would no touch a med that had not been around and generally used for at least 10 years.so much for that!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/3jidxp/methylene_blue/,Methylene Blue (?)
here are my symptoms.difficulty remembering appointments using the wrong word when talking not understanding an explanation or story difficulty keeping up with all the steps to a task i noticed something weird was happening around 2 years ago i started having mild problems following arguments. this year has been the worst and recently (last few months) i have started using wrong words in sentences and sometimes plain stalling because i do not know what word i should say next.i do not smoke and i am not a drinker and i am not stressed.what should i do?," i will repeat what another poster said. find a different doctor. i have multiple disabilities, but it took a lot of patience and even a bit of 'doctor hopping' to get specialists to believe that my symptoms were more than just nothing or coincidence. take one step at a time and remember that you are your own advocate when you go to these appointments. you have to do what's best for you. if one doctor doesn't believe you, or makes light of your symptoms--move on. i will also suggest that if you keep a bit of a symptom diary, it helps doctors see things in print (and possibly to see a pattern). they seemed to pay more attention to the details then (i imagine because i took the time to write it out). i used a calendar and just wrote the time and the symptom i felt i had at the time. there are doctors that care, sometimes it just takes the right fit between you to be the recipe for success. good luck, i wish good things for you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/3jcu50/i_am_26_i_think_i_have_a_issue_but_no_doctor_is/,I am 26 i think i have a issue but no doctor is taking me seriously.

"we have a baby monitor set up so that we can hear when he gets out of bed (so that we can make sure he's not wandering out of the house). last night, he came over to my so's and my bedroom (the room used to belong to pop's wife, but she was moved to a nursing home a few months ago), look in, and then go back to his room. at first, all i heard was him blowing his nose. and then he started wailing. without the baby monitor, i wouldn't have known he was crying, but it was pretty dramatic. he continued the cycle; open the door, peer in on us, close the door, walk back to his bedroom, cry. the crying would let up, and in a few seconds the door was open again, and the cycle continued. this happened at least 12 times.kevin (his grandson, my so) got up and tried talking to pop, but he denied any sad feelings and climbed back into bed, only to get out again to continue peeping and crying.i don't know what to do. things were getting much better, and then they declined so quickly in just a few days. kevin suggested that we go back to spending nights in the living room, thinking that maybe he was expecting to see his wife sleeping in her old room and that's what caused the depression and crying.he refuses to talk to either one of us about what's going on. sometimes he'll say that there's nothing going on in his head, which i understand is troubling for patients with alzheimers (to feel upset but have no idea why). any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/3iuhu2/pop_spent_all_night_looking_into_our_room_and/,"Pop spent all night looking into our room, and then retreating back to his bedroom to cry."

"my wife of 50 years (we're both 71) was diagnosed with alz about 6 years ago. i decided to take care of her at home for as long as i could, because first she deserves it, and second it gets expensive. up until last year she was walking good, so we took usually 2 walks a day for exercise. she still walks without assistance, but much slower. she developed incontinence a couple years ago, and argues about showering and changing clothes, but i've helped her get it done. so this spring, i could tell i was breaking down a little physically as well as emotionally, as i wasn't able to get out very much. after much deliberation, in june i started looking at memory care places. the one i decided on is only 2 miles from our home, so it's easy to get to.the big part of the equation is, while she was at home, i was eroding slowly both physically and mentally. now that she has been in the home for a month, i am slowly recovering physically, getting better sleep and exercise. not that i wanted to move her, but i knew it was time. the bottom line is, the emotional toll is still there but i'm coming back around physically. i still have emotional times to deal with, it's sad going up to see her sometimes even though she seems to like it there, but the physical problems are easing up. i know in time the emotional side will work itself out. so, those who are caregiving on your own, think about saving yourself both physical and mental downfalls by putting them in a safe place to be taken care of, or bringing in help. take care of yourselves.f\*\*k dementia.", f*ck dementia,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/w2gthm/a_caregivers_perspective_on_moving_lo_to_asstd/,A caregiver's perspective on moving LO to asstd living/memory care for those who are trying to decide....

"i'm really sorry in advance if this isn’t the right place to post about this or request advice. i just really don't know what else to do and came here as somewhat of a last resort.my 85 year old grandmother was diagnosed with dementia and placed in a long-term care facility about a year ago after a series of detrimental events. i am attending university out of state, my father is my family's sole breadwinner and works long hours, and my mother is disabled due to a stroke she suffered five years ago. a care facility was, unfortunately, our only option, as my mother's disabilities (severe aphasia, ntbi-induced illiteracy, partial blindness and limited mobility) would 100% prevent her from being able to care for my grandmother.my grandmother previously lived alone, at her own insistence, with the help of home health aides, nurses and regular wellness checks. she was diagnosed with dementia after a series of hospitalizations resulting from multiple severe urinary tract infections over the course of around two years. two of these utis resulted in systemic infection/sepsis, which caused total incoherence and physical falls that necessitated the use of emergency services.i give all of this backstory because it helps one better understand the current situation. my grandmother absolutely refuses to shower, bathe or participate in any manner of physical hygiene. any time the facility staff attempts to initiate a shower or clean her up, the result is a screaming, violent tantrum complete with hitting and kicking the nurses until they give up and leave her alone. the smell when one enters her room at the facility is downright offensive, like walking straight into a wall of filth and excrement. this lack of hygiene is, from the start, what *caused* the utis that landed her in the er multiple times and almost killed her twice. this and the resulting danger to her health is why she was deemed unfit to continue living alone and other arrangements had to be made. the staff at the first facility she was placed in was lucky to get her to bathe once every 7-10 days; however, we recently moved her to a different, more specialized facility after she sustained two *additional* falls and subsequent hospitalizations in the care of the first. the second fall and accompanying hospitalization revealed a severe abdominal infection that required large doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics to clear, though we don't know for certain if this infection was caused by hygiene-related issues. my parents chose to relocate her after this second fall, believing that she wasn't receiving the care or supervision necessary for someone of her level of illness.my grandmother has been in the new facility for just over three full weeks and has not allowed herself to be showered or cleaned up *even once* since relocating. the staff have tried daily to initiate showers but have been met with the same kicking, screaming and aggression. care facility staff are, legally, *not allowed* to force any type of care on a patient that refuses said care, even in the patient's own best interest. this includes the administration of medication, food and personal hygiene. in the same way that a hospital cannot force even a life-saving procedure or medication on a patient that has turned it down, the facility cannot force my grandmother to bathe even if her continued refusal to do so puts her at risk of actually dying from another severe uti. all they can do is treat the consequences.my parents are at the end of their rope. my grandmother's unhygienic state and general aggression are putting her in danger of being dropped as a patient and kicked out of the facility altogether. she is in constant danger of developing life-threatening infections because of her refusal to accept hygienic care. when prompted to bathe, she insists that she's already/just recently done so, and pressing the issue results in screaming fits or outright violence. i feel like i'm watching my parents' slow downward spiral as they try everything in their power to keep my grandmother not only housed, but from actively killing herself via some extremely preventable infection or another. none of us know what to do, and it feels like our hands are completely and helplessly tied.i don't know what i'm asking for here, or if there's even any advice to be given in these circumstances. maybe i just needed to rant to help cope with what's going on. if anyone feels inclined to respond, even if it's just with similar experiences, i'd welcome any and all comments."," unfortunately dementia does this, makes people just afraid of water or something, not want to bathe.  my dad acts like the cia is going to waterboard him if you try to get him to shower.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/w287ya/my_grandmother_85_is_actively_killing_herself_by/,"My grandmother, 85, is actively killing herself by refusing hygienic care."

she is steady at 108lbs right now, same as when hospice left, so i don't know if it's useless to even bother since she hasn't lost any more weight. the hospice website does say a reason for them to approve is ""needs assistance with some activities of daily living: (eating, bathing, getting dressed, walking, getting out of bed)"", mom refuses to wash or bathe and never gets dressed, but she had these problems before, too, and the nurse said weight loss had to be the reason for hospice.\-or-\- do i call a doctor who specializes in geriatrics, see if i can get an appointment some time this year, then if i do, exhaust the both of us to try to get her dressed and out of the house, to maybe find something to help her ( and me) sleep, and try and get her calm and more stable mentally? i'm alone, i don't know what to do. i asked my cousin who is a sensible sort and she said she'd take mom to my doctor. now that my doctor's no longer in the picture...is it wise to take her to a stranger neither me nor mom have been to before? any advice is greatly appreciated 🙏  i'm at my wit's end."," a lot to unload here but i’ll try to address the biggest issues. your mom needs both a geriatric specialist doc and home health care. it’s my understanding that hospice is for those who are expected to die within 6 months? i don’t think your mom is necessarily at that point yet.my mother had mild to moderate dementia for several years but in early 2021, she had a stroke-like event that accelerated her dementia to advanced. it was stroke-like and severe but they couldn’t find any signs of a stroke in her brain. one of the theories is that she lost so much weight (30-40lbs over a year) that she basically od’d on her regular drugs.now she needs 24/7 supervision bc she can’t remember where/what anything is and that’s too much for any one person.  we had to hire a full time, live in caregiver. me and my sibs are the relief (weekend) caregivers. since she lost all that weight, her meds had to be adjusted. we were talking to her doctors daily during the first few months to adjust her meds accordingly.

"i hope that this can help others give a gift of stimulation to their loved one!  this is an update to post i made quite a while back about using an 5"" echo show as a remote photo frame for my dad.background: dad is in a memory lockdown ward, but still fairly functional but can still remember what goes on his kids' lives between phone calls.   his kids live across the country and can't visit anywhere near what he and we want.  the facility has personnel issues and can't provide the walks/services they did pre-covid and he started withdrawing between our visits.  while thinking of this problem, i happened to see an ad for an echo show displaying photos and thought this might be good for him.fast forward a month or three and i have a few lessons learned.  first, i used an echo show, but you can do something similar with units from facebook, google, and wi-fi photo frames.1. the basic idea is fantastic!  he loves seeing the photos and seems more stimulated.2. the 200+ photos in rotation keep him interested because they're often ""new"" to him.  i still intend to add many more.3. the subjects in the photos include his beloved dog (about 1/3rd the total), family, extended family, scenes from the farms he worked, vacation scenes (yellowstone, etc.), nature photos, and encouraging bible verses4. photos of his childhood and shared experiences with his kids (trips, marriages, etc.) seem to be most stimulating.5. since the 5"" show was so small, i had to tightly crop the photos so he could recognize the people.  group photos were often cut off at the waist to fill the width of the frame.  portraits often turned into heat shots, and some were paired to fill the width of the frame.  it took three tries before he started reacting to the photos.6. my siblings will also add photos of their lives to keep him up to date.7. the echo also shows weather and sports prompts, which keep his interest, too.notes specifically for the echo show:1. you can get a refurbished echo show for the price of a wi-fi photo frame off amazon, which is my preference.  if you don't mind some risk, you can get them cheaper off ebay, yard sales, facebook market, etc.2. i started with a 5"" show and it's too small for dad.  he can't make out the subjects from his rocker or bed and space is limited.  i've purchased the 11"" show (3x picture area) to deliver on next visit in a month or two.3. note that different models and generations work slightly differently.  the 5"" show has many more settings to control to eliminate prompts to use alexa than the others.  he can't hear well enough to use it with all the background noise.  4. use a separate account - alexa would show my notifications (shipping, purchases, etc.), which could confuse him if he saw them.  however, separate accounts can be a pain if you use the service - i'm constantly switching accounts in my browser as i add photos and change settings.  once it's stable, this is much less a problem.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/w1lvkl/pictures_as_connection_to_the_world/,Pictures as connection to the world

"my 64 year old aunty (j) was diagnosed with fronto-temporal dementia in oct last year and has been progressing quite rapidly. she lives with her husband who i think is in his 70s. they have been together about 15-20 years and have no children (he has an adult daughter from another partner but i can't imagine him ever having had the patience to deal with children). j was a primary school teacher- mostly in the 9-12 year old age group then she did professional development for teachers and then was teaching new entrants for a short time (v different challenge for her) before teaching through the correspondence school until she was forced to retire early with her diagnosis. j's husband is her primary carer and they live in the house they have owned for 10 years or so. for financial reasons he wants to sell the house but the market isn't going the right way and its better for her to stay in a familiar environment. other family support includes my nanna who is turning 90 in january and used to receive a lot of support from j in terms of helping with grocery shopping and changing sheets on her bed etc. my mum lives nearby and has some flexibility in her work schedule and takes j to a line dancing class every week. my other aunty takes j to church on sunday mornings. j, nanna, mum, other aunt and i all live within a 2-5km radius so are able to help a bit. i also have a brother who is about 30km away and a sister in a different country. i took j to a ""get togethers for seniors"" session last week and she wasn't able to interact with others but she did some cognitive activities- sorting number tiles and making words with letter tiles. between the members of the family taking care of j, it would be helpful if we could have a way to communicate as to how things are going, what anxieties she's having, who is going to be available for what activities, whether prn anxiolytic medication was needed, what safety things have been useful, what activities had a positive effect on her mood etc. husband and nanna are okay but not great with technology. i'm wondering if a what's app or messenger chat group would be good? or if there's another app that would be appropriate where each person can record how an activity went, upload photos if applicable, any other useful information. sorry for the long message end excessive detail- it's how my brain processes things. also apologies if this information is covered elsewhere. tldr: what apps or systems do you use when multiple people are caring for a loved one and are they suitable for some of the less tech-savvy carers?"," also - encourage j’s husband to get set up on facebook because that’s where the aftd has their online support group. he’ll need it. their helpline is very helpful, may take them a few days to get back but the support is amazing. definitely so in the group too (and someone’s around 24/7). if you can help him get a whole afternoon or even day off, maybe once a week, that will allow him to be more useful to your auntie. ftd burns people out. he will have to advocate for your auntie with healthcare professionals. astoundingly little about ftd is widely known. the aftd has info sheets he can share. they even have little cards you can give to strangers who are confused by the behaviour. all the best to you guys and to your auntie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/w02mwk/apps_or_tools_for_managing_care/,Apps or tools for managing care?

"hello everyone. i'm not really sure where to start with this. perhaps i'm just seeking guidance on here or comfort. or both. my father is almost 78. lives by himself. he fought in vietnam and so therefore is a vet. about 7 years ago family friends started to point out to us that my father has started to suffer memory issues. we could see it then, and it's very evident now.the good news is that he can still take care of himself. in terms of hygiene, driving and basic daily stuff he does well. but, his memory has definitely gotten much much worse. my sister in law pointed out awhile ago, that she sees signs of dementia. i then started to research it and it makes more and more sense now. it's pretty clear that he has undiagnosed dementia, and i have absolutely no idea what to do.part of the problem is that i live in another city, roughly 150 miles away. at this point i need to start thinking of getting power of attorney over his medical and financial right?how do you do that if my father is in denial. in fact, i can't even bring up the issue with him for fear that he will get upset and kick me out if his house. he does that sometimes when he's confronted about this kind of stuff. here is an example;a few years ago some family friends, who we've known for nearly 40 years, had mentioned to my father that he's developing memory issues. he then got upset with them and refused to talk to them for almost a whole year. my brother has mentioned that to him too a few months ago. my father flipped out, kicked him out of the house and then called his wife to tell her what a piece of sh$$ my brother was. so yea, how exactly would i get power of attorney over anything if my father acts like that? i'm afraid to even breach the subject for fear of being shunned.so there are a couple things that i have been thinking about.do i need to consider moving back to my hometown to keep an eye on him? i have a family and a career. my wife has a career. do i just up and leave them to move 150 miles away? how could i possibly do that and still pay for the house we have? i couldn't just allow my wife to take on the burden of being a single parent and paying all the bills just so i can go stay with my father. no, i don't think that is the solution. or is it?my brother on the other hand, he and his wife live in the same city as my father. however, my brother isn't the best person to take over my father's finances and medical decisions. i'm not sure if it will matter, but my brother isn't biologically my father's son. he is related to our mother who had him before she met my father.aside from that, there are tons of reasons why my brother would not be the ideal person for power of attorney. he's terrible with financial decisions. he's the type of person that would win a million dollars and not only blow through it in a few weeks, but also end up owing someone money by the time the million was spent. he's terrible with finances and has always made bad decisions. besides, he's got a bad drinking problem, so yeah, that's out of the question.my brother's wife on the other hand, i could definitely rely on her, but once again, i don't fully trust her to be in charge of his finances. so there it is. i'm open to answering any questions. i just need some guidance. thanks for reading!"," driving?  wtf! my brother was killed in a car accident; he was getting married in 3 weeks. my aunt has dementia. i guarantee if other people have noticed his issues for years, he should not be driving. immediately disable the car and take his keys away. lie and tell him you’re going to get the car fixed. lie and tell him they can’t find a part. idk. let the air out of all 4 tires or something. then have aaa tow it away to your brothers house for now. you need to get a poa, not your brother or his wife and you need to stay with him at his house for awhile so you have a better understanding of the disease and what he is and isn’t capable of right now. my aunt can carry on a conversation with her sister and laugh and joke but she can’t make toast on her own. she hears the buzzer go off, says my toast is ready but can’t quite make it to the toaster. she keeps reaching for the butter knife. dementia is a bizarre disease. my aunt surprised me by coming out of her room without her pants on twice. she didn’t seem to realize she wasn’t wearing any and i’m not sure she would have known to put them on if i hadn’t been there. she can’t walk without her walker but today, i found her swaying from wall to wall trying to get down the hallway. she had to push her walker out of the way in order to do that. no driving. as of tomorrow. other peoples’ loved ones could die because you didn’t do the right and responsible thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vyvgz2/my_father_has_undiagnosed_dementia/,My father has undiagnosed dementia

"we moved our mom into a locked memory care facility 8 weeks ago that is priced according to the number of minutes per week the staff needs to spend assisting a resident. the baseline charge is $5500 for a room with up to 120 minutes per week of assistance with bathing, escorting to meals, etc. the price goes up $1000 for each additional 120 minutes over the base 120 minutes. after 8 weeks, our mom is suddenly being charged the additional $1000 because the facility says she requires ""a lot more escorting and redirecting"" (their words) than she required for the last 8 weeks. they told us that their ""assessment tool"" has determined that she requires 37 minutes more attention from staff per week now than she did for the 1st 2 months. when we asked for clarity about how that 37 minutes was tracked or reported by staff, they said they don't require the staff to log minutes caring for a resident so they have no proof of what they're doing extra for 37 minutes per week. they just keep saying their ""assessment tool"" came up with the 37 minutes. can anyone give me more information about how memory care facilities price care for residents? how can a facility charge by the minute of care for a particular resident if there is no way to actually track the minutes spent on that resident?"," ask the nurse or nurse manager to sign a release for you to access medical records. if you're poa, you can have an outside physician sign a statement that she is incapable of making decisions and demand to see the records as well. if they still give you a hard time, escalate the request to their medical director. if that fails, get an attorney involved. i would absolutely have a field day with their staff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vy80hu/need_transparency_in_memory_care_pricing/,Need Transparency in Memory Care Pricing
"my landlord, a woman in her mid-50s, seems to be experiencing cognitive decline. before may she was in turkey and rented all bedrooms out and i had more than one roommate as a result. one of them was a surgeon, who frequently complained to me that the landlord always forgot what she said previously and changed her opinions day by day. the surgeon eventually found another place and moved out. initially, i didn't take this seriously and thought it was just a breakdown of the landlord-tenant relationship. after my landlord came back to england in may, there were only two lodgers on the property (she lives in the house since then), her daughter and me. i've observed several weird things about her:1. she seems to be almost tech-illiterate. i have been her free tech support since she came back, so often that it's making me annoyed. however, the family is full of apple users and all but one device are apple products, which is a tv set. as someone who has been using windows pcs and android smart devices all the time, i'll say they have the largest number of apple device collections in a private setting i have ever seen. this includes a good old macbook a1342 that fell into abandonment because its white plastic case is broken. my landlord also has a master's degree from a bangladeshi university (she is of bangladeshi ancestry) and furthered her studies in the uk as well, although all of these events happened more than twenty years ago. i think it is almost impossible for a person with such a background to be tech-illiterate.2. an even stranger thing is a few weeks ago, she asked me how many is 20% of a number in thousands (6920? i can't remember the exact number but it must have been an integer of 4 digits). 3. she claimed that several things have been lost from her house and suspected the first tenant (the surgeon i mentioned above) stole them. yet, i don't even know which things she was talking about.4. when a new potential lodger asked her for information about the location, she could answer basic questions like the way to the nearby supermarket and how long it takes to walk there from home, so she asked me to answer these questions on her behalf. i said, ""i thought you should know this better than me because this is your house."" 5. she wore her top inside out at home twice since june and seemed never have noticed until i told her.6. she asked me to pay the rent in advance, usually a few days before the day i should do so. this happened twice and she said she had run out of money and needed my money quickly. i have no idea if this is true or not. 7. the largest red flag happened last night. i just fired my employer (not related, but you can see me complaining about chaotic management in the company in another post on a different subreddit) and was letting my cvs fly everywhere on recruitment websites for a whole day in my bedroom, with the door closed all the time. when i opened the door to get food to eat from the fridge, i smelt gas. i rushed to the kitchen and told my landlord about the dangerous odour, and discovered that she didn't turn off one of the four stoves after cooking! i've lived with old people for some time (my own parents, who had me in their 40s) and i know what is normal and what is not. my mother, who will turn 66 in november, never has these things. she does occasionally have trouble finding the right word and finds it more difficult to concentrate compared to when she still had her periods. once she walked out of a department store and got one step in the wrong direction to home and said ""damned i got the wrong way"" and it only happened once. recently, she told me through the video chat that my father (who will celebrate his 70th birthday next month) was misplacing the vegetables he bought a moment ago! my mother's trouble is obviously just getting old. the things happening to my landlord is certainly not, and they are coming too early. i don't know if i should talk to her daughter about these abnormal signs and ask her to see her gp? because i am not a family member, perhaps someone who is will be better for this task."," if that were my mom i would be so grateful to whoever let me know. it isn’t rude or anything, it’s people looking out for each other.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vy2j0w/i_am_very_worried_about_my_landlords_cognitive/,I am very worried about my landlord's cognitive ability

(there is no physical reason she can’t wash herself she can reach). she listens to her tv super loud and i have to repeat myself constantly, my throat hurts from talking loud, she is snarky about needing a hearing test (but at least she is going). she gets lost walking in walmart with the most simple directions and cannot dial out on her cell phone a lot of the time but wants her car back. she’s also had syncope and falls. her gait is odd, short stride length with head forward like she can’t stand up straight but she can’t explain why she can’t straighten up….are these things typical of dementia??i signed her up with legal aid for free help to get a will, living will, poa, etc. they were weird about talking to me and insisted on calling her directly but she won’t answer her phone and now she’s getting weird about letting me listen to her voicemails. i’m not used to loud tv on constantly, i’m not sleeping well, cleaning up after her and her animals is exhausting. if she would at least admit when she pees all over the floor so i can clean it up and not be surprised by it. im terrified she is going to pass all the memory tests and never get to neuro referral. i’m hoping to get some services/help eventually. though right now she wants to move back home after evicting everyone. i don’t see how she can safely live on her own. any advice you could give is appreciated! i appreciate y’all i’ve learned a lot here already."," hi 👋, thank you for sharing . my mom is also 74. i’m not sure what state your in. please seek medicaid as well as medicare . use humana or care plus. you may have to get mom baker acted. you can go to a court, and seek a court ordered baker act. it’s not as scary as it sounds. she will be monitored 24 hrs for a min of 3 days. also please inquire for a clínical social worker through your pcp. going forward change everything to your personal phone number. you need to get all the calls. fill out a aor form . authorization of release. this will allow you to get her medical records. one dr, said my mom had amnesia. i used that to get more help from the state. my mom refused to go to her neurologist.  since being baker acted my mother now has state of florida: daily phone call from 211 to remind her to take meds 21 gourmet meals delivered weekly,1 speech therapist 2 week,1 occupational therapist 3 times a week,new more effective meds all paid for no deductible,social worker,free uber/lyft to all dr. appt,in home nurse to check her vitals,$75 month for groceries,$400 every three months for over the counter,i’m working with the social worker to get mom into assisted living. this costs $3k monthly. medicaid pays $1,500 and than she gets ss that will pay the rest mind you this is a lot. but i learned in last 9 years to be the squeeky wheel and do everything to let everyone know all the problems we have with mom . everyone lol even my amazon delivery guy knows!  my hoa knows, my overnight security guards know, my usps know. my six closest neighbors know. now i have a huge network of folks to help. and furthermore i feel safer . cause mom wonders off a lot! fortunately these folks text me. hey 👋 just saw your mom walking alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vx941d/mother_in_denial_not_sure_of_next_steps/,"Mother in denial, not sure of next steps."
"&amp;#x200b;dementia symptoms are caused by brain damage caused by disease or injury. it becomes more difficult or impossible to store new memories or access old ones as brain cells die. dementia can strike suddenly after a stroke or a head injury. it frequently manifests slowly as a result of conditions such as alzheimer's or parkinson's disease. the majority of dementia causes are irreversible. there are many times when people with dementia experience paranoia in their daily lives. this could be about their residence, possession of their belongings, or recognition of their loved ones. in those moments of doubt and confusion, the primary caregiver's first response is usually to tell them the whole truth.**lying to a person with dementia: whole truths and lies** offering people with dementia the whole truth can be a terrifying experience for them. a loving act that awakens them to their condition and surroundings can frequently result in sudden shock, trauma, and helplessness. in such cases, many people choose to lie and pretend that there is no difference in the person's behavior in their daily life.**caregiver response** a critical element of caring for someone with dementia is communication when they experience a different reality from their families, particularly as the condition progresses with their age. this turns out to be one of the most challenging phases of the state and can be particularly difficult to manage by the primary caregiver. take, for instance, a situation when someone living with dementia forgets the loss of their loved one and repeatedly brings their name up with an urge to meet them.  in this situation, a primary caregiver can either tell them the whole truth-""*the person has sadly passed*."" or lie and distract them from this particular person "", *the person is busy right now*"". in both these cases, the primary caregiver puts themselves and the loved one in a precarious position which affects the health and wellbeing of both. it is also essential to understand that regardless of their cognitive condition, people with dementia are functioning and capable humans; knowing their life story, state of mind, and needs are equally important before choosing to lie or being honest with them. in the process of caring for people with dementia, primary caregivers often make sense of these instances and adapt to the best of their potential.**is lying okay?**however, they forget about people close to the one suffering who may or may not have responded to their shift in time, their unfounded suspicions, and general paranoia during this process. while these differences in approach become apparent over time, most people choose to stay on the caregiver spectrum, which progresses from 'whole-truth telling' to 'looking for alternative meaning,' 'distracting,' 'going along with,' and finally 'lying.'one argument against lying is that it endangers freedom by distorting your loved ones' ability to make decisions. it is critical to remember that decision-making becomes more difficult with age.**note to caregivers**while there is no one-size-fits-all model for caregiver response, there are a few things to keep in mind when dealing with someone who has dementia.* take some time to reflect on the significance of the loved one's reality.* take a flexible, empathetic, and tailored approach to telling the truth.* avoid environmental deception.* keep track of responses that work well with the person and share them with others who are close to them.it is natural to feel overwhelmed when faced with the choice between lies and truth. it is recommended that you consult with a trained mental health professional in order to help your loved one and yourself understand and adjust to living with the condition in the future.", what is the source of this material?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vx511a/lying_to_a_person_with_dementia/,Lying to a person with Dementia
"background: my mom has frontotemporal dementia. she’s 68 and has had this diagnosis for a year. i (37f) am her primary caregiver. i’m single; she’s single.for at least 2 years she’s struggled with urinary incontinence. around the time of her diagnosis, i convinced her to wear [thinx]( which she likes and help her to feel more secure. however, pee accidents are happening more often now, so she has (reluctantly at first) started wearing poise pads as well. now she’s super into those. but the incessant need to pee is still a big problem (she needed to pee &gt;6 times in a 3-hour drive after the 4th of july). so my sister (who is an np) suggested to mom’s gp that pelvic floor pt might be helpful. we got the referral and went last week. when we were filling out the paperwork, i knew all of the urine-related answers, but i asked my mom for answers regarding bowel movements. she told me she had no issues there. so the physical therapist skipped all that. fast forward to last night. i’m helping my mom get into bed. i go to arrange her pillows the way she likes (she usually can do this herself, but sundowning is becoming a whole thing™️), and she says she doesn’t want me to help. when i ask why, she replies, “i don’t want you to see the poop.”turns out my adult-sized 5yo (i.e. mom) has been sharting the bed (i’m guessing this is the particular situation based on the stains). apparently this has happened several times, but she manages to hide it from her caregivers. so my sister and i think she needs to be wearing underwear in bed. we have told the caregivers. i expect resistance, but what else is new?the big issue here is me, though. this level of incontinence has made me so sad. i feel sunken. i haven’t cried about my mom in a few months, and i’m not crying now. it’s just that it feels like such a huge dip to add poop to this mix of straight up hell. when i learned this information last night, i just felt like i had dropped into a deep hole and couldn’t get out. i’m ok, but i feel the depression creeping back in. (luckily i have a great therapist!)how do y’all deal with this continual grieving? and is there anyone else out there taking care of a younger, single parent as a single person? i just feel really alone. i have wonderful friends, but they don’t get it. and no one in my local ftd support group is in the same situation. i’ve honestly stopped going to those groups because our situations are just too different. if you’re existing like i am, please reach out (if you have the bandwidth). thanks for reading all of this. hugs to all of you! 💜"," my nanna has a weird dementia caused from her psp (progressive supranuclear palsy) and has alot of mobility issues. she's been had urine incontinence since her diagnosis with psp, and as such has been using aids. however, as her dementia has progressed, she has taken to padding the aids with things that are within reach for 'extra protection incase she somehow passes more than 5ls of urine overnight'. she also likes to change her aids. worse surprise was when we walked in her room one morning and was hit with an awful smell. she had changed her aids, because she had pooped and not wanted to wake us up to go to the toilet. she had smeared poo all over her bedding, there was poo on the floor, it was literally everywhere and took forever to clean. an other time, she pooped in a sick/vomit bag and put that in her paper waste bin. it's honestly mind boggling to see how her brain has deteriorated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vx35hz/now_shes_pooping_the_bed/,Now she’s pooping the bed

"&amp;#x200b;there is a strong need for the caregiver to be at ease in order to ensure the loved one with dementia is at peace. as a result, caregivers must rest when they can and prioritize the tasks at hand. keeping the day as structured and predictable as possible, the surroundings clean, and the tasks simple will help both the caregiver and their loved one feel more at ease. it's normal to feel overwhelmed and disheartened as a loved one's cognitive, physical, and functional abilities deteriorate over time. it has been observed that such emotions frequently lead to people ignoring their health and well-being.**making peace with a dementia diagnosis** communication with family members is essential for coming to terms with the diagnosis and assisting your loved one in moving on with their life.you'll notice changes in how your loved one interacts as their dementia progresses. they may have difficulty finding words, substituting one word for another, repeating the same things repeatedly, or becoming confused with daily tasks. despite these difficulties, encouraging social interaction is critical for promoting a positive environment and making them feel safe rather than stressed. changes in their personality may occur in tandem with these changes in communication. these behaviors include aggression, wandering, hallucinations, and eating complexities, all of which can be distressing to witness and make your role as a caregiver even more difficult.within these moments, it is often a possibility that one might find this to be a never-ending struggle, and the idea of peace might seem unattainable. however, there are ways in which, in these moments, both the caregiver and the loved one can try to be at peace and help each other move along. learn more:[",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vwe7bu/moving_on_from_dementia_finding_peace/,Moving On From Dementia: Finding Peace Post-diagnosis for Caregivers

"i’m just look for a bit of reassurance that this isn’t anything else really.my grandad has parkinson’s &amp; dementia, and my grandma and myself care for him.recently he has started making really strange, loud noises- the best i can describe it is him saying the word beep/boop but shouting this. he doesn’t seem to realise he’s doing it at all. whilst he can still communicate verbally, he really struggles with his speech (we believe this is due to his parkinson’s but we’re awaiting an appointment on this), and when he talks it’s very quiet and mumbled; compared to these noises that he shouts.i first noticed it when he was watching tennis and “copying” the noises the players were making. some days he won’t do it at all, others it’s every minute or so. i want to say it happens more when he is happy, but i can’t quite be sure as he doesn’t really show his emotions other than his body language.i’m not sure if this is his dementia, parkinson’s or something else entirely, so i wanted to hear about your experiences with this. it doesn’t seem to bother him (since he doesn’t realise he’s doing it!) but i’m not sure if this is an indication that he is deteriorating, or even if it’s normal at all for people with dementia?", my mum repeatedly sniffs.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vw24h8/grandad_makes_strange_loud_booping_noises/,"Grandad makes strange, loud “boop”-ing noises"
"hello,my grandma is diagnosed with dementia and brain atrophy 3 months ago, around 4 months i noticed she would forget or repeat things often so i made appointment with doctor, she was diagnosed with dementia and brain atrophy (brain shrinkage). her age is somewhere between 75-77 year old.but since the diagnosis her condition keeps getting worse, i've read about dementia stage and 3 months ago she was on between stage 3 and stage 4 but in just 3 months she's now between stage 5 and 6 on gds scale and stage 5 on fast scale.i know it's the average duration of stage but i think my grandma dementia is progressing very rapidly and i am very worried, she may not be my biological mother but she my real mother.the last doctor appointment was a week ago, doctor didn't tell us about the stage, the next appointment is after 2 month but i am thinking of taking appointment next week and tell him regarding my concern.you can read dementia stage and their average duration from here:"," as i understand it, it’s a progressive disease but not a linear progression. my mother had memory deterioration for years but it was only after a stroke like event that she couldn’t be by herself at anymore. i’m her case, it was big change overnight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vvws58/dementia_stage_and_their_duration/,dementia stage and their duration
"tw: eating disorderhas anyone here found ways to deal with anorexia nervosa in an elderly person with dementia? my mil is 86 and likely has restricted her food intake her whole life. i don't want to make this post super long, but it is truly anorexia nervosa and not the stopping eating typical in people with dementia. even she admitted during a moment of clarity that she is obsessed with not gaining weight (but she does not remember saying this) and she has lost more than 10% of her body weight, starting from not having anything to lose. we started with palliative care last week and the np is consulting with a colleague on possible medications. she has been on mirtazipine for a few years, and the np is adjusting her other medications to be sure nothing is upsetting her stomach (she was not on many). megace does not work so we stopped that. i know that there is not one magic pill for anorexia for anyone at any age, otherwise there would be a lot less suffering out there.  she is in a really nice alf with good food, lots of activities, etc. it does not matter if she eats alone or with others, if she eats with us or with the other residents, or if we bring in outside food she likes. when we eat with her we try not to harangue her about eating. she does not want a feeding tube, hospitalization or inpatient treatment (which i 100% agree with). i am willing to accept the inevitable. the problem is that she says she always feels ""so bad - something has to be done,"" and not eating or drinking enough does not help. we have ruled out infections but are not doing anything like looking for cancer because she has been too frail for any chemo or surgery for a while.as i said i am working with palliative care but i also value the experiences of others. there are a few papers on this topic but not much info out there, and no recommended solutions other than case studies where people were taken inpatient. i just want her to be comfortable."," i don’t have a solution, but i wanted to share my experience with a lo who also restricted her eating throughout her life. two years ago, after a back injury and before we were aware she had dementia, she was down to 106 pounds on an 85-year-old woman who was originally 5’9” and had had osteoporosis since her 50s. in the past three months, her dementia changed such that she doesn’t remember what she eats. she still eats the same thing she always has for breakfast, toast and half a grapefruit, and skips lunch out of habit, but she eats dinner and lots of sweets after. chocolate covered-caramels, mouse, ice cream, hershey’s kisses, etc. it’s great. she’s gained 9 pounds. maybe the sweet tooth will kick in for your lo too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vvv6t0/anorexia_nervosa_in_patient_with_dementia/,Anorexia Nervosa in patient with dementia
"my mom is 85, currently lives alone and has always been very stubborn and difficult to deal with.  she's also rapidly declining in both physical and mental health, with more and more signs of dementia.  she won't wash, can't figure out what day/time it is, won't go to the doctor, gets angry out of the blue and wants to argue,  gets mixed up and freaks out about her medication, imagines people are in the house with her, there are many signs.  my question is about poa. i keep seeing on this sub where people are advised to get poa - is this something the parent has to agree to? even before she got so bad, my mom would refuse to talk about giving one of us poa, saying that we would use it to put her in a nursing home. no amount of explanation or reassurance would even let her consider the idea.  what are the potential pitfalls of **not** having poa for her? right now my brother and i are both listed on her savings account but not on her checking account.  we pay her bills from the checking account using mostly the bank website and if a physical check needs to be written, we will write it and ask her to sign it. she owns a home which is not worth very much at all.  no other major assets except what's in her savings, which is considerable.   what are some things that we can expect to have problems with down the line if she never gives anyone poa?  she should definitely not be living alone but steadfastly refuses to consider any form of al/memory care.  her doctor is no help at all since she won't go see him in person, and he won't talk to either my brother or i about her.  we are expecting things to take a turn for the worse soon because her doctor is threatening to stop prescribing her meds if she doesn't come to the office, something she can't/won't do due to her frailty/anxiety/not being clean enough.  but i guess that's a topic for another post. thanks in advance for any help.  it's so hard caring for someone with this condition."," i have poa.  like you said, much can be handled online without having poa.  where poa was required included the following:  cancelling her cellphone service, selling her house, and signing the memory care facility contracts.  there are many other situations where the poa was not honored, so having poa status doesn't always result in the problem being solved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vvs544/questions_about_poa/,Questions about POA

"hi everyone. my (21f) 78 year old grandmother was diagnosed around 6 months ago with mixed dementia but seems to me to be predominantly showing symptoms of vascular dementia. she lives quite far away from me and i am currently at university so unfortunately i am not able to provide full term care but i do visit as often as i am able, usually at least once a fortnight but more often when i can. i am currently visiting her after not seeing her for around 3 weeks and her decline has been absolutely shocking to me. she has struggled with cooking and eating for a while, but there is just no food at all in the house (i mean literally there was a pint of milk in an empty fridge and she doesn't drink milk) and she hasn't been eating. she gets her weekly shop delivered but i believe she throws it away. there's no bedding on her bed, no toothpaste or toilet paper, she has been struggling to swallow tablets which was never the case before and most concerningly to me, her hygiene is suddenly all but non-existent. she has unfortunately had a few instances of bowel incontinence all over the house which i have found particularly overwhelming, and she refuses to shower or brush her teeth without a lot of encouragement. whilst i knew all of this was to be expected at some point in her decline, i didn't expect this in a matter of weeks. the issue is i cannot be there everyday to clean her, the house and feed her etc however i also can't leave her for a week or two at a time at this stage, it's extremely unsanitary and not fair for her. we don't have access to an adult social worker, we were told that we didn't need one in our case. we're also not in a great spot financially so having a carer in every day or every other day doesn't seem to be an option without some kind of support and i don't know where to turn. i've tried the council and a memory clinic, and i do not know where to turn to now. any advice would be greatly appreciated, i'm feeling so defeated."," hi op!i see you’re in the uk, so i’m hoping i can help based off my experience with my grandad.first and foremost, have her checked for a water infection/uti- my grandad goes from able to somewhat function normally to not being able to eat when he has a water infection, the decline is massive (and terrifying!) but thankfully it is easily treatable.  with your description of her rapid decline, this would definitely be something to look for especially as elderly people don’t have the same symptoms as younger people.does your grandmother receive any kind of disability or attendance allowance? age uk were a great help for us, they helped us with benefit checks, signposting to the right people & services etc.get onto your local adult social services team and tell them your grandmother has rapidly declined, tell them everything you’ve told us in this post and ask for a reassessment of needs; also as you’re a carer (you class as a family carer if you provide any level of care) you can ask for a carers assessment. tell them that you don’t live local and there is nobody to help care for her and she is not eating, cleaning herself etc- they have a duty of care to help you but as i found (for us at least) we had to push and push for this, social services (again from my experience) are hugely overwhelmed and if they don’t think your case is urgent it gets put to the bottom of the pile. you need to really push on them op and tell them you’re worried for her safety and her health and stress that there is nobody local to provide care for her and that she is mostly alone with no ability to feed, clean or medicate herself. this is an urgent situation and you need to be completely clear to them about this.similarly, get onto your grandmothers gp and tell them the same as above. our gp surgery has a team who assist people with speaking to social services etc and can help with appointments with them. also speak to her gp about occupational therapists, we were referred to one who was able to put hand rails etc around the house and make adjustments to the house to help my grandad. also ask for a referral to the incontinence clinic. also tell them about her struggles with medication- this is so important especially if medication is for other conditions. look into local care organisations, they’ve been a godsend for us and have helped us where social services couldn’t/wouldn’t.i’d also recommend looking into lasting power of attorney, to allow yourself (or someone else) to make financial and health and welfare decisions for her (such as respite care, long term care, paying for services etc). if your grandmother has less than £23k (and some change) she is entitled to help with paying for care & other services, if she has less than £14k (again with some change) she is entitled to completely free care/respite/long term care- her home will be factored into this if she owns the home & nobody else lives there / there is no joint ownership so keep that in mind; if you decide on long term care in a care home she may need to sell her home to pay for this.is there any family local who could step in temporarily to help? i know family situations can be difficult for everyone (currently it’s just me, my dad & my grandma- the rest of the family don’t really care or won’t help so i understand the difficulty) but if there is any family you can lean on right now then push them to help you- you cannot and should not carry this alone.and lastly, breath. caring is an incredibly difficult, at times soul destroying thing to do. you can do everything possible and it still doesn’t feel enough. i’m so sorry you’ve been let down by your gp & social services before, it often feels like a fight and can feel so demoralising to have to demand and plead for support- but don’t give up, keep pushing. this time is probably the most stressful, when you’re in the process of getting things in place but i promise you op that once they’re in place it does get easier. we had to fight and push for adequate care for my grandad for a year but now we’ve got it i rest a little easier knowing there a people in his corner who are trained to deal with this. keep pushing op, it sounds like you’re the only advocate for your grandmother and i know how upsetting and hopeless you must feel right now, i hope you manage to get the help and support you need ❤️edit: to mirror what other posters have said, any evidence you can get of her condition will help- pictures of her living conditions etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vvq4w6/rapid_decline_with_no_support/,Rapid decline with no support
"so, i am pretty certain my 96 year old grandmother has dementia, and i think she has been doing her very best to hide it for some time.she has been telling the same stories repeatedly, forgetting things, and getting past events mixed up for a long time. recently, however, things have escalated.now, she expresses fear and paranoia about neighbors and caregivers, feels calls are being listened to, food items are poisoned etc. any attempt to suggest that her perception may be muddied by an underlying health issue is met with denial and hostility about how excellent her mind is.she has always been a fiercely independent spitfire. she lives alone in her own home. she refuses to list anyone as power of attorney, refuses to release medical records to anyone, and has refused to go to the doctor for years. she has never driven, so at least that is not a concern. her self care has taken a nose dive.relatives check in on her several times per week, but with these recent escalating paranoias, that is hard because she only trusts certain people.not sure where to go from here. what is the best way to respond to these hallucinations? how can you help someone to understand and accept that their perception may not be reliable? is that even possible? she has always adamantly insisting on dying in her own home (partially build by her husband after wwii). no one wants to take that from her, but we are concerned."," sadly this is pretty textbook. she is indeed moving from earlier stages into the middle phase of dementia. does she get more upset in the late afternoon, evenings, middle of the night? if so that’s sundowning and there are strategies to mitigate it. if she refuses to leave the house to see the doctor, a virtual video visit may work. the doctor could prescribe seroquel which can help a lot.get the book the 36 hour day and flip through it. some of these delusions are common and it suggests how to respond. don’t try and convince her she has dementia, she may feel like she is being gaslit",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vvkd52/help_need_advice/,Help!

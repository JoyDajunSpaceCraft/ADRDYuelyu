"hi. i have a relative that may be suffering from dementia. i can't confirm it because he refuses to go to a hospital no matter what. nothing we say can make him. he use to be an addict up to recently but now he doesn't remember or care about his addiction. instead, he has traded one addiction for another. that being food. hes obessed with food. he eats about 5 or 6 times a day. not small meals either. when we tell him to chill out or to wait for dinner, he gets extremely angry. stomping and slamming things. he just finished fussing with us about fixing him something at 11 at night. he's also experiencing hallucinations to the point he doesn't want to sleep in his room due to ""people"" or ""bugs"" or ""the air being different in there"". he says random things sometimes. he doesn't bathe or change his clothes. when we complain about something being soiled, he chooses to wash the item of clothes in the tub (cloging it up) over washing it in a washing machine. the only thing that doesn't fit is some improvement he's showing. he went from holding onto walls for balance to walking. he claims he can't walk b/w despite walking. he's talking is more clear despite being hard to understand before. he's also eating. just too much now.we're at a lost at what to do with him. he's eating us out of house and home. he also causing a lot stress and picking fights. he's in his 60s. is there any way we can get some sort of help for him or get us some relief?"," he is in desperate need of medication. i assume he has a doctor, make an appointment. if you can't get him in to see his doctor then ask for a tele-visit and make sure he is there so the doc can see some of his behavior.  you can't force him, if he becomes really abusive or his behavior is so out there then you can call 911 and get him transported to the hospital and they will assess him.  also, check his medical insurance policy, sometimes there are provisions where a doctor can come to your home, i know many medicare advantage policies have this provision, not sure if medicare does but you could call and ask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psazxo/we_dont_know_what_to_do_he_needs_help_but_wont_go/,We don't know what to do.

"i'm sitting here with my mother, who has lewy body dementia, and it's about 3 hours past her bedtime, she's yawning and nearly falling asleep at the table and saying she's tired, but every time we suggest she go to bed (and we've tried suggesting it in a dozen different ways and with different tones and suggestions and whatnot, and are including explanations of *how* she gets to bed just in case the problem is that she doesn't remember where the bedroom is, which is sometimes the problem). she's just refusing. i'm at wits' end, and since some of the time the reason she doesn't want to do something is just *because* someone wants her to, i am now wondering whether it'd be worth it to try suggesting to her that i want her to stay at the table and stay awake, and not go to bed, or would that be counterproductive?"," sometimes reverse physiology does work! if it doesn't,  i would suggest removing the kitchen table chairs out of her sight and let her take her meals in her favorite recliner. then she can fall asleep in her recliner and it will be safer then the kitchen table chair.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/psacfs/does_reverse_psychology_work_at_all/,Does reverse psychology work at all?
hi all. i was wondering if there is an easy way to find nursing homes with memory care that has self pay option and then accepts medicaid once the patient runs out of savings?i know places do this but is there a search tool that can help me find them?i tried to look on a place for mom but i couldn't sort out searching on my own and they called me incessantly all day every day.thank you!," why don't you seek out a quality facility that accepts both medicaid and self-pay? who has durable power of attorney? it's usually on that person to arrange accommodation and payment options. whatever the case, someone will have to personally visit each candidate facility. when we were considering long-term memory care facilities for our mom, we personally visited a bunch of atria facilities, as wells as others. footwork is required. you could try contacting a social worker for suggestions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ps7slm/finding_nursing_home_w_self_pay_medicaid/,Finding Nursing Home w Self Pay & Medicaid
"hi everyone, thanks for sharing your posts and stories here.my mother, late 60’s, has been experiencing personality changes, such as anger, ruminating, mood swings and saying things that are not like her at all.she is also experiencing memory issues.her mri showed small strokes and some white matter lesions. i was not clear on what these findings really meant.her neurologist is holding off on making a cognitive diagnosis until she has tried an antidepressant to try and stabilize some of her mood changes i guess in the hopes that she improves.she has stated to me that she knows something is wrong with her and she has been ruminating about her recheck appointment in a few months. she has a lot of awareness that her memory is slipping but less awareness of some poor judgement i have noticed lately. i am new to all this and have no idea which way this will go.do people with dementia have awareness that they are struggling? how long, in your experience was the window of awareness? i wish i had a crystal ball to know what comes next. it feels like waiting for the shoe to drop. i don’t know how i should feel, just like waiting and worrying."," what you are describing sounds like vascular dementia. it's rather different from the gradual unaware decline alzheimer is known for. her brain makes her who she is, but it's getting spot damage all over. this often means that patients are aware of the decline, and this can be very painful for them. new spots will show up, signified by sudden decline in a function. which one it will be can not be predicted. there is no predicting her window of awareness. however i tend to see it remain rather long, even when other functions are failing. the moments where you can connect will grow smaller. feel free to ask more questions. i'm a psychologist working in geriatric care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ps4f8r/wondering_about_insight_into_dementia_symptoms/,Wondering about insight into dementia symptoms?
"this past june my grandmother passed due to complications of dementia. she was one of the most importand people in my life. she was there for me during the hardest time in my life and no other human has ever shown me the kind of unconditional and pure love that she showed me. i miss her dearly and coping with her death has been very tough. today i was at a bird store picking up food for my bird. i ended up having to ask a worker a question. up at the counter was an older woman and someone who appeared to be her daughter. i smiled at them like i usually do to strangers. let it be known that i look like a boomers worst nightmare, full sleeve tattoos, facial pericings and jet black hair. usually older folks want nothing to do with me and thats totally fine. when i smiled at the older lady she absolutely beamed back at me. i could tell almost right away that she had dementia or another degenerative disease as i was very familiar with the symptoms from being around my grandmother. the woman approached me with a huge smile and asks me if i wanted to dance. i say yes obviously. she grabs my hands and beings to sway me back and forth as she hums a tune in the middle of a store. she was so happy to see me and dance with me my face hurt from smiling so much. she asked me how old i was and i said 23. she tells me shes 88 but her daughter/caregiver said she was 92. when we parted ways the lady said she loved dancing with me and hopes we can do it again.me and my grandmother used to dance in her back room on rainy days. today i got to dance just like i used to with my grandma. i hope whoever is family to the wonderful woman i met today understands how special she is. i cant really put into words how this whole experience has made me feel because the emotions are just so strong. but the emotions are positive if not a tad bittersweet. i miss my grandma, painfully so, and hate dementia, but this woman in the store was able to make me smile more than i have in months.   love your loved ones please. they are so important.", thank you for sharing this. i miss both of my grandparents-lost them in 1994. 4 weeks to the day apart. they danced and loved each other. the memories overwhelmed me. i could hear the laughter. i hope you can find out who she was. i'm glad you had that moment and the memory.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ps256n/i_met_a_stranger_with_dementia_at_a_store_today/,I met a stranger with dementia at a store today and she danced with me.

"i don't really know why i'm here or what i expect from you guys, but i'm hoping someone has advice. my mom is 72; around 10 years ago, she had a brain tumor removed and has exhibited some signs of memory issues ever since. then 5 years ago, she had treatment for cancer, and at some point, had a couple of mini strokes (tias). since then, her memory has become significantly worse, though she's been reluctant to admit it, or at least admit it was an issue. she (along with my dad) has been seeing a specialist, and one of the warning signs they mentioned is accidents. my mom had her first incident of wetting herself a couple of weeks ago. it seems like we've reached the point where we can no longer trust my mom on her own. we can't let her go to the restroom by herself of we're out unless we can be seen from the restroom because she'll forget where we are and get lost. one of our favorite activities is shopping, and we generally go with my son's (4 and 1), and if she gets out of my line of sight, 8 freak out as much as i do when i can't see my kids. despite all of this, my mom does still have amazing moments of lucidity where she almost seems like her old self. i feel like these moments are giving us false hope and don't want to get my hopes up. but at the same time, i want to enjoy those moments because i don't know how long i have with her. i can already feel the edges of grief creeping in, and i don't know how to deal with the feeling of losing her soul, her spirit, even though her body is still with us.to add a few things: i'm an only child, so it's always just been my parents and i. i'm now married with two kids, and we moved from three states away to about 10 minutes down the road from my parents. my mom has very little support system outside of us because she doesn't want anyone to know what's going on. i mentioned her cancer, and outside of them, me, and my husband, i can count on my two hands the number of people who even knew she had cancer. most importantly, i know that my dad is ensuring she is receiving and will continue to receive the best care. he is also looking for somewhere for her to live should something happen to him. he wants to alleviate as much burden from me as he can, especially in light of my mental health issues (ocd, gad). so, tl;dr, i'm right at the beginning of all of this, and i'm just hoping for advice about how to keep my sanity and still be able to continue to be an active and happy part of my family and help support my dad through all of this.", cherish any lucid moment granted to you.  give your dad time away from the house for his wellbeing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/prnzf0/i_need_help/,I Need Help

"he stopped independently bathing a little over a year ago. my grandmother and i (i live with them) have tried getting him to bathe in multiple ways (a bath, cleaning just parts of his body, using warmed up cloths, showing him pictures of him having fun in the pool when he was younger,with his favorite music, offering to get in the bath/shower with him). his siblings and children have come over to encourage him to bathe. one of his sisters brought him a shower chair. the only person who has gotten him in the shower and cleaned him is his best friend (who is also his primary care provider). the last time he had a shower was at least 3+ months ago. he refuses to change his clothes/brush his teeth. and he gets very very angry when we try and get him to bathe. he smells really bad.yesterday he left poop on the floor. my grandmother insisted he had to bathe after that. we got his best friend to come and his friend was having difficulty getting his shoes off. so me, my mom, and grandmother came to help. needless to say we were unsuccessful. he got very angry, tried to get physical with his best friend, was cursing and refused. every explanation of why he should bathe/that we all do is met with “i don’t do that, i’m a man, i don’t need that.”this is him medicated by the way. we give him 1.5 ml of haldol twice a day and we’ve started giving him valium. before trying to give him to bathe yesterday he had already been given 1.5 ml of haldol and 10ml of valium. after yesterday, his doctor said we should bring the haldol dosage up to 2ml twice a day.at this point i don’t think anyone will get him to bathe unless he his drugged up. and he smells really bad at this point. is it possible he very well not bathe again? what is done in those situations?"," talk with a cna/home health aide about bed baths. he really does need to be bathed; without it skin infections & skin breakdown is inevitable. oral care is essential as well. if he's already being medicated and it's getting impossible to do it at home, you may have to look into other options e.g. respite care at a facility (transport to the facility, then return to home), upping the medications, etc. very sorry to hear you're having to go through this - it's tough enough for pros to deal with, horrific when it's a loved one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pr8cap/is_it_possible_my_grandfather_may_never_bathe/,[deleted by user]

"so my grandad is 82, has dementia but has been very independent and was okay until a week ago.. he had a temperature and wouldn’t get out of bed, he couldn’t control his bowels or bladder, wouldn’t eat.. we had his urine tested, no uti, he was put on antibiotics but they didn’t work. so he had to go to hospital.. he was okay for a day or two but we weren’t allowed to visit him at all, he got very depressed and deteriorated quickly and still  refused to eat. he was stressed missing his family, we weren’t even allowed to talk to him on the phone.. he was so confused as to why he was in there and very distressed. they tested him for covid even though no symptoms.. it came back positive even though the nurse said it could be a false positive, he was put on a covid ward and taken off fluids, stopped being fed and we were told he’s on end of life and there’s nothing we can do about it. we were allowed to visit today and they have sedated him to the point he can’t even talk or move.. (midazolam) we feel like this whole situation is so sketchy. we asked why he wasn’t put on a feeding tube at all (5 days with no food now) they said the best thing to do is to let him die from no fluids or food. this seems extremely cruel. we requested to have his fluids &amp; a feeding tube to give him a fighting chance but they refuse. (my mum has power of attorney but the nhs said the final decision is down to them) i can’t accept that this is fair and right. am i crazy for feeling that they’re killing him off? if we were allowed to visit earlier he probably wouldn’t be in the state he is now. he would accept water &amp; food from family over nurses/doctors. he was clearly stressed &amp; missing us probably feeling like we abandoned him in there. this all feels so wrong. anyone experienced anything similar?"," there's info i'm here on delirium and covid. it seems like the covid may have caused the delirium. unfortunately going through this with my grandad last two days. i would question with the hospital more, if you don't get answers ask for an escalation contact and keep escalating until someone gives you a straight answer. they legally have to tell you* what is wrong with him* what treatment they are giving/ not giving.* why they are doing it.most of my family are nurses and this does not sound right. you may find that it's just bad communication on their part and there is nothing they can do for him. i hope this is not the case and good luck.edit to add: most hospitals now allow all family to visit for palliative patients but this may not be the case for covid patients.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pqa0a3/grandad_on_end_of_life/,[deleted by user]

"dad is 84. we got a formal diagnosis of alzheimer's back in april. his wife was moved into an adult foster home in february following a fractured hip from a fall. she also has dementia as a result of hydrocephalus; she has had short-term memory loss for quite a while, and her husband was the primary caregiver. since moving her out, she has actually improved in terms of weight, energy level, and general attitude. since she moved out, my father's symptoms seem to have accelerated. (or maybe i'm just not in denial anymore? i can't tell) presently, my brother and i visit 3/week, including cooking once a week, (and making leftovers for the rest of the week) and taking my father to visit my mother at the group home. i have tried several times to broach the topic of moving out of the family home (which he is living at alone) into facility similar to the one his wife is in. again, **she** is doing great: more interaction and stimulation is good, the staff forcing her to exercise every day is good, regular meals... she's *thriving* (in the medical and non-medical senses) and my dad sees this. but my dad is absolutely adamant that he does not **ever** want to move out of the house. he does not want to move in with his wife, and he will not even *discuss* what kind of a facility would be acceptable to him. whenever i have tried to broach the subject, his answer is ""i haven't fallen down or set the place on fire!"" and arguing that we shouldn't have to wait for something awful to happen isn't an effective argument. his dementia is progressing; he has serious difficulties with language (speaking and writing), he has very little encoding of short-term memory, and he's starting to lose basic living skills.(toilets aren't being flushed, leftover food isn't being stored safely, frozen foods are kept in the fridge, etc.) legally, there aren't a lot of options to *force* him into memory care. i suspect that such a move would be a very hard transition for him, and i'd rather not traumatize him any more than absolutely necessary; if the loss of his autonomy by being forced into a home would be hard, having it happen because his sons had him declared legally incompetent would be even more so. i'm reaching a personal breaking point here. right now, it feels like my only options are to play the heavy (get him declared incompetent, take over the bank accounts, move him into memory care) or provide what little supports he'll allow (cooking ""sunday dinner"", driving him to visit his wife 2/week, making sure he doesn't buy an extended warranty for his car, etc.) and just waiting for something awful to happen. help me find a third choice, something that keeps him in the house for longer, and lets me think about this situation in terms of other than ""well, guess i'll just wait for something bad"".", what's your father's insurance like? is there any possibility of getting him professional in-home help at least a couple days a week?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pnmgbs/need_a_better_set_of_options_than_waiting_for/,"Need a better set of options than ""waiting for disaster"""

"so, i’m in the process of getting my grandpa to bathe. he hasn’t had a shower in 3 months and past efforts of bathing him have led to him getting very angry. so, we’ve started giving him valium some time before trying to bathe him. on friday i tried the best i could cleaning his face, torso, armpits, arms. yesterday i tried to get the leg area and perineal (i knew i wasn’t going to be successful with this). i was only successful cleaning his feet (lots of dry skin peeling off and fungus he in the past refused to let us put antifungal ointment on) and putting on a new pair of socks.i’ve been wondering how often i should be trying to change his clothes. i put on a new shirt on friday. is it too early to change it? the same with socks and hopefully (eventually) bottoms.also, like i mentioned in the case of his torso/arms i couldn’t do the best job since he started complaining. should i strive to clean that area again the next day until it’s clean? or should i just focus on one area a day?"," i learned not to insist on bathing or changing daily. whether my dad is compliant or not varies a lot from day to day, but we always kind of waited until he was in a good mood and then tried to make a nice, upbeat suggestion that he go clean up, then did whatever he tolerated and stopped when he started to get agitated. we also switched to sponge baths because he became terrified of showers, and switched to button-downs because he'd freak out and accuse us of trying to murder him the second a shirt went over his head. something about having his face/head even temporarily covered was a trigger.it takes a lot of flexibility, patience and persistence to get someone with dementia to bathe and change, and sometimes, we just had to accept he'd smell for a few days until he was in a better mood and let us clean him up.it helped a lot to have a home health aide come in and do it, because he was more cooperative with her than with family. even she couldn't always get him to comply, though, so bathing and changing tended to happen piecemeal - top today, bottom tomorrow, etc. it helps to establish some happy rituals, like putting on music or lighting candles (if it's safe to do so around him), to make them feel more at ease and make the whole thing feel more like a treat than a chore. it also helps to explain each step as you're about to do it, check in, and follow a set routine - basically do whatever you can to make him feel like he understands and has some control over the situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pmxg04/how_often_to_strive_for_changing_clothes_of/,[deleted by user]

"ive been on this sub for months watching the journey of others.  i think this may be the safest place to let it out in order for me to gain some kinda mental solace, if that's the proper terminology.  my faith and trust in god is disappearing quickly and that scares me a lot!my family and i had been receiving calls (at 2 and 3am sometimes!) from dads live in whore/girlfriend of almost ten years informing us that she thought he had dementia.  i was working two jobs after surviving covid, getting myself back up after losing a car in a george floyd riot and my own child before my girl was full term (8.5 months to be exact) when i finally got the call from dad himself. knowing that dad's been actively using (hiding habits the entire time!) for 50+ years, i was very standoffish with becoming involved.  it took a very serious "" dad have you been using again?"" to hear that something just didn't sound right.  when i arrived by greyhound here, caught a bus to dad's place and walked in, i finally got the full look at the last day of my life as i knew it.  found my dad laying in bed, dirty sheets full of poop/pee/bugs in clothes that hadn't been changed in months in an apartment that hadn't been cleaned in years, drunk and chain smoking cigarettes, pissing into a mop bucket because he just couldn't make it to the bathroom anymore, blood pressure was 183/nothing, got him to the hospital asap.  saddest part about this is all she had to do was push his life alert button on his arm.  instead she turned the light off and left him to die, alone, told him to get help as soon as she left because she found someone who wasn't as broken and old as he is.  man, this was an eye opener, on my 40th birthday, when we, as family, trusted dad's decision making skills and girlfriend for all the years prior to stand by the man she loved and be the rock he had been to her, paying her way for everything, rent, food, allowing disability benefits to be drawn on his address, getting benefits for her children on this address, using him for all he was worth.  figured out its had been about a year since the whore had been inside this apartment also, she's been too busy scheming other married men in the neighborhood for money for crack and using dad's money to go on trips with other men to be attentive to my dad, as the neighbors had informed me.  they had been giving him money when he asked because that's all he's known will help cure the pain.  that was end of march 2021, i've been here since, scrubbing the fuck outta his apartment, getting rid of bugs (from my own pocket and savings!) losing my own clothes to the bugs, cleaning, cooking, running errands, paying bills, trying to figure out exactly what this man has been up to and why he didn't see living like this was just downright foul and wrong.  it was then i started seeing the cognitive decline.  dad has been going to the va docs drunk every appointment, showboating, being dishonest, lying to cover up other lies, masking everything because he just doesn't want to accept the quad diagnosis (early onset dementia/heart failure/copd/ed on top of mini strokes) and wants to stay young forever.  the aging process on top of it all has added more stress also.  being a veteran hasn't helped much as i'm feeling they diagnosed him a year ago and he just never told anyone.it's getting to be a lot too much lately, the constant need for nurturing, the doctors appointments in which they watch me watching him to see if i can tell if he's lying to them, the days of no sleep, the constant discord between a father and son who have never been close to begin with, warning signs of more decline, running away when he gets angry/confused/confounded and hiding, missing medications.  as a child he would always have conflicts with my ma and would use that to his advantage, most of the time abusing her physically so she would call the cops and have him escorted out just so he didn't have to give money for rent, food, clothes, shoes, etc.  this gave him reason to take his money into the streets, running the neighbor for days at a time, ignoring his child.  i clearly recall three separate instances of him hitting my ma and me snapping out at age 9, 10 and eleven.  the last being the first time i took the biggest kitchen knife and ran at him full speed with all of my might, screaming ""you ain't gonna hit my mama no more!""the other bigger factor is the hidden family secret of h molesting me and raping me.  i was taken by my ma to her mother's and it was discussed and decided that they couldn't tell anyone and ruin the family name, nor could they take me to the hospital to be seen about cause people would talk.  so it had been decided, by ma's sisters and mother, that mental help would be the best for me and i was put into programs for disgruntled/troubled youth at a very early age and the truth has never come out until after ma died about ten years ago this month.  efffffff, the last point puts so much hatred in my heart towards this man for not ever putting me first when it came to needs.  i didn't need a bike, i needed food.  i didn't need nintendo, i needed time spent with him teaching me how to work on cars and fish and be a dude.  because i was always hidden away with family after school or on weekends, i tended to get a lot of bullying from the kids in school.  the first time i was called a faggot was in kindergarten and i didn't know what it was.  i came home, asked my ma and she took me immediately to her mother who taught me to always study the word of god to find understand no matter what it is.  that book would answer any questions i had whether she or my ma had an answer or not.  my dad's mother reminded me that ""fagotto"" was a popular style of upbeat tempo in music and always told me to sing to god my troubles and trust in him with all my might and he would take care of it.since stepping into the roll of being dad's caretaker a lot has happened, i'm starting to see my own mental decline, again, after years of putting it all back together, failed marriage, losing my hair and my teeth, not eating, countless jobs, ma's funeral (that haunts me every day now because dad reminds me that he replaced her with a younger model because she was broken every day!), etc.  been seeing that i'm not the only one who's been through pure torture and mentally fucked from the person that i'm taking care of.  just recalling all of this makes me feel quite nauseated, so i think i'll stop here for now and cry myself to sleep for the next 20 minutes before he comes into the kitchen and asks me if i'm ""gonna crawl into bed with him and keep him company until he falls back to sleep"" in that same creepy tone as the night he raped me as a child.fyi: it can be very easy to assume that i would be aggressive towards him due to the nature of this post.  it's a vent situation here and i'm trusting that it's safe to let these facts out here instead of bombarding my family anymore than i have.  unearthing the family secret about my childhood is enough for them to me er speak to me again.  just wondering if there are any other caregivers who are trapped in situations like i am who have always been taught to ""honor and respect their parents"" as it has been instilled in me.  i'm doing this all by myself here, no job because he's a danger to himself and the world outside the door during the day and a wanderer at night.  thanks for the safe place y'all and letting get things off my chest.  feedback welcomed, help/food donations are very welcomed also because the stress of support his eating habits now that he's completely clean keeps me from eating daily at this point."," if you can, place a call to social services to see if he can be placed in a nursing home on county assistance. also, as ask social services to help refer you to an elder attorney who takes on pro bono work. you should probably get guardianship over your dad. if social services is of no assistance, because some times they aren’t very helpful, visit the local public library. librarians are there to help you find the information you need. some libraries even offer times that one can meet with a person from social services at the library.i agree with other commenters you need to get out of that situation, and place his care on the county. in doing so you are fulfilling your role of taking care and respecting the parent child relationship but without damaging your own mental and physical health.and you are correct, this is a good place to come and

"honestly not sure what this is, but i needed to get it off my chest.my father was perhaps one of the worst people and influences in my life. he was hateful, stubborn, aggressive, and constantly made any situation that may be joyous into one filled with anxiety and stress. he paid for little and assisted less.in his later years, he would resort to stealing money from family members purses/wallets when they weren’t looking, as well repeatedly lying about everything while verbally attacking others.i found him insufferable and in the years would repeatedly try to explain to family that something isn’t right, which fell on deaf years, until i moved out.a year or so later he was diagnosed with dementia, something that took near godly work just to convince/trick him to get the scans done. i had tried so hard to convince them something is messed up, so getting this diagnosis finally was at least some relief.my siblings immediately began to discuss how they will care for him, and i admit part of me was enraged. here is a man that wouldn’t even pay for our educations or the clothes we wore…but they are discussing who to care for him. naturally my older sister immediately attempts to shove the duties on my brother and myself because her life is clearly far more important.things he now does:things i’ve noticed about him is that his habit for lying has increased dramatically. he would even lie about the food he had eaten. for example i purchased a box of donuts for the house only to find 3 missing later. i casually mention if he liked the donuts and he immediately becomes defensive and denies eating it. it is the same with just general food in the fridge even….he hates an open window…..we aren’t sure why but if there is an open window then he rushes to shut it. this coupled with the fact he is a chain smoker makes the house absolutely stink. dare you mention that and he has his usual tantrum of showcasing aggression so that the topic is dropped.he hates open doors….i even tested this by leaving the bathroom door open late at night, 10 mins later i hear him get up to close the door then go back to the sofa. he actually got up to make sure the door was closed after i finished from the bathroom…he refuses to shower, but that being said it has been building up for years. even years back he just hated bathing and would receive repeated insults from my grandmother. now he just refuses. we believe he wipes himself down in the bathroom.he refuses to shave or cut his hair. when i came back to house sit when my brother had to leave for a bit…i was confronted with a yeti. covid causing lockdown doesn’t help since i can’t force him to a barber so….for now i guess we wait.he constantly believes my brother has stolen his money. why? from my discussions with him it seems it was based off a “memory” of my brother taking his card to withdraw money and then mocking him. naturally…it turns out it was some dream he had….he is honestly a mess, stubborn, insanely exhausting…and bordering on a human rights report of suspected neglect….."," dementia care is going to demand so much from you. my sister and i took care of our mother at home until she died. we had a hospice service for doctor/nurse visits and prescriptions. they also helped bath her. my mother was a saint and was a great mother but it got so hard when her disease advanced that i almost had a mental breakdown. i was considering putting her in a facility. if you’ve always had problems with your dad, consider hiring full time care or putting him in a facility. it’s too tough of disease to handle if you don’t have the motivation. i was absolutely committed to helping my mom and even i felt like quitting at times.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pm5ai6/father_dementia_vent/,Father Dementia Vent

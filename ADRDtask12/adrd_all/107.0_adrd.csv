"i've known my dad had dementia for at least five years now, probably longer than that. he hasn't seen a neurologist and probably won't either, so i've been depending on his family doctor for help. end of february he went into the hospital with endocarditis (infection around his heart) and sepsis (this is the second time this has happened and the last time was when the dementia was more obvious to other people than me). so he was in the hospital and rehab from feb 28- march 20 because he had to have iv antibiotics three times a day. while in rehab i don't think he was very cooperative as far as doing the rehab and he stayed pretty confused. so, he's been home since march 20th and now he has some odd behaviors and i was curious if anyone else has seen this before? since he's come home, he will no longer sit in a chair for longer than five minutes, he lays in the floor (to the point now he has to be reminded to change sides because he has a bedsore trying to form on his hip). we have been exercising him pretty good and have got him able to walk without a walker again and get up and down without issues, but he still just lies in the floor. if he goes outside he tries to lay on the ground, same thing with the porch. i've asked many times why and his answer varies wildly and even from minute to minute. if the nurse asks he said he just likes to lay in the floor. he also complains of foot pain, leg pain, hip pain and back pain and this is all over the place too. i've asked the home health rn and she's looked him over and told me that it may be behavioral and a symptom of his dementia. he refuses even half a tylenol for pain. and if he starts complaining about his leg, two seconds later it's his back or if you ask if it's still hurting he says he doesn't know what you are talking about. the lying in the floor puzzles me as well as the random pains, anyone else ever seen this?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ghn9hw/dementia_or_something_else/,Dementia or Something Else

"hi guys my mom refuses to shower or bath, i have to force her sometimes...are there any tips or tricks anyone has to deal with bath time troubles?"," bathing can be a common difficulty for many folks. lots of ways to think outside the box on this one. start with a ""pedicure"" set up. soak her feet. then as you are giving her the spa treatment, start to wash her legs, etc. if she stays relaxed during this time, see if she would accept an ""arm massage"". you can use a warm washcloth and get all the way up to get shoulders.to help her with her trunk you can expand the spa treatment to include some warm pjs after, if you help her change after arm/leg treatment, bring the warm cloth along and tell her to really get the full experience by washing under her breasts etc.you can expand the spa idea to a back rub= back warm water wash down and some great smelling lotion.this may be difficult to sustain daily, but maybe weekly. i like the idea of the hair coloring concept too. there are also hair washing products such as dry shampoo and hair cleaners used in hospital settings when a wound or body cannot get wet.most importantly do not deny her of her feelings. if for whatever reason she is fearful of water or being exposed or even feeling vulnerable because she actually needs help can be very understanding. anyone of us can understand those emotions and would hate if someone denied us of that feeling or our reaction to bring ""forced"" to get over it. she's nervous, scared or unsure of something. be in agreement with that will help you build trust with her. telling her you have been scared of being naked in front of others or how uncomfortable you felt when you depending on someone to help you, will break down a wall and create connection. let me know if you need more help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ghkp81/hygiene_battle/,hygiene battle

"hello, it's my first post on reddit. i live with my mom and my grandma who has dementia. my grandma has always been a difficult lady before her diagnosis but dementia has definitely enhanced her passive aggressive personality to the point where she is now verbally abusive and aggressive. she's always been big about patriarchy and whoever made the most money and while she's had 4 children (2 boys / 2 girls), my mom being her first child has never been the golden child. her 2 sons don't even care about her even though she spent her time and affection on them and want her out of sight out of mind. (they live overseas). my aunt is the only one mentally and financially helping my grandmother out and being supportive for my mother who is the primary caregiver. however, lately my grandmother has begun to lash out and direct all her anger towards me with abusive language and nasty lies when she calls people at all hours of the day. i try to take it in stride but hearing her delusions certainly do not make me feel good at all and her misdirecting her frustration and fixating on me all day long non stop is taking a big toll on my mental health. i took a paid leave of absence even though i'm essential in order to not risk her to any potential covid contacts; my grandmother thinks i'm unemployed and berates me even more thinking i am financially incapable of doing things.   my mom wants me to stay at my sister's house out of state (fly there) until my grandmother has ""finished her fixation"" but i'm afraid my mother will be at her wit's end once i leave. my mom gets stressed seeing me upset but i am burning out because of the constant abuse i am getting every single day. if i fly out, i have to self quarantine at my sister's for 14 days and she'd also feel very burdened by my presence. everyone else in the family is negatively affected by the matriarch but no one has the balls to mention that they are just waiting for the end to come. i don't know if me moving out for one month is going to change anything but i don't know if it's worth going out and possibly getting contracted vs the slow decline of my mental health. i just want her ... calm. i feel defeated. should i just risk it?"," do what your mum wants, move out. what good can you possibly do there ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gfrflk/abusive_grandma/,Abusive Grandma

"my mom is 56 years old. she's been retired for 5 years now, and used to work as a software engineer. she now spends her days doing ""house wife"" duties like cooking, cleaning, surfing facebook, gossiping on the phone with her sister. after moving back home recently, i've noticed some cognitive decline in her. she is extremely forgetful, has word-finding difficulties, shitty concentration/attention during conversations, has poor impulse control and is starting to behave more childlike (she will ask naive questions, or not understand how her words/actions may come off to others). some examples of inappropriate behaviors: * sending her facebook friends (including my depressed younger brother) a suicide video. it was a video of a man jumping off a building and falling to his death. * lashing out at a crowded taqueria when i let a group of young people share our communal picnic bench. everyone felt so uncomfortable.* not being able to understand why people get upset at her for her actions. * zoning out and physically getting up and leaving group conversations to do something else. even if its the conversation is positive. she has a blank look on her face a lot of the time, and thats when i know shes no longer ""present"".over the years i've harbored a lot of resentment towards her. i would just silently label her as uncaring, slow, inconsiderate, and ignorant. however, my dad has pulled me aside and expressed his concerns that something is wrong with mom, mentally. i feel like a bad child for not having more empathy towards my own mother. do you guys think she is actually showing early signs of dementia?"," this sounds similar to what i have been seeing with my husband. we are working to get a diagnosis if one is to be had. the neurologist agrees that something seems off and mentioned one particular dementia as a possibility. for now, realizing that all of these things i’ve been seeing for the past several years could all be related to dementia is making me more understanding. i can stop wondering if he is an ass or just indifferent at times because of some feeling he has towards me. if this is dementia, then this isn’t about me. that has actually comforted me even though a diagnosis of some type of dementia is, shall we say, undesirable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/geexy9/does_my_mom_have_earlyonset_dementia/,Does my mom have early-onset dementia?

"hi,first, i deeply appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and/or respond. i know we are all already stressed for a variety of reasons. i am writing on behalf of my fiancee (34f). her mother and aunt have both been diagnosed with early onset (56&amp;58 at diagnosis) alzheimers that affects them very differently. i believe her mom likely has ftd because her memory seems fine, it’s her word recall, writing, and speaking that are most difficult. currently, the two diagnosed aunts live with their other sister, who doesn’t have memory issues, but let’s just say she’s never worked a day in her life because she’s been “sick” abused xanax, had “cancer”, and other pains that have never been proven. she’s a sweet lady, we’ll call b, but has never wanted more for her life and bounced back and forth living with the, now ill, sisters before they were diagnosed.  there is also another sister living with her husband nearby. their mother and stepdad are also alive and well living independently in their 70s and 80s. when my fiancee’s mom was diagnosed going on 3 years ago, her grandparents moved into to “help” which turned out mostly to be taking all her mom’s 401k and giving it to her younger sister for college. this was roughly 40k. come to find out after that there were also $500 monthly transfers from her sister’s bank account to their son in prison. my fiancee confronted her grandfather and he blew up and they have not had much of a relationship since. we suspect most of that money is gone and was not used on her sister but was used for them to move into a house (whereas they were living in a camper before). my fiancee had suggested saving that money for her mother’s long term care, no one listened and took what they wanted. grandfather also got power of attorney of her mom and then grandfather(step) and mom moved out into a new house.  once her aunt (d) was diagnosed she moved into her mom’s place with the other sister (b) who had been living with d already. i know this is confusing, i apologize. so basically, the two sick sisters and the other one b are all living together in her mom’s place. her mom was lucky enough to have ssi and a pension coming in which basically provided for all of them and has until this point. b contributes $400 a month but that’s for everything (rent, bills, food, whatever she wants). my fiancee’s mom has essentially been paying for them to live in a nice 3/2 bath townhome for the past 2-3 years. not accounting all the years before she was sick. my fiancee has repeatedly attempted to get her mom and aunts involved in research studies, structured activities, hobbies, in-home care etc., but they have refused all of it. they seem to want to wallow and wait to die. they fight with each other (which has gone on their whole lives) and bicker and complain and just want to blow up my fiancee’s phone guilting her to come over and “help”. my fiancee has brought groceries, makes sure everything is paid for, and offered other services. but they just want to pull her down into their negative state full of drama. meanwhile my fiancee is trying to finish her degree, work, plan a wedding, make sure her younger sister is okay emotionally and staying focused in college. in our minds their needs are taken care of, we cannot control their attitudes and personality problems. here we are today, and they are insisting her mom needs to be in a home. it’s “too much”. meanwhile, she can feed herself, bathe herself, dress herself etc. if they are fighting i cannot guarantee it’s because of alzheimers. they seem to think it’s solely my fiancee’s responsibility to put her mom some place and somehow find out how to pay for it. we do not have the money. her mom does have medicaid, but does she even qualify for a place at this point? i don’t think she could be left alone for long, but she doesn’t wander. we are at our wits end dealing with them when they haven’t wanted to plan, have family meetings, help themselves, and have done nothing but taken advantage of the situation until it doesn’t benefit them anymore. my fiancee is the most caring and compassionate person. she wants nothing more than to have happy, positive family get togethers despite their illness. her relationship the her mom has never been perfect. her mom was very controlling and manipulative. mom was verbally and somewhat physically abusive growing up, my fiancee never had stability and male figures were always in and out of her mom’s life. oh yeah, none of these women are married or have been for years. she always wanted her mom to be happy but she was always too busy working for fun. not to say her mom was all bad, they never went without and she always supported my fiancee’s dreams. it just seems to have ripped this family apart and shown everyone’s true colors. my fiancee keeps having mental breakdowns and cannot handle the burden of this without any other family support or understanding. we live the further away than any of them but they are now saying my fiancee needs to call alz.org and find a place for her. they have repeatedly said no amount of money will make a difference in her care lol. we are just at a loss. at this point my fiancee’s phone is off and we have become so hardened to the situation. we are feeling (whether right or wrong) that the people who took everything from her mom should figure it the f*&amp;$ out instead of pawning it off on us when they never wanted to be honest or work together before. this may sound horrible but we feel like they had their chance to have a life. the illness is cruel and unfair but their are lifestyle factors that did play into. if we let this consume us..we surely will never have a chance at a normal life. i don’t know how they think moving her mom into a home will be good for them either, aside from (maybe) less fighting. they don’t have enough between them to live on their own. also, my fiancee’s mom would no longer be able to pay for her sister’s dorm which she has been able to with her pension. she cannot live with us because we don’t have room, work all day, and my fiancee would honestly go insane/take her own life. it’s a mess and we are sick about it. don’t know what to do. want to go to sleep and wake up to a new life. we would greatly appreciate any advice or support &lt;3"," god, reading all this breaks my heart. my grandma’s dementia ended up exacerbating long standing conflicts in my family and caused several rifts that will likely never heal. but my grandpa, and then my uncle, who had power of attorney at least always had her best interests at heart and made sure she always received the care she needed. i just wanted to respond to say that your fiancé, her mother, and you have my most sincere sympathies. i can only imagine the struggles she must be feeling in wanting to care for her for mom while navigating that familial mine field. the only small advice i can offer is the general notion that while is perfectly right to feel guilty about your own actions, one should never feel guilty about the actions of others. based on what you wrote there really was only so much she actually could have done, and it seems like she did that. i’m sorry i can’t offer more, your experience is beyond my ken. please accept my sympathy and all the internet hugs in existence, know that i’ll have you both in my thoughts, and feel free to reach out to me if you need an ear to vent to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ge4s75/bitter_and_exhausted_full_of_anger_and_about_to/,Bitter and exhausted.

"hello! my grandfather has dementia and is currently in the hospital because he refuses to eat and take his medication. the nurses at the hospital will put applesauce and other foods in his mouth but he just refuses to eat, so he’s being fed only through iv and he’s lost a lot of weight. he doesn’t spit out or swallow the food, he just won’t do anything. they have done a couple brain scans and other tests, but they haven’t found anything wrong with him. he just started doing this very suddenly this week. since he’s stopped eating, he’s also become mute and won’t engage in any activity (coloring, activity boards, etc). we have tried talking to him over the phone every day since we can’t go see him, but he’s just silent. this is extremely odd behavior for him, because he used to be very social until this week, just slow at talking and sometimes couldn’t come up with the right words to say. everyone in my family is so lost as to what to do, so i have a couple questions. 1) does anyone have any experience with dementia patients/family members who refuse to eat? do they have to stay in the hospital forever?2) what activities could we provide my grandfather if/when he comes home from the hospital? we had tried most common things people suggest for dementia patients before he went into the hospital, but he refuses to engage in any activity or talk. he won’t even look at the tv if it’s on. it honestly sounds like he’s mentally checked out, but if that is the case, no one in my family knows how to care for someone like that."," if he has a sore throat, he may not know how to articulate it. he may pick up any nervousness or sense of unsure related to all the changes happening right now. honestly, he sounds like he may be depressed. depression presents very differently in people with dementia. withdrawal/not engaging, and refusal to eat, are two signs. depression will make any symptom of dementia worse. ask if he can be evaluated by a psychologist (not a psychiatrist, unless they are very familiar with the overlap of dementia and mental health). clinical psychologists are trained as diagnosticians. evaluations are much more in depth and medication is not always the first recommendation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gbr25y/questions_about_dementia_care/,Questions about dementia care

"and he looks so weak.. and skinny.. and his voice is barely recognisable (he beat corona. he's 90). my parents were really happy to see it but i broke down, i'm so afraid once we get to see him again he won't recognise us. how do i deal with losing someone i haven't phyiscally lost yet?"," >how do i deal with losing someone i haven't physically lost yet?by treating yourself with empathy and kindness. even though his body is still here, so much of his personality and the characteristics that made him recognizable to you have changed. there's real grief in that loss of the person you knew. just be aware of your feelings and try to not shame yourself for having them. my grandmother had dementia in the couple years prior to passing at 91. she lived with us in her final year, so i helped my mom out a lot with caretaking. there were times when my grandmother forgot she had grandkids, children, or even that she'd been married. there was one time when she mistook me for one of her high school teachers (i was only 16 at the time). it was sad to see her so disoriented when i would try to recall her back to the current times (i just didn't really know what else to do), and she just couldn't make that leap... and looking back, i think the better moments were really just when i managed to played along and tried to empathize with her in whatever moment she was in at the time. i got to hear her talk about her brothers like when they were all kids (even about her youngest brother, who died when he was 17), and that was stuff i didn't really get to hear her talk about when she was lucid in the current timeline.it's really hard to watch someone become a sort of shadow of the person we once knew. it's devastating when they reach a point when they forget the people closest to them. what i say next is not to invalidate your feelings about losing someone you love, and i'm not trying to add a silver lining to this experience of grief: i think it may help you cope with upcoming interactions with your grandpa (if he is in a state of failed memory) to focus on getting to know him in these moments as if he is a new person - because he is a new person in respects to how you knew him. it doesn't make him bad or broken - just different.dementia is disorienting for the person experiencing it, and that can force them to regress into childlike states of expressing frustration and fear. if his caretakers are saying he's having an off day, you may just need to play along with him in whatever headspace he's in. there will be days when he's not going to know that he's grandpa, but he might know who he is as an earlier version of himself, and you can interact with that version of him on that day. on those days, you just keep things simple. like with my grandmother - when all else failed, i'd ask her if she would like me to make her an ice cream sundae. man, that woman never stopped loving ice cream. she might not have remembered that i was her granddaughter, but she would always smile and say, ""oh, how pretty! you should open up an ice cream parlor!"" it's gonna feel weird, and it's okay to step back and make space for your feelings when you need to. this type of situation requires empathy for everyone involved. make sure you have at least one person you can trust to talk to and lean on for emotional support. your grandpa, as you knew him, may not always be present, but some aspects of his personality will be there. you can mourn and miss the characteristics and shared memories you had with him, and you can be present and find appreciation for the good qualities he's able to exhibit right now. it doesn't have to be an either/or situation: you're allowed to feel both grief for your loss and gratitude for the moments you can still have with him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gbfqk8/the_carehome_put_up_a_video_of_my_grandpa/,The carehome put up a video of my grandpa

"so my dad has always been good at keeping his stuff together, never really ever forgets stuff. recently hes been forgetting some minor stuff, like hed forget where he put stuff, nothing to crazy but like where he put his wallet or where he put his favorite bottle of water. yesterday though he went to sleep after cooking, and my sister came home and saw the gas was on and she turned it off.recently he started working a new job that requires a night shift and goes into work at 11pm and comes home at 8 am. i do realize he usually does forget stuff when hes tired. like yesterday my sister said he was in a bad mood and he usually gets those moods when hes really tired or stressed out. he drives to work with no issue, remembers to pay bills, he goes shopping for us in the morning for food, he cooks almost every day. there is no changes in his personality. he was always prone to some bi polar mood swings but actually since his new hours at the job hes clearly been happier. &amp;#x200b;there is no history of dementia on his side, his father lived to 90 and his mind was sharp and his mother, while having ptsd from her child hood was sharp too from what i was told. his brother and sister are sharp too, both older than him and totally sharp. my dad is 60. &amp;#x200b;a few weeks ago he forgot where he misplaced a few things and i asked him about it, and he was totally good untill yesterday when he left the gas on and went to sleep. &amp;#x200b;should i be concerned or no?"," i agree to be watchful. maybe he is just tired and stressed with the new job. it’s hard to sleep working the night shift, especially if you then have to sleep at night on your days off. i do want to ask about his old job. why did he leave it? did he leave for a better opportunity or was his old job not going well for him. if he is experiencing dementia, his job performance/behaviors have likely been effected. that could result in a firing or at least his previous employers highly encouraging him to seek employment elsewhere. do you know of any poor performance reviews or any complaints filed against him at his old job? if so, that would be another thing to add to your list of possible signs of dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g7wqvz/is_my_dad_getting_dementia/,is my dad getting dementia?
"this is in maryland usamy mother is 53 and has progressed to about a late stage 6/ early stage 7 of her early onset dementia (frontotemporal dementia) over the course of the past 4 years since her diagnosis / stage 4.in 2017 my brothers and i got her into a 'home style' assisted living / memory care facility with 3 full-time around the clock caregivers &amp; 6 residents. it's been great so far for the most part. she was happy, we got to visit her frequently, she was being well taken care of.however over the course of the past 3 years, there have been a few caregivers hired that weren't as good as others. some were kind of rough when helping feed or dress my mother. but with this care facility it seems like i see a new face every 2-3 months. which i think is normal in this line of work.anyway - the caregivers aren't the problem. they have been great for the most part. the problem is the management / owners.when i was sold on this particular spot, i was told in no uncertain terms that it's a long-term care facility and that many residents live here until they die and that they even provide in-home hospice for the final month(s).  i didn't really want to think about that at the time, but it sounded like a solid choice because we were uncertain how long my mother's early onset dementia would last..  and everything about the facility seemed perfect.  10 minutes away, friendly staff, clean conditions, etc.fast forward 3 years later to now.  there have been several hurdles my brothers and i have had to overcome (mainly me as the primary / oldest) while my mother has lived there, but none worse than right now.  last week i got a phone call from the head caregiver  / manager and the owner of all of their care facilities telling me, ""you need to take your mother to the hospital so they can find her fast placement at a new facility immediately.""   this is during the height of the covid-19 pandemic...i asked them why she needed to find a new place since they are 'full service' till 'end of life' with memory care, etc, and they told me that my mother was ""walking around with her arms outstretched 'touching things and people' with her head tilted back"". and that she had knocked some things off the wall with her hands.  they said this makes her a danger to herself ...???needless to say i was pretty upset that they were asking me to do something so unsafe right now such as driving directly to a hospital / emergency room with my dementia-ridden mother during the covid-19 pandemic.  it sounded over the phone like they were simply fed up with dealing with my mother, at least that's the impression i got.i told them in no uncertain terms that there is absolutely no way i am taking her to a hospital right now, and that  i would begin looking for new facilities in maryland immediately. maybe some that actually do what they say they are going to do.i followed up with my mother's current care facility over a week ago specifically asking them to provide a detailed letter / e-mail telling me exactly why my mother is no longer eligible for assisted living at their care facility, and they simply said they would send me 'an assessment from her primary care physician.'  nothing about how long she has to live there before being kicked out, nothing about a 30 or 60 day notice, just that.  i followed up again today reaming them out saying they need to give me what i'm asking for so i can find her placement in a new facility immediately.i'm currently talking to a bunch of memory care facilities in maryland &amp; florida, both self-pay and medicaid, scrambling trying to find her a new place to live. but nobody is taking new patients right now so i feel like i'm trapped between a rock and a hard place. and i need answers that her current assisted living facility isn't providing!!  \*\*my question is a legal one; is the care facility legally responsible for asking me to do something so unsafe such as taking mom to a hospital during the pandemic / stay-at-home orders when she's not sick?  and what right do they have to kick her out in maryland? how much time do i have??\*\*also if anyone has any maryland memory care facility suggestions in the $3-4k per month price range, self-pay and/or medicaid, please send them to me.  \*\*tl:dr; care facility says my mom needs to go, but won't tell me exactly why, or send me the information i need to find a new facility. and they told me to ""take her to the hospital and let the doctors and nurses find her placement quickly"" during covid-19 pandemic.", have they checked her for a uti? sudden onset of new symptoms can sometimes be indicative of a uti in people with dementia and the geriatric population.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g7uix0/legal_help_care_facility_is_asking_me_to/,[LEGAL? / HELP] Care Facility is asking me to personally drive my STAGE 7 Mother to the emergency room so they can 'find her new placement quickly.'

(it's stress on our sleep schedule as well). last night he wanted to go to target at 4 am. he ended up passing out in the living room and being furious when he woke up- (literally the moment of awakening) to why he isnt ready for the day (showered- brushed teeth etc). his sense of time is gone , no clue what time of the day it is. and most importantly his appetite is gone. &amp;#x200b;i dont think anyone who hasn't dealt with a dementia afflicted family member would understand where im coming from - ive already accepted my father is gone. i know at some point it will get worse- the question is how long do we keep living like this. even with a care giver 12 hours a day he is still very dependent on us and other people.&amp;#x200b;i dont think its a very fun life to live and i am highly considering hospice. yes i am thinking of nursing homes but 1) covid makes admission a whole lot harder 2) he is still conscious to not want to go to one 3) if hospice is an option i would prefer home hospice. &amp;#x200b;anyone make a decision like this before?"," you don't want him on hospice. you want him in a nursing home. hospice is for someone with 6 months or less to live and a doctor usually has to recommend it and push for it. my grandmother was on home hospice (thankfully) the last month of her life. i agree that those without dementia family members will not understand. my grandmother was a bit of a handful but no where near what others deal with. you need to do what's best for your father, your family and your pets. he may not want to go but you don't want him to kill you or your family or do something that will hurt him. also try to talk to his doctor and find a good home. that will make a difference in the transition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g7hckf/did_you_ever_decide_to_put_your_dementiaafflicted/,Did you ever decide to put your dementia-afflicted family member on hospice?

"my sister texted me yesterday.  mom and dad were at her place a few days ago and she was helping him with his computer.  said that he was having a very difficult time following along with what she was doing, forgetting things.  mom says he's been getting increasingly forgetful for a while, and quarantine seems to be making it worse.  he's in his early 80s, so it was expected that sooner or latter the inevitable slide towards the long night would come sooner or later, but now it's here for me and my family.he hasn't seen a doctor yet, he hasn't gotten any sort of diagnosis or treatment plan.  he's still able to take care of himself, but we don't know how long that will last.  my mom is having to deal with a man who has always been difficult, but who is now slowly fading.  i can't even really talk to her because they live in a small house and she can't go out without him.next week my sister and i are going to go over to their home and i'm going to try to talk to mom and come up with some sort of a plan.  but i've studied this, and i've worked in patient care, and i know that there is never a happy ending to this story.  i don't want him to forget who his family is, or the things he's accomplished, or the people he's helped.  i don't want him to be a drain on my mom, a woman who has taken care of him for sixty years and deserves her own rest.  is it selfish of me to hope that if he really does have dementia that something comes along and kills him before it gets too far gone?  like a heart attack or some kind of fast acting cancer that isn't treatable?  i think i'd want that for myself but then i'm still relatively young and won't have to think about myself in that situation for years yet.  i don't want to lose my father or my mother, even tho i know it's going to happen regardless, but i especially don't want to lose either of them bit by bit.i had a beautiful cat that i rescued off the street when i was younger.  she was my best friend, and she always took care of me when i needed it.  then she started losing weight, and a trip to the vet found a mass in her abdomen.  that was the worst day of my life, since i knew it would be the last day i had her in it.  but i am at least able to find some solace in the fact that it took her quickly, and almost painlessly up until the moment she died in my arms.  she never lost her instincts, or her personality, or her dignity.  i had that for my cat, i want that for my mom and dad.  they're good people who devoted their lives to the service of others.  and i don't know what to do."," if this truly is dementia, a couple resources are a book titled “the 36 hour day” and youtube videos by teepa snow.  good luck with your dad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g6p910/my_father_is_staring_to_go/,My father is staring to go
"# nutritional ketosis and photobiomodulation remediate mitochondria warding off alzheimer’s disease in a diabetic, apoe4+ patient with mild cognitive impairment: a case report## highlights- case study evaluates the effects of a 10-week clinically prescribed ketogenic nutrition protocol combined with photobiomodulation (pbm) with a 59-year-old male, heterozygous apoe4 carrier, with a dual diagnosis of mild ad and type 2 diabetes (t2dm) for 11 years. clinical goals of treatment included increased hypothalamic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as measured using homa-ir, which takes into account insulin and glucose levels; lowered hga1c; normalization of blood lipid panel and improved memory by restoring cognitive functionality measured using the moca (montreal cognitive assessment).- physiological biomarkers for t2dm and cognitive functionality were assessed pre-/mid-/ post intervention. these measures included: homa-ir, triglycerides/hdl ratio, hga1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and a complete fasting lipid panel. cognitive function was measured via the moca in order to localize compromised function to specific areas of the brain.- the moca score improved from 20/30 (mild ad) pre-intervention to 26/30 (normal) post intervention. hga1c decreased from 9.4% pre-intervention to 6.4% post intervention. the reduction was accomplished without supplementation of injectable insulin. homa-ir, a gold standard for insulin resistance, decreased from 4.67 pre-treatment to 0.79 post-treatment (normal = &lt;1). likewise, other cardiac biomarkers reflected statistical significance.- the results of this case study strongly suggest that the use of a clinically prescribed ketogenic diet and pbm may have significant potential in restoring cognition, increasing insulin sensitivity, and improving metabolic flexibility in diabetic, apoe4 heterozygous individuals. mechanisms of action point to an increase in metabolic flexibility as reflected by an increase in insulin sensitivity and decrease in hga1c. the increase in cognitive function likely reflects improved delivery of fuel substrates to the starving brain and restoration of mitochondrial function.## abstractalzheimer’s disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative progressive disorder for which there is currently no cure. recently, there has been a robust correlation between type-2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) and the development of mci and ad, which is now referred to as type-3 diabetes. this is extremely important in recognizing both ad and t2dm as metabolic pathologies, which can be traced to the level of mitochondrial function. although glucose is known to be the deferred source of fuel for cells, ketone bodies have been observed to be able to provide metabolically compromised brain cells with an alternative fuel source, bypassing deficiencies in glut transport due to increased insulin resistance. by keeping glucose and insulin levels low to allow for the production of ketones, there is evidence that mitochondrial function will be restored, which treats the underlying problems of t2dm and mci. further, visible red or near-infrared (nir) light has been shown to heal and stimulate damaged tissue by interacting with the mitochondria to restore function. this case study evaluates the effects of a 10-week clinically prescribed ketogenic nutrition protocol combined with transcranial photobiomodulation (pbm) with a 59-year-old male, heterozygous apoe4 carrier, with a dual diagnosis of mild ad and an 11 year history of insulin dependent type 2 diabetes (t2dm). statistically significant results reflect an 83% reduction in homa-ir; 64% decrease in the triglyceride/hdl ratio; hga1c reduction from 9.44% to 6.4%; a 57% decrease in vldl and triglycerides; and normalized cognition as measured via the moca (montreal cognitive assessment), 26/30 post intervention.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g6im5t/nutritional_ketosis_and_photobiomodulation/,"Nutritional Ketosis and photobiomodulation remediate mitochondria warding off Alzheimer’s disease in a diabetic, ApoE4+ patient with mild cognitive impairment: A case report"

"hi there - first post on this reddit. my mom is approximately two years into dealing with dementia. no official diagnosis, but doctors are fairly certain about her cognitive impairment. since my dad’s passing 10 years ago, i am (general) power of attorney for my mother. i read the document, but i don’t speak legalese... mom’s gp recommended having enduring power of attorney. can someone explain to me what the difference is?thanks in advance."," hey!i'm no lawyer, but this is my understanding:so, a general power of attorney generally covers short term incapacitation or inability to deal with your medical or financial life. say you are in a terrible car accident and spend months in hospital recovering, or you go travel europe for 6 months... you can set up a general poa so that someone can pay your bills for you, or whatever. when you return to capacity, you have the power to kind of turn off the poa and resume authority over your own affairs. importantly, a general poa does *not* cover a person's mental incapacitation. an enduring poa is long term, and does cover mental incapacitation. in fact, to the best of my knowledge, its *intention* is to cover mental incapacitation because you have to specify, in an enduring poa, if you also want it to cover you for things like the car accident scenario above. enduring poas are harder to 'turn off' because they would require the person that they cover to return to mental capacity to do so. there are some kind of complicated processes out there by which a concerned party could get an individual's poa revoked if they suspect that the poa isn't acting in good faith.so... tl;dr: general poa = short term; enduring poa = long term. hope that helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g6aqir/canada_general_poa_vs_enduring_poa/,Canada - General POA vs. Enduring POA
"hello all. my dad has been home for 2 weeks after a few weeks in hospital due to tests for diabetes issues and his ongoing parkinson’s. he is now home, after a very badly rushed discharge.....obviously for pandemic reasons. anywho....i live and care for him just by myself normally, but we now have carers coming in 4 x a day to help with his personal care. his mobility has declined, but more distressing is how his dementia has really kicked in over the last 2 months or so. due to all this he is now sometimes incontinent, or so confused or immobile that he has incontinence pads and basically has to go to the loo in bed if the carers aren’t here to help him use the commode or urinal. it’s basically impossible for me to help with any of this, as he is a dead weight due to immobility, i’m pretty tiny and it’s distressing for a father and daughter to have to deal with.i never knew how much caring for somebody, was about waterworks!! i wish i could help him more, but it’s easiest for the carers if he just lets it all go and lets the incontinence pads, special mattress protector and all the frills we’ve tried, soak up whatever they can. however!!.....with the dementia side of his parkinson’s, he decides to undress himself entirely when he needs to go. how he does this is beyond me, when he struggles to move in other ways. since he’s been home neither of us have slept very well, either because he wails or bashes the bed during the night, tries to get out of bed and falls, or generally the stress of the situation. tired of trying to explain how it would be best for him to keep his pants on to let them absorb everything, rather than get naked and let the pee go everywhere. i know he doesn’t really understand so it’s a waste of time. but heck it’s exhausting. stop getting starkers dad!!!nurses considered conveens or catheters, but they decided against them as he is likely to pull at those as well. oh i’m just so tired of it all...and can only imagine how dad feels. he shouldn’t have to lie in a wet bed. the washing is constant and i hope the house doesn’t smell too much of urine......hard to tell anymore being in the same house. but that feels like the least important thing....but it’s still his house and i want him to live in a nice, clean environment.apologies for the long rant....there is so much more...his troubling diabetes, his right eye that no longer works and is closed, the first anniversary of my mums death tomorrow.....not to mention the unmentionable horror the world is facing right now. one day at a time i guess.....but boy oh boy i wish he’d keep his pants on!!! all the best to all x"," potty training. sounds messed up but we had great success with it. set times to do a wee. we chose 7pm, 11pm & 6am. we'd get them to sit up on the edge of the bed (not standing) & use a bottle. make a sound each time to train them (psssssssssss). then back to bed.there's a huge amount of stress around wetting yourself & he's obviously feeling that. you'd hate to wake up in the night, need to go, can't get up & then hold as long as you can before wetting the bed. then you'd naturally want to strip off & get out of the wet bed. very stressful & losing sleep will only make it worse.i really, really hate the whole, ""it's easier for carers if they wear pads"" line. it's so stressful for the patient when they still have that awareness & can ruin their toileting ability long term.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g67yt6/father_with_parkinsons_dementia_suddenly/,Father with Parkinson’s dementia suddenly declining and the incontinence issues are stressful for everyone involved
"i am at a complete loss as to what to do. first of all this is a somewhat unique case, it's due to my father being a unique human. he came from a broken home with a bunch of siblings, worked hard all his life and is now retired. he was always a me. fix it type of guy. he never had friends, he doesn't like creative outlets even music he hated, and he has always been negative but now it's 100% of the time.my father begins his freakouts when he realizes he isn't allowed to leave; i've come to the decision to keep the rest of us safe since everyone including myself is someone who is at high risk of covid19 exposure by not allowing anyone here to leave except me i'd go get the stuff they needed. you get older you take care of your folks yaknow? or at least that's what i feel you should do.anyways he realizes he can't leave it obsessed about trying to find a mask so he can leave, i know you're probably thinking why not just give him a mask and let him go to the store or something? he got lost going to the end of the road, began driving on the opposite side of the road like this was england, and is always drinking alcohol so even before this covid19 situation him driving made us all nervous. he feels, understandably, that he isn't allowed to do anything anymore and he acts out.i came home from groceries yesterday, my dad was in a better mood than normal he went into his bedroom. my sister and i had a disagreement about an item written on the grocery list, he came out of his room screaming ""i want these two cunts out of here! i'm going to kill you both!"" i'm used to his threats but for him to threaten my sister was new so he's gotten worse. for the next 8 hours he tried to destroy everything and anything he could...he tried finding the titles to the cars to shred, he was trying to look up how to hot wire a car, he was looking up how to kill us and get away with it...it's an everyday occurance, he asks why he can't leave or obsesses about needing a mask. when he realizes or after i explain to him there aren't enough masks to go around i've been reusing the same one and sanitizing it and medical workers don't even have enough so there won't be any for him.he almost killed himself he decided to walk off the property, we figured cool he will walk it off and calm down. he was asking mom for the number for 911, but we just kept quiet. we knew if he called the police we weren't going to lie about his threats and he would likely be arrested for typical domestic violence. anyways he walks 0.3 miles to a neighbor's house, beats on his door, and says ""can you call the police for me my family won't give me a mask?"" thankfully the neighbors just said they didn't want to be involved. he almost killed himself just by walking off the property, he couldn't make it back to the house we had to go pick him up.he is spending his days trying to figure out how to make our lives hell and get us to cave in and give him what he wants. he literally doesn't even need anything he just has this compulsion to leave and go shopping. i can't tell you how much money we have saved since he's been quarentined.so yeah that's the story but how in the heck can i get him to ""reset"" when he is going off on a tangent like this? yesterday my sister and i hid for 8 hours while he continued to throw tantrums to my mother, my mom even told me to give him the keys at one point im like sorry i'm not going to cave.  he is so unsanitary, he will crap his pants then stick his hand down there and while it on his shirt. i have a hard time explaining to him a mask is only part of it, being germ conscious and cleaning your hands frequently is just as important.so please any and all guidance, words of wisdom, tips and tricks, hacks, whatever you have i need!!do post it's with info like ""no masks are in stock"" or ""people over 65 &amp; high risk health should stay home""  would help him? i'm thinking maybe remove the human telling him no from the equation and have the post it tell him no basically...should i call the cops when he comes at me to hurt me or threatens to shoot us? can you have their doctor prescribe them a sedative?i was hoping this aggression would pass but it's refueled everyday by not being able to leave."," if you live in the usa, see if there is an area agency on aging in your city.  some of them have mobile mental health units that can help.my relative went through a phase like this, but she lived alone at the time.  she passed out of that phase and is now fairly easy to deal with.it would probably not be possible to get him into a facility at the moment, since most of the long term care facilities will not keep someone who is violent.  like you said, they will evict them from facilities when they are violent.  the mental health involuntary commitment, which is not specific to dementia, might take him if he is considered a danger to other people.  this is usually time limited - maybe three days.  however, when i tried this option, my relative lied to the police, so they wouldn't take her for an involuntary commitment.  i have heard of other people who were able to get the police to take people with dementia to one of these mental health facilities for usually a short stay of a few days.  if you do this, keep records of the police reports.  these reports can help (depending on the courts in your area) if you try to request that he is declared incompetent.  i don't know much about medication, but i have heard that medication causes more problems  and that behavioral interventions tend to work better.  search youtube for teepa snow and aggression.  she provides training for dealing with dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g61oeu/i_need_some_options_my_father_deserves_better/,"I need some options, my father deserves better than this but he isn't even himself anymore it's sad.

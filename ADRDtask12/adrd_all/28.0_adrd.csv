"forgive me if this isn’t appropriate but myself and the rest of management where i work is totally stumped. one of our former employees, who last worked here over a decade ago, has begun showing up again because he no longer remembers that he doesn’t work here. this began about 6-8 weeks ago and has begun to increase in frequency. we are all extremely concerned in this situation because none of us have direct experience in handling confusion in dementia. he does leave without exhibiting any verbal or physical aggression but it’s clear that this is beginning to frustrate him. not only are we extremely concerned about his health in general, we are worried about his reactions escalating to the point where our staff begins to feel threatened. what is the best course of action to take in this situation?"," this is so sad.i agree with rudderusa to tell him he is on vacation, and i really hope you can reach family soon. it's dangerous for him to be wondering like that alone. when he comes in again do you think he would tell you his phone number? maybe you could reach his primary caretaker that way? although i'm stumped that anyone would let him wander alone in his condition. also please let us know how it goes. i don't even know the guy and i feel concerned for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dcw3rk/employer_in_need_of_advice/,Employer In Need of Advice

my sister and i are pretty sure my mother is is showing significant signs of developing alzheimers.  unfortunately her mother succumbed to the disease years ago and she was very involved with the care of her mother. we think she is trying to keep it hidden as she is scared and doesn't want to confront. i too am scared because i know what my mom went through caring for her mother. just visited alz.org and did some reading. a little overwhelmed this morning because i'm pretty sure something isn't right and need to figure out where to begin. i think the first step is to sit down and have a discussion with her and that won't be easy. if anyone has any suggestions for someone in my position i would welcome any input. just beginning to try to figure out how we will navigate this and i'm having a lot of emotions regarding the situation.," also, be aware of anosognosia. basically, it’s a condition where the person with alzheimer’s physically (because of the restructuring of their brain) cannot comprehend there is anything wrong with them. i think my mom had this and it made getting her diagnosed extremely difficult. it’s different from denial, but the behavior seems similar. if you try to tell your mother that you think there is an issue, but she doesn’t accept it, imo: don’t argue with her. if she has anosognosia, arguing won’t do anything but agitate her unnecessarily. you’ll just have to get creative and talk to her doctor independently or be sneaky with getting her diagnosed.hoping this won’t be an issue for you, but best to be prepared.good luck and remember, as alone as you may feel, you aren’t alone. we are all on a similar path. keep asking for help and take care of yourself too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dbfi4b/im_pretty_sure_my_mother_is_at_the_beginning/,I'm pretty sure my mother is at the beginning stages.

"hi all. this is my first post in this group. i joined because my mom and i really suspect my dad (63y) is in some stage of early onset alzheimers or some form of dementia. i usually use the term dementia because i hate to diagnose. his uncle battled alzheimers, as well as his younger brother, so it definitely runs in the genes for men of the family.my question is, does the disease affect how one cares about ones personal health? he's always been overweight, but since his mental struggles have increased, his weight has gone up a lot. he only eats fast food, breakfast food, or those little pot pies that you put in the oven, or the occasional pizza. never a balanced meal, and the only time he'll ever cook for himself anymore is breakfast food or a tv dinner. any even minute physical activity has him sweating buckets. his job is stationary and he basically sits in a vehicle for 10-14 hours a day. i'm just curious, is there any connection between physical health deteriorating but also caring less about physical health when one is starting to show signs of alzheimers? thanks for any help! &lt;3"," my mom was never great at filters in general, but with alzheimer's her filter for appropriate behavior got even worse. that including things she said about other people while they were within earshot, lack of hygiene like deciding wearing smelly clothes and not showering is fine for going out in public where she never would have done that in the past, flashing her chest at me (i mean never appropriate or appreciated, but even less so in the dining hall!). i suspect her dementia-induced lack of filter is related to her eating habits. like a normal person might secretly want to eat 3 slices of cheesecake for dinner, but the rational filter in our brain overrules it, saying nope, you're gonna have to eat your protein and veggies first and then maybe you can have a piece of cheesecake, if you haven't already had some with lunch, or every other day this week, and you've done a bit of exercise today and otherwise eaten healthy. and my mother used to eat pretty healthy. but then her ability to self-regulate broke, and she convinced herself she needed dessert every night, she developed diabetes. sometimes she complains that things taste bitter even though they are things she used to enjoy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/d7tr2b/alzheimers_on_physical_health/,Alzheimers on physical health?

"to being with my mother was diagnosed with dementia (probably alzheimer’s from having a grand-mother go through it but getting her to go back to the doctors has been difficult) about six months ago.  at that time they called us and told us what was going on and that they would like us to move home (we live about a 14 hour drive away from them at the moment) and build an extra house on their property to be able to help my father out with the long term care that my mother will require.  me and my wife agreed and made plans to move back home in about 2 months from that time.  we decided with my father that we would take what is my mothers workshop (she does crafts for a living) and use that to live in while the house was being built.  at first this was fine, then as things started coming out of the shop my mothers attitude changed and became aggressive towards my father about the changes being done.  it finally came to a crashing halt about a month before we were set to move back in a phone call that had my father just say forget the whole thing.  luckily my wife could rescind her notice to her work and we hadn’t given notice to where we rent but it was still a bit jarring to say the least.fast forward to this last week back home visiting them.  my mother is farther along than i realized from the phone conversations i’ve been having with her.  she repeats herself sometimes within just minutes of saying something and forgets she’s the one that came up with certain ideas just earlier in the day.  she’s always had a problem with not letting go of the past and complaining a lot but now with alzheimer’s its gone to a whole new level.  it’s like all the crappiest things that ever happened to her is on constant rewind in her head.  this of course has not helped my parents relationship.  my father has always kind of just let my mother be in charge and given her a bit of a wide-berth on anything she had an issue with.  so now that dynamic between them is keeping us from going forward with any real help for them.  he needs help because he cant leave her alone and no one is there to really help him.  i’m an only child and they really don’t have anyone else to lean on for help.  even if he could find someone to come sit with her so he could get some time away she would just hold it over is head that he left her for how ever long before the next thing happens that bothers her.  i see this already aging him (he’s 73) and its not even been a year yet.  my mother can be a very sweet person but she had a difficult childhood and tends to linger on the negatives and isn’t able to move on or fully forgive.  so here’s my dilemma.  me, my wife and my father all want us living next to them to be able to help him moving forward with her.  my wife has medical assistant training and worked in a nursing home for years so she has hands on experience with this.  we’ve been renting for years and we’ve already been looking into buying a house so being able to build a house for us on my childhood homestead which me and my wife love would be nice.  also being able to help my mother through this would be rewarding for myself.  my mother has and even is at times on board with all of this, until she’s sat and worried about it so much that she freaks out on my father about it, and then when it gets to the nuclear level he caves.  me and my wife have i think been able to finally get him to see that he needs to take the wheel and make some hard decisions even when there is going to be a fight involved at some point.  he agrees but to be honest i’m not sure if i can fully trust him on it since he always does cave in the end, its what happened six months ago and i don’t know if he’ll do it again when push comes to shove.so now the question is how do we get her onboard with this.  my father needs it to happen so i don’t end up losing him from the stress alone and we need to have some stability in knowing how to plan our lives moving forward.  the plan is as of now for us to move back home in may and start building a house on their property close enough to their house to help but not so close as to be in their way.  the idea of changing any part of their house always ends in her freaking out eventually about it, even if it was originally her idea.  for right now i convinced my father to take my mother out of the discussion process of this as it seems giving her any information to dwell on usually leads to her worrying about it until she lays into him about it.  we don’t want to just surprise her with it but i’m also not sure how to approach it in a positive way but with the understanding that this isn’t really a decision she can veto.  if anyone has any suggestions or best practices in dealing with maybe something similar to my situation i am all ears.  i looked up a lot of best practices but those are more general and i’m in need of a bit of nuance.  any help would be much appreciated."," the vicissitudes will continue to get worse, not better.  if you decide to do anything like this, buy the land outright from them, all legal and proper, and then you'll be able to build without her

may do better just quickly putting a pre-fab on the land you own so you're not in tug-of-war hell with her for a year.also, for heaven's sake, see if you can get her to enjoy some cannabis.  indica

mom isnt that bad yet i guess. today we spent about 45 minutes looking for her purse all over the house. the grocery store was called as she thought it might have been left in a shopping cart. my dad freaked out because he's always freaks out due to his lack of patience with life. i was tired from today and wasnt really up for the hide and seek. i did eventually find the purse just before dad called the credit card companies to cancel the cards. it was behind a couch left there because mom was afraid some worker might steal it while they are working on something in the house (there is no work being done). she does other things like tries to take her mind pills more than once. we have set up a system now where dad gives he the pills and writes down on a sheet the date and time of the taking to show her that she took them. but it can be a battle with these because she doesnt believe us when we tell her she has taken them. she will sneak the pills if no one is watching. we have about a month worth of english muffins in the pantry because we 'keep running out'. i know its little things but its getting more and more frequent and this has happened very quickly. i dont live here i'm visiting for the summer. when i leave i fear my dad will be driven mad with trying to help which will drive mom even more into her dementia hole. my mom knows shes sick and she knows its not her fault. i just feel bad that they will now not be able to share their golden years together as a functioning couple (both in their mid to young 70's).  i frankly dont know what to do for them and i feel terrible about it., better hide those pills before she accidentally takes too many. it may be time to reach out to some support organizations for dementia and get mom into adult day care to give your dad a break.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/d0bipu/mom_has_dementia_and_i_feel_terrible_for_her/,Mom has dementia and i feel terrible for her.

(they weren't even going to inform her he was moving?) so fast forward to today - he's been calling up, agitated and in tears. he arrived at the city hospital. the ambulance driver was told a bed was ready for him, they asked the receptionist - nope, no bed. they aren't even taking new patients until today? so why transfer him. an 82 year old with alzheimer's, a possible ""raging"" infection and severely swollen legs (he can't even stand to walk to a toilet) was left in a corridor overnight. &amp;#x200b;it's safe to say i am fuming.", i totally understand. i hope your grandad is doing ok.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/czyg71/i_just_need_to_rant_hospitals_are_the_worst/,I just need to rant.

(she's a nurse. so she's not oblivious to this condition)she suffers from depression, extreme anxiety, migraines and constantly sick or sore. she rarely eats (a battle my wife and her brother have been fighting for 20 years). forgetful. and sleeps a lot. but what really made me more concerned was her constant humming, singing or talking to herself. obsession with cleaning dishes or the bathroom. she has been a great help with watching our kids this summer ( 9 and 5), but i hit a breaking point one day when i got home from work and my oldest tells me grandma has been in the bathroom for at least an hour humming and talking. i think ""well 15 minutes feels like hours to a kid"". so i tell them if she's humming, she's ok. but then she's still in there at least and hour after i had been home. so essentially i have no clue how often my kids have been on their own all summer. so that's where i am at. my wife is afraid to admit anything is wrong. i'm home most of the time(i work 3 am to 11 or 12. wife is 8 to 5) during the day. so i notice all this stuff instantly. i figured this place would be a good place for advice."," does she forget what she's talking about?confused with money?sleepwalk? get more confused or odd behaved in the evening?does she know what her ailments are?does she use the wrong objects without awareness?(a spoon instead of a fork, a permanent marker instead of a pencil)have trouble with familiar objects? (can't open a jewelry box she's had all her life, turning on a shower)it will be pretty obvious something isn't right. the sooner you get her diagnosed, the sooner you can get her treatment and learn how to help her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cvheie/what_to_look_for_with_alzheimers_or_dementia/,What to look for with Alzheimer's or Dementia?
"saw dad yesterday. he's been getting worse. he's always getting worse but he just crossed the line to the final stage. i've been coping pretty well lately but this visit just has me broken again. i haven't felt this terrible about it in two months, maybe longer.husband is really making this worse, this time. he's trying very hard to be encouraging, reminding me to take care of myself.unfortunately the ways in which he's suggesting i take care of myself are exactly what i don't want. call a friend to talk. go out and putter in the garden. go for a walk. hang out with him and talk. go out to the farmers market with him.and maybe he's right, maybe i should be doing things and it would help.but to be perfectly honest all i want to do is have the house to myself and rot my brain on bad tv. maybe putter around the house, maybe go out and do something, maybe see a friend, maybe nothing. i want the freedom to do what i want, when i want, without feeling judgement or pressure to do something else.it's his birthday so i don't want to be mean and tell him to leave me alone. but there have been a few moments over the past 24 hours where i've just wanted to yell ""f you, leave me alone.""so instead i'm trying really hard to have a good attitude and go do things, and i'm in this weird place where i'm sullen and no fun and yet still putting on an act that everything is okay. i'm just coping so poorly that ""pretending i'm okay"" still manages to come across as being entirely miserable. but ""okay"" is just forcing down the feeling of being on the verge of tears at all times.

my dad who has alzheimer’s went on a last vacation out of the country with my mom to visit my grandma (his mom)  for one last time before his condition worsens. his alzheimer’s is already bad as it is and just 2 days ago i got a call that he had gotten lost out there and was missing for almost 24 hours. they found him already but i still haven’t been able to get my emotions in check..every time my phone rings i think it’s going to be bad news that something happened to him again. and i’ve just feel so uneasy and stressed. i don’t know how to cope with any of this. it’s been a rough week and i just wish my parents would cut their trip short and come home., get a tracker and put it on him. we use itraq.com.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cuobj7/father_got_lost/,Father got lost..

"im going totry to keep this short, but im lost. i just moved from east coast to west coast into a apartment with my so 2 months ago. started a new job (36k /yr) and am living essentially paycheck to paycheck for the time being. yesterday i got the expected diagnosis that my fathers weird behaviors and forgetfulness is stage three degenerative dementia. (expected alzheimers).  he is okay now, as he still has a little independence but that time is running out as its getting worse and worse each year. my step mother lives with him they have been married 5 years. to be clear, in the process of this mental illness i suspect that my father has spent most of all his savings. i do not know that he even has money at all. im not sure my step mother will stick around for him, as they are relatively new and i wouldnt expect her to take on such a hard task. im not going to have money to hire anyone to help him...id have to quit my job to move in with him and be his caretaker. leaving my new life ive started behind. my so and our new place etc... i need advice..."," your father has a diagnosis. it's real. 1) contact your local alzheimer's association and tell them your story. you will be invited to join the support group. i highly recommend you do. these folks have been there, done that. tell them your story. listen.     you do not need to move east but 2) do need to visit with your dad and his wife and yea, get real. what do they know? what are their expectations? while everyone's planning, ask outright about what you can do. his wife **is his next-of-kin** so she has the keys to the car but you can let her know about your availability and your constraints. if it seems she's not gonna stick around then 3) it's time to get some paperwork done. your dad should designate someone with power of attorney for finances and someone with power of attorney for health decisions. **this is the most important step.** they could both be you or be his wife. then there's the will.    3) you might also visit with a family attorney, if you have a distant relationship with his wife. or even if not.    at some point your dad 4) will need a lot of assistive care - safety, wandering, walkers or wheelchairs, bathing, dressing, medications, eating/nutrition, agitation, distraction, transportation to doctor visits, hospice. 5) in addition, someone will need to pay the bills, pay the taxes, sign up for medicare and supplemental insurance, manage the retirement funds, pay the mortgage, sell the house, donate furniture and find a landing spot for his wife, especially if she does, or doesn't have children. gawh. the alzheimer's association is so precious here.  if you don't think his wife is not up to #4 or 5 you should consider moving your dad closer to you, but not without power of attorney. keep talking. his wife may have her own health issues. she may welcome your interest. she may need time to absorb this future. there are lawyers who specialize in aging issues.  best wishes to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cuj3ia/only_child_father_has_stage_3_dementia_suspected/,"Only Child, Father has stage 3 dementia (suspected Alzheimers)"

"and now i feel guilty. my sister has progressive alzheimer's. she and i have been very close for all our lives, even though she is 15 years older than i. her son, my dear nephew, passed 3 years ago from lung cancer, just at the time her disease was becoming evident. it was a 2 year struggle for me, dealing with her by myself. i moved her and her entire household twice. i sold her home and her car. i packed all of her things, weeded them out, and moved her into a small room in a group home with her cat. i pay her rent from her social security and pension. she is in good hands with 24-hour medical care.when she was well, i spoke to her every day on the phone. her husband died in 2001 and after that i began to call her every day to check on her, and then it became a habit. at first, when she moved into the home, i called her every day, but then it turned into a battle of her wanting to know when she could go home. it became easier for all involved for me not to call her every day. i still go over there at least once a week to visit her. she's forgetting everything about her life, but thankfully she still knows me. and thankfully she has forgotten that she's lost her son.but here is what's troubling me. i find myself thinking of her less often during the day. the first time i moved her into a independent living place, i didn't realize that she needed more than that. i called her literally 7 times a day. i had an alarm on my phone. i would remind her to wait to go to the dining room until i called her to take her blood sugar and give herself insulin. i would call her at night and ask her to take a shower before bed. i hated going to her place because it smelled bad. i didn't realize she wasn't taking care of herself, as far as bathroom and bathing habits go, and that she was hiding dirty clothes. i didn't realize what a relief it would be when i moved her into a home with 24 hour care.i don't feel guilty about it. i am so happy that she is safe, and being cared for by people who have the knowledge to take care of her properly and give her her medicine and all that.i feel guilty, because i think of her far less often than i used to. she is not the person i used to know, but she's still my beloved sister. she's going away from me, and i know that. she doesn't know how much time has passed. every time i visit her she thinks it's the first day she's been there, and she's been there for well over a year. i feel like i've given up something. i'm not in charge of her care anymore, really, and i don't talk to her every day.i know that she is leaving me, and my belief in the afterlife gives me comfort and i am not totally stressed about that. i wonder why i don't think of her as often."," you are letting her go slowly, maybe at a deeper level you already accepted that she is no longer the same person you grew up with and that she will eventually go. i think this is normal and a good thing for you. if you were in denial about the situation it  would not help you and sadly she won't remember by tomorrow if you told her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ctbh8p/i_try_not_to_think_about_it/,I try not to think about it

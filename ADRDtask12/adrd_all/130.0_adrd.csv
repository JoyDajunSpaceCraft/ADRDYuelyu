"what are thought (or known) to be the cause/causes of frontotemporal dementia, and how have we learnt this?"," as a primary care-giver, i've lost the desire to find out the case(s). all there is for me is today, and tomorrow. i find myself reaching back into the past to remember when my wife's first symptoms might have shown up. in the end, i slap myself in the head and get back to what is important: how can i make my wife's day *today* joyful and meaningful? and how can i make her tomorrow equally so?sometimes it's buying her an ice-cream. sometimes it means telling the doctor to f*ck off. no, he can't poke something into her spinal cord just because he wants further confirmation of what is patently obvious. my wife isn't here to further your career.if you have a loved one with some sort of dementia, i implore you to look to their well-being *today*. i suspect you are. looking to the past is a fruitless pursuit. my only pursuit is making sure my wife has the best day she can have today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/79fzl4/cause_of_dementia/,Cause of dementia?
"first off - we will be looking at medical advice at some stage soonish, but in the meantime would love some input on this situation...setting the scence: my mil who is 69 has always been anxious and has ocd (actual medical ocd but very, very mild version usually just pertaining to checking locks a few times over).  she's a bit dyslexic as well, and very 'right brain"" dominant. so she's arty, and a little bit of a hippy and not really 'academic'.  her anxiety has always caused her to avoid different situations a little bit (although she really enjoys new experiences once we coax her somewhere different). her husband is incredibly active, helpful, and capable. unfortunately this has meant he has really enabled her over many years. he loves driving, so will happily drive her to her art class and pick her up again. he will take over anything task or activity that is at all difficult - such that when we had our baby, he did just about everything a traditional ""grandma"" might do (and more), while she did next to nothing. a lot of that was because she gets anxious about hurting people (she often worries that she's accidentally used old ingredients in cooking and will make someone sick for example).most importantly she's always worried about her memory, since i've known her (20 years). due to her dyslexia and 'right brainedness' she has sometimes struggled to learn newer skills as well.  we've always laughed it off, because she's always jokingly said things like she's having a ""senior moment"", or ""gees i worry about my memory - just bump me off if it gets really bad haha"".situation now:  we've noticed a slight increase in times where she will forget a topic of conversation that we have had in the last 30 mins. or will ask a question a few times in the same coversation. example: we might be talking about taking a holiday to xyz destination and all that entails and she might ask what month we are going in, then ask the same questions again five minutes later in the conversation about the destination. sometimes again after that.  doesn't happen that often, maybe once every week or two.there's been about 3 times in the last 6 months where she has used a seemingly random word instead of the correct word - they can sometimes seem a bit like a similar sounding or we might say ""yeah i can kind of see why that odd word sort of might pop into your head in that circumstance"" but still...otherwise she seems totally normal. nobody other than those close to her would ever think anything was wrong. she hasn't done anything like forget how to do things she normally does, or put things in odd places.she has had some trouble sleeping through the night (probably due to anxiety and poor sleep habits) for many, many years and is generally a little kooky - so it's very hard for us to decide whether she's impaired due to sleep issues, or just a kooky person getting older, or whether this is very serious.  i should add that her mother did get dementia in her last years from about 85 years old. that seemed to happen fairly rapidly after her husband died, but didn't get super bad until her last days, and even then i've heard much worse stories.sorry for the rambling post - but you can see how it's a little confused situation. if she was a super reliably straight forward capable person who suddenly was forgetting conversations then that would be obvious!"," hey there. i have to say these are very similar to the signs my mom displayed over the past five years. she has now been diagnosed with vascular lesion dementia. the one thing she said so often was 'gosh, my memory is so bad!' i do think that if you are picking up signs that make you wonder, it is very telling. the repetitive questioning is very common to alzheimer's and dementia, as well as the laughing it off. has she exhibited any signs of emotional ups and downs? getting angry when people remind her of things? i know the sleeping issues are very common due to the brain patterns changing. also using the incorrect word is classic with alzheimer's. i hear that you're worried, but it's so great you've picked up on it. trust your gut, you know something is off.  all the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/791gi0/are_these_early_signs/,Are these early signs?

"mom my has mild vascular dementia. her bathing day is suppose to be on wednesdays. she can take additional showers on other days, such as on saturday or sunday. some times she's really resistant. rather than press the issue where she gets really upset, i get her to sign and agreement to take it the next day. last night i tried for about 30 minutes to persuade her and she was starting to become very angry. she calmed down when i said she could take it tonight, and got her to sign the agreement. my brother says that this is unacceptable, that i should nag her until she takes it, regardless of how upset she becomes. what the best course of action and why?"," my mil will not take a shower or a bath when there's anybody else in her property. she tells us and her carers, and anybody who turns up to assess her, that she 'bathes' every day. she doesn't because she used to be scared of getting stuck in the bath and, when a walk in shower with a seat was installed, she remains scared in case she falls over and hurts herself. she will not allow anybody in the bathroom with her, and that's her right - it's her choice, whilst she can still make choices.we have discussed this with her doctor, clinical psychologist, and social worker who have made it quite clear that as long as her personal hygiene seems to be okay then nobody, not one person, has the right to force her to remove her clothes and stand or sit in a shower against her will - it is tantamount to assault.with dementia patients, as with anything else, you need to only fight the battles that have to be fought - and there'll be plenty of those to come. she will be suspicious of a bit of paper with a date and a signature on it because she probably doesn't know what day or date it is, but won't tell you this because it will make her look stupid because her dignity is about the only thing she's got left. in her own mind she will know she's bathed because that's 'what people do', and any suggestion that she's not doing 'normal' things will be upsetting.you can't easily regiment somebody with dementia, because they don't always understand the passage of time, and you may have to learn some strategies of dealing with this and getting less stressed about it, rather than adding pressure to somebody who's clearly distressed. the dementia isn't going to go away, and it isn't going to get any better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/790h1r/bathing_is_it_critical_that_day_of_the_week_and/,Bathing - Is it critical that day of the week and the time be set in stone?

"need to vent... also looking for some insight on dementia. my husband and i quit our professional careers a year ago to move down to his family farm so we can help his aging parents run it. we have a 5 month old son.my father in law is 91 years old. other people that live here:- mother in law- two sister in laws (both of whom have since moved out but still drop by frequently)- brother in lawmy husband's family think my fil has dementia. they think this because of the usual signs, though he hasn't received a proper diagnosis because he refuses to see the doctor. and apparently the word of a 91 year old man with suspected dementia is **law** around here.i sound resentful, that's because i am. so far my little family of three (husband, me, baby boy) have been slotted into the ""scapegoats"" for all of fil's rage. and everyone else is just fine with that. just now, the three of us were taking a nap in an outer room (usually used as guest room). fil came to the room, stating he was looking for ""towels"" (he knows full well that towels aren't kept here. his short term memory is shot, but long term memory works fine), and then he slams the door on his way out, waking the baby. this is just an example of the animosity we receive daily from him. a few others:- he dropped his electric razor and it fell apart. while he was fixing it, my husband cameby and asked how he's doing. fil aggressively said, ""fixing this razor that you broke!"" - bil took the ride-on mower out to mow the lawn. fil freaked out as he's taken to keep keys for all things on his person so he can't figure out how bil got the mower going... he freaked out looking for my husband. when i asked him why he needed my husband, he said my husband took the keys from him and gave it to bil to use. ... my mind was thinking, ""... but why would he even do that??"" - my son has started making squealing noises when he's excited. he laughs so hard that it turns into a squeal. we understand it's annoying for some people. but there's really no way for us to tell a 5 month old baby to stop squealing. they don't understand consequences yet. plus it's part of their usual development to make these noises. fil has taken to giving my son the death stare whenever he does it. the last time my son has done it at the table where everyone was sitting for breakfast, fil said, ""jesus christ!"" and then stood up and stomped off. at this point, my husband and i have decided to move back to the city. plans are underway. we actually didn't want to leave initially because we felt bad to leave mil (who is a wonderful lady) with all the work (sibling-in-laws all have jobs in town, so they don't farm full time) of taking care of the farm and fil.about two months ago, mil told us that it is better if we leave, because fil can't cope with the disturbance to his household that a baby brings. we told her we really would prefer to stay and help her, and we said we'd try anything to help fil not freak out. mil said that it's just dementia and there's nothing we can do. so we see that as green light from mil for us to go.  this advice from mil was due to the fact that my fil just can't stand my husband. he's fine with all his other children, but for some reason the sight of my husband just sets him on edge. we believe that this is because my husband is the only one doing farm work, which makes my fil feel inadequate to run his own farm. we can rationalize his dislike for us all we want, but none of us really know why he appears to hate us so much. we informed him recently of our plans to leave (already received job offers; just getting ready for the move). turns out us leaving **also pisses him off**. he's been making passive aggressive comments to us and about us ever since then. but to everyone else living here, he's as sweet as sunshine. mil has started to make passive aggressive comments as well about how we're taking her grandson away and how we're leaving her alone to bear the brunt of fil's decline. ... she's in her 60's and has full mental capacity. she's just not very good at being honest with people about her feelings. i have the suspicion that she really didn't want us to go but she's torn between keeping her declining husband happy for his last years and being able to have us around for help. anyway, my question for this community is: is this usual behavior for someone with dementia? to have a focal point of aggression? and is there any other alternatives we could have considered before just throwing in the towel and leaving?"," this is all normal behavior stemming from dementia, unfortunately. :( i am in the same situation as you, moved in with my boyfriends grandma to take care of her as she was deemed unable by the state. i’m 8 months pregnant and it’s been very stressful. last night she started hitting my bf and throwing stuff at him because she wasn’t allowed to take her photos to day care (expensive wedding photos she keeps ruining and giving away). she’s forgotten everything short term so she only has a few stories left to tell and it’s hard to listen over and over. it only gets worse to be honest with you.

"hello folks. for a short film, i researched creutzfeldt jakop disease and found out about how it was a rapidly progressing dementia that progressed alongside other signs like myoclonus and extrapyramidal dysfunction. for the past 2 months i have had some strange experiences. on july 16th, my thumb was moving by itself, flexing and relaxing at a slow speed before stopping. i started to worry that i might have the disease so i consulted my gp several times and they were confident that it was just anxiety. this seemed to be the case because other symptoms that i had including shakiness in the hands and a jelly like feeling in the legs, subsided after some time. however, i still seem to be having what appears to be senior moments or memory lapses. i noticed one in september when i found one of my sister's toys in my pocket (we were playing with it) and i couldn't figure out why it was there. another instance was when i walked to tell my sister to stop trying to get into her friend's house, but i walked passed the house accidentally (mistook the house next to her friend's house as the one she was trying to get into). the only other instance very recently that happened was when there seemed to be this strange feeling of surprise when my sister called me while i was washing the dishes. my mother had left to pick up my little brother from school and left me with her. as she was occupied i decided to wash the dishes and when my sister called me, i was somewhat startled and i am worried that it may be the result of me forgetting that i was babysitting her or something. do you guys think that these problems are the beginnings of dementia or cjd, or am i just being paranoid?", do you drink? do you eat regularly? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/75au21/23_and_having_some_neurological_signs_is_it/,"23 and having some neurological signs, is it dementia or is it just me"

"my grandmother has dementia right now, i'm not sure what the extent of it is, but please if there are any doctors lurking on reddit, please help me out here.i can recall her forgetting stuff since 3 years back. it's all basic memory loss, stuff you expect with age. basic repetitive questions like what day it is and where did i put my spectacles were normal for me. nevertheless, she was her usual helpful and friendly self, loved folding clothes, doing laundry and loved interacting with me and my other siblings. now, what really began to make me feel a bit concerned was last month, she asked us if we were going to visit my cousin who was in the hospital. she was never admitted in the hospital, and when we told her that, she said she must be mistaken. however, she began asking,this question several times a week. now, 2-3 weeks ago, i noticed she completely changed. my aunt, who had always been a doting,daughter, came over to my family's house to take care of my grandmother as we were all busy at school or work. she has been doing this for the past decade or so when no,one is at home to look after my grandma. here's when it starts to get really worrying.my grandmother suddenly refuses to eat any of my aunt's food. she would starve herself until my mother comes home with a loaf of bread, which she would consume. i was rather perplexed by this, but not too much as i thought she was suffering from a lack of appetite. the moment i knew she had dementia was a few days ago. she suddenly began crying at random spurts every single day. one day, my brother had completed his night shift and came home in the morning with only me and my grandmother home. he bought breakfast as well. when i opened up the packet of food and invited her to eat, she wrapped the packet, placed it inside the plastic bag once again and threw it inside the rubbish binn. my brother and i were dumbfounded by this, but grandma held our hands and whispered to us that the food was poisoned by our aunt. now, a few days on, she has many sleepless nights where she sits in front of the house door, crying periodically. we now always lock the door because she tried to get out of the house on her own the other day because she thought our uncle was waiting for her outside. she is extremely quiet now as well.it is extremely devastating to watch this unfold to my beloved grandmother. i cannot concentrate on my upcoming exams because of her condition. any tips to make her  better are welcome."," nurse here, working on a dementia unit. first off all, you yourself cannot diagnose your grandmother with dementia, no matter what symptoms might lead you to that conclusion. there are many things that can lead to desorientation and personality changes in eldery people, and you should go see a doctor in real life, not on reddit, to get her problem dioagnosed. with the right diagnosis, she can be treated with the right meds and therapy, which will, according to the diagnosis, either make the symptoms vanish completly, or at least make the progression slower. especially since you said that  the change from slightly forgettful (which, depending  on the age of your grandmom, can be totally normal and not pathological) to very disoriented happened really quickly make me wonder if there might not be a different problem - small strokes, extreme dehydration, malnutrition, liver problems, etc. that being said, let me answer the rest of your post. i think it can be clearly said that you grandmother sounds disoriented, if from dementia or not.  it is not uncommon for the major caregiver to become the ""villian"" in the eyes of disoriented people. try to see it from her perspective: your whole life everything was okay, and now, suddenly, from day day to the next, nohing makes sense. you believe things that other people tell you are not true, and they act like *you* are stupid, while you are *sure* that you have everything figured out. that is scary as shit. and then there is this one person, in your case, your aunt, who is always there, gives you the food you eat and the water you drink. what do you think is easier: admitting that something is wrong with oneself, or blaming someone else, thinking that everything will turn back to normal when you stop taking the poisoned things from them? i understand that it is hard situaton, but your aunt should not take that personally, as said, this happens often. to get her to eat things through the day, you can try to place food around the house, apples, bread and other things she can eat without anyone helping her prepare it, so that it is not food that her aunt gave her directly. for ""real meals"" there is probably no other option than letting someone else make them and giving them to her at the moment. also, she sounds to me like she is still able to read at that point. to help her orientate, you can try to place visual helps all around the house. write notes on the door saying who will come home at which time of the day and that your uncle is not here, and notes that remind her to eat (maybe write something like ""eat x, i bought it for you and not our aunt, love, your grandchild"" so that she feels safe to eat it)as for her emotional problems, i can't help oyu too much without knowing her. just talk to her about how she feels - not why she feels that way, just the feelings themselves -, that is often the most important part for disoriented people. and go see a doc.

"hi everyone, i'm hoping to get some advice on how to handle a situation with my mom (56 yo) who has early onset dementia.my mom has been very active throughout her life. she used to play basketball, go on long bike rides, run, and go to the gym constantly. i still take her to the gym with me on a regular basis, but while i am at work during the day she gets very bored. she has caregivers about 4 days a week and she hates it. she doesn't have any sit- down hobbies really. she used to read a lot but she no longer can. she has no interest in drawing, and i think her coordination is too poor for her to be able to pick up knitting or something like that. she is also in complete delusion about her dementia. she keeps talking about wanting to get a job and how she doesn't need to have any caregivers at all. i'm not really sure how i should handle these conversations with her. she gets super upset when i tell her i don't think it is realistic for her to get a job and that maybe she could try volunteering (with the accompaniment of a caregiver). any ideas of hobbies i could try getting her interested in? (fyi her dementia is to the point where she can't write her own name and has trouble dressing herself). also how should i handle these conversations with her? i feel like they're totally pointless convos because she's not thinking logically. i almost feel l'm being mean by telling her that she is too cognitively impaired to have a job - and i don't get anywhere by telling her that anyways. so what should i say instead?thanks in advance for any advice, it is much appreciated."," as long as her body is capable of the activities, let her do  them. is it possible to buy some home-training equipment? she can use it while you are at work. maybe a treadmill or on of those bike-things. the day will come where she can't do that anymore, but from what you are saying, it seems like it would be pretty possible atm. for talking: you are right, people with dementia slowly stop thinking logically, but they start thinking more and more in emotions. don't argue with her over if she can or cannot have a job. talk about how it makes her feel, that she wants a job and that she doesn't have one. this is a far more important aspect for her than the fact itself, she just can't or doesn't want to adress it clearly.

"my grandmother is 86-years old. she lives in a skilled nursing facility. her health history includes very common pain inducing conditions combined, mainly:1. trigeminal neuralgia 2. fibromyalgia3. vascular dementia (which has made her a total care patient) 4. stroke (has resulted in left arm contracture and weakness)5. arthritis (especially in the fingers)after a uti she was transferred to a nursing facility and placed on hospice. she did not report trigeminal neuralgia/fibromyalgia-related pain in the months before she stopped communicating, nor did she complain of pain from the other conditions. the only pain she complained of was from a previous fracture in her left shoulder due to a fall. as mentioned before, that entire side has atrophied and weakened after a series of strokes, which have also contributed to her dementia. she had always been reluctant to disclose pain or discomfort, but in recent weeks she has ceased verbal communication, including any vocalizations (such as groaning) that could indicate discomfort. she displays mostly flat affect, verbally, emotionally and physically, even in situations that used to cause her to express discomfort in some way (such as through a vocalization or grimace). her lucidity is unclear, but it seems that she drifts in-and-out of alertness and a half-dozing state, but due to her lack of communication, it’s also unclear if this is delirium or disease progression. until about 3-4 weeks ago, it was uncommon for her to go multiple days without speaking. but for the last 2 weeks, she has not spoken a word. within the last two weeks, she has begun to sleep more throughout the day and wakes intermittently at night despite sleep hygiene practices, daily activities and regular visitation by family, and frequent exposure to sunlight. she spends much of the day sleeping and is nearly impossible to arouse. this pattern was first noticed on 9/28 and she began taking tylenol the next day. her current dosage is about 1300 mgs a day. the only means she communicates any form of pain/discomfort is through furrowing her brow, widening her eyes, slight grimace, closing her eyes (uncommon, but sometimes after being turned/repositioned), and sharp withdrawal of her left foot. her foot jerks intermittently throughout the day and sometimes wakes her at night. she flinches if touched there. it’s unclear if these responses are due to pain, anxiety/surprise, or due to some other cause.her left calf is really tight despite stretching.  the hospice and facility doctor don't visit often enough to understand her pain issues. i think it's some kind of neuropathic pain, but i'm not a medical professional. they agreed to put her on gabapentin, but it's possible that they're doing it just to pacify me considering how often i alert them to her issues. based on her previous behavior while being changed, repositioned, and transferred from her geri chair to bed and vice versa, it’s quite possible that pain proceeds from such activities of daily living. however, due to a lack of visual pain response, it is challenging to tell if she is in discomfort or not. the family has attempted non-pharmacological interventions (warm massage, passive mobility exercises). as the focus is palliative care (reducing the pain/emotional symptoms associated with any health complications, including treating them if need be), the family is seeking further safe solutions for unreported or unnoticed pain responses and depression, as it is unclear if her withdrawal and flat affect/response is due to disease progression or pain/depression. the family tried zoloft to stave off depression, but the drug left her sedated. thus, the family is considering giving her 5 mgs of lexapro at night to avoid circadian disruptions while addressing any underlying depression/anxiety. when cognizant, she was not one to express sadness. so i’m really not sure if she’s depressed, delirious, or just succumbing to the inevitable progress of vascular dementia.  unfortunately, the hospice and nursing home haven’t been much help in identifying what (if anything) is abnormal, be it delirium, depression, side effects of tylenol, post-stroke central neuropathy, etc. i’m working on finding alternative opinions for her care so she can be comfortable. in the meantime, does anyone have any experience in caring for someone like my grandmother, someone who’s always been really stoic? what have been your experiences in distinguishing between and treating pain (especially nerve pain), depression/anxiety, and delirium?thank you so much."," as a fellow trigeminal sufferer as well as a caregiver i can suggest you  try cold compress, (not ice) on the back of the neck for the trigeminal. and a warm compress around the hands for the arthritis. both these things can give a teeny bit of relief. unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how  you feel  about her suffering) both of my elders who became this non-responsive were very close to the end. condolences to your family",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/70dkr9/distinguishing_symptoms_in_a_stoic_patient/,Distinguishing symptoms in a stoic patient
"i dont know if this is the right place for this, but i have to ask. my grandpa has severe dementia. he gets irrationally angry over inconsequential things and he is constantly forgetful and easily confused. my grandparents live in a suburb of houston and they got a foot and a half of water. since the flooding cleared i have been over to their house a half dozen times and basically forcing them to let me tear up the drywall and the carpet. it was not until today that they let me throw out several furniture pieces.however, there are still several things in the house that have mold on them and my grandparents insist on staying in the house. my great aunt has offered to pay for a hotel room (they only stayed there for two nights because my grandpa got lost at the hotel and couldnt find his room) and she has even offered to rent a fully furnished house for them to stay in (which they didnt because my grandpa said it wasnt nice enough, without even looking at the inside of the house.)everyone in the family has tried to talk to her but she wont listen. she insists on doing whatever my grandpa says because she doesnt want to upset him. he still drives his truck around even though he is a total danger to himself and other people on the road. his dementia has led to him being taken advantage of by at least a dozen scams that has cost them thousands of dollars. but this is a new low point because his mental issues are directly putting them in danger.i just dont know what to do anymore. is there any kind of legal approach that i can go through to remove my grandpas decision making abilities? or does someone know how i can talk to my grandma and get her to get out of that dangerous situation? i would really appreciate any advice on the subject. i dont know if it makes any difference but i am 28, my grandpa is 86, and my grandma is 69."," well, as for the truck, take the key. alternatively, communicate with police and see if they can revoke his license due to his condition. second, grandpa is moving, whether he wants to or not. in the mean time, if they need to stay at a hotel, then grandpa's not leaving the room (at least without grandma). third, stage an intervention for grandma, with the purpose of putting her in charge by her own will. grandma, whom i'm assuming does not have dementia, should be taking charge, and not a back seat. times have changed, and she is more reasonable (i am assuming). and if grandma is not already attending therapy, she should do so. it seems like she lives in fear of her husband in her own home. but driving the truck around is my main concern. like you say, he may eventually kill himself or someone around him with it. and if that happens, you'll all feel a tremendous amount of guilt. is grandma unable to drive with grandpa to prevent this?

"hello. i'm a 16 year old boy who's korean american. my life is nice at its times and i get what i need so money doesn't matter and i'm feel like i'm quite spoiled sometimes. about 4 years ago, my father started showing signs of dementia and i didn't know what it was. my mother didn't really tell me what's happening. he retired at the age of 77 and which i didn't know how old my parents were. i was excited to have him back home thinking i could play with him more since he wasn't home a lot due to him being an anesthesiologist. i was wrong. it turned into the biggest nightmare my life has ever experienced. my father drank a lot since koreans love alcohol and he was very drunk saying/doing things he didn't mean. i never understood as my mom just described it ""daddy might forget somethings sometimes."" i understood she didn't want me to be exposed to this hurtful thing at this age but it never helped me understand why this was happening. the first year of dementia was ok with some family arguments that were small nothing too serious. but then second year, shit hit the fan. his dimentia got worse and it didn't help he was drinking. it once got so bad that he wrestled me to the ground as i was crying and screaming becnaes my mother and i had an argument about video games and school again. my mother stood off to the sidelines and never did anything until finally when i was hyperventilating, pulled my dad off. i ran away from home for ten minutes (i was afraid of the dark) and tried to come back inside. i just saw him sitting down on teh couch holding a knife and when he saw me he screamed at me and i ran away again. after a while, i don't remember what happened, i was finally able to come inside and my mom told me that my dad had dementia which would hinder his emotions. she said not to get mad at dad because he can't control it. did it help? no it made me very upset. upset my dad does this to me, upset that my mother would stay off the to sidelines and have the nerve to say i can't blame anyone. the grudge grew and arguments got worse at least 1 or 2 every single week. i grew depressed further using video games as a place to escape from all the anger from my family. then finally, when it got very bad, my mother took my dad to the doctors after a year of this hell. they said they couldn't do anything because he was acting perfectly fine and said if he acts violently, to call the police so they can transport him to the hospital to get proper check up and stuff. my mom of course was against this but reluctantly agreed as they gave us medications. the meds helped my dad stay calm and it was ok for me to live but my mom and i still argued with each other. since the meds made my dad drowsy and lazy, my mom descided to not give him as much. big mistake. he started going back and actually got worse being violent towards me more since i always get the blame from him. he says very hurtful things saying ""why dont't you just quit school and get the hell out of here"", ""i have 2 sons and they never acted like this"", ""why are you fucking cursing at your mom, don't you respect her!?"", ""why don't you go fucking kill yourself"", and much more that i can' type without remembering the pain. fights got worse as now i got phsycial with my dad refusing to be hit and pushed and choked without a fight. my mom and dad held  grudge on me for  a small period because of this but i felt i was justified. finally, i get a call from my mother that she called the police because dad pulled a knife on her. i immediately went home to comfort her and it was very gloomy at home, i missed a lot of school days as i was so depressed and unable to learn i just called in sick. i felt upset that my dad was liek this, but the words lingered in my head from my mother. ""you can't get mad at him, he doesn't mean it"". i know he has dimentia, but it still fucking hurts me to hear this shit. i never really had a childhood with it being ripped apart from me with all this family drama. i just wished i could be normal. the sadness turned into rage. she only called the police because she was being hurt. i got mad and started to hold a giant grudge against her. i never outright showed her but it was deep down inside. finally, we went to a therapist which helped at first, but i later found it useless and one day decided not to go. that was a big mistake. my mom vented at my therapist and i was unable to defend myself. the therapist recommended very radical things and one was taking away my computer and electronics. i was lost, overtime i would try to talk to my mom, she would cut me off and say you can't raise your voice at me, you're verbally abusing me. this went on for a week and on time it got so bad so we had to get a new therpist who was much better and unbiased. he helped out so much and we were able to stop this radical stuff and i was able to get my stuff back. at this time, i was looking for something to help me cope and i found it was twitch streaming and making youtube videos. i make people laugh and it makes me happy seeing them happy. but later, my dad is able to come home, there is load of legal stuff to go through. police and child abuse people come to interview me. it was hard reliving every moment of hell and but i managed to do it without crying.

"hi, people. so due to circumstances i'm currently living with my grandparents. i don't have anywhere else to go; my dad is homicidal and serving a life sentence in state prison, my mom has extreme anxiety with schizoid paranoia, barely functional, my stepdad is abusive/rage issues, and their house is falling apart. i have no irl friends left to lean on because i am a shut in. i'm unable to work due to ongoing mental health issues of my own (asperger's/asd, depression, social/generalized anxiety, selective mutism, authority phobia) and all the relevant agencies including ca department of rehab, social security, headhunter organizations are basically ignoring me. no money, no car, nothing.he is 73 and she is 74. i'll start with him. for many years it was apparent that he was slowing down, but 2 years ago he had a cardiac arrest incident and barely survived emergency pacemaker surgery. since then he has decline has accelerated. he has anomia/aphasia where he uses generic words like thing, gizmo for many nouns, or shoehorns in a word that is sort of similar, for example lighter for flashlight. he speaks very slowly and stilted, like his words are bricks lined up on a wall, each one recalled individually. communicating with him is a ponderous chore. he stares blankly at you, uncomprehending, until he chuckles and repeats back what you said, says a non sequitur, or simply walks away, forgetting that he was in a conversation. in addition, he is profoundly deaf, so he mishears things and just goes along with it, even if what he heard makes no sense. he putters around the house aimlessly and rummaging through things, when asked why he says he's looking for something, but he doesn't know what. he looks out the front room window so many times a day that the curtain is frayed where he grabs it. his fine motor skills are not very good; he wields his hands like clubs, seemingly having reduced feeling in his fingers, knocking things over often. he's also cold all the time. every day i have to re-teach him how to operate the dvd player so he can watch the same few episodes of northern exposure again. overall it feels like his personality is evaporating away. at least he's not the angry kind. nothing really seems to bother him. based on the symptoms and his heart problems, i'd guess it's vascular dementia.if my grandpa is slowing down, then my grandma is speeding up, but nonsensically so. she's always been...off, but she's been getting increasingly eccentric, acquiring strange compulsions such as requiring our trash cans to be perfectly aligned on our sidewalk and throwing a tantrum if our neighbor's cans are too close. most of her friends are dead or have moved away, and with her husband being so vacuous, i'm the only one she has to talk to. and boy does she talk. constantly, about literally anything. stores i've heard scores of times, things on the news i couldn't care less about but she carries on anyway, oblivious. if i'm not available she starts whispering to inanimate objects, the tv, herself...it's very creepy. sometimes has arguments with herself and loses. recently she's been having manic-depressive episodes, for example starting a ""project"" involving ""cleaning"" the house (in reality moving some of the hoard from one part of the house to another...did i mention they're hoarders? yeah...the ground floor is pretty much a biohazard) and the next day not having the energy to get out of bed. this has made her sleep schedule and mood completely unpredictable. the conversations she has with her husband are very surreal, like two chatbots talking.he still drives. i have a driver's licence but they won't let me drive because...i don't know. it's scary when he drives, he has a serious problem with rubbernecking. sometimes i feel like he's forgotten he's driving and is just...sitting in a chair somewhere, watching the scenery go by...i don't really expect advice for any of this. they're not going to get diagnosed, they completely lack insight that anything is wrong with them. grandma despises doctors and grandpa does anything she says. i just feel like i should say *something.* i'm 25. i feel like the best years of my life are being whittled away.there's a quote that i feel is particularly poignant here. ""he who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. and if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."" i feel as if i'm going mad myself."," > i'm 25. i feel like the best years of my life are being whittled away.yeah, me too. same age as well, except i only take care of my mom - i can't imagine taking care of two people. as for like health insurance and stuff, does your state have state health care you can apply for? i would also recommend looking into your city's local elder services... they *might* be of some use. you don't need to talk to your grandparents about this, you can just email them and bring up concerns about their well being and they might be able to come up with a plan to help. do not let them (especially your grandma) guilt you - you are looking out for their health and safety as well as your own and you don't need to feel even worse than you already do. trust me - it's not worth it. i hope you can figure something out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6y5ug2/living_with_and_caring_for_two_dementia_patients/,Living with and caring for two dementia patients.

"i have been studying this disease for thirteen years.  i am not a scientist, but i do have some background in biology.there has been a minority hypothesis that while amyloid oligomers and tau tangles may contribute to alzheimer's disease, the real culprit is nitro-oxidative stress.  nitration and oxidation prevent the regeneration of neurons and synapses, limit blood flow and the transport of glucose in the brain, and reduce the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, social recognition, and alertness.by partially reversing oxidation and nitration (using peroxynitrite scavengers), you should be able to produce some improvements in cognition that can be sustained.  here is the evidence for this prediction.aromatherapy with rosemary, lemon, lavender, and orange essential oils  ""all patients showed significant improvement in personal orientation related to cognitive function on both the gbss-j and tdas after therapy."" korean red ginseng  at 24 wk, there had been a significant improvement in krg-treated groups [in terms of cognition]...in conclusion, the effect of krg on cognitive functions was sustained for 2 yr follow-up, indicating feasible efficacies of long-term follow-up for alzheimer’s disease. heat processed ginseng (korean red ginseng steamed at higher temperatures).results: the treatment groups showed significant improvement on the mmse and adas. patients with higher dose group (4.5 g/day) showed improvements in adas cognitive, adas non-cognitive, and mmse score as early as at 12 weeks, which sustained for 24-week follow-up.  discussion: these results demonstrate the potential efficacy of a heat-processed form of ginseng on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in patients with moderately severe ad.  a variety of herbs including ginseng along with aricept  during the treatment of ad case in eight years, sequential therapy showed great potential in stabilizing and improving cognition and overall status.  meanwhile, a two year polite [pilot] study to check effects of the sequential therapy was conducted in more that two hundred patients recently. primary results favor the sequential therapy than pure conventional medicine, which will be published soon. i hope the promise made it the last study is realized.  stabilizing alzheimer's disease in one person for eight years is impressive in its own right, but if it is possible to stabilize it in 200 people for two years that would be a game changer."," thank you for this post, i am unfamiliar with many of these terms, but it's a good jumping off point. i appreciate the time taken to put this together.

my step father is 85 years old and has dementia. he is a very negative person for years. we got him into a care facility after his wife (my mother) passed away. he goes into rants almost daily there screaming at the nurses to let him out. he wants to go back to his house. he can't though as he is a danger to himself in the house and would get lost in his own driveway. i am his power of attorney and i am trying to make him comfortable by getting him cable tv and a cd/tape/radio player. he told me i shouldn't have as he wants to escape and it is too much to carry. i did it anyway since i know he is not leaving. i will not take him out on a day trip as i don't think i could get him back in. he told me yesterday if i don't get him out he will hate me for the rest of his life. all i do is try to help him.," in a dream world, i'd give him a chance to pick a place where he wants to go if it can be afforded, 3 places, which one. if he's being hurt or there's a bad employee, why he's screaming there, check it out; would he say the same thing, hating you, at another place? no, home's not an option, says judge, it doesn't have to be you, it can be a judge. maybe if he acts right no screaming for a certain time, 30 days, then he can vacation a day from the place, like many other adult care places that reward good behavior. to be brutally emotionally triggeringly honest, no you're not helping *him*, you're helping cope with his disease, you're helping yourself control yourself in front of his attitudes, helping the community, help his control of his things, help control his actions in front of others in the city, and helping the law from having him be a liability in at home and in town. no kidding he's not emotionally satiated, of course they feel sabotaged. if you're not there in the day watching him you're technically not helping him, some caretakers and doctors are. the power of attorney thing is all about the paperwork. i'm curious why he needs cable tv at the care facility, don't they have tv for everybody?

"**tl;dr:** grandma goes to an adult daycare during the weekdays and that helps a lot. dad's getting paid as a caregiver by the state (thanks to everyone who pointed out that this was a thing!) and we may be able to move into a new home! grandma's memory and logic skills are getting worse, but at least we'll be able to make her comfortable.every time i've posted here i feel like i'm being a bit of a downer ([1]( and [2]( respectively)! so i decided i'd like to throw in some good things that have been going on with my grandmother and my family's life in general.we've been managing. mom had the entire summer off which helped a lot, and we got my grandmother into a really nice adult daycare from about 10am-2pm, so she usually comes home exhausted and with some crayon drawings or gifts for good behavior. my mom hasn't put anything on the fridge since my brother and i were little, but we're starting to see it fill up again! we've also noticed a dramatic improvement in her general moods on most of the days that she goes to the adult daycare. if anyone else's loved ones need something to keep them occupied, i'd recommend looking into adult daycares if their insurance covers it. they come pick her up in the mornings and have a social worker that can help us in the process of possibly finding a permanent home for her if possible/necessary.dad's also started getting paid for being a caretaker (it's not much, but every little bit counts!), so i guess he's technically out of retirement in a way? i'm always surprised by how much he loves her (even moreso than his own biological mother, but that's another story for another day really). he told me that the reason he feels motivated to keep taking care of her is because of one time, while he and my mother just started dating, when he was deathly ill (like, almost literally). she nursed him back to health over two weeks with love and chicken bone broth. it's those little reminders of how much we love her that keep us going, really, even if she's not really the same person.i finished my first year of university as a transfer student and will be graduating this next year. i'm the editor of a club and will be responsible for designing fliers and banners and stuff, which is exciting! i'm also the ta for a class designed to acclimate incoming students to the culture and workload the university. i'm also going to be writing an undergraduate thesis that i may get to present to undergraduate research conferences!right now, mom, her cousin and his girlfriend are trying to convince grandma that her mother did indeed pass away eleven years ago (i'm not fluent in spanish by any means, but i can repeat ""tu mama fallecio once años pasado"" flawlessly now!) so things aren't always great, but things are ~~sloooowly~~ moving into a more positive place. if anyone actually read this entire thing, godspeed. even if you didn't, [here's a fun video]( cheers!!", this is an awesome update. it would probably mean the world to your parents if you expressed how proud you are of how they're caring for your grandma. 😁,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6tcf7k/some_good_days_some_bad_days_but_maybe_things/,"some good days, some bad days, but maybe things will get better"

"my mother's vision, memory, etc has been in decline for the past few years. she was originally diagnosed with mild vascular dementia 2-3 years ago. it's now 'severe'. december last year she was moved permanently to a care home when my dad could no longer cope with her by himself. as her condition worsened, she was moved to a nursing home in march. today she needs 1:1 and sometimes 2:1 professional care, and the nursing home are struggling to cope. she is becoming more physical with people, swiping out and kicking and swearing. for the safety of others she is confined to her room and restrained there if needed during her episodes, that can last hours.the docs have tried different meds. but she's 'maxed out' on them now. so an assessment this morning came back that she may need moving to a different facility. i've not been given much in the way of details. i don't know what's next for her. i worry for her safety if she's being restrained (the staff apparently are trained for it). i also worry for her safety if she's moved into a facility with others that may have similar physical tendencies. she's not a strong woman, and she would easily be hurt.anyone have experience with what might happen in these circumstances?"," this is exactly the post i needed to read to *help* cement the fact that i am going to help my father get into assisted living/memory care soon.both my parents have some dementia and now my father cannot properly take ""as-needed"" medicines to keep nausea etc down and keep eating regularly. neither can my mom properly give him the meds. and, even we (his kids) can't always be there to handhold the medication (no judgment).he's just come off of 4-5 days of constant vomiting from a viral stomach flu, while having ulcers operated on just 3 weeks ago. he's in independent living where all the staff *can* be dismissed by him simply saying ""i'm ok, just go"" when he's not. i joke that it's his new hobby to tell people they can leave now (even when he's not ok). he's only getting better as i sacrifice full work days to babysit his meds + meals so he can **at minimum not vomit**, and being family i'm not beholden to leave just because he asks. a recent support group introduced the phrase, ""they may not be happy but are they safe"", to me. i don't really know if i'll be able to solve that he has constant headaches, mild depression, and poor mobility and endurance. but at least he's not going to literally starve because he can't eat.i'm compartmentalizing and delaying the debate over whether we should even be trying to fix other basic medical/psychological things because it's just so hard to stabilize proper eating/exercising right now.erg so long a rant... i _don't_ have experience with what might happen. i suppose it will be, she is less likely to physically hurt herself or others in proper care. she may not be happy about it, but you are delaying a major cut or break which would bind her with obvious pain ... which she may worry at the cast or open wound and never allow it to heal. make sure you're healthy, and put her in the safest care you can. hugs yo",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6t0ziq/last_year_my_mother_was_able_to_play_frisbee_now/,Last year my mother was able to play frisbee.

"this is the maybe 3rd level of infection for grandma.  started with her leg about 15 months ago (it seems) with some cellulitis and/or stasis (fluid swelling in legs).  i wish she'd been in stocking earlier because it never seems to go completely away and maybe won't with scar tissue.  we've had multiple rounds of antibiotics for it, including a 5 day hospital stay for iv antibiotics.a couple utis have also led to antibiotic regimes.  throughout we've tried to get her to take a regular probiotic, whether by gummy pill or yogurt.  she hasn't been real consistent about it.  for a little bit we were trying greek yogurt but her choice is the opposite of mine (she opts for sugary types).the last week they found c.diff in her stool sample.  probably because of the uti antibiotics she was on, keflex for one.  so now she's on a 3 a day antibiotic (i forget the name).  it is in a weekly box, but it seems she is getting to the point were i need to be there to make sure she takes them.  i've started to find too many missed times.with the pills, she got put on a bland diet.  i kept her on it for a few days but after that i've been less strict.  she eats mostly bland anyhow but they had some veggie and fruit rules that go against her normal diet.  the skins and seeds are not allowed as much, for example.well today fixing supper with chili for myself i had to remind her that she was still supposed to be relatively bland.  this kind of set her into a tailspin about the meal.  she looked at her list that she had transcribed from the doctor's bland recommendations and then started looking for only things on that list.  she went to open a peanut butter jar.  i've never actually seen her eat peanut butter before, this jar was unopened and something she bought after reading the recommendations.  i said she could have a salad, like she has the last 3 night without problems, but she checked her list to let me know she couldn't have the skins, etc.  i probably messed up because i told her she doesn't need to read the list and that she has been eating without issues for the last few days, and tried to re-iterate my reasons for withholding spicy chili.  i finally just left her to her meal prep.  by that point i'd already prepared and ate my supper, it just becomes too time consuming for me to wait for her.  i'd do everything in cooking, but usually she wants to do things so i let her.  but she can spend an hour reheating and plating leftover, or more.i suppose any advice on how to get her to remember she needs to take a pill every meal and maybe better idea of how to approach meals.  ideally, we'd eat the same thing, but i've been trying to reduce frozen stuff in her freezer and chili was up.  i'd been trying to have her stay relatively bland, while i ate down things from there.  i know probably part of the answer is being more attentive, but admittedly it isn't my strongest attribute.ps i was about to post, but grandma stopped by.  she wanted to call the maintenance guy for her apartment for her kitchen light (which is working, but maybe it is the wrong bulb -- i don't really know because he was by when i wasn't around).  i messed up again, i let her know that it was nearly 7pm on a saturday and that it probably wasn't a good time to call.  i should have, in retrospect, lied and told her i talked to him already and that he can come on monday.  learning to take a breath and think before replying is probably one of the harder things for me.", your doing well enough. try not to be hard on yourself! ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6rv6xl/bland_diet/,Bland diet
"some context: my husband and i live with my grandparents to help them out. i'm new to this sub and grateful to have found this community. my grandmother is in early-stages of dementia (diagnosed ~3 years ago) and my grandfather is fairly advances copd - meaning he's on oxygen and can't move around very well. my grandma is not accepting at all of the disease, and when she is reminded of it, often gets upset. it's not unusual for her to sob and say things like ""i'm so useless and everyone probably just wishes i was dead, i should go jump off a bridge/go into the garage and turn the car on/cut my throat/take a bunch of pills"" and then go throw herself on her bed and cry. she's been on an anti-depressant for about 6 months now and that has helped to reduce the frequency of her break-downs.yesterday my grandmother's doctor came for a home visit while i was at work. she knew he was coming and started to get agitated. she often has flip-outs like this when something reminds her of the dementia and her reduced ability to care for herself. i don't know the full story, since i wasn't present, but at some point during the doctor visit, she got really upset and threatened to cut her own throat. after this, the doctor advised my grandfather to ""lock up all our knives"" as that kind of thing is often an impulse. i have a hard time agreeing with the doctor here. my grandma says things along that line all the time (pre-dementia, she had tendencies towards martyrdom) i genuinely believe that this is just something she says as a way to express her pain and frustration. the doctor could have just as easily gotten jump off a bridge/take a handful of pills/insert any other suicide method here.my grandma is still able to do quite a bit in the kitchen (usually with a little guidance), and locking up all the knives would probably upset her more than anything else. she's never alone in the house. my grandfather is there but he's not very mobile. i'm just not sure if we should be taking this doctors comment seriously?"," to simplify it, she threatened suicide. any other person, any other age or household, you or me with those same words, any threat of suicide gets the 72 hour hold or a crisis center, by default, in fact threatening suicide in my state is a crime. i saw my roommate at a crisis center try to strangulate herself with a rubber glove the nurse tech forgot to hide, and no knives is the policy? no, when they're really mental they'll suicide by papercut if need be, so restrictions like 'no knives' is stupid, so they'll break a mirror and use that, or a razor, or a plate or a glass or bottle. when they really want to they'll be like a prisoner with a spork. locking up the knives is saying you are intimidated by the threats. can you lock her out of the kitchen for every day she says suicidal things that involve kitchen objects?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6re8t2/grandmother_threatened_to_cut_her_own_throat_in/,Grandmother threatened to cut her own throat in front of doctor during a home visit. Now we have to lock up our knives?

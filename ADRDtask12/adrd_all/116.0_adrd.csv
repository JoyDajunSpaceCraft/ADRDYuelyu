my father has dementia and is violent and emotionally abusing my elderly mother.  we’ve tried to get him in a nursing home but because he said he didn’t want to go and my mom doesn’t have power of attorney the nursing home people wouldn’t take him.  we’ve called adult protection services on him and called the police several times but nobody will do shit.  i am so fucking tired of all the fighting and listening to my mother cry because of this asshole.  he’s never been a good person and the dementia has made it 10x worse.  i’m sick of nobody will help us and acting like he has more fucking rights than we do.  just fuck everything.," i remember reading about a tribe that follows some kind of herd animal (yak?) in rough mountainous areas, and when someone gets too old and frail, or even just difficult to care for--they probably have elders who get like your father--and can't make a river crossing or a mountain pass climb, they just leave him or her behind.  ""here, sit on this rock, dad.""  nobody looks back. nobody mourns.  it's like ""i can't fix this, and i don't have the energy to spare emotion on it.""   i don't condone geriatricide, but modern life isn't always providing a better answer.  in my opinion, nobody in the whole world has a problem worse than yours and your mom's.  it's no help.  but this misery all hinges on one life that will end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d9vuf4/need_to_rant/,Need to rant

"my mum has had dementia for 3 years or so now.i went away recently and when i came back she has deteriorated badly.  she is physically very healthy and has started to wander. i am her live in caregiverthe police brought her home the other day.she has started insisting over the last month that she has to leave to go home despite being at home.she goes out in her night clothes and tries to flag cars down passing by.  she says she will tell them to take her home and they will. if i try to convince her to stay she gets hostile and angry, and it takes me about 90 minutes of non stop battle of wits to stop her wandering. i try and use all the tools i've read from our local dementia society such as distraction etc but she gets paranoid and thinks that i'm some stranger trying to stop her and  doesn't recognise me at times. i can't lock her in or physically stop her, so it's driving me crazy trying to keep her safe.  i can't stop her but letting her go is dangerous potentially so at times i have had to follow her along the street trying to get her to come back. i cannot keep doing this.. i just don't have the mental capacity or strength to keep going.  i am thinking of suicide.  the mum i know has long gone. so it's off to court tomorrow to give me the legal authority to have her detained in a secure dementia facility even against her will for her own safety.  the court order will give me the authority to ask the ambulance and police to forcibly take her somewhere if necessary for safetyshe will not like this one bit understandably and i've just beside myself in how betrayed and hurt she must feel. she has no insight in to her condition and think she is perfectly fine.  i cannot watch her 24-hours a day and she has left the home before i'm awake couple of timesshe needs to be in a secure facility with staff at sufficient numbers to look after her. i am only looking for a couple of weeks respite care at this stage but even finding that is incredibly hard. when mum is in a good mood and remember she loves me she is the most loving wonderful mother like she used to be before the dementia took her.  the court hearing will be a nightmare i imagined with her feeling betrayed. but i can't keep her safe anymore.  but she's going to hate me and i worry it will ruin our future relationship although i am hoping that she will forget about it the next dayi am beside myself with anxiety and worry about tomorrow's hearingi know it's the best thing for mum but i don't want to hurt her feelings or make her feel unloved but i know i can't control that and unfortunately it's reached this stagedementia is a nasty fucking disease...", good luck. i can't even get up the nerve to talk to my mom about her dementia.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d9j6hy/going_to_court_tomorrow_to_give_me_the_power_to/,Going to court tomorrow to give me the power to tell mum where to live..

"hi there! my name is rachel, and i'm a nursing assistant who recently decided to start a side gig entertaining at care homes. i generally take advantage of my position working with residents at different nursing/care homes to tailor each show to the specific audience. this is my set list for nursing home show #3. the audience is comprised of 17 gents and 4 ladies, aged 65-90, mostly with either dementia or challenging behaviour, but a few who are just physically frail.  almost every song is a request, or from a requested artist/genre. as with my former shows, tried to include something for everyone. i also tried to alternate between faster and slower songs. :)how does the setlist strike you?--you are my sunshine - just a short, fun opener--close to you -- request for the carpenters-- can't help falling in love with you (ub40) --multiple requests for elvis, plus one for ub40--hopelessly devoted to you -- classic showtune request--i could have danced all night -- classic showtune request--white cliffs of dover -- wartime song/vera lynn requests--think of me -- phantom of the opera request--delilah--fly me to the moon -- sinatra request--hey jude -- beatles request--i wanna be like you -- swing request--dancing queen -- so many abba requests--super trouper -- same--mamma mia -- and again--flying without wings -- westlife request--can't take my eyes off of you --bohemian rhapsody -- direct request--show me the way to go home -- fun closer", awww that’s a great list! good for you!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d9flpb/nursing_home_performance_3/,Nursing Home Performance #3
a lots happened since i made that post only a day ago and thought i’d do a quick update. a few hours after i posted i got a call from my mum to tell me my grandma was going into care tomorrow (today) because she suddenly couldn’t walk (i was visiting my boyfriend so i wasn’t at home to know this) either my mum was having to tell her how to put one foot in front of the other or my sisters partner was having to carry her to the bathroom and back. we were going to make her a part of the deciding process and let her choose the home but things became urgent very quickly as you can imagine. it’s so scary how suddenly things can worsen.it’s been the day i’ve been waiting for for so long and now it’s finally happened i’m honestly not sure how to feel. i feel happy that me and my immediate family get our lives back and don’t have to rotate around my grandma 24/7 but then i also feel extremely guilty for feeling happy about that.  she didn’t take it well as you can probably guess and said some pretty nasty things and even called my mum from the home tonight to have a go at her. we’ve all tried to tell her we’re doing this because we want what’s best for her and that she’ll come home for family get togethers and holidays but she just thinks we’re all selfish and horrible people and that none of us care about her anymore. obviously not true but i also know we can’t reason with her anymore. fuck i hate dementia., i can feel your pain..at some stage it  can get too much for people to handle in a non professional setting,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d9bi8o/update_my_grandma_is_going_into_care_soon_she/,"(UPDATE) My Grandma is going into care soon, she thinks we’re abandoning her."
"i am going on a long journey by train.  as i begin, the city skyscrapers and county landscape look familiar.  as i continue my journey, the view reminds me of times gone by and i feel relaxed and comfortable.  the other passengers on the train appear to be feeling the same way and i engage in pleasant conversation with them.as the journey progresses, things begin to look different.  the buildings have odd shapes and the trees don’t look quite the way i remember them.  i know that they are buildings and trees, but something about them is not quite right.  maybe i’m in a different country with different architecture and plant life.  it feels a bit strange, even unnerving.i decide to ask the other passengers about the strangeness i feel, but i notice that they seem unperturbed.  they are barely taking notice of the passing scenery.  maybe they have been here before.  i ask some questions but nothing seems different to them. i wonder if my mind is playing tricks on me. i decide to act as if everything looks all right, but because it does not, i have to be on guard.  this places some tension on me, but i believe i can tolerate it for the remainder of the trip.  i do, however, find myself becoming so preoccupied with appearing all right that my attention is diverted from the passing scenery.after some time i look out the window again, and this time i know that something is wrong. everything looks strange and unfamiliar!  there is no similarity to anything i can recall from the past. i must do something. i talk to the other passengers about the strangeness i feel.  they look dumbfounded and when they answer, they talk in a new language.  why won’t they talk in english i wonder?  they look at me knowingly and with sympathy.  i’ve got to get to the bottom of this, so i keep after them to tell me where the train is and where it is going.  the only answers i get are in this strange language, and even when i talk, my words sound strange to me.  now i am truly frightened.at this point i figure that i have to get off this train and find my way home.  i had not bargained for this when i started.  i get up to leave and bid a pleasant good-bye.  i don’t get very far, though, as the other passenger’s stop me, and take me back to my seat.  it seems they want me to stay on the train whether i want to or not.  i try to explain, but they just talk in that strange language.outside the window the scenery is getting even more frightening.  strange, inhuman-looking beings peer into the window at me. i decide to make a run for it.  the other passengers are not paying much attention to me, so i slip out of my seat and quietly walk toward the back of the car.  there’s a door!  it is difficult to push, but i must.  it begins to open and i push harder. maybe now i will get away.  even though it looks pretty strange out there, i know i will never find my way home if i do not get off the train.  i am just ready to jump when hands suddenly appear from nowhere and grab me from behind.  i try to get away.  i try to fight them off, but i can feel them pulling me back to my seat.i realize now that i will never get off this train; i will never get home.how sad i feel.  i did not say good-bye to my friends or children.  as far as i know they do not know where i am.  the passengers look sympathetic, but they do not know how said i feel.  maybe if they knew they would let me off the train.  i stop smiling, stop eating, stop trying to talk and avoid looking out the window.  the passengers look worried.  they force me to eat.  it is difficult because i am too sad to be hungry.i have no choice now.  i have to go along with the passengers because they seem to know where the journey will end.  maybe they will get me there safely.   i fervently wish that i had never started out on this journey, but i know i cannot go back.", wow,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d9924q/for_those_of_you_living_with_dementia_or_taking/,"For those of you living with dementia, or taking care of loved ones with dementia, I hope this helps.

"hello. new here and still trying to figure out what i need to do. my 65 yo wife was diagnosed with ftdementia two years ago. originally thought to be alzheimers and had various scans including the expensive new pet scan that definitively ruled out alzheimers. she also has diabetes and thyroid issues and takes a statin for high cholesterol.while she she presents somewhat normally if you don't spend a lot of time with her it is becoming more apparent her short term memory is almost gone. repeating things and asking questions constantly, playing solitaire on an ipad all day it allowed. she used to cook but can't really do that any longer as ingredients get left out or the stove gets left on... pretty typical behavior.i use the usps service that alerts you to what mail is expected each day, have moved all bills to online payment so she can't interfere and have our home phone line forward to my cell. i had it ringing at home and my cell but disabled the ability to receive calls at home since the other day she answered a call from a scammer and gave out her medical information. fortunately the doctors office alerted me when the scammer called there trying to elicit information.when i asked my wife about the call she didn't remember what she told the scammer.on one hand i hate to block the phone completely (i also screen all her email) but i don't want what happened the other day to happen again. our utility has a device that can be installed on the electrical panel that allows you to monitor the electrical system and see what devices are being turn on and off. designed as a tool for monitoring expenses but i'm using it as a safety tool to make sure the stove/oven gets turned off if i'm not around.any suggestions or should i just let things be as they are with calls all coming to me? thank you."," rerouting all your calls to your cell is a great idea! we did that with my grandma in law, pretty much for the same reason. she was still able to make calls though and we left a sheet with friends and families numbers beside the phone. she needed help to use it though so it was usually an activity that her visitors could help her with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d969it/safety_issues/,Safety issues
"i guess this is mostly to vent, it's pretty much this or just sit in a corner sobbing.mom (lb dementia 67) called again just now. her eye glasses are ready, the doctor called. she spent about 10 minutes just gut-wrenching crying about how all she wants to do is see with her new glasses one more time, but dad is definitely having her killed today, so she'll never get to see clearly again. (dad's been 'definitely having her killed today' for almost a year, i think, now?)her pain is real, even if i know the reasons for it are not. my mom was never a big crier, hearing her sob breaks my heart every damn day, it's almost easier when she's angry. i feel shredded. at some point i went numb to it a while back, but feeling returned. i'm wondering if it'll be a cycle, will i just go numb again when enough of the daily heartache piles high enough the emotions can't claw their way to the surface?dad's flying her down here to stay with me for a few weeks at the end of next week. we've worked out getting special passes to get her to and from the gate, and a direct flight, with notices to flight attendants to keep an eye on her. i'm hoping some time away will get her away from the daily panics; thinking dad's about to have her murdered so he can run off with his non-existent mistress whom either lives in the basement or attic, depending on the day. i'm deeply afraid she'll transfer the paranoia to me, as of now i am the only one she talks to everyday that she doesn't think is somehow ""in on"" the conspiracy. i'm afraid it'll go so well she won't want to go back and i'll have to get her on the plane back crying and screaming, i mean i don't know if i can. what if this is my mom just moving in with me? lol. it's not funny. i am hoping this trip goes well, on both ends, so there can be many more in the future. if dad can send her down to spend time with me, while she can still technically be alone so i can go to work, it gives him a much needed and deserved break, and me time with my mom i couldn't have because i'm out of vacation days, or any padding to just quit my job and move across the country.anyway, thanks for listening to my rant. sometime just vomiting it all up makes you feel less nauseated."," get her in to a doctor.  my father sobbed daily.  he was put on an antianxiety medication, and moved into a memory care center, and now he hasn't cried for months.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d957a8/breaking_hearts/,Breaking Hearts

"i am looking for support/experience from anyone who has dealt with dementia in a very young person. my 18 year old foster son was diagnosed with dementia caused by brain damage related to kidney and heart failure, and it is progressing rapidly. one of the biggest problems has been his behavior; he has always struggled behaviorally, he has spent large chunks of his life in foster care, in hospitals, or being neglected and so has the trauma that goes along with it. i actually work in behavioral health, specifically with foster kids, but the combination of the memory loss and the behaviors is a whole new challenge. we were making progress for a while, but now he is just fighting everyday, and can't remember that we just had this same fight the day before. i don't know how to address unsafe behavior in someone who can't learn from his experiences."," i work as a dementia care provider, and the two things that i would say are one, that problematic behaviors are often due to some unmet need that they can't express. with significant dementia impacting abilities to communicate that might be as simple as being thirsty, or having some illness but more often might be anxiety, boredom, or some other psycho-social need. with your foster son's situation that could of course be any number of trauma based issues. the second thing is that when it comes to dementia, it really becomes necessary for you to meet them in their reality. as you pointed out, he can't learn from his experiences so you have to adjust to his ability. maybe that means ""dementia-proofing"" your home to make it safer (e.g. stove guard, locks for chemicals, locks to prevent leaving, etc.). maybe in-home care, but at some point it will likely mean a residential facility.clearly an extremely tough situation and i wish the best for you and your son.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d6jay3/teen_with_dementia/,Teen with Dementia

"what ideas and strategies do you all have for coping with a close family member with dementia who stubbornly resists seeing doctors and getting proper medical treatment due to pathological anxiety and a general paranoia towards the whole medical profession?my mother is in her mid-70's and i am 95% certain she has some kind of mild cognitive impairment or undiagnosed early-stage dementia. in part, we don't know for sure because she flatly refused a recommendation from a neurologist to get an mri. but she has concentration and memory problems that interfere with her ability to do daily tasks she used to be able to perform easily (now, luckily, she's in an assisted living home) and she shows some classic symptoms of early alzheimer's.the part i'm struggling to deal with is my mom's strong resistance to taking care of herself and going through with important medical appointments and procedures. she's always suffered from anxiety, but her fear of seeing doctors is so extreme that last year that she kept cancelling one check-up after another until it got to the point where she fell down multiple times in one day (no real physical harm but it was alarming) and my dad had to drive her to the er. even then, we could only barely convince her to go willingly with some cajoling by her primary care provider over the phone and the ruse that she was going to a scheduled appointment. (turned out the falls were partly due to a urinary tract infection and she had to stay in the hospital for a week.)most recently she fell (yet again) and broke her wrist in three places. not an emergency, but when my dad drove her to the medical center they recommended resetting the bones with some kind of non-invasive procedure (not surgery, just numb her arm and set the bones somehow). so my dad leaves her alone for 15 minutes to get a sandwich, and she freaks out and tells the people at the clinics that she refuses to have her broken wrist reset, and they send her home with a splint and some painkillers without having done the treatment! this necessitates scheduling another appointment the following week with an orthopedic surgeon. this specialist tells my mom that she can either (a) have surgery right away to fix the bones, and expect a short 1-2 week recovery, or else (b) wear a cast for 6 weeks plus physical therapy afterwards, and \*maybe\* she won't need surgery if she's lucky, but on the condition that she goes in for follow-up visits every 7 days to get new x-rays to check up on it, and with the risk that perhaps she'll need a more complicated surgery later on if they discover it's not healing properly. my mom chose option (b) because she's deathly afraid of any kind of surgery. we suspect this wasn't a good decision, but we know that fighting to convince her of option (a) would lead to a long, ugly argument and lots of stress for everyone, so now we are just crossing her fingers she doesn't fall down again anytime soon and have even more complications.i know that standard advice for dealing with loved ones with dementia is often ""be positive, don't argue, don't contradict them."" but it's infuriating to see my mom cancelling doctor's appointments and refusing to undergo standard medical tests and treatment. this directly affects my 78-year-old dad, who's the only family member living near her (i'm her only son and live thousands of miles away) and is forced to deal with a constant stream of minor crises and near-emergencies. mom's in an assisted living facility now (where she seems to be happy) but if she suffers another fall and becomes unable to lift a fork to her mouth, i don't think they'll be able to take care of her any longer.i feel that i cannot just happily agree with my mom and let her live in her own fantasy world because not taking care of herself medically has real consequences! reasoning with her calmly about this is a non-starter, and arguing with her passionately is even more of a waste of time (i have tried both of these things).ideas or suggestions?"," the doctor will need to be told about this, if it is not already known.  then, your father will have to call the doctor (gp) and (1) point out that she has been blowing off appointments and (2) she needs to get to these appointments and (3) the anxiety needs to be controlled. ask for a short acting med that will help calm her and get her to these appointments. you think they would know and offer something but, no, you have to say you need this help. then, tell them that she needs something to help with anxiety on a day-to-day basis because this just is not something that will go away on its own.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d67di3/question_vent_how_to_deal_with_dementia_sufferer/,Question / vent: How to deal with dementia sufferer who resists medical treatment?
"hi all, new here! i believe my mil has dementia. she is 70. her cognitive function,  memory, and ability to complete daily tasks have been declining gradually over the last few year. some examples- forgetting her sons’ names, being disoriented to the day of the week or the month, forgetting our garage code that she used to use daily, and then writing down the letter “r” instead of the number 9 when i told it to her, getting lost on the way to our house and not being able to follow written directions or a map, etc....the worst symptom of all, though, is the paranoia. luckily it hasn’t been focused on any family members yet, but she has zeroed in on her neighbors. she believes they are trying to kill her pretty much daily. she also thinks they are stealing from her and messing with her car.  (of note, the exact same thing happened at her old place so we moved her only for it to happen again.) we’ve had her staying at our house for the last week and now she believes they have followed her here and have been terrorizing her by standing outside her window and yelling that they are going to shoot her. we obviously know this isn’t true since we live here and have dogs that would go crazy if that was really happening. we have tried gently to get her to see that none of this is happening, but to her it’s 100% real and there is no convincing her otherwise. she then gets mad at us for thinking she’s “crazy.” (we would never ever use that word, but that’s the word she uses.)so here’s my question.... she obviously needs help, but how do we convince her? she has no established doctor. i doubt she would sign a dpoa right now.  i did get her an appointment with a new pcp that she agreed to go to in order to get her back pain checked out. i asked over the phone if we could speak to a nurse or doctor beforehand to voice our concerns, but they wouldn’t allow it. is this standard practice? i understand with hipaa they cannot give us info on her, but that’s not what we are asking for. we just want to make sure they have the whole story so they can do their best assessment. i’m afraid that will be difficult to do while she’s in the room and i know she can hide her symptoms fairly well. i’d love any help or advice! this is all so incredibly frustrating and i know this journey is just beginning for us."," dementia suffers are often not aware of having dementia. because of this, it’s best for the loved ones to get a screening. you might want to try to get her involved as much as possible so you know what she wants before she is too far gone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d66ykq/help_for_someone_in_denial/,Help for someone in denial???

"my mom (mid 70’s) has the beginning symptoms of dementia. my father, sibling, and i all agree, but her doctor claims she’s fine. and she thinks she’s fine, so we’re getting nowhere with a diagnosis. i feel like i’ve had to start going behind her back to keep her safe or patch things up with her friends. she gets into arguments because she can’t remember things. she’s always been the type to start long, drawn-out feuds over with friends and family, and it’s gotten worse as the dementia symptoms started. so i’ve started calling her friends and telling them about her dementia whenever she tells me another “lee’s not talking to me, and i don’t know why” story. not so they’ll let her off the hook entirely, but so they’ll understand why she’s changed. she also has a type of heart disease, and is seeing a different cardiologist. after she mentioned the upcoming appointment i felt like a secret agent getting the doctor’s name out of her, then calling his office the next day to let him know, so that he can suggest that my father attend the appointment. otherwise she’ll only hear what she wants to and ignore all his advice because she’s scared of the tests she needs. my father’s not a pushy guy, and just wants to let her do what she wants. he has the right to make that decision, but watching this play out is both heart-wrenching and frustrating. he’s willing to let me go behind her back, telling friends and talking to doctors-i think because he doesn’t want to be the bad guy. my sibling agrees with what i’m doing, but their spouse is also very sick and they just don’t have the time to help deal with this. i know i’m lucky that my mom made it to 70 before the onset of her dementia, that my dad can, and wants to, take care of her, and that i have a sibling to vent to, who helps with local stuff when they can (i live across the country from them). but this all still really sucks."," you need to figure out a way to get her to her family doctor, so he can refer her for testing. the earlier she can get the diagnosis of dementia, the earlier she can start medicine that delays the symptoms for awhile. maybe call the doctor’s office and explain what needs to be done. i’m assuming she won’t want to go. they can schedule the appointment, and you can say you answered the phone when they called her. just let her think it’s for a physical or something that won’t threaten her. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d5rkt8/just_a_vent_going_behind_someones_back/,just a vent: Going behind someone’s back

"i initially posted this on another sub but it was recommended that i post it here too! this is just a copy/paste of what i posted before. i guess i'm looking for advice and for a way to put this awful disease into perspective, and maybe just to get this off my chest too. as the title says, my 80-year-old grandma is in the early stages of dementia, as has been diagnosed by doctors (every so often she has to go back to the hospital to see how it's progressing). of course, this is making her very forgetful. her short-term memory is virtually non-existent. she takes medications but those can't reverse her regressing memory.my family tries to be understanding but it's not easy. she has lost all sense of rationality and thinks the entire world is against her. to give an example: my grandpa (her husband) had to undergo heart surgery yesterday (it went well!). she was there when the cardiologist told him he needed surgery last week. afterwards, she's been calmly told a hundred times that he was going to get surgery. yesterday, she was very upset at him for ""not telling her"", and accused him of ""faking it because he's lazy and wants her to pamper him"". when my mom tried to talk sense into her, she lashed out at my mom, telling her that ""she always takes my grandpa's side"" and ""everyone is against her"" (maybe i should mention that my grandma began to hate my grandpa, even though he tries his best to truly help and assist her). she stormed off and left my mom on the verge of tears. this is just one of dozens of examples i could be giving. i know it's not her talking, but the disease, but it's incredibly painful to hear her talk about my grandpa like that, or to witness her get angry at my mom. i understand that this must be very scary for her. she is losing her memory and, subsequently, her grip on the world. i know it's not her fault. but situations like this are incredibly painful for everyone concerned. she has always been a very proud woman and now she refuses to acknowledge that she's old and that there's something wrong with her. she adamantly refuses any sort of help, whether it be from therapists, nurses, or chat groups. going to a retirement home is completely out of the question.is there anything that i, and my family, can do, to avoid those kind of situations? or to at least make this entire ordeal a little more bearable? because this is awful for my grandparents, for my mom and her siblings, and for me to see my mom get hurt and my grandma no longer being the woman i knew while growing up."," thank you. i worry so much about them, but they so far seem to be learning compassion for others.  they really love their dad, he is an amazing father.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d42gtv/my_grandma_has_early_onset_dementia_it_is_making/,My Grandma has early onset dementia.

"does anyone have experience with having an elderly, demented relative declared a ward of the state or dealing with adult protective services?  what happened, and how did you feel about it?"," i heard this story when going over options with a social worker.there was a dementia patient and his son. the patient was a ward of the state. the son was able to visit his dad regularly when he could. he didn't have the finances to take care of his dad with extra rooms or caregivers. but, eventually his right to visit was revoked. the story goes:* the father had diabetes* the state had a duty to keep the father healthy* the son felt a duty to bring tasty sweet snacks to his dad* the state enforced its legal duty for the father's health with a restraining order against the son because the amount of sugar being brought in was too much* the son may have had legal recourse, but no practical recourse since the son didn't have spare cash/time to go the legal route in the first placelet me be absolutely clear it's sad right away that the son couldn't afford to take care of his dad. but also if the son had been forced to take care of his dad, it would absolutely ruin the son. vaguely i understand that when the state takes over, all assets of the patient become assets of the state to use/liquidate in the caregiving of the patient. your mileage may vary, always check with a local social worker and a lawyer.-- edit -- aps is a screener type of service, they're the ones who evaluate whether the patient requires action. ward of the state is one of the 'end games' of deciding who's caring for the patient.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d3ulrf/adult_protective_servicesward_of_the_state/,Adult protective services/ward of the state?

"i literally feel sick to my stomach and on the brink of crying at any moment.for reference, my mom has not been diagnosed with dementia but shows many of the early signs and repeats stories over and over, forgets she tells me things, forgets what she's told, and has significant lost critical thinking abilities.several days ago my mom went on a date with a man and has been seeing him and chatting with him off and on since then.  she has told me he's a vietnam vet who has ptsd and cries about how awful things were.yesterday, my fiance and i googled his name to check him out and it turns out he is a registered sex offender who has been convinced on two counts of assault on a minor. evidently he was married multiple times to women who had young daughters and has been accused of intentionally seeking out these women for that reason.at his trials, many young girls testified, and several ex wives stated they divorced him because of his inappropriate behavior. he even admitted guilt to some counts including to molesting an 8 year old girl, said he had had therapy.now, when i called my mom to let her know what i had found out, she said she knew that he was a registered offender (he told her) and this is what he cries about and he's so remorseful, and he's a changed man.  the story he told her was that a vengeful wife set him up in all this. she did not get the story that he was married so many times and that he even admitted to some of the accusations. i tried to tell her that the evidence (even started the articles and court transcript) overwhelmingly pointed to his guilt, that he even admitted guilt on some things and that he lied to her about the severity of things and his own admission to guilt.when faced with that new knowledge, she maintained that he's remorseful, and he's 75 now and a changed man. he could hardly do anything like that now. he's a kind man.  i've tried to explain that pedophilia isn't something you can necessarily just turn off, that it's a compulsion and sure, you can recognize it's wrong, but the compulsion can be so strong that you do it again. i've tried to explain that even if he can no longer physically harm a child with his reproductive parts, he can still touch inappropriately and exploit with photos or mind manipulation.i am just disgusted and distraught because she is really into him and refuses or is incapable of seeing this. i want to have children and she deeply wants grandchildren, but she can't see my concern about having someone like that in their life. i took the straightforward approach and told her point blank that i could be courteous to this person but the moment a child entered the picture, there was no contact with him and if that meant she didn't see it as much, that would be how it had to be. she did not react well and painted me as a cruel and cold and unforgiving person.this is just not who my mom was. she was a teacher of young children and never ever would have given someone like this the benefit of the doubt. when she was dating 20 years ago, she would never have considered someone like this to date. she is just so so desperate for companionship and love that i think she will twist anything in her mind. and her critical thinking skills are so diminished and she's so vulnerable to manipulation, i don't think she can see the danger or harm this relationship can cause or how in can change her relationship with me if i choose to have children.i don't know what to do. i just want to throw up."," i read a book loaned to me called ""what cops know"". on the subject of child molesters it said ""rape was about the power, pedophilia was all about the sex"", even if he could not penetrate a child. and ""a pedophiliac could look at school yard or movie venue and pick out a child who was susceptible to being molested"". you never said whether your mother had any grandkids that i saw b/c some people look for people with children or grandchildren.with 5 grandkids, i was always watching out for them. my daughter had a girl about two. she wanted to kiss anyone. her other grandmother was with a guy who i saw kiss her on the lips. i didn't say anything as it was a baseball game. i always turned my head for a kiss on the cheek, mostly because half the time kids need their noses wiped every 10 minutes. i told my daughter and she kept them at a safe distance.thankfully this was husband #7 (seriously) and it lasted about as long as her other husbands did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d1rd2d/i_am_living_in_a_nightmare_right_now/,I am living in a nightmare right now

"my father had dementia for 3 years before he died last year. my mom was his only caretaker and it was really hard. she's now trying to get her life in order (fixing up the house, creating a will, setting up power of attorney, etc.) because she's noticed some changes with her mentation.  she actually went to a memory care person and they noticed slight cognitive loss.  her mom had dementia too so my mom is a little paranoid about her also having it. she lives alone and wants to make sure she's got as much set up as she can if anything really bad happens.  we have a plan for the next few years that we're all going to be finally living in the same city. if she needs help later on, she'll be living with us. she put me in charge or making health care decisions but wants to make my younger brother (we're both near our 40's) in charge of her money.    thing is, he'll be in another state and won't be involved in her care; i will.  i told her it felt a little odd to have to go through my brother to get money for her as i'm a responsible grown up who will also be her caregiver. she might be thinking of if she needs to go into a home (she's planning waaayy in advance, i know but she had a hard time with my dad) and doesn't want the burden of dealing with all her bills left onto me.   am i wrong to think the child she'd be living with or at least the child lives in the same city and would be the main person involved if she was in a care home should be financial power of attorney?

"my grandma has had dementia for around two years. but because a nursing home is way too expensive, my mom takes care of my grandma. we got her an apartment right outside our house. my grandma gets paid by my uncle for it.sometimes i feel really bad that i'm not always around my grandma simply because that's my grandma. growing up i loved seeing her. but our family hasn't always been close. infact, my entire family hardly got a long. i honestly cannot remember the last time i saw one of my cousins in person. but that's not what this is about... except that me and my mom are the only people to take care of her. except occasionally when my cousin (uncle's daughter) comes over with her kid.it infuriates me that nobody else in the family wants to help at all. i'll be honest, i don't talk to my grandma everyday even though she's in the apartment right behind our house but i watch over her when my mom has to go somewhere. to make sure she doesn't leave and get lost. infact a couple months ago, she managed to find a ride to her old farmhouse. my mom had to call the police. we couldn't find her for hours but turns out, the driver took her to the bank and took her to her old house which could have went extremely wrong. we had another incident where my mom had taken in my grandma's pocketbook and my grandma wrote on a piece of paper through the window that she was locked in and robbed and someone called the police.it's really frustrating to me. to see my grandma hardly know what's going on, to see my mom stress over her nearly everyday due to dementia changing my grandma's personality, and to feel like everything is put on my mom. my mom will only let me do so much because she's afraid that my grandma might get nasty with me on the wrong day.i don't know. for now, my mom is okay with taking care of her because i keep an eye on her aswell. but some days my grandma can really do my mom in. what keeps us pushing through this, is we know one day she will pass. so we lookout for her because of that. nobody wants to put her in a nursing home, not only because of how expensive it is, but my mom distinctively remembers my dad saying he'd never put her in a nursing home because he felt it was a horrible way to live the rest of your life.my dad passed away many years ago, as did my grandpa, so sometimes i just can't believe my mom and i are doing this. i can't believe life is the way it is. i want to help more, but i'm not sure how because like i said my mom only wants me to do so much. i try to come up with ideas. for example writing certain things where she'll obviously see it and she won't be tempted to leave because she forgot. but i don't know. i hate seeing my grandma like this and i hate that no one else wants to help even though they have mooched off of her. it's just me and my mom. it sucks."," it really is an awful situation. how old is your grandma if you don’t mind me asking? my grandpa has dementia but luckily he is 94 so he is too weak to get around. it makes taking care him in general easier but makes showers a nightmare.i’m sorry to hear that she is still able to move around to the point she can run away. i can’t imagine how scary that must have been.on the bright side you and your mother still have each other. i feel like watching a grandparent go through dementia makes you appreciate having your parent even more.i don’t talk to my grandfather either. but it’s mostly because he doesn’t remember things after a day. it is a awful existence either. every day he goes to the tv and just watches tv for 10+ hours. he eats and just sits there. nursing home or not dementia is a cruel existence.our brain is what makes humans special. it’s what allowed us to create civilization, language, art, and go to the moon, it must be scary losing what makes us human.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/d02thl/venting/,Venting

"a little background, my 83-year-old step-father has had progressively worse memory loss and recall over the past ten years but it's worsened after a recent diagnosis of sarcoma (a rare cancer on an artery) and subsequent radiation treatment. for the past six or more months, he's become delirious (no sense of time, paranoia, major lapses in memory). the doctor's have been more concerned with the sarcoma that they have not diagnosed these issues. my mom has taken care of him at home during all of this. she's younger than him and retired so she's fit to take care of him, but she's worn thin right now to put it simply.yesterday, we had a major episode where he ended up calling the cops after he had hidden my brother's hunting rifles and couldn't remember where three of them were. my brother (40s) who lives with them has become his target when my step-dad loses things or is just angry. yesterday's incident was because earlier in the week he thought my brother stole his car keys and wallet which they later found in my step-father's bedroom.the cops were very understanding and helped us talk to him trying to figure out what was wrong. they tried getting him to tell us where the missing rifles were but said he gave them to someone but couldn't remember who. just to clarify, these aren't automatic rifles, but it still worries me that he's given them to who knows who as he doesn't drive nor really knows anyone near us other than his son and brother who both said he didn't give them to them.apologies for long-windedness. we finally got him inside by having my brother leave the house for the night because my step-dad said he wouldn't be in the house with him. the cops said they couldn't take him anywhere for momentary stay because we became worried about self-harm after he kept saying he wanted to stay outside and die.so that's where we are at the moment.i don't know if we're capable of handling the issue's he's having at the moment. we just went through a very similar issue with my grandmother with years of delusions and paranoia before she passed just recently. it's taken a toll on my mom who basically jumped from that straight to this.what kinds of options are there? do we try to get him sedated temporarily by the doctors so we can get him on an anti-depression/anti-anxiety medication to help with these things? i'm personally afraid of him endangering my mom or brother with these erratic mood swings.lastly, yes, the rifles have been removed from the house. there was never any ammunition for them so they weren't concerned but obviously we know now otherwise.", i would recommend getting him to a neurologist as soon as you can. my mil takes a few meds that have helped with the paranoia and agitation.   the one that helps the most is namzeric. it's a treatment for alzheimers but it seems to work for her. she is more docile when she takes it regularly.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cz722v/stepfathers_memory_loss_and_subsequent_anger/,"Step-father's memory loss and subsequent anger becoming a big issue, not sure what to do."

(so no complex emotions). that makes it harder for you to deal with, as you'll lose more and more of her. on the other hand, it can make caring for her easier and she will have a much easier time. it is important to be aware of her needs. if she needs to sleep, let her. if she needs to go out for a small walk, eat, drink, let her. if she doesn't, that's also ok. be aware of the risk of developing wounds if she has lost weight and is in bed for the bigger part of the day. if you see any redness (heels, lower back) that doesn't go away when you press it, consult a doctor, nurse or physical therapist.as for your question if this is the beginning of the end, then yes. it seems to be. i wish you all the strength you need, although with what you are already doing i think you are already doing the best you can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cyqdj9/sleeping_so_much_in_bed_most_of_the_day/,Sleeping So Much - In bed most of the day

"posting on a throwaway to protect her anonymity. i'm mostly a lurker but tonight has been....a night and i am at the end of my rope. my grandma is at home on hospice with a slew of medical issues but the main culprit being her lewy body dementia. i stumbled across this subreddit in the last few weeks and found comfort in the stories and advice of other people dealing with this dreadful disease. i felt like i needed a place to vent some frustrations i am having as one of her caretakers. my grandmother was diagnosed with lbd much too late. it had already progressed to the point of her needing assistance with every day activities and her hallucinations were downright frightening. (people trying to rob her, a man with only a head and torso in her bedroom, etc.)  in the short time since the diagnosis, she has deteriorated rapidly to the point of being nonverbal and pretty much sleeping all day. when she's not asleep, she is just....impossible. she screams and cries throughout the night and nothing can console her. when i say scream, i mean it sounds like a slasher movie. she is very combative. she refuses all medication at this point and will even spit it on you if you try and give it to her. she slaps, punches, bites and kicks. just this afternoon she gripped my thumb with what can only be described as superhuman strength and attempted to break it. i was literally just giving her water. she refuses to allow anyone to change her or bathe her. despite not being able to speak, she makes her anger very clear with a cold slap to the face. we've become quite good at dodging them though. my mother and i who provide her care feel so powerless to do anything and everything we can do is met with nothing but resistance. i know this is all relatively normal for someone at her stage but part of me just wants this to be over and her pain to end. then i'm wracked with guilt for even having thoughts like that. i just want my grandma back. i'm not resentful of her. i'm resentful that this disease took her from me and left me with this person who seems to hate me.thank you for listening.", god bless you for not resenting her....even though i know it is the disease i still have such a hard time not being mad at the person who carries it.  i hope your family returns to a more peaceful state soon.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cy48vh/combative_86_yr_old_grandma_seems_to_be/,Combative 86 yr old Grandma seems to be approaching the final stages
"hi,my mother (66f) has been exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior over the past year or two. last week i got married in my parents' backyard. her behavior the week leading up to it and day of was extremely out of character. the family has noticed her decline. my father took her to get memory and cognitive testing completed about two months ago, and it came back alright for a person her age. i'm not sure what the test entailed, but my understanding was that it was not for the purpose of identification of dementia. he also took the test and actually scored just behind her. is it possible for someone to have dementia with limited ""traditional"" cognitive decline? here are a few examples of her behaviour that has caused alarm bells to be raised.- has stopped bathing/showering as needed. my husband and i both noticed a smell of urine when we were around her.- my mother (who does not drink) chose right after the wedding ceremony to create a scene with my aunt (dad's sister); telling her how much she she hates her guts, hates her family, etc. this is completely irrational to do this at my wedding.- tried to shut the bar down before the wedding was over because she didn't want people there anymore.- rude, nasty comments to everyone around her. huge shift in negativity. groom's brother told him she is the nastiest person he's ever met.- obsessing about things that are not important. e.g. fixating on one decoration for a few days leading up to the wedding, continually asking me and my sister what my aunt gave for a wedding present.- accusing my brother in law of stealing alcohol with the bartender following the wedding (paranoia).- exceedingly stubborn and illogical. e.g. hosted a family bbq and invited groom's family, then asked me to uninvite them. told my sister (maid of honor) that was not allowed to do a speech at my wedding and fought with me over it. fought with me when i wanted to allow guests to sit on either side of the ceremony regardless of who they were there to support.my mother has always been somewhat self-centered, but we all feel she has gone off the rails as of late. she had an incident of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in 2012, continues to have high blood pressure and smokes, and has been reliant on lorazapam and diazapam for many many years now which might be contributing to this behavior. any insight/perspective would be appreciated."," my mom (74) was initially tested around the same age as your mom. we noticed strange behavior, increasing paranoia, agitation. however the test of cognitive decline showed no significant change from what’s expected of her peers. the neurologist did point out one thing, though, that kept her as his patient, and i’m glad he did. he said that the test is really only useful for people with average iqs. my mom’s a very intelligent, educated woman. it’s only now that i’m noticing that she can’t follow her usual video games (she loves rpgs) or sudoku. and unfortunately, she’s progressed to early stage dementia. we’re still not sure what kind because she’s very ashamed and paranoid that her family will use this against her. sigh. anyway, keep an eye on your mom. and try to remember that her nasty behavior is, in fact, out of character. my mother also made my wedding an incredibly stressful occasion, so i try to remember the fun times we had when i was considerably younger.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cy2yk3/dementia_with_limited_cognitive_decline/,Dementia with limited cognitive decline?

"cw: death we found out yesterday that my dad has only a couple weeks left to live. he’s only been diagnosed for around 4 years, but it’s progressed so quickly that he’s different and worse every day in a different way. i find myself so detached from the situation that i don’t know if i even feel sad about it. i know that everyone grieved in different ways, but this makes me feel like i’m...missing a part of myself that would allow me to feel sad about what’s happening. how have y’all dealt with the loss of your loved ones to dementia?", you have been grieving the loss of your father for four years.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cvo8zm/detachment_from_grief/,Detachment from Grief
"i am worried about my dad. over the past few years i have started to notice more instances of memory loss and problems holding conversations. in the back of my mind i think i've been chalking it up to him just ""getting old,"" but a conversation we had today made things click and i want to have a talk with him about him getting some help. i am afraid the conversation may not go well, though, because he has become increasingly angry, defensive, and stubborn over the past few years and months.the memory loss started off small and has gotten worse as time has gone on. a few years ago he would have trouble coming up with words in conversation, but with some prompting he could figure it out and the conversation would continue.  this itself has become more frequent, but more and more he is losing his train of thought mid-conversation and i'll have to remind him what he was talking about. the worst part is that sometimes when he is telling a story, i will ask him questions during the story for clarification or to interject something related. a normal part of friendly conversation. but more and more when i do this he will snap at me for interrupting him because he will immediately forget what he was telling me. ""now what was i talking about?..."" and ""can you just let me finish?!"" have become regular lines in our conversations.there have been other things. for instance, in the past few weeks he has lost his phone twice and lost his wallet. he forgot my fiancee's name during conversation recently, and we've been dating for 8 years. he has also been making some questionable financial decisions. but the worst part is that his anger has gotten more out of control. he has always had the propensity to get angry in certain situations, but now he seems to have a much shorter fuse. he will get angry multiple times during normal conversations for seemingly no reason. and this seems to get worse later in the day and into the evening.he has gone through some rough things in his life. my twin brother committed suicide 4 years ago my dad took it extremely hard. he blames the recent increased anger on that situation. and it does seem like his mental state has started deteriorating more rapidly since that happened. he was in therapy for a while which helped, but he hasn't been recently. he has had problems in the past with mixing his anti-depressants with alcohol and marijuana, which could be contributing to some of the mental issues he's having. he's also gone through some emotional abuse from his father early in life which i think has contributed to his general anger throughout his life.whether the cause of his increased struggles is early stage dementia, alcohol/marijuana mixed with antidepressants, or just general emotional trauma taking its toll, i would still like him to go to the doctor and get checked out for dementia. the problem is, with his increased defensiveness and anger i think he might reject this and get upset with me for even suggesting it. i definitely want to be sure i communicate that i'm coming from a place of love and caring. i'll probably also frame it in terms of ""there very well may be nothing wrong, but it would be good to get checked out just in case"" because he has usually been proactive about going to the doctor to keep himself healthy in other cases. i'm also worried because he has always felt insecure about other people thinking he is stupid, so i hope he doesn't take the conversation in that way.i guess i'm wondering, was anyone else in a similar situation in the early stages with a loved one? do you have any advice for starting up this conversation with someone who might get angry at the idea that someone thinks they could have dementia? and what should i do if he does get angry and refuses to acknowledge there is a problem? any advice or related stories would be greatly appreciated.","  if your dad regularly goes to the doctor, but you think he would balk at being checked for dementia, you can write his doctor a note. explain what has been happening with your dad and ask that he be evaluated.  the doctor will take it from there.  the doctor can’t talked to you because of hippa (unless your dad approves), but the doctor can absolutely listen to your worries about your dad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cvjmfo/i_think_my_28_m_dad_65_m_might_be_showing_early/,I think my (28 M) dad (65 M) might be showing early signs.

," sounds like the anger is the issue, not the car.  dementia makes people depressed and angry.  can you get her on meds for her anger, or if not, will she take cannabis?  even just a half a gummy at night makes the next few days soooooo much better.  check with her doctor first, there's an alz med that interacts really badly with cannabis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cv94g0/mom_has_vascular_dementia_should_not_be_driving/,"Mom has vascular dementia, should not be driving, still is, what do I do?"

"hi everyone! i’m just looking for some support and confirmation from people who deal with loved ones with dementia.i’m pretty sure my grandma (just turned 80 this year) has dementia. she has grown increasingly paranoid over the past decade and hasn’t left her tiny apartment in at least 5-7 years. my mom orders her groceries over the internet.i live thousands of miles away, and my mom (who also lives far away) talks to her on the phone almost every day. anyway, my grandma would always act normal and lively when she would talk to me through skype. but i guess when she would talk to my mom she would tell her all her crazy paranoid shit, yell at her for no reason etc.it was hard for me to understand... because i love my grandma, and i know that my mom and her never really lived peacefully. so i used to be skeptical about my mom telling me all that stuff.i’m just curious is this a common thing? do people with  dementia often switch how they act depending on who they talk to?it seems that she is now breaking that facade with me. i now see what my mom is talking about finally because my grandma now is beginning to act the same with me as well...also, does anyone have advice on how to convince someone who is paranoid and delusional to accept help from a psychiatrist/doctor? i’m about to visit my grandma next week (i haven’t seen her in person in 4 years) and i’d like to call a doctor to her apartment who could examine her at least a little bit.from the research i’ve done, it does look like delusional thoughts and psychosis (pretty damn sure she has that right now) can be treated. tldr: my grandma has dementia and she acted/acts like she was normal with me for years. but she acts crazy with my mom. is that common?"," if your grandma has a uti this will also cause her to act this way, they can be really bad for the elderly. my mom has dementia but a uti will make her a totally different person. please make sure she gets checked for that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cv2xi7/is_it_common_for_people_with_dementia_to_act/,[deleted by user]
"well,    today i fucked and completely pissed off my brother.  he and i have both been sharing time sitting with dad at night.  our wives have both been at home holding down the households while we are with dad.   some things happened and he was out for a while so it was just me staying with dad every night for about 4 weeks.  well he’s been able to come back to helping, but i didn’t want him to feel like i was all of a sudden taking advantage so i’ve been having him just help a couple of nights a week.   with that schedule, if i work late, he’s been staying.  my schedule has been work late, get up early, go sit with dad for an hour so he can get to work, then get off work and come sit with dad.   i’ve seen my family a total of 3-4 hours in 2 weeks.   dad hasn’t been sleeping well at night.  he’s got days and nights mixed up.his daily sitter left a list of groceries.   instead of going to get them, i just get a text of the list from his wife.   there’s no reason they couldn’t get them.   really really frustrating.   so i call my 16 year old son, who goes over to get the list and go shopping.  no big deal, he’s happy to do it, he gets to drive.i show up this morning, and one of the first things said is my son forgot a few things.   in reality, he didn’t forget anything,  he just didn’t look for it.   that really rubbed me the wrong way since my son had stopped what he was doing to come do something they could have easily done.   i sent a pretty rough text message to my wife venting my frustration, but i sent it to him instead.   yay.  the only support i have to help with dad and i just fucked that up.   i should have just shrugged off the frustration like i’ve been doing for months.  lesson learned, check text receivers."," my guess is he recognizes the stress caring for your dad sometimes can get you frustrated and acting angry to people who are close to you. it is very normal to feel overwhelmed or frustrated at times when you are caring for a loved one.as another commenter suggested: talk about it. it might even bring you closer as brothers, since you are going through the same thing.best of luck and keep on being an awesome son to your dad. that also includes caring for yourself by the way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cuwfgx/my_fu_with_my_brother/,My FU with my brother.

"since 2012, my grandma has gone down hill with her mind and losing everything. she will yell at me, my mother, and sometimes the men in the house. it's always females she yells at, and not the males. she dictates everyone on what she wants done. meaning, things have to go her way, cooking, cleaning, etc. in the morning, shes good sometimes but it's during the afternoon/night when she gets unstable. she tends to forget names and memories of things that happened.my grandpa passed away on june 7th and since his death, she has gotten worse. the day after her funeral, she yelled at me and my siblings because we took the attention from her on his funeral. now she is complaining she is broke and has nothing but she goes on vacation and buys ton of groceries. it's gotten so bad that some of us don't want to be around her. my fiance doesn't want to come over and see me (my mom, stepdad, and me recently moved in) because she has gotten worse. i know she checked a doctor and they did a mri scan, they found no lesions but i don't know what is happening with her.i know i should ask a professional but i wanna ask anyone that has been around someone with demintia."," it sounds like your grandma is just grieving. that's not to say there isn't something else going on, but i think you may have to be a bit gentle and patient with her.she has lost her life partner and your family have moved into her home. these are huge events in your grandma's life and it will take time for her to get used to the fact that her life will never be the same again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cu52w3/does_my_grandma_have_dementia/,Does my grandma have dementia?

"throwaway account as i’m not comfortable sharing my personal info on my main account as it has my name. my great aunt has dementia and i recently went to visit her in a care home. it’s just the beginning stages, i know this as her brother (my grandpa) had it, and i had to watch him slowly die from it. i miss him everyday and i regret not spending more time with him, but i was in my teens and didn’t really understand how serious it was. he passed 2 years ago and that’s when it really hit me. now i feel like i owe it him, and her, to be there for her as much as i can, because i know how quickly she could be gone. i’m trying to find activities i can get her to keep her busy, or things we can do together. i got her a large print book, colouring book, and puzzle games book. i’m going to give her one of my small plants to take care of (one that doesn’t require much attention) does anyone have any suggestions on other things i could get her/things we could do together? her and i were never close so i’m not sure on her interests."," does she knit or crochet, or do you? how about a mini spa day? paint her nails, rub her arms, legs & neck with a really good lotion that smells nice, brush her hair.  bring her hair bows or hair bands or inexpensive bracelets.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/c2yhyv/activity_help/,Activity help?
my partner is flummoxed dealing with her 85 year old mother with mid-stage dementia who currently is in another state.do you have experience or thoughts on memory care unit vs. independent care facilities? she seems in between both.," independent care facilities are probably too independent in this case. memory care units might be too restrictive. what you're looking for is, probably, the middle-ground - assisted living. the staff still keeps an eye on the resident, gives them help where needed, but otherwise let's them stay independent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/c2wlf0/memory_care_vs_independent_living/,Memory Care vs. Independent Living?

"mil lives with us, she has lewy body dementia. she had a neurologist appointment this morning that kind of triggered her because she’s in denial and he said the word “dementia” about 40 times. and now she’s just learned that she has a colonoscopy tomorrow and she can’t eat today. shes convinced herself that she’s going to die tomorrow, so she’s distraught. she can’t stop crying. i’ve hugged, brought her comfort items, reassured, and have calming worship music playing for her. i’m the only one home with her, my husband can’t leave work, and his brother is unhelpful and unsympathetic. can you give me any advice? do i sit with her while she cries or leave her alone? do i try to distract?"," i'm glad she's doing better now.  like another poster, i think you need to speak to her and her doctor about what types of treatments she gets going forward.  the lewy body dementia isn't going to get magically better (not curable), so maybe you should be focusing on what things you can do to help her feel better.  that might mean withholding medical treatments like colonoscopies or other screening tests that cause her a lot of stress.  \*her doctor will probably continue to keep prescribing such treatments until she (or whoever has her power of medical attorney) says to stop them.\*if i were you, i would not do the colonscopy tomorrow.  there is a lot of risk with putting someone with lbd under anesthesia (that it will make the lbd a lot worse).  plus, she has to not eat and drink all that gross colon prep stuff, even if she doesn't understand why.  you can always re-schedule the colonscopy and do it later.  but in the meantime you can do research on lbd and what steps to take going forward. [ like that site says, there are a lot of doctors that don't know about lbd.  maybe the dr. who prescribed the colonscopy doesn't know the effects it could have on her.  also note how the anesthesiologist in the story didn't know anything about lbd and how anesthesia and the wrong pain meds can really mess up someone with lbd.

"hi everyone!i am a msc psychology student currently looking for support workers (or a similar role such as healthcare assistant or carer) to answer my questionnaire about vicarious trauma and personality types. the questionnaire is about 20 minutes long. all data collected will be anonymous and will form as part of my dissertation.vicarious trauma is the physical, psychological and spiritual changes that can occur from an individual witnessing the pain, fear and terror that trauma survivors have endured. very little research has been conducted on vicarious trauma and support workers therefore it is important this research is done to get as much recognition as other healthcare professionals.the definition of support worker is someone who looks after the well-being of vulnerable people. they help people to live their lives as independently as possible and support them in reaching their potential, through both practical and emotional support. a support worker role will vary depending on the person you’re supporting, but generally speaking you will be supporting vulnerable people with many aspects of their day-to-day living, helping them to take care of themselves and live a fulfilled life. different people will need support for different reasons. for instance, they may have mental health needs, learning disabilities, medical conditions or physical disabilities.this is a re-post so you may have already taken this questionnaire. i am hoping for 20 more responses before i analyse my results next week.thanks for any responses.link to the questionnaire: [",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/c2fnb4/participants_needed_support_workers_healthcare/,"Participants needed: Support workers, Healthcare assistant, Caregivers"
"my name is max, i’m a theatre-maker and musician from london.   my grandfather mike died with alzheimer’s in 2015, and my grandmother flora was also recently diagnosed with the disease. they were the perfect couple in my eyes, loving and kind, with a beautiful connection and a fiercely positive attitude, and at the end of last year i decided to record interviews with flora to try and save as much of their story as i could while there was still time.   at that time i had just finished writing a song cycle based on the orpheus &amp; eurydice myth - the tragic story of a man who journeys into the underworld to try to rescue his lover. he is permitted by hades to take her back to the land of the living, but only if he can walk all the way there without once looking back to check if she is following. just before they reach the surface, he loses faith and turns around – tragically losing her forever.   while interviewing flora, i learnt that her and mike had started a jazz club in their twenties called the orpheus club. this strange coincidence inspired a detective mission to trace this story back - i tried to track down any scrap of information about the club and the people who once frequented it. it turned out that the initial coincidence was the first of many – the parallels between their story and the myth were uncanny and wonderful, and what started as an archiving mission grew into an extraordinary exploration of memory, myth and the stories that connect us over time.  so i weaved my grandparents story through the songs i had written about orpheus and eurydice, and made a show, called styx. at its heart, it aims to spread a more nuanced and hopeful understanding of alzheimer’s and dementia, challenge misconceptions, and bring hope in the dark. it encourages audiences to examine their ideas about identity and memory, and to think about the ways the imprints and impacts we make in the world can outlast the decay of our synapses. it also explores the incredible power of music to unite fragments and bring back lost memories.  making this show helped me to reconnect with flora, to accept mike's passing, and to prepare myself emotionally for the coming months and years. it also felt amazing to know that i could immortalise some part of them in my work forever, and that every time we perform the show, their memory takes root in the hearts of others, and can live on through them in some small way. i hope that people with experience of alzheimer's and dementia can also find hope and respite by watching the show!  we did our first run in perth in january, where we won an award, and now we’ve been invited to play at the edinburgh fringe festival in august, and in london in september! i’m thrilled that we have this opportunity to expand this important conversation, and with a bunch of post-show talks and satellite events, i think we’ve got a really exciting programme planned.   if you’re interested in learning more about the show, or coming along to see it, please visit the show's [website]( i’d love to see you all there, i really hope you can make it!   we’re also running a [kickstarter]( at the moment to help cover some of our costs – playing at the fringe is a really expensive venture! we’d be hugely grateful if you could visit the page and consider supporting the show, we need all the help we can get to make it all possible. every pound really helps, and there are also some great rewards on offer.  if you feel inspired to do so, i’d also be incredibly thankful if you could spread the word by sending this story to family and friends. i think we’ve got a really beautiful show here and we want as many people as possible to experience it.  many thanks and all the best with your own journeys!  love, max",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/c2eb36/i_made_a_show_about_losing_my_grandparents_to/,I made a show about losing my grandparents to dementia

"i've hit my limit arguing with my aunt over her refusal to look into assisted living options for my dementia-suffering grandmother. she's had alzheimer's for eight or nine years now, and the signs are getting severe: frequent if not constant anger, outbursts at all hours of day, complete inability to care for herself, slurred and nonsensical speech, verbal abuse and threats, confusion, etc. by all accounts, she's miserable here, and any other sane family would have put her into a home years ago.however, my aunt is denying the facts and the science, insisting that she and her hired helpers can do a better job than trained, licensed professionals in a facility. this aunt claims to have done her research and due diligence, and yet didn't know what conservatorship of a disabled person was - the exact kind of conservatorship she would legally need to look after my grandmother in her condition. further, the ""help"" she hires to look after grandma aren't social workers. they aren't licensed. or trained. some of them didn't even go to *school*. she's putting my severely disabled grandmother in the hands of some ""nice ladies"" she happened to meet. and she's vowing to die on the hill that they're all that grandma needs, and that putting her in a facility is too expensive.my aunt herself is mentally ill. her house is a cluttered hoarder's nest, and many rooms haven't seen an earnest cleaning since god knows when - including the kitchen grandma's meals come from. i had to scrub hard-crusted stains off the oven that i swear were there when i was a *child.* and i'm a grown adult working on my second degree.i've gathered research for her, outlined it in clear bullet points, and sent it to her so she can't escape the facts. i've argued with her, pestered her, threatened to bring social workers down on her. nothing. to her minimal credit, she says she's thinking about going to a workshop to learn about becoming a conservator, but as far as putting grandma in assisted living, nothing. she insists she and the helpers are better for old mom. i imagine this is what kids with anti-vax parents have to deal with: *""we know better than those 'doctors'!

my grandma was diagnosed early last year but we’ve known she’s had dementia for a couple years but she was too stubborn to go to the doctor. she’s currently living in an assisted living home and i visit her as often as i can but it’s wearing on me emotionally. i love her so much and she’s been my best friend since i was little so it’s really hard for me to see her deteriorate. i dread going to visit her now because i know it will just be the same two stories and questions being told/asked to me and it upsets me. i really haven’t talked to anyone about this because i guess i’m just compartmentalizing.," don't overlook having some music on your phone from when she was 20 years old.a few examples:[&#x200b;that way you can start playing a song with ""i just heard this on the radio"" and let it play and see what memories it brings up.things like year of high graduation or wedding are good as often it helps unlock those memories.just smile and let her know you love her. when she asked ""when is dad coming"" no need to explain he passed away thirty years ago, but a simple ""he will be here tomorrow"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bzv4zw/my_88_year_old_grandma_has_lewy_body/,My 88 year old grandma has Lewy body.

"well, i knew it was only a matter of time before my dad would eat cat food. we were at the table eating dinner and for some reason my dad didn’t want our cat eating his cat food. so he picked up the few remaining pieces in his hand. i told him the cat was fine and there was no reason to take his food away. then i asked him what he was going to do with the cat food in his hand and he looks at me and says “i’m going to eat it” and before i could do anything to try and stop him, he just popped the pieces into his mouth. i of course panicked and yelled out “no! you just ate cat food” and i grabbed a napkin and he did spit it out and said oh sorry or something like that. i’m guessing he just got confused since we were at the dinner table eating, but it’s crazy to me how their brain (of lack there of) tells our loved ones to do these things. why did he take the cats food away in the first place? why did he pick the pieces of food up in his hand instead of taking the bowl of food away? and why would he put it in his mouth?*sigh*his diagnosis was official in 2013, but my mom and i both know it started years before that. for the most part these things don’t bother me anymore, it’s just the norm now, but this one was a little hard."," luckily it won't hurt him.  other than being a little gross, it isn't that big of a deal.  i knew things were going downhill when we were at his favorite buffet and we were leaving and he picked up a piece of half eaten cake from a table where they had already left, and plopped it in his mouth.  i was horrified - especially since it's a buffet and he could just get his own piece - but i had to just let it slide.    i'm also a bit of a germaphobe, so my alarms were all going off at once.  :)  we both survived.  i've gotten really good at anticipating what he is thinking and quietly instructing him.  like at christmas he got a big spoonful of mashed potatoes - my head flashed forward to him licking the serving spoon.  so i just said ""get as much as you like, then put the spoon back in the bowl.""  he did and crises averted.  :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bzjcb6/cat_food/,Cat food

"my father and i were finally able to get my 90 year old mother to a neurologist to get a confirmed diagnosis. he saw a recent ct scan and mri and was able to confirm she has what he referred to as mixed dementia, meaning for her alzheimer’s and vascular dementia.  he has prescribed aricept and seroquel and wants her to start physical therapy to help her balance because she has had a couple of serious falls at home. i really like this doctor. he was able to recognize all her symptoms and “heard” my father out even while my mom denied the things he said. he never told my mom she has dementia, but said she has major balance issues and the medication should help and he wants to help her be independent as long as possible. he spoke to me privately and said he’s concerned about her safety at home and recommends a minimum of assisted living but doesn’t believe she needs memory care quite yet. but... when he took me to his office to talk privately, my mom started getting very paranoid and irritated and we ended up leaving with her cursing at the doctor. she yelled and cried most of the way home. we expected the visit to end this way. then, we got home, and i walked into the kitchen and saw my mom with a large bottle of whiskey getting ready to pour herself a drink. my mom is not an alcoholic, but she no longer has any tolerance for alcohol as a result of the dementia. my dad and i have tried to get her to stop drinking. i pleaded with her to not drink and she got mad. i calmly took the bottle from her and started to pour it down the drain. she grabbed my arm, trying to stop me. she is only 5 feet and 100 pounds. i simply kept pouring it out when she bent down and started to bite my arm. she bit me hard enough to break the skin and caused an instant bruise about 2 inches long and almost as wide. i told her i couldn’t believe she hurt me, she has never physically hurt me before. i told my dad what happened and showed him the bite. i grabbed my things and went upstairs where she couldn’t follow due to the stairs. about ten minutes went by while i called my husband then she pleaded with me to come downstairs so she could apologize. i went, reluctantly, and i listened while she told me she would never hurt me again. i do believe her and i insisted she has to stop drinking because she gets so mean and hurtful with even the smallest amount of alcohol. she kept arguing about only drinking a little and i left the room to get back upstairs.  now i am writing this. sorry for the rambling. i know it is very serious that she hurt me. my dad swears she has never hurt him, ... yet. but i am very worried. my dad is almost 93 and is getting very weak and tired. he had a serious fall last week,but was very lucky to not have been seriously injured. i don’t know what is going to happen because she won’t live somewhere else without a major battle."," i have talked to my dad about moving my mom to assisted living and he tells me “not yet.” he wants to keep my mom at home for as long as possible because he knows she will be very resistant to moving elsewhere. as for my dad moving to assisted living, he says he is not ready and he has told my brother that such a move would kill him because he is still so active maintaining the house and yard. my parents have the financial resources necessary to move to assisted living. but i think both of my parents have an outdated perception of what assisted living is like today. they seem to only envision a nursing home environment. i have started requesting brochures from some of the local facilities so that i might get my father to take a tour. i think my dad has been influenced by the doctor’s concern about home safety and after his fall he’s starting to realize how unsafe home is for both him and my mom. he has also been complaining about feeling very tired and weak lately and he’s worried about not being able to get all the chores done. so i am hopeful that i can convince him to move in the not so distant future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bxnasi/finally_a_diagnosis_then_she_hurt_me/,"Finally a diagnosis, then she hurt me"

"apologies in advance, i’m on mobile and tired.three months ago i moved in with my ageing grandparents (70s) under the pretence that i will help take care of them until they are gone and they will leave me the house. my grandfather is in okay health despite being in heart failure after a heart attack in january. he is still active, still sharp as a tack. he drinks to much but he’s working on that. my grandmother on the other hand...three years ago my grandmother was the matriarch of our family. a jolly woman of 300 lbs, she ran a tight ship, hosted a podcast for a distinct special needs group that she had advocated for the past twenty years . she kept up on everyone’s birthdays, she baked as often as she could, would regularly make the hour drive to see her kids grandkids and great grandkids. today my grandmother is under 100lbs, we don’t know how as we’ve gotten her any foods she wants. she lays in bed constantly as she says sitting in a wheel chair hurts her tailbone even with 2 donut pillows (she does get in the wheelchair for about an hour or two for special events like christmas). her once thick salt and pepper hair has almost all fallen out and what is left is frail and white. she will only walk to the bathroom when she absolutely has to, dribbling the whole way. her short term memory is 100% gone. i can tell her “grandma i’ll be back in two hours i have to run to the store, i’ve left your lunch in your mini fridge and the dog is outside” and i will return home to her angry that i’ve left her unattended and she doesn’t know where the dog is and she hasn’t touched her lunch. she claims her feet hurt to walk on because she’s let her toenails grow until they’ve started to curl under.  the major problem is that she absolutely refuses to see a doctor. my grandfather had a nurse from their insurance out to check on both of them and she flipped her damn lid. screaming that he hated her and that there’s nothing wrong with her she’s just old. but we all can see otherwise. we are in washington state and i believe my grandparents are on medicare. i don’t know where to start considering she absolutely refuses to see any medical help.", maybe check with your local visiting nurses agency? they should have a social worker that can help answer any of your questions or concerns about getting someone in the home to check her out and most take medicare.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bw0cmt/im_not_even_sure_where_to_start_hoping_to_find/,"I’m not even sure where to start, hoping to find help."

"my mother-in-law has mid to advanced progressive alzheimer’s. she has been in the general care section of a ltc facility for several years, since she broke her hip and declined both cognitively and physically. over the years, her alzheimer’s has progressed. my sister-in-law (medical proxy) recently decided to move her to another facility because she thought she wasn’t getting good enough care where she was. my husband and i went to visit her in the new place, and found her laying back in a wheel-recliner in front of the nurses station. they put her there because she needs more supervision, but there didn’t seem to be any interaction with her. she was leaning to the side over the arm of the chair. overall, we thought the facility was not as good as the previous one, and the staff seemed less professional. over the course of our visit, my mil repeatedly told us she hated the place and wanted to go back to the old place.we visited on the weekend, and we realize that the schedule is different than during the week. during the week, she’s scheduled to have pt and speech therapy, but those orders will expire in a month. we’re concerned that once they do, they’re just going to keep her propped in the recliner by the nurses station again, but all of the time. in the previous facility, she was in a wheelchair most of the time and could at least scoot around. now she’s confined to the wheel-recliner.we are wondering if it would have been better for my sil to switch her to the memory care unit, rather than to a whole new facility. we don’t have any experience with those sections and wonder if she would have gotten better attention there, than in a general unit in any ltc facility.can you help me understand the pros and cons of memory care vs general care for someone with mid to advanced alzheimer’s, and share your experiences as either family members or people who provide care in ltc facilities? thank you for your input!"," i am an in-home care provider, but regularly work per diem in ltc facilities and memory units.is your mil a ""fall risk""? can she get up from a chair and walk around on her own? i would assume so since you mentioned her broken hip, and the fact that she was leaning over the side of the chair on one of the days you visited. if i had to guess, the reclining wheelchair is so that your mil doesn't try to walk around by herself while unsupervised and cause further injury. also, regular assisted living/ltc facilities are usually larger than memory units, so care providers usually have more residents (sometimes too many) to care for. if your mil has advanced alzheimer's, the memory unit is probably the way to go. the doors are alarmed and locked at all times with a security code to enter or exit, plus the resident/care provider ratio (in my experience) is smaller, so she may get more attention and have a better quality of life.one major downside is that they are *expensive*, and depending on where you live there might be a waiting list to get her in. hope this helps, good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bvyti2/long_term_care_facilities_memory_care_vs_general/,"Long term care facilities: Memory care vs. general care, pros and cons?"
"we are having a perfect storm of problems. my mother (88) has had dementia for several years and the decline is such that she doesn't know i'm her daughter or that my dad is her husband, although she likes us well enough and is quite compliant with us. my dad (80) has been trying to care for her but he is just not equipped to keep her clean (she hates showers and cannot get in and out of the bathtub) and safe (she recently ran into a gate in the yard and lacerated her leg rather badly, necessitating iv antibiotics and wound care). in addition, dad has had a series of medical events and diagnoses that have him facing some daunting treatment.  my husband and i flew in from out of state to try to manage things temporarily. they have some home care (temporarily 24/7 during the current crisis) but my sincere belief is that mom needs to be in a facility to be safe and clean and healthy. we are planning to fly mom home with us, where fortunately we can manage some home care for her in the short term while we try to get her into facility care. we don't know whether we will be able to transfer dad's treatment to where we are so he will stay home for now with a lower level of home care (he mostly just needs meals/groceries prepped or picked up, medication reminders, and rides to doc appointments).ideally, if his care can be moved to where we are we would bring him to us as well so that we could manage his care. he would probably not need to move to assisted living.any recommendations for flying with my mom? short flight, just over 2 hours. i plan to ask her doctor for a letter explaining that she needs her travel companion to remain with her due to dementia. anyhow. i need someone to talk me in off the ledge a bit. i am at the ragged edge of my ability to deal with this. she is at the point where she often says that she wants to ""go home"" but of course she's in the house she's lived in for more than 50 years. they don't see many people anymore, many of the old neighbors having moved away or passed on, and if she were in our neck of the woods we couldn't least see her, and a facility would provide some social interaction that home care just isn't giving here. i'm sad and angry and frightened.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bvo6e3/bringing_mom_to_my_state_to_find_a_facility_that/,Bringing Mom to my state to find a facility that can care for her

"hey all, been a little bit of time since i posted.some things have been fixed a bit with my mom, but other problems have begun to worsen. my mom doesn't sleep at night. if we're lucky she'll get a couple hours of sleep, and then it begins. she will get up, wander, use the restroom constantly, make herself toast, and get confused and think it's time to wake up. she'll wake my dad up and angrily tell him it's time to get up. she'll rummage aimlessly in her closet and drawers, looking for something, but never anything she can remember. she's often aggressive and volatile. my dad and i have both stated that it's like she turns into another person entirely. this didn't used to happen every night, and it wasn't this bad. it is now *every* night, and she has recently begun having delusions that go along with it. if my dad accidentally touches her in his sleep, she becomes convinced *for hours* that he assaulted her. if he opts to sleep on the couch in the living room, she leaves their bedroom every minute or two to shuffle out into the living room and stare at him. last night was a bad one. my dad ended up arguing/yelling at 11 at night (he has to wake up at about 5:30 every morning for work), and after that, she eventually believed that he was going to harm her (he would not and has never laid a hand on her.) mom walked up and down the hallway for hours, kept locking and then opening her bedroom door, and just looked... crazy. we're tired. i feel guilty going to bed when i know she's awake and wandering, but also feel it shouldn't be my responsibility to lose out on sleep. i have to be awake by the time he leaves in the morning to watch her, and then i have classes - we both need sleep. the neighbors are constantly calling and texting me to tell me that she's falling asleep when she's out with them and that i have to ""get my dad in line."" i'm exhausted, i'm drained, i'm angry. we don't know what to do. we just started her on a new medication a week ago, but so far there is no change. essential oils to calm her down don't work. melatonin never worked. i advised against sleeping pills because of how confused she gets. there are days i want to strap her down to her bed. is there anyone here who found success with getting someone to sleep? i saw a horror story about someone who's loved one only slept 1 hour every day. i'm afraid my dad could be losing it. i'm afraid for both of us. he doesn't research and plan ahead for this as i try and do, and i feel like she's solidly in the 6th stage already. thanks for reading all the way through. oftentimes i write these when i get a brief moment in class or at home, and so i don't edit things down like i should."," i don't have any experience in the same exact situation regarding sleep, but my mom has had a lot of the very anxious symptoms (pacing around, constantly opening drawers looking for things , paranoia). it's been really difficult to cope with. i was feeling like we had completely run out of options, but recently i've been reading a lot about the positive effect of cbd on dementia patients in relieving their anxiety, helping them to sleep, and even making them think more clearly. i asked my mom's doctor, he said he didn't know enough about it and couldn't recommend (they have to say that), so i did a lot more reading online and on reddit and learned that lots of people are having really positive experiences with cbd improving the mood of their relatives with dementia. i decided to order some and try my mom on a small dose of 10mg a day, so far... i have to say, i think she's much calmer and happier. it's only been about 10 days so this is very new, but like others i feel that this is really helping. maybe it's worth trying? its not even legal in the uk but lots of health store places do sell it now, so i bought some gummy bears with cbd oil in. so far i'm feeling like it's making a difference. if i can be of any more help to you just let me know, feel free to send me a message at any time at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/buyg3f/we_are_a_very_sleepdeprived_household/,We are a very sleep-deprived household.

[ &amp;#x200b;unlike mice designed to have an alzheimer's-like disease, humans with alzheimer's disease have far fewer activated microglia (the brain's main immune cells) as the disease progresses.  so neuroinflammation is probably not much of a factor during the later stages of alzheimer's disease.in addition, caspase-3 activation appears to play a critical role in both the initial activation and death of microglia.  it also plays a role in the death of neurons.  and it also contributes to the initial cut in the amyloid precursor protein (by bace-1).  the initiator of caspase-3 activation in alzheimer's disease is peroxynitrite (onoo-).&amp;#x200b; [ (albeit in spinal cord injuries) [ &amp;#x200b;for awhile misfolded amyloid (and tau proteins) and neuroinflammation contribute to oxidative stress in alzheimer's disease but that stress both precedes them and is in part independent of them.  to put it simply, most of the treatments being tested for alzheimer's disease are not focusing on the primary causes of the disease's pathogenesis."," i'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:- [/r/earlyonsetdementia] [reconsidering neuroinflammation in alzheimer's disease](&nbsp;*^(if you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([info](/r/totesmessenger) ^/ ^[contact](/message/compose?to=/r/totesmessenger))*",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bug82e/reconsidering_neuroinflammation_in_alzheimers/,Reconsidering Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease

(my dad is usually at work so he usually isn't there to help me out, but he always sides with here anyway so it wouldn't matter)i'm really struggling at the moment as i am constantly being blamed for not telling her about my doctors appointments, times and dates, information, ect, even though i tell her multiple times. along with this (not sure if it's related or not) she never wants to talk to me, always telling me to 'stop talking in busy'. i understand that she might think she's busy, but lately it's been happening with small stuff. today she told me to 'shut up' while we were at bunnings looking at the pot plants! i was trying to talk about the pot plants! i know that sometimes i can be annoying, (i have a type of  aspergers) but it really hurts when she says things like that.she constantly misplaced things and never trusts me because she thinks i'm stealing them. she thinks i'm yelling at her when i'm barely raising my voice (she can't hear me sometimes if i don't raise it). and whenever there's an argument she comes back 15 minutes later as if nothing happened, and gets angry that i'm upset. also anything that goes wrong is my fault, especially with electronics, and i never get thanked for fixing stuff. she constantly tells me off for not helping her around the house, but i do all of my own washing, ironing, cleaning, and a lot of the rest of the family's too, along with washing dishes, packing and unpacking the dishwasher, and cleaning the house. she doesn't believe me when i tell her and is obsessed with everything being clean, so if she sees a speck of dust she vacuums the whole house (she cleans the whole house at least once a day then wonders why she never has any time).this is made worse by the fact she refuses to let me show her how to use things properly to make it easier and faster, and yells at me when i try.she has been told by doctors that her memory is starting to fail but she ""doesn't think it's that bad yet"" and that i'm 'overreacting'.  she can take care of myself and my 2 younger sisters (they are both still in school, i'm the only adult child at the moment) so she doesn't need a carer or anything yet, but i'm worried about what will happen when i move out (i'm living with them but pretty much take care of myself).what should i do? any tips on dealing with this(emotionally)?thanks all who've ready this far, sorry for the long post."," if you & your dad can figure a way to get your mom to the doctor, there’s medicine that can help stabilize her moods. the doctor can also look her over and see where her dementia stands now.  talk to your dad and explain how she is, tell him that your mom would feel so much better if she was calmer.  really play it up that you’re trying to make your mom feel better. i hope it works. hugs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/btw9jf/false_dementia_accusations/,False dementia accusations?
"my grandma is 87 and was just diagnosed with dementia after honestly a couple years of symptoms and also having pretty well every risk factor in the book. she still lives alone. she has four children but my mom has been doing probably 3/4 of the care and is getting burnt out. i’m an rn with some background in dementia, but i also live several hours away. now that she has the diagnosis, my aunt and uncles are finally seeming to take things more seriously, looking into long term care homes, etc., but they are also clueless. i’ve just gotten them to agree to have a sit down family discussion about what dementia is, what it means for grandma, and what we need to be doing to help her. my questions to you are: what would you have wanted to know ahead of time about the disease itself? what resources have helped you the most? what were you too afraid to ask? what is something that you would have done differently in the early stages if you could do it again?"," i’m certainly no expert (not a medical professional, nor was i the primary caregiver), but my grandmother passed away from dementia when i was in high school and since then (i’m in my twenties now), i have volunteered in memory care centers, hanging out and helping out residents with all stages and all forms of dementia. here are a few little things that i have discovered and i wish i had known to help improve overall quality of life. people don’t usually pay attention to little stuff, but the little things make a daily difference. one thing that is very small but so, so underrated/overlooked is the importance of finding small tasks and activities that involve some measure of recall or muscle memory for your grandma to do. this doesn’t have to be a big thing, one of the residents at the retirement home i visit will sit with her daughter and take turns spelling different words. my grandmother’s in-home caretaker would have her sit and help fold laundry. we often play simple boardgames and card games with our residents. one of our more able bodied residents helps pull weeds in our raised flowerbeds. many of our residents still knit or crochet. this is totally anecdotal, but i have found this helps stimulate and challenge them in small ways, which improves their overall recall and mood. also, don’t underestimate the power of music. find some of your grandma’s favorite artists from when she was young, make a spotify playlist of favorite songs and have someone play it for her. even if it only lasts for a few seconds, it is amazing how much listening to old music lights up a dementia patient! this can even be done when she’s in more advanced stages. and one more thing, not for your grandma, but for your mom. take care of whoever is the primary caretaker (sounds like it’s your mom right now). caring for a loved one with dementia is not only time consuming, mentally, fiscally, and even physically taxing, but also one of the most emotionally taxing things a person will ever go through. make sure she is alright and has time to herself once in a while. take care of yourself too. dementia sucks wind. it’s okay to be sad. it’s okay to be angry even. it’s okay to be uncomfortable. it might be the saddest, most frustrating thing your family faces, but you will make it through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/btv3r6/what_would_you_want_to_know/,What would you want to know?

"a lot of this is venting something that’s been on my mind heavy. any advice or kind words would be appreciated. tl;dr: my grandmothers mental and physical state is worsening, my short fused father is her main caregiver and it’s creating a toxic environment for dad grandma and my brother who lives with them. my dads nearby sister and out of state brother provide little to no help other than financially. my grandmother is 85 and i’ve been told by family that she has dementia. i lived with her my dad and my younger brother until last year, i moved out and they are still with her. she doesn’t speak english and i have a hard time communicating with her past basic conversation. a few years ago she started having more memory loss with just like not remembering the day or where she put things or leaving food on the stove. she began taking some medication that gave her angry mood swings (again something that i was told) where she would become very suspicious of us and blaming us for things that were missing. we’ve always had a kind of rocky relationship and i felt that i was getting the worst of it, one of the last straws being her accusing me of stealing $600 from her. from when i moved out almost a year ago i have noticed that she has become more confused. she started to confuse my dad for my uncle who lives in another state. she went through a period of believing my brother and i had another baby sibling also by my brothers name. she has had a couple of episodes, once standing at the front door and refusing to let my brother leave because she believed he stole her keys. she has now been confusing my dad with my late grandfather. he passed almost 2 years ago and she had refused to speak to him for many years. he was abusive to her and cheated on her  throughout their marriage until he left her. she now has aides that come in about 6 hours a day on the weekdays while my dad is working. a new younger woman came one day when my dad was working from home. grandma had an episode claiming she got home that day and found my dad and the aide having sex on the dining table and called her all kinds of names, claimed they were trying to poison her and screamed outside for help. my father recently eloped with a woman who works in the neighborhood that my grandma has known for years. they came home with lunch and plans for the 3 of them for the day but my grandma said she didn’t know who she was and demanded that she leave. my dad is the middle child and has a sister who is about 30 minutes away and a brother in another state. his sister (my aunt) has started spending the night once a week because my dad has been sleeping on a pull out couch in the living room for when my grandma needs help walking to the bathroom, so she comes once a week to give him a break. grandma also sometimes needs him to help her get dressed after using the bathroom. he says he wakes up 2-3 times every night. he loves to bike and isn’t able to go for rides after work like he used to because he needs to get home for my grandmas aide to leave. he has a short temper in general and him and my grandma would often get into yelling fights, or he would just get angry when she couldn’t find something and insisted she knew where it was. when i visited the day that she threw out his new wife, he was helping her into a chair and she asked me where my dad was. he immediately brought himself closer to her ear and yelled that he was my dad and that he was not her husband. i said she is confused. we had just talked 10 minutes before and she had already forgot. she said she cooked something and would give it to me and my mother before we left (she didn’t cook and my mother wasn’t there). she began asking me what i got for christmas and where i spent it (this was a week ago and we always spend it together) when i was finishing school (i dropped out 3 years ago). he said that he thinks sometimes she is confused but sometimes she knows exactly what she is doing and threw out his wife on purpose to have him alone, that she sometimes needed help getting dressed but other times *somehow* knew how to dress herself. throwing out his new wife seemed to be the last straw and he said it had him considering putting her in a nursing home. i think he is completely worn out and resenting her for everything he has to do. my dad is already not the type of person to be caring for an elderly person. he doesn’t have the patience or a nurturing kind of personality yet he is doing it 6-7 days a week. i think my aunt and uncle need to be doing more to put less responsibility on him. i’m the first person to understand feeling impatient and irritated with her but having the time away makes it infinitely more easy to be patient when i visit her. i would hate to see her be put in a home and i know she would hate it too but i think they all may be better off, including my brother who barely spends time at home to avoid the drama between the two of them. he yells at her and she doesn’t even have the capacity to understand why anymore and it’s been eating at me for the past few days. i want to bring her some kind of activity to do but her hands are also weak so i don’t know what would be good. i don’t know if it’s too much to want my aunt to spend more days there to care for her. any advice would be helpful.", one question which comes up here in the

"my 85 year old mother has her mind but requires a walker to move. her judgement is not great. she was living with my unmarried brother (there are three of us) in a paid for home that was her's until he had it put in his named. she fell and broke her ankle and stayed like that for 10 days. i had gone over there and she never mentioned her ankle until it got so bad she had to tell me. he never leaves her side when we visit. our family dynamic is me, married 37 years, another unmarried brother who is a recovering alcoholic and cannot handle any kind of stress, and an unmarried brother who she lived with in a paid for house that he had transferred into his name. my father died and she has no siblings. besides her broken ankle, they also found bedsores when she got to the hospital. please, i am not here for judgement, only answers. my wife did some major string pulling to get her into a first rate nursing home close to us and central to two brothers. my wife is working to get her on medicaid so she can stay there. my mother thinks she can leave when her ankle has healed, around 6 weeks. i threaten my brothers that if they take her out i will pursue elder abuse. i only have the one in her home to worry about really. i have pics of her ankle, bedsores, an earlier wound to he toe (she is diabetic) that had gotten infected, which is why we moved her to my home until my brother slipped in and took her back after 9 months, and the conditions of her house. sorry for the run on question, i have early onset dementia myself. how can we keep her there without empty threatens? thanks"," from your description, she should not go live with your brother again as there is obviously abuse and neglect going on there.  also, i would call adult protective services since it appears, from your description, there may be financial exploitation going on as well.&#x200b;if your mom is not competent enough for self-care and managing her money and assets, you'll need to look into a guardianship and maybe a conservatorship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/brjxq8/having_someone_committed/,Having someone committed
"my father is 47 turning 48 this year. i’m 20.my father is a completely different person than he was just a few years ago, and he’s very clearly mentally deteriorating. i suspected that he might suffer from a personality disorder, but now i’m thinking that it might be dementia.he has these symptoms: memory loss- sometimes he forgets what was said just 5 minutes before. he developed a recent habit of getting in my face to talk to me and i don’t like it because i like my personal space. i have told him to stop several times in the past but because he did it again, i screamed stop. he threw a tantrum and started screaming and cursing at me. then he said that i screamed “get the fuck out of my face” when i literally only screamed “stop.” my mom was there to verify this happened, and then he claimed that we conspire against him and will lie for each other. this isn’t true, it’s just ridiculous. he couldn’t appear more confused when we tried to explain to him that that’s not what happened. similar incidents have occurred in the past, but this is the first time i’ve seen him forget something that occurred literally minutes before. difficulty with visual and spatial abilities, such as getting lost while driving- yes. especially driving. as of late we have noticed that he needs to use a gps to get home although we’ve been to/returned a particular location without a gps in the past. he has also started taking unusual routes to get home that we have never taken before, even though we have taken our typical route all our lives.misplacing things- all the time. misplaces hats, keys, etc. loses self control and will often scream and become agitated if he can’t find things. that’s about it for cognitive changes. the personality changes are the most significant.personality changes- he now describes himself as “anal” on a daily basis. he never described himself as anal before and nobody would describe him as anal, either. suddenly he has felt the need for exact change, such as a $10 bill rather than two $5 bills. if he’s paying for a $10 item with a $20 bill, and the item comes out to $10.50, he will ask the cashier to put a small item back until his purchase is exactly $10. he was never like this before, nor would he have ever did this. the cashier was getting visibly annoyed but he wouldn’t stop. depression- he has this sense that everyone hates him or dislikes him, and i think it makes him depressed. he is rarely smiling, rarely happy. he doesn’t like to participate in recreational activities (he even recently said he doesn’t know what “fun” is) and he will never leave the house to do anything but to run errands or go to work. if either me or my mom try to get him to go with us somewhere, it becomes an argument. agitation- a fight will start at the drop of a pin. he throws temper tantrums and has no control over his emotions. again, this is relatively new behavior. he acts like he has the emotional control of a teenager or even a child than that of a fully grown adult. he takes everything as a personal attack and will resort to insulting his loved ones if he feels like he’s the victim of an attack. hallucinations- possibly. there was an incident last year where he was sick but refused to see a doctor because he said he hates doctors. in the past he never had an issue with seeing a doctor, but this time, it took arguments that lasted for days until he finally went. in the meantime he was saying things like “i don’t have much time left” because he truly thought he was going to die. it worsened when he said that he could no longer swallow his food because he would begin to choke. when he finally went to the doctor with this problem, he wasn’t diagnosed with anything. they said he was perfectly fine. all of a sudden he was able to swallow again and he bounced back within a day. i realize this isn’t a hallucination, but the “illness” was definitely created in his head. is this enough for him to see a doctor? my mom began to cry at the thought because he had some symptoms. it’s heartbreaking and painful for all of us. it’s like he’s an entirely different person. nobody could ever even conceive of bringing this up to him because he will throw a tantrum.", he sounds almost exactly like my dad who has behavioral variant frontotemporal demential (ftd).  many doctors misdiagnoses it as schizophrenia. see if these symptoms sound familiar:[,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/brg7m1/does_this_sound_like_a_case_of_early_onset/,Does this sound like a case of early onset Dementia?

"hi everyone,my dad is 70 years old and i’m not sure if he has a mental illness such as borderline personality disorder, the beginning stages of dementia or the beginning stages of alzheimer’s. let me explain the situation. we moved as a family from los angeles to dallas in 2014. my mother became ill and lapsed into three comas from late 2014- and then passed away in july 2016. while my mother was in comas, my younger brother stole over 100,000 from my parents checking and savings accounts. i kept wondering why my father said he was broke all of the time and we finally realized my brother was stealing. shortly after my mom passed, my father went bats#it insane and called my mom’s family in l.a. one thing led to another and the court served him with two restraining orders. three months after my mother died, my dad started dating a woman he met at work. take into consideration my parents had been married for forty years. my dad dated this woman all of 2 months and told me and my brother that they were getting married and she was moving in. i immediately called my aunt, who flew out to texas and was able to talk some sense into my father. my dad has been obsessed with leaving dallas since my mother died. my fiancé and i were having to coordinate his whole move, with no help from my brother, but the worst part of the experience was the repetitious conversations about where we were going to move. i counted 57 times that i had to explain to my father that the house had to sell before we could even travel to the destinations we had chosen. it got so bad, that i became chronically depressed and it’s been hard to kick the depression. i am the one child who helps my father out with things he can no longer process, and instead of getting angry at my brother who almost bankrupted him, he goes off on me. three nights ago, he told my fiancé that if i didn’t let him borrow $500 for a home mortgage processing fee, he would throw me out of the house. my fiancé told me that five minutes later he came back upstairs, apologized, and said he didn’t understand why he was acting in that manner. he is usually rude to me, or overly emotional, where he will start crying, which can be awkward for me. i have been a social worker for many years but i mainly dealt with ptsd with co-occurring disorders. i believe he shows classic signs of bpd . he has emotionally turbulent relationships, he is erratic, he fears abandonment, he is ambivalent, he has shifting goals, he has been suicidal, has wild mood swings, feels empty, angered and loses his temper. bpd is rare in males, and because of his recent short and long term memory loss, i’m not sure if it’s bpd with dementia, or what his diagnosis might be? he will often forget to complete a task and blame me. my fiancé and i have been sticking around here because my brother still lives with my dad, stole 100 grand and texted me death threats against my dad. i was in houston and had to tell my dad to immediately leave the home. my dad refuses to throw my brother out. my dad also has tons of firearms and he has pointed a loaded gun at my brother, and has threatened to kill himself. yes, he sees a shrink, but the shrink isn’t helping and when i suggest getting therapy and a new shrink, he just shines me on. at this point i know he needs an evaluation. if it’s alzheimer’s, dementia, or severe mental illness, or all of the above, he needs help. for my own well being, i believe that i need to exit his home but only after i know it’s safe. can anyone relate to this?", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/br7vi8/help_for_my_father_70_years_old_m_very_serious/,"Help for my Father [70 years old, M] Very Serious!"

"my wife and had big plans.  we were training to ride motorcycles around the world, and then, at one point, her progress stopped and even went backwards.  and not just in this one aspect of our life, but everywhere (e.g., cooking, driving, family finances, and so on).  we tried all sorts of lifestyle, diet, cleansing, and supplements before we finally determined that she had some sort of mci going on.  it took while longer before we had to finally surrender to the reality that she had early onset alzheimers, then, at 48 years old.  she was a yoga instructor, a health nut, and only ate non-processed organic foods, and yet, she was now dealing with perhaps the most miserable disease that we know of.  after caring for her for years, and then having in home care, we reached a point where i could no longer care for her in the home.  my next challenge was to find a facility that, in my conscience, i could trust to take awesome care of my beloved wife.  and at the same time, it had to be affordable. as you know, medical insurance is of no help and we did not have long term disability/care insurance.  it was almost by accident that i finally became aware of an amazing place in san miguel de allende, mexico.  it was truly a god send.  please let me share this little video as a way of introducing you to this place.[sincerely,  james",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bpmyxx/affordable_assisted_living_and_memory_care/,Affordable Assisted Living and Memory Care
"well it’s been a bit rough the last couple of months so not a lot to smile about but right now i’m on a road trip with mum to see some of her far away friends and she has come up with some fun ones.yesterday on the ferry she suddenly said out of nowhere “i haven’t even yet” when i asked her what was it she hadn’t yet, she replied “put my toe on my toe” neither of us could figure that one out.mum has also developed rem sleep behaviour disorder which causes her to moan, scream and yell in her sleep. i was a bit nervous about travelling with this, but the doc prescribed some extra meds and we chose to stay in a hotel rather than alarm her friends. our first night was quiet until six am when mum finally started to talk. it wasn’t yelling or anything this time. instead she had a two hour happy conversation with someone. she laughed and chattered away till my alarm but the funny thing was she talked all that time without moving her face. to see what i mean , try it. talk only with your vocal chords. no tongue or lip movement. it’s hilarious especially if it is a happy bubbly conversation peppered with giggling. i was quite entertained."," it’s so important to take time away from focusing on the more difficult parts of dementia and take a moment to laugh at some of the funnier things. thanks for sharing :)edit: my nan had lewy body and my grandad was talking about the radiation treatment he had for his cancer to my mum, and couldn’t remember the word ‘radiation’. he said, “what’s that life-saving thing again?”, and my nan replied “shepard’s pie?” (what they had for dinner the night before). my nan passed over a year ago and my family still have a giggle at that one. if someone asks a question one of us will randomly reply, “shepard’s pie?”.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bpf0in/the_lighter_side_of_dementia_part_3/,The Lighter Side Of Dementia part 3

"it’ll only get worse from here on out but as of now i just can’t handle it. i’m a college student who spends majority of the day with my grandma, who has dementia. it all started about 5 years ago but i’m at the point where i just can’t handle it anymore. i get so much anxiety and stress being around her or even just being in the house. she accuses me of stealing her money, jewelry, and other miscellaneous items. she calls her friends on the phone and basically talks badly about me and my family for mistreating her (not giving her meds, giving her meals, lying to her) all these years and even now, when none of that is true. some times she upfront tells me i “mistreat”, when i’m the one caring for her majority of the time. i try to tune it all out but, i can’t anymore and it really hurts. i don’t know if it’s because i’m young and immature to handle this but is all so emotionally and mentally draining. i don’t know what to do."," as her primary care giver it looks like it's going to be up to you to figure out your/her next step.  i am so sorry your family has put you in this position.  they're probably not going to do anything because you are there to look after her. you also need regular breaks from the responsibility.  i know how it can be, you start almost believing all the horrible things said to your face.  i know i'll end up in therapy after living with/supporting my parents.  you need to call her health insurance company and ask them for a rundown of her benefits so that you can figure out either how to get a care giver in there a few times per week, to give you a break, or move her to a care facility.  if you need power of attorney, ask your family members, or find out if your family consistently has used a specific lawyer, over the years....maybe whomever did her will?  you need that lawyer to help you start the power of attorney process. there is health and there is financial power of attorney.  also, contact your local memory care facilities in the town you live in and tell them your situation.  talk to them about what your options are.  also look for caregiver support groups for yourself.    you shouldn't have been in this position for this long.  this is detrimental to your mental health.  it's a shame you aren't getting any support, but it sounds like you're going to have to find it your own.  i'm so sorry your family is doing this to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bp4jpm/really_dont_know_what_to_do/,Really don’t know what to do

"my (44) dad (76) has been showing cognitive decline in the past several years. the main symptom by far has been memory loss. he is still pretty sharp about some topics, but i'll hear the same story and get asked the same questions again and again. he doesn't seem to be showing other symptoms, such as getting lost, and his vocabulary is still pretty good. he seems to be able to do his regular tasks, such as making coffee etc. he thrives best when he can stick to a regular routine and be in familiar places.his memory loss symptoms are becoming quite noticeable and it has got me thinking about the future for the sake of my mom (76) who would be/is his primary caregiver. this issue is that he is deep in denial, and i can tell he works hard to hide his issues/confusion (i.e. he will change subjects, dominate the conversation, or go quiet etc. in order to avoid showing his lack of memory about certain things). because of the responsibilities he holds (including overseeing their finances, and doing all the financial investing), i think that the next step is some sort of medical assessment. they live part time in a small community, where the local clinic did do some sort of short cognitive test last year that apparently showed he was ""fine"". however, my mom (who is dealing with her own issues around denial) did not get the results directly or follow up with that doctor. we got the results through him, so i'm not sure how accurate what we heard is. they share a family doctor in a larger nearby city where they live for the rest of the year, and he gets check ups with this doctor, but my mom has not yet taken to time to alert their doctor about this. obviously that previous test was not comprehensive enough, and i feel that the next step is a proper assessment so we have a better idea of what might be happening. however, how do we convince him to get such testing? and also convince my mom to take a more active role in tracking his health?"," your father is in the very early stages,it's vital you find a way to have him assessed,try explain to your mum the sooner he can be assessed the sooner any recommended treatment can start,catching it early is vitali am not sure which country you reside in so it's difficult to give precise advice,i live in the uk and from what i read on here treatment and diagnosis are very different",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/botuq2/dealing_with_stubborn_parents/,Dealing with stubborn parent(s)
"in 2007, my wife began to manifest symptoms, odd behaviors (increasing incrementally), and struggling mental health.  since then, she has developed severe addictions to medications (initially pain relievers and sleep aids) and she came to enable addiction in one of our daughters.  over time, she began to isolate more and more, withdrawing from all of her friendships and social engagements, except for the enabling of our addicted daughter.  epilepsy, depression, anxiety, paranoia, ptsd, addiction, and fibromyalgia all became her rallying cries.  we spent fortunes on doctors, residential treatments, counseling (psychiatric and marriage), not to mention various extensive treatments for ptsd (neurofeedback), and nothing helped.  in 2015, thinking it might be alzheimer’s, she underwent the standard neuropsychological testing regimen, and the local neuropsych said that she had mild cognitive dysfunction, but that the inconsistencies of the test outcomes suggested psychiatric issues.  two years of psychiatric work followed, with absolutely no progress and continuing increases in dysfunction.  that test was repeated in 2017, with the same neuropsych telling us to get a different psychiatrist. i could not stop the destructive (addiction) and dysfunctional activities, so i separated from her and obtained a legal separation (at this point, i was being “harmed” by her addiction and fraudulent activities).  i continue to provide all of her living needs (home, car, insurance, food, utilities, etc.), and see her regularly, but have gone on with my life, forming a new relationship with a woman who is healthy and supportive of my situation.about five years ago, i read a “white paper” about frontotemporal dementia and brought it up with her care community, and it was brushed off.  i have come to understand that our local community does not have any real awareness or expertise with respect to ftd, and i am really angry that we spent thousands of dollars and thousands of hours chasing what turned out to be incorrect diagnosis and treatments.  and i now know that i might have been able to be more helpful had we been able to access good information.in essence, the lack of intelligent, competent expertise contributed to the destruction of our family, and now, finding out, from experts far from home, that this is ftd, feels like such a failure, for me, and for my family.  it is just awful!  dealing with the disease is bad enough, but being told it is a dozen other issues, and thinking all these years that she could “choose to do things differently” when she was, in fact, losing her mind, is the ultimate angry resolution, for me and my adult children.it is simply a shitty failure, at all levels, and for a medical community that constantly talks up it’s acumen, intelligence, and brags about being the ‘best in the world’ i say an angry “fuck you”!"," you are a wonderful person for continuing to support her and for choosing another partner. my uncle basically used my ftd multiple substance abusing aunt as his rape doll because he was a violent drunk. she only got inpatient care, finally, when she had locked herself in the bathroom to get away from a man she no longer recognized and the fire department had to be called. only then did anything get done. there is so much misinformation about this disease and so little help dealing with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bojaom/our_ftd_storyour_family_has_been_on_the_long/,"Our FTD Story-Our family has been on the long, difficult, and unknown road to FTD, for twelve horrible years.

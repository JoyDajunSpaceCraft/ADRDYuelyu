"my 62 year old step mother has been recently diagnosed with picks. she was a brilliant woman, with the ability to speak 9 different languages and had earned 3 doctorates. unfortunately, pick's has taken that all away from her. i have watched the most intelligent woman i know lose everything.my dad is having difficulty dealing with the situation. he is a very independent, practical and at times impatient person, this ordeal will test every part of him.right now, he is mostly worried about being able to contract/care for her while he isn't around. she is still fairly functional and in control of her independence, but we know those days are coming to an end. she already is frustrated by her cell phone and can't remember how to use it at times.we want a very simple cell phone from which she can press a few large buttons and it will call numbers we have already pre-assigned. i have exhausted all my google-fu looking for something that will work and fit her life.can anyone offer any options?"," i installed the android app [big launcher]( paid version ($10). you can experiment plenty with the demo version, and for some folks the demo version  does the trick, but the paid version allows much more customization. it's not perfect...there's a lot more i wish it could/would do/customize, but it's still pretty amazing. i envy you, in being able to start implementing solutions while your stepmom is still fairly functional. my granddad, 94 (& grandmother nearing 95, and i guess my mom for that matter) were in denial about my grandmother's progressing dementia, and it took a broken hip & hospitalization to get it diagnosed and ""treated."" even after that, he expected her to come home and carry on as before, but it was a disaster, and now she's in a nursing home, and he's at home but visiting most days. he says over and over that he's not cut out for this...he was a sergeant in the army (wwii) and is used to giving orders and moving quickly, not being patient, not trying to ""interpret"" or troubleshoot and not interested in any namby-pamby/touchy-feely solutions. i have to admit that the phone is still not in use, but in my case it's because the very concept of a cell phone is foreign to my grandmother (even though my granddad has had a flip phone for years), never mind one with a touch/swipe screen. she's gotten the hang of big launcher itself, but the steps of pushing a button and,swiping to start, swiping to answer (to add insult to injury, the phone i bought has a picky swipe screen and if she swipes in the wrong direction she ends up in the wrong place), tapping instead of pressing, and not wrapping her fingers onto the screen...(i recently bought a case that helps with the last problem, and i'm going to try outlining the ""back"" button with nailpolish...). if anyone knows of an android phone that doesn't require swiping... or of a  normal-looking phone that can be plugged into/powered by a cell phone... (say, one of those large-button corded phones where numbers have been replaced by photos/names, but connected to a cellphone instead of a wall jack... they've figured out how to connect keyboards, mice, game controllers to cell phones, so why not a telephone-shaped phone?anyway, hateboss, i hope that big launcher is a solution that works for you/your stepmom.

"hi all, my first reddit post :-)i'm here for some help / advice please. my mum has been recently diagnosed, we dont know what type yet, we are waiting on a pet scan result to tell us more. i got married in august and mum was a little stressed / anxious leading up to it. we all thought it was mother of the bride syndrom! as i am an only child also, and all her tests came back clear, the doctor gave her some anxiety medication. things like her mood etc. improved. there was still a little things she would forget but not alot. now the wedding is over and things have gone backwards, her consultant thinks it is dementia and we are waiting to see what type?any of you who have had a parent with this? how do you digest the information? i feel like bursting out in tears the whole time, and cannot stop thinking about 10 years down the line. it's breaking my heart, i'm constantly worrying about her. my dad told me today the doctor has said not to let her go to town on her own - she is only 60 - how can this been?those of you who have been there? how do you cope with this?any advice? how do you live your own life without feeling guilty that they are at home and their normal routine is effected? thanks all."," very similar to me, 64 yo mum diagnosed a couple of months ago and i also had the same reaction! crying and my brain leaping 10 years into the future. it's tough. i feel so guilty a lot of the time, and have had to take a lot of deep breaths!allow yourself to have this reaction, try not to research too much until you feel ready (i wasn't, and didn't touch google for at least a couple of months), talk to friends, rely on people, talk to close family friends and tell them you / your mum needs support. i was surprised how many of my mum's friends had wanted to help but didn't want to intrude. tell them to intrude. call them. not sure whether my advice will be very good, as i'm still working things out myself, but feel free to pm me if you would like to vent to someone in a very similar situation. at the very least, i know how it feels!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3serdj/help_advice_in_dealing_with_a_recently_diagnosed/,Help / Advice in Dealing With A Recently Diagnosed Mum

"tl;dr at end, as this can be a long story... i need advice on what to do with my nana (dads mom). my family is a bit of a broken one, but we all have our issues... i really only have my mom and my dad and hey, thats really all ill need. everyone else in my family (grandmas, and uncles) are either drug addicts, alcoholics, or have allowed money to tear us apart. my parents do very well for themselves. my dad took over his fathers company, but long story short, technically my nana did some really shitty stuff, kicked me, my sister, mom and dad out of my grandpas trust fund and kept the company to herself. she ran it to the ground, my dad started his own company and took his clients with him and made something out of nothing. before he got back on his feet though, my nana made sure that she made my parents bleed any way she could, and i can honestly say she has done some horrific things that i have only learned of within the past 3 years. it doesnt help that my dads brother is hooked on drugs and manipulates her to give him money from the trust. my point in telling you this is to portray the frustration and anger my parents have built up for this woman. she is kinda truly evil, and selfish but....she now lives alone, in what seems to be an empty shell of her former life, and she has some major mental issues that no one has diagnosed her with... my uncle has stolen all of her valuables, and she has just shy of $250,000 left with a mortgage she has not been paying for the past 8 months.... so she should be evicted... she cant remember day to day... when i go to bring her food, she cant remember the day, when i last visited, or what im doing with my life. although she will give me the run around to make it seem like she doesnt have memory problems. she will talk to herself right infront of me, but its usually dialogue between her and another person like my dad, financial adviser, or whatever (but theyre not really there). when i ask her why shes talking to herself, shell make up something and say ""oh i was just mentioning this food is hot!"" even though i can hear her.... when i test her memory, she gets very agitated when i wont let her give me the run around and i insist on a specific answer she should know. my uncle has also stolen her car (although she really shouldnt drive). she never leaves her place, and stacks all of her furniture up against the door when i leave. everytime i have to shove my way in. she retains some things in her memory like her mom passing away recently, and my sister having a child, but she also thinks her sister is alive when she died about 13 years ago (before she went crazy). my mom and dad have tried countless times to get her to the doctor, and got really close to getting her to be evaluated, but as soon as she heard psychiatric exam she called the doctor a quack and never went back. they have no idea how to get her diagnosed or how to get anyone to help. we were hoping that once she was evicted, the cops would notice shes crazy and shed be forced to get help, but no one seems to care that shes not paying her mortgage. she gets letters, and people have come to warn her by taking off her door knobs, but no further action has taken place. so now, i bring her frozen meals a few times a week, and walk in to hear the same stories as to how my uncles is a jackass and my dad is such a horrible person even though all he has done is put up with her selfish bull shit for years. i dont want to go, as i have disdain for her too but i cant imagine the pain my dad feels having to deal with her so i just do it. they have given up on ways to get someone to give her a psych exam, and i dont know how to force her to get one done. we cant move forward until she gets help. she either dies in there alone with no comprehension of reality, or she is forced to get help. i would rather the latter, but im out of options. if anyone has any advice, please provide!tl;dr:nana is evil.cant remember day to day.has conversations with others (that arent there) out loud right infront of me.has no comprehension of reality.cant leave her home.need to force her to get a psych eval because she can fake being ""normal"".i have no idea how to force her to get a psych eval....", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3s1d7g/would_really_like_some_advice/,Would really like some advice!

"so my family is absolutely convinced that our grandmother is developing dementia, but every time we force her to go to the doctor she either seems to hide it very well or the doctor just doesn't care. my grandmother has never been the nicest person, she's always been quite selfish which has been very hard on my grandfather who is the nicest person i know. but lately she's started to bully him, so much to the point where he can't even ask if she'd like a cup of tea without her verbally chewing off his head.my grandfather is an amputee having lost his leg a few years ago and the medication he's on along with his age (84) make him very aloof at times, sometimes he can't keep eye contact with anyone (though he can keep a conversation going). but even though he's not all there, he's still the nicest person i know which makes it very upsetting to see him being treated as he is by my grandmother.we've talked countless times to them about moving them into a home where they can get better care, but my grandmother is completely against it. she is very hermit-like who wants her own space, but my grandfather needs interaction with other people, not just our family and his nurse who comes daily. we've also considered the idea of moving him away from my grandmother, but he won't. as much as she verbally abuses him he still loves her and would do anything for her, despite my belief of the reverse not being so true. a few years ago he stayed at her bedside in hospital for days; while she had to be strong-armed into visiting him in the same situation.my parents are just as worried and upset about this, but don't seem to be willing to do anything about it. but i want to know if there is anything i can do?"," sorry to hear about that, as a person who has a grandma suffering with dementia, i definitely understand. keeping them active in events and physically active is relatively effective. it's sad to say that you can't stop dementia, but you can still 'slow it down'. perhaps that's an answer you're looking for? moreover, i came across this the other day as i am participating in a campaign which aims to make people suffering, or know people who are suffering with dementia have 'easier lives' somewhat. people with dementia often need to feel comfortable and independent which is a key factor when monitoring the health of a patient with dementia. therefore, as part of an initiative to tackle these issues presented, you can learn more about what this campaign ensues on the website and even sign it which is greatly appreciated. it involves the handling of sensitive information, but i'm certain it's reliable and safe as i've already signed.thank you and kind regards. if you can feedback on it, it would be amazing. share it with as many people as possible. if there are enough signatures, (100,000), it can be debated through the government.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3qzsqg/looking_for_advice_with_my_grandmother/,Looking for advice with my grandmother

"some background. my dad has had parkinson disease for around 9 years, he was only 60 and in the last two was diagnosed with parkinson related dementia. he is in the late stages, lives in a nursing home and he struggles to know who we are. now and again he references family/friends names and things that have happened in the past.  he knows my face as 'margaret' we presume it is his cousin margaret he is remembering.  i visit my dad once a week and sometimes will bring my children along. they have never known papa before illness. so have grew up visiting him with no expectation of him doing papa stuff and always know papa as unwell. i feel personally i have dealt with my dads illness pretty well.  i've worked in a gp practice for 15 years and over the years have dealt with numerous wee patients that have become demented and as heart breaking as it is i've always felt toughened with regards to illness. i recently got married with no frills. i only told my mum and my husband told his patents, no one else knew. out of respect and the fact he is my dad my husband wanted to tell him and i guess in a way get his permission. he was having a good day when we told him although he still didn't remember i was his daughter. but he asked about honeymoons etc.  fast forward to our first visit after we got married,  me my husband and our six year old went to visit. he was sitting on his usual chair in the tv room and as i walked in did my usual greeting.  i had a can of juice in my hand for him and his first reaction was to grab it off me. i told him to hang on till i opened it and as i began opening it he was still grabbing it and angrily saying give me it. so that was a little upsetting but not  anything i hadn't dealt with before. we pulled our chairs in. my son's birthday had been the day before we got married so i say to my son tell papa it was your birthday.  so he tells him and my dad just looks right through him and draws his eyes off him.  i don't know if it was the incident with the stupid can that added to my emotions but for the first time i cried while in his company. i got up from the chair and went to look out the window. my husband continued to chat to him but my six year old came up beside me and asked if i was ok. i smiled and said yes i was just a bit upset. he then continued to say you know papa isn't well mummy, his brain is all confused, it's not his fault. i hugged my wee boy that seemed too wise for his years. here was me crying like a baby and having my child comfort me by mimicking the words i say to them after every visit.  my husband mentioned we got married but he wasn't for chatting. he seemed frustrated and angry so we cut the visit shorter than normal.the reason for posting this is can any one offer advice? should i call him by his name instead of dad? he  seems to respond to his name every time. should i keep taking my children to visit? he has never shown any kind of relation to them and the kids normally end up wandering around the home chatting to the other residents. i just feel this is not my dad now and each time i visit i'm left a little more disheartened.  i wouldn't wish dementia on my worst enemy."," towards the end, i referred to my dad by his name.  it got a more consistent response.  no matter where he was in his head, he knew his name.  it sounds as if the visits are helping your children learn compassion and empathy for others, i wouldn't curtail them unless they were upsetting to the kids.  you also have to remember that no matter how much experience you have with this professionally, this is *your dad*.  that give it a totally unique emotional flavor.  of course it's distressing.  you have a loving family to support you.  let them.

"we started noticing my mom's memory issues since about 2012. she's always been super sharp, read a ton, never missed a detail. it was pretty obvious when it started. her mom had alzheimer's and we went through her long goodbye for about 10 years. pretty tough on everyone. lately her memory issues have been getting worse to the point she can't remember a movie we just saw yesterday and gets confused as to what day it is, etc. she repeats stories all the time but also has some very good days where you can barely notice she has any issues. it breaks my heart to talk about it with her because we all know what it is and what comes next: confusion, hallucinations, medication, and losing all independence. she understands what's happening but insists on not going to a neurologist or geriatric doc because ""if its alzheimer's, then what's the difference, nothing can be done"". i've asked her not to drive (she lives with my dad), she usually listens. how should i answer her objections? we're all tiptoeing around the issue, everybody knows what's going on but we're all sort of in a holding pattern until something happens that forces things. any advice?  in a moment of candor, she said if she ever gets any worse, to send her to the same home my grandma went to and just make sure she's taken care of and the place is clean :'(", i highly recommend you read this:,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3pylue/my_mom_knows_shes_losing_her_memory_now_what/,"My mom knows she's losing her memory, now what?"

"my father has been diagnosed with dementia since 2009. he is looked after by carers in the morning and afternoon but attends a dementia day center for most of the day. my whole family works except for me as i am searching for a job. at one point while i was unemployed i looked after him full time. basically things have been changing with my father's behaviour and we don't know if we are doing the right thing or not. 2 years ago when i was staying home with my dad we could relax watch tv, read a book and we were able to do these things for a long time. now when he is sitting in the same place doing an activity 10 mins later he gets upset and we have to constantly find new ways to occupy him. its exhausting. he is increasingly getting angsty, muttering to himself and rolls his eyes and sighs at us. he needs to be in bed by 7pm each night to sleep. he argues with us often that well the suns going down so he should head home. when we tell him the address his is at and that he's home he angrily tells us of course he knows that or says nope i don't believe you. i do understand about sun downing and the inability to understand logic with dementia. maybe once a week or twice every two weeks he will have issues with sleeping. sometimes he is good for two weeks no problems. sometimes he refuses to sleep and lies there muttering and will get up extremely angry and try and leave the house. other times he will have slept and woke up to go to the bathroom and will try and leave. our front door can only be opened with a key so he is unable to leave. and he tries to open the door hitting it, yelling to let him out, he kicked one of the other doors once. he can also do this is the morning when he says hes going bathroom but continues towards the door. we basically try to distract him and tell him to go back to bed or offer him things he likes. when he is like this you can talk to him but he ignores everything you say and is very angry at you. my father has only ever one time while i was growing up yelled at me. when he is in a good mood he is so sweet and caring trying to make sure everyone is looked after. on the weekends he's normally so well behaved smiling, making jokes and loves hanging out with the family. due to his angry nature at night we have thought about putting him in a rest home. we have started to prepare the funds needed as we would have to pay. we don't qualify for a subsidy. he would hate the idea of living at a rest home. it would be one with secured dementia care. we love having him around just not when he is angry and trying to get out. we are three women smaller than him but he is not huge or anything. my father hasn't forgotten our names, is looked after, fed, and showered by the family. we drive him everywhere and normally during the whole day is not by himself for more than 10 mins. i feel like the normal time to put a person with dementia in a rest home is when they forget your names or how to eat or shower. but my father is able to eat, speak, remember our names, help with small tasks, use the bathroom and shower although needs help reminding to wash hands and how to properly shower. we just feel so inadequate when he gets angry especially at night. we feel like its inevitable that he will go into care and are thinking of putting him most likely early next year. are we rushing? i've heard people go downhill in care. when was your final point when you knew you had to put your relative in care? we just don't know if we are doing the right thing to put him in care but unless the anger goes away we cannot keep living with him. sorry for a long post. just wanted to give all the info. many thanks. please share your experience of when you put a love one in care, with me."," late to the party, but we had very good results with trazodone as a sleeping pill at night.  it's also for anxiety, so ask your doc.  also, it may be cheaper to hire an overnight caregiver a few nights per week than admitting him somewhere.find a large curtain rod and cover the exit doors at night with drapes to disguise them.  sometimes works very well.    read the book ""contented dementia""  if you haven't already.   watch the teepa snow videos on youtube.sometimes a normal household is too chaotic.  memory units are very bland, quiet places and everyone thinks they are terrible, but the residents have less stimulation/agitation.  see if you can arrange to visit the home that he likely will go to.  observe how he does, some places will let you have a meal to see how things go.   observing him in that environment might give you insight as to whether or not he is ready.best of luck deciding.  we have had two parents with dementia and eventually go into care.  there's no black or white, do your best and don't feel that you've made a wrong decision.  there are no ""right"" decisions anymore, there is only coping.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3ni74n/when_is_it_too_early_for_my_father_to_go_into_a/,When is it too early for my father to go into a rest home?

"hey all! i've been a long time lurker and recently got myself an account. still looking for relatable subs.    anyway. i moved closer to my mother's side of the family for work and to help my aunt take care of my 83 year old grandmother who lives with her. she has been blind as long as i've been alive.    within the last couple of years i've seen a very quick decline in her health. she used to walk around the mall and go thrift shopping and i would always meet her for lunch at her favorite local buffet. she had a few hospitalizations and when she came home she fell and broke her ankle. hospitalized again; this time she was put in hospice. that was the last time she walked. all the while her dementia worstening.    i think it's a mix of the dementia and her blindness, but sometimes she goes on fantastic adventures. one time two strapping young lads picked her up and took her on a helicopter flight across the lake where she layed on a beach with free cookies and lemonade.  other times she thinks we've stuck her under tables or beds and are hitting her with baseball bats.  she always thinks she's holding babies and cats. or she's grasping at her skin and clothing thinking she's covered in ropes.  she never knows where she is and worries about how she will get home or complains how tired she is of standing when she's already in bed.    one time an old friend came to visit her and she went on this huge rant about how my aunt and uncle made her sleep on the floor with no pillows and were hitting her with a broom under the table. instead of arguing with her i just kept trying to change the subject and ask her about her children or her deceased husband to no avail. her friend was obviously rattled and i had to explain. unfortunately, we probably won't see her around again.    i try to visit her everyday and ""grandma-sit"" at least 3-4 times a week between full-time work and grad school. every time i see her she is always so delighted to hear my voice and i love every ounce of her. lately she has been asking ""why am i still here?"" and it's.. so difficult. to say the least. when she is lucid she feels like a burden and not worth our time and love.  but, as anyone with a loved one who has dementia knows, we do everything we can out of love and compassion. some days we may feel more loving and compassionate than others.. but that is all part of the disease.  so here's to us! all of you caretakers and family members are amazing and beautiful people! you go through so much to help someone else have a little bit more comfort and familiarity in their lives. you are selfless and no task is too big for you! but in all of this chaos, don't forget to treat yourself because you deserve it!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3ln5bl/new_to_this_sub/,New to this sub!

"my mother is 69, with vascular dementia. she can no longer drive. i don't live with the family as the dysfunction there makes my chronic pain worse. my brother and father are the two people at home. there's also my centenarian grandmother who takes up the time of the helper when the helper is there along with household duties. my brother came home tonight to find the gas on. the whoke kitchen, living and dining rooms stunk of it.my mother didn't realise it was on. where is her husband in all of this? in the opposite end of the house, permanently holed up in his room doing work and watching the same tv show as my mother, except when he goes out briefly for work and his errands. i have begged him to keep her company even for a little bit. she says she is lonely. no one visits her. no one really calls her either. he doesn't check in with her to make sure that the house isn't about to be blown to kingdom come.  i've suggested hiring a caretaker for mum to keep tabs on her. it would help her, imho, to keep doing certain tasks while making sure she doesn't mess up anything. my father thinks it's not necessary since we have, according to him, three helpers (we have helpers on alternating days and a gardener...... ). my brother is not comfortable with it because he has heard about caregivers and nurses being abusive/sneaky. he doesn't want one even with cameras installed. to him, you might as well stay home with her if you have to put cameras up. i wanted to tell him to go fuck off and die. they keep trying to take away suddenly everything she can do and kept planting her in front of the tv leaving her bored out of her mind. if i were just to hire someone, my father would promptly fire them the next day and i would get a cussing. i cannot fucking deal with this shit. i already get depressed almost every week after dealing with the family for several days (oh, did i mention? i work at the family house. in this country, that is the best suited job i can manage to do because of my health problems). my brother says he will stay at home more. i told him we both need the space. our psychologist said that to both of us. i reminded him but he clearly is letting his guilt make the decisions for him. if i dealt with my mother more, i'm pretty sure i'll jump off a bridge. i loathe my family. unfortunately, my mother is included in this. i hate the person she has become. she weeps all the time, snaps at me and pesters all of us. i just want to give up and die in my sleep or something.", could it be that your father finds it too distressing to be in the same room as your mum?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3l9wv5/my_family_refuses_to_get_a_caretaker_for_my_mother/,My family refuses to get a caretaker for my mother

"i'm 23 and i live with my mother in the uk.my grandmother was recently ( i believe about a year ago?) diagnosed with dementia ( which from a little bit of research i did, may be what is called 'late-onset dementia', she's in her 90's).it's slowly been getting worse and worse over time, and has resulted in her being admitted to a care home after being taken to hospital a couple of weeks ago. the way she's acted is very unnerving for me. her memory has slowly been getting worse and worse as the weeks and months go by. she used to live on her own in a flat, then as it progressed, carers were bought in. she was admitted to hospital twice  and...it's got to the point of ' well, she needs to go in a care home.'  the second time i was also told she had apparently been saying that she wanted to die, which upset me a lot. this wasn't the sweet, kind, funny woman i remembered from when i was young. this was someone different.it's all stressful for me and my mother especially, and my mothers sister is of no help whatsoever. she is often rude and obnoxious to my mother, which upsets her, which then upsets me.it's often like talking to a brick wall. sometimes she'll be nice, and other days she'll be completely rude and unkind. i think that she thinks my grandmother always favored my mother over her.i've sort of experienced this all before with one of my other grandmothers before she sadly passed away, but it was vice-versa ( nursing home, then hospital until her passing, quite a long story behind that) and back then, i didn't understand much of what was going on.and it scared me. this all scares me now as it is, the thought that someone who i remember throughout my whole life, is slowly fading away, and i can't do anything, nor can my mother, and i think it upsets her a lot.  i know there's gonna be a point where my grandmother doesn't remember me at all, and that frightens me. i don't quite know why, but it does.going back to the other grandmother, back when she was in the nursing home, i remember going with my dad to go see her, and to be honest, it wasn't the same person i knew from when i was young, this was a frail, pale, elderly woman,who didn't seem to recall (until my dad said my name to her) who i was. bearing in mind, at that point, she had a water infection as well. i remember being in that room and hearing her start to say ""i don't want to be here anymore..."" which really got to me, and at that point, i left the room because i couldn't take seeing her like that.the very last time i saw her, she was unconscious in a hospital bed. she passed away the next day.going back to the current and now, i just don't know what to do. obviously i'm gonna be there for mum, because this is hard on her, and when ""the inevitable"" happens, it's gonna hit her hard, and she needs (and will need) all the love and support she can get.i may sound absolutely horrible when i say this, but on one hand, i don't want to see my grandmother anymore now that she's in this state, because it really gets to me and i know it would upset me quite a lot, but on the other, i wouldn't mind going to see her, because i'm hoping that there's still a little piece of memory in her mind that hasn't forgotten me.i'm just at a loss with what to do right now. i'm just a 23 year old girl who doesn't understand a lot of all this right now. it's a frightening prospect. and i know it'll get worse before it gets better."," >i don't want to see my grandmother anymore now that she's in this state, because it really gets to me and i know it would upset me quite a lot, but on the other, i wouldn't mind going to see her, because i'm hoping that there's still a little piece of memory in her mind that hasn't forgotten me.i can understand your not wanting to see your grandmother anymore, and it makes much more sense than going to see her just so you can confirm that she still remembers who you are. if she were dying of cancer or als, would you be hoping that your presence would somehow ease her pain? it wouldn't, just as your presence is not likely to jog her memory. to have a grandmother live into her nineties is a great gift. she could have easily been taken from all of you 20 years ago and you would not have gotten to know her at all. dementia is a horrible way to die, but much more so for the loved ones who must watch the decline and realize that the patient can't even take comfort in their presence since she no longer knows them.if you don't want to visit your grandmother, don't go. if your mother were to tell you she asked for you, then maybe a visit is in order, but there's no telling if, when you are there, she will know you. if you can control your discomfort at her not knowing who you are, you could just pose as a kind young woman who is looking in on an elderly lady, call her by her first name,  ask her if there's anything she'd like, or bring her a food treat that she's known to have enjoyed or some music that might comfort her, or a photography book with pix of cats or dogs or beautiful scenes of nature, something that she might like. or you could ask her if she'd just like to hold your hand for awhile without falling back on, ""grandmum, it's me, ninja, don't you remember me?""don't feel pressured to force yourself to visit, tho'. when your grandmother gets to where she's going i sincerely doubt she will hold it against you, for she will be absorbed in her new journey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/3j0iql/where_do_i_go_from_here/,Where do I go from here?

" dementia changes lives. even though the disease is gradual, no one is ever ready for the impact the disease has on family relationships and responsibilities. as a grandson, i was flattened by my grandmother's diagnosis a few years ago.i had a strong connection with her. her distinct sayings, lessons, cooking and laughter are forever ingrained in my brain. we are bonded for life, despite the fact that she has recently passed away.my grandmom lived in italy, so, unfortunately, a lot of the burden fell on my dad. while we all had an inkling something was wrong, we mostly assumed it was normal ageing. we had no idea my grandmother would go from being a seemingly independent, vivacious and driving woman; to an entirely dependent old child in less than two years. but once the doctors diagnosed her with dementia, it happened this fast. maybe she was truly lonely without her sister, who was her living companion and passed away a few years before her. still, she became old seemingly overnight.when i was asking my grandmother for her address, she used to give me the exact address of the home she lived at as a child. i felt like i really got a chance to know a 'younger' version of my grandmother. she told me about life with her sisters and when she first started dating my grandpa. it was pretty sweet.and here comes my regrets.i wish i had listened to more of her life stories. i wish i had recorded some of them to re-enjoy them now she is gone. i wish i had kept some of her memories to pass to my children. this thought had become my obsession in the last few years when i realised that my memories of her were slowly fading out.i am a software developer, i have co-founded several tech companies in the past, so i decided to put all my knowledge at 'dementia cause' service. i recently founded a company that helps people maintain the mental well-being and the brain activity of those with dementia by applying the reminiscence therapy methodology. i aim to create a support tool that facilitates conversations with our loved ones and transforms those conversations into an archive of audio recordings to treasure forever.we got overwhelming feedback from single people, and we are now trying to scale a bit, but we don't have an extensive network. the reason i am writing today is to ask for help to reach more charities, associations, care homes or support groups to pilot it. of course, the app is free, and we won't charge anything for it. if any of you have relevant contacts and are willing to make an introduction, please, dm me. happy to provide any further information.**🙏🙏🙏🙏**thank you in advance for the help.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/st0dsw/need_help_to_reach_charities_and_associations/,[deleted by user]

"🌞🌹🌟#1. she's forgetting what to do next when taking a shower, so i have her turn on her speaker phone and have to guide and walk her though one step at a time what to do to get in the shower and then i have to tell her again what to do when she gets in the shower while we're both on the speaker phone. she will ask questions what to do through the process, but when i tell her, i can tell she does it and says what next and what else. sometimes i have to repeat two or three times, but sometimes i only have to repeat one time and she gets everything done while we're both on the speaker phone. #2. i notice when she eats any kind of berries like all species of birds eat all berries and fly hundreds of thousands of miles to get where they want to go. i do see she remembers more when she eats berries. also take two to three ferrous sulfate iron tablets everyday. especially drinking pure water, not beverages to keep the blood diluted and to keep hydrated. we are amazed of what she can do for herself while using the speaker on her cell phone all by herself. she even says i look beautiful when she combs her hair in the mirror and tell her to put on her lipstick! she even says wow, as i feel her looking in the mirror. i do believe if you think a relative or someone you know is getting alzheimer's, our story of how to help them exercise their brain in this way, is definitely proof that it can be done. it could be better than anything else.🌈⭐🌙",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/somjzi/my_little_forgetful_motheralzheimers/,My little forgetful mother/Alzheimer's.

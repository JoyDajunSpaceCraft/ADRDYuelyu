"it’s been a couple of months since my grandmas been in the care home now. i’ve only had a chance to see her once but my mum and her other siblings visit her about once a week so i get frequent updates on how she is doing. on top of the dementia i’m almost certain my grandma has undiagnosed depression, since my grandad passed she was never been the same. constantly crying, no motivation to do anything. she pretty much gave up on herself the moment he passed away which i think only accelerated the dementia (although she wasn’t diagnosed at the time) as by the time she was put into a care home she could barely walk and we pretty much had to do everything for her in the end.the care home isn’t far from where my mum lives and although the building is pretty shabby that’s as far as i can complain. the carers are amazing and so patient and kind. they recently got a doctor out to see her and she’s been prescribed antidepressants which appear to have helped her mood a lot. my mum saw her last weekend and she seemed a lot happier, my mum asked her if she liked living there and she said yes whereas before she has begged my mum to take her home with her which is a big improvement. she also pointed out a male patient to my mum and said they were her boyfriend. i got a giggle out of that one as apparently she has at least two other boyfriends according to the carers. i’m just glad that she’s happier than she’s been in a while and getting the care that she needs. for the first time in a while were all feeling much more positive given the circumstances.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/e0fqhd/grandma_seems_to_be_doing_better/,Grandma seems to be doing better
"my father-in-law has moderately advanced lewy body dementia, diagnosed a couple of years ago. he lives alone and is divorced. my husband is his only child and has poa, etc. last week, fil called us confused about some paperwork he received containing the terms of a lease agreement for a new lincoln. he immediately knew that the car belonged to some guy he was vaguely friendly with. when questioned, he claimed it was because they had recently had coffee and he saw the car. he acted defensive when we asked more questions about why the lease was in his name. he is now claiming that this ""friend"" had reached out and asked fil for a reference so that he could get a new car, and thinks he might have signed something for a reference. he is clear that he never agreed to lease a car for the friend. (i'm skeptical on this)we have access to his accounts, and cannot find any payment records, so it does not appear that he paid for anything related to the vehicle. to clarify, it's not clear if my fil agreed to the lease, or if the friend simply stole his identity in obtaining the lease. most likely it's the first. obviously, my fil is a terrible witness and we're not going to get a clear picture of what really occurred. however, we need to get him out of this lease and for a host of reasons, some low life guy my fil kind of knows shouldn't be driving a personal vehicle technically owned by fil. what do we do?just to add- we have freezed his credit with all 3 agencies to prevent future similar occurrences"," lo in early stages of alzheimer’s successfully living on her own with an active life and social support had some repairs done to her kitchen. the  repairman conned her into assigning him as her poa. the elder attorney hired and police discovered he’d targeted elderly customers for years. he’d convince them substantial repairs were needed, did little or nothing and paid himself a fortune.lo moves into a ccrc and generally lives independently with more support but no adl issues. she can’t discern between real phone calls and fraudsters. she repeatedly volunteered credit card, social security, and bank details. she lost several hundred dollars that couldn’t be refunded before all was locked down (can put limits that require poas co-sign so they are still independent, cancel most credit cards, freeze credit file, limit incoming calls) but a neighbor of hers lost $50,000. get ahead of this or he’ll be penniless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dzsp6r/fil_with_dementia_leased_a_car_for_someone_he/,[deleted by user]

"so it's 5am when i'm writing this. i'm starting to get worried about my dad. he's 64, his wife died 3 years ago, and he went to rehab beginning of the year for opiate abuse. i don't know if the abuse can cause or trigger any form of dementia, but he's showing some weird signs. a few days ago i came back late and he was on the couch watching tv. i asked him a question about something, and he started talking about his military service in ussr (which is true). then, out of nowhere, he starts talking about something about australian people like it was part of the story even tho it was just something on the tv. all of a sudden, in the middle of a sentence, he goes dead quiet. he's silent for about 10 seconds, then looks at me and asks ""were you saying something?"" a few hours ago i go outside for a smoke. as i'm walking out, he asks me for his debit card. i asked him if i could have $5 for food tomorrow, which he agrees to. i give him back his debit card, and he goes to his room. i literally wait for about 15 minutes and he doesn't come back. i go to his room and he's just in the bathroom doing nothing. i ask him again for the money, and he gives me his debit card and says, ""go have fun with your friends."" what??? i told him that i just needed $5, so he gives me that. 30 minutes later, i'm outside smoking, and all of a sudden he comes outside. mind y'all, it's 40 degrees out, and he comes out in a t-shirt. he closes the front door and wanders around the front porch for a couple of minutes. then, he slowly walks towards my car (all while i'm looking directly at him) and tries to get in it. i tell him that that's my car, and then he asks me if i'm getting a ride to class tomorrow. (wtf???) he then tries to get into his car, and guess what? he forgot his car keys. i'm really concerned at this point so i tell him that it's not safe for him to drive and that he needs to go back inside. he says, ""i can't i have to go to the field trip i have a field trip to go to."" (he's a teacher irl) i go, ""dad do you know what time it is?"" he doesn't know, and is completely astonished that it's 1am. he locked himself out of the house, so i have to lead him back inside. i unlock the door, and he reaches for the top of the door to open it. (wtf?) i ask him if everything is alright, and he says that it's his sore throat. he's completely fine during the day, even tho his sleep schedule is a little messed up. but i'm really concerned because he could've hurt himself or someone else. i don't think he's good with money (we just had to take out a loan last month) and the house is a mess but he doesn't mind. i'm really worried about his mental health. any opinion or advice would be greatly appreciated.tldr: my dad is forgetting and acting confused and doing things without end goal. i'm only 21 idk if i can handle all this."," hi there! i can only imagine how worried you must be. unfortunately, the best most of us can do here is to say: he needs to see a doctor. there are lots of things that can cause erratic behaviour, from an infection to, yes, dementia. only a doctor can determine what's up. if he is indeed lucid during the day, bring up what you've observed with him and explain you'd like him to see his doctor. if he refuses, you can independently contact his physician to share what you've seen. the next time your dad goes in, they'll test him. in fact, you likely should independently share what you've seen whether your dad is willing to go to the doctor or not. your dad may not know what to say about his own behaviour, or he may be afraid or prideful and underreport what's going on.if he refuses to go, you might get away with a white lie. give it a week, then tell your dad that the doctor called to set up an appointment for his annual physical. although fibbing doesn't feel great, sometimes it's necessary for sometime who is cognitively compromised. you can book an appointment for him, and let him go in not knowing what you've shared with his physician.good luck. let us all know how it goes!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dyinty/im_worried_any_opinion_would_be_greatly/,I'm worried any opinion would be greatly appreciated.

"hi all,first, my apologies if this is the wrong sub for this. please take my post down if that’s the case.some context: my grandfather is in his 80’s and is in the beginning stages of dementia. he deals with periodic bouts of memory loss, confusion, and frequent angry outbursts. he also fractured his neck in a fall recently and will have severe mobility limitations for the rest of his life. other possibility relevant context: we are located in the us and i have power of attorney.the only activity that seems to calm him during moments where his dementia or pain acts up is access to his ipad. he plays gambling and billiards games that have in-app purchases and he racks up thousands of dollars in fees per month. his retirement income used to cover this habit but we are now going to have to divert those funds to in-home care.given his mobility limitations and the fact that these games are the only thing that bring him any peace, i’m trying to find an alternative for him as opposed to just taking the ipad away. my current plan is to install all of the parental controls that the ipad has available and turn off his ability to make in-app purchases. i’m also hoping to find replacement games that are either entirely free or only have a single up-front cost. given that context, i’m looking for suggestions regarding the following:1. is there a way to make absolutely sure that my grandfather won’t be able to make any purchases- even through the web browser on the ipad? will the parental controls be sufficient or do i need to take further steps? he has lucid moments where he’s very motivated and able to make purchases. he’s also pretty tech savvy in those moments and i’m afraid he’ll be able to get past restrictions i put into place.2. does anyone have experience with trying to move a fragile loved one away from these apps? i’m anticipating a strong negative reaction even if i replace the apps with similar ones. he still desires some level of autonomy and this will be taking away one of the last ways that he’s able to spend money. i don’t take that lightly.3. is there a website or something where i can find info on apps that don’t require in-app purchases? i’m afraid i’m going to accidentally download something that has in-app purchases and he’ll either spend money or become very angry that the app won’t let him play anymore.4. do you have any recommendations regarding resources for dealing with gambling addiction in seniors, tech access for seniors, or anything else that’s relevant here? are there other subs that might be helpful?any advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance.", my dad was a compulsive spender.  we took away his credit cards and replaced them with low-value cash cards.  you might also look for games that allow you to gamble for fake money.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dwniyk/looking_for_suggestions_regarding_tech_access_for/,Looking for suggestions regarding tech access for my grandfather with early stages of dementia.
"my dad is 81 and has moderate dementia. he was diagnosed with bladder cancer and last month had the bladder removed and now has a stoma which requires him to have a urine-collection bag attached to his abdomen. i have had very little success in teaching him how to care for it other than emptying it once or twice a day while i'm at work. still, he empties it wrong (i'll spare you details) and most times forgets to close the bag properly. he needs to be hooked up to an overnight bag, a very simple thing, he can't ever remember it even though we do it nightly. and every 4 days i have to change out the entire system, which is way beyond what he can understand.so basically now he cannot be left by himself for any length of time, let alone overnight. i'm his sole caretaker. does anyone have any experience with this type of situation? i mean, pretty much now i'm forced to be with him 24/7. i don't see how he'd allow a stranger to do what i do. i'm basically stuck to those damn bags forever? how do other people do this?"," definitely get assessed for care needs and a carer should be provided or hired to come several times a day. there should be an allowance for this (depending on where you are in the world). the stranger help thing will have to be overcome sometime unfortunately as things aren't likely to improve. and you are doing an amazing job, but you can't do everything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dwij4z/dementia_patients_with_ostomies_need_advice/,"Dementia patients with ostomies, need advice"

"hi all,i’m glad to uncover this community and hoping for some opinions/thoughts from people who are in the thick of it.my grandma has dementia. she has been in a memory care unit for the past year and a half. no one has been totally happy with her care (aids sitting around on their phones, not putting socks on her in the morning), however she has been safe and her basic needs are cared for. plus they do have some engaging activities (arts and crafts, musicians, nail painting, community outings, group games) and she has made some sweet, confused, old lady friends.the big reason to stay in memory care unit (mcu) has been that my grandpa was living in assisted living in the same building  and could come and go easily. however, he just passed away so that factor is gone.my struggle is, would it be better for her to have my grandma move in with me and my boyfriend or to have her stay where she is in the mcu.if she stays, the aids will still be less than engaged. however, she has familiar surrounding, friends, and engaging activities.  plus i visit her 3 days per week, and one other family member also visits about 3 days per week.if she moves in with me she would start and end her day with family. we could hire overnight help if needed and she could go to granny daycare. however, mobility is becoming more of an issue and if she can’t transport she will then be isolated at home with either  just me or an aid (rather than the community of friends and activities). plus, it would be a big transition to move her. and, there would be multiple hurdles for me to jump to get to this end goal (rent larger apartment, get family members on board) the struggle of what is best for her haunts me. any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."," i agree with the comments suggesting leaving her where she is but let me add this: it will also be better for you and your boyfriend. i can't emphasize that enough. you are very sweet for even thinking of taking her in (and kudos to your boyfriend for agreeing) but you do need to keep yourself in mind. good luck. you sound like a great, caring person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dvkh56/memory_care_unit_or_home/,Memory care unit or home ?

"so my mom is 80. for the past few years she’s been obsessed with the thought that people have been stealing things from the house.at first it was directed at a company that she hired to clean her garage. the rearranged everything and since she couldn’t find what she was looking for she decided that they had stolen it. random things like old jack stands and the good shovel. now she’s moved on to believing my brother, his girlfriend and his ex wife have been sneaking into the house and stealing things. like letters and an expired passport, a creamer set, a dress, a record, photographs. the thing is that she’s always hidden things and lost them, ever since i was a kid. she hides things and forgets and thinks they’ve been stolen. like when she had cataract surgery she hid her eye drops and when i went to put them in they had disappeared and she thought my brother had stolen them. i found them in a drawer just randomly. this morning she accused me of stealing a picture of my brother, but later found it in a drawer where she had wrapped it up and left a note to my brother about how bad he was for stealing.when items turn up in different places than she remembers them being she says that they snuck in the house and moved them to “mess with her” or “to make her look crazy.”at times she whispers or writes notes to me because she thinks that they have bugged the house.i’ve tried to stay very diplomatic with her. my brother told her that she’s demented and she took that very badly. so i try and just nod and keep her calm. but now she’s starting to think that i’ve moved things and that we’re all conspiring to get her house. she gets really agitated and angry, saying how she can’t trust anyone. otherwise she’s fairly normal. she’s still drive if i let her. she pays attention to politics and is with it on most things. i live with her and take care of her. i don’t know what to do. i have power of attorney for when she becomes incapacitated but how can i get her to see a doctor or take medication when she thinks it’s all a plot against her?"," you have to tell her that you believe hertell her ""omg, i gotta inform the police, they will investigate this""and when you find it you tell her ""police just got here and gave this back, they found the thief and that person will go to jail for theft!""&#x200b;don't tell them they got dementia and don't tell them it was them who put it somewhere... it is called valitation and it is hard to do, but helps them a lot  you have to sweettalk her to go to the doctor, call in before and tell them what you think is the problem, so when you are there, you don't say ""she got dimentia"", you can just say ""it is waht i think i called you about"" and they can investigate without making her angry... telling her the meds might just be good for her health and she has to take em regulary  love <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dvhu1z/what_to_do_when_a_parent_thinks_things_are_being/,What to do when a parent thinks things are being stolen?

"my dad is 93....had a stroke 2 years ago, has parkinsons and some dementia.  i was living out of town for 35 years so only saw my folks a couple times a year on vacation. i moved back 4 or 5 years ago thanks to a job change and moved back in to save expenses and take animation classes. let me mention my dad is a control freak stemming from being a narcissist. for those who dont know what that does...he is god. he is always right and nothing he says or does can be wrong no matter the truth or how abusive he gets. basically he tells you what to do, how to do it and how to think and what you can say.  there is so much more but just so you get an idea.i think his dementia is blending with his narcissism  and the aftereffects of his stroke so theres not one clear cause here. he i think often has blanks, which his mind fills so his life makes sense. for example he had a fall and a spinal fusion on his lower back. i know the location because his nurse showed me the bandage and i read the doctors procedure paperwork and it lists specifically the lower 3 discs in the back. my dad swears it was his neck, top of the spine. i mean he will argue like his life depends on it. he will fight ya if need be. ive learned to just ignore it unless it endangers him or me or has legal import. that said. his parkinsons diagnosis was made at the rehab hospital after his stroke. no one before had mentioned this. if his doctor had then my dad refused to believe him. just like he refused to believe that any kind of rehab was worth his time. he didnt see a reason for it so he ignored it. he actually made fun of the pt girl for starting him with basic exercises. i explained things many times. but as he ragrds me as his idiot little son he doesnt listen. now he istied to a walker and doesnt drive. he doesnt go anywhere because he cant be on his feet much. his day is spent sitting in a chair watching movies. nor does he do the simple exercises i showed him, which his neurologist gave him...so he could continue to get up from a chair and to use a walker.he has issues swallowing food, refuses to see anyone. has a sleep med which mostly works but when it doesnt hes very weak for a couple days. i had read that coke with dinner helped swallowing, the bubbles. he had discontinued his parkinsons med because he said it didnt do any good. he expected his tremors to just vanish. i explained to him that parkinsons is much more than just tremors. but then being the idiot......finally got him back to his neurologist who gave him a patch 1mg. try it for 2 weeks to see if he can tolerate it and then he can step up to a 2mg. two days after starting that patch he is stronger and walking w/out the walker for a week. woot!we go back to the neurologist, she is positive and gives him 2 weeks of a 2mg patch and 2 weeks of a 4mg patch to try. he started drinking  a coke with dinner and after a couple nights he was up all night. slept half a night and then  was up all night again. so last night he didnt have the coke. last night he said he didnt fall asleep right away so he took the patch off and slept 11 hours. he told me when he got up today, blaming the patch for his lack of sleep. which i dont believe for a second. i suggested he call his neurologist and talk to her first, even if to see if she wants to return to the 1mg patch. then he tells me he never had a 1mg patch. ahhh, doesnt matter that i was there during his appt, that she explained it to me directly, that i carried the patches and looked at them. was there during his second appt etc. he never ever for one brief instant suspects that perhaps he may be wrong. because hes a narcissist he can never be wrong, even when he makes up a bad memory to fill a hole. even when i can tell him from being an eyewitness.....i cannot be believed because i am not god, not him, only he knows. i am thankfull that my dad gives me a place to stay. i take care of the house and help him as needed. im studying to get into it. at my age i realise finding any job that will pay the bills  will be a longshot.  but honestly he wouldnt survive  without my help. i'm just so damn tired of his stupidity and foolishness. he has no idea what he is talking about and he wont even consider listening to reason. so he will suffer. ive told him that i cant lift him so if he ever gets to a point where he has to have assistance getting up and down he will have to sell the house and get a smaller place and a helper. but then im an idiot so.....its like dealing with a madman who so believes himself that there is no way to convince him otherwise. you dont stop the train you try and redirect it. ....yes im bitter too. the part of not listening is how he has been forever. only he knows and dont even think of questioning him. lets just say that when i moved back i was noticing some really strange behaviour from him, esp after his stroke. mom noticed it also after his stroke. she was his enabler but was always very good to me. she passed a year and a half ago. quite honestly she was the only person in this world who loved and cared for me. to my dad im the houseboy, as he has told me. by word and action. my big brother is like dad. both try to tell me how to make decisions in my life. decisions that are wrong, serve their purpose and in the long run would hurt my life greatly. both think they will play me, neither understand that i know quite well what they are.why am i here? because two weeks before she passed my mom told me how much she loved my dad. my dad showed no remorse whatsoever at her death. he didnt offer anything to me. thank god my best friend was there to talk in email whenever i needed to talk. why am i here? because until i can get enough to get into it i would be trying to manage in retail, not getting paid enough, and tearing me down. why am i here? because after all he has done and all the frustration from his own issues and stuidity he is my dad and he can do daily things and he wouldnt survive. there is so much more and this probably wont make sense....so to all of you who care for someone with dementia and issues, in the middle of the insanity. wondering if you're losing yours. wondering how to get through another day. \*hug\* for as lost as i feel you folks do so much out of your love and compassion. know that you are appreciated.  i honestly dont know how you do it because i fail."," i'm so sorry you're going thru this! i had a similar mom related conversation with my father today. i told him he is getting to a point he can't live alone and he asked why i'm doing this to him. i said i'm doing it because it's what my mom would've wanted... my taking care of him. he told me that wasn't true... he knew i just trying to get my own way and he wasn't going to let me win. he was also livid because 'the kid' told him, when we were moving furniture at my house, that i didn't want him coming for christmas. i asked who exactly 'the kid' is and when exactly did we move furniture at my house? it never happened. he'll often dream things thinking them real events. the funny thing is he hasn't shown up for the last 2 christmas's.  he wanted me to bring my mom to my house for the holiday. i'm not a nurse and for the last 2 years my mom was unable to walk, she was completely incontinent, could not feed herself and did not know who we were. thing about my dad is that he would insist i bring her home, and then expect me to do everything for her while caring for my kids, cooking the holiday meal and playing host to everyone else who stopped by. his feeling is that as the daughter this is all my responsibility while he did nothing but sit and enjoy the day which is his entitlement as all knowing patriarch.  my punishment for refusing to bring my mom home was his boycotting the holiday. he then got angry because i refused to leave my family in the afternoon to bring him some food and wine. he's always been a bit paranoid, but you add it to the narcissism and dementia and it becomes almost unmanageable. he refuses to take any of the meds his doc prescribes. he doesn't feel them necessary. he self medicates with alcohol though he was never much of a drinker when we were kids. i went to his house today. he's told me in the past, he turns off his fridge because it's too noisy, but today he told me that's ridiculous... he'd have no idea how to shut it off. he's been eating green bacon that smells rank. when i got alarmed he just comments about my being a hysterical woman. he says he survived growing up in the u.k. late 30's/early 40's eating rotted food. he's impervious. he never believed in estate planning. there's no life insurance, poa, will... nothing.  today, his house was in such bad shape i realize i'm going to have to go for guardianship and force him to move. he's going to make my life hell, because i'm just the stupid kid and female to boot and he shouldn't have to listen to a thing i say.as for the holidays... i think all you can do is plan the best day for you. if he chooses to participate... wonderful. if not, you did what you could and it's his loss. bottom line... you're doing the best you can and that's all anyone can ask. i think we're both strong people, because of we weren't we would pull the disappearing act like my brothers

just wondering if a lawyer matters or not.  my parents are separated but not divorced.  they gifted us a property but we will try to stay outside the 5 year look back period before applying for medicaid.," if he’s over 65 he should qualify for medicare.  there are free help places that will help you figure out the best plan for him.  i think there are state resources you can google to find out who you can get help from.  there also should be a senior and disability agency where you can go to get him signed up for additional things like food stamps or if he qualifies i think there’s an extra program that can help with some of the costs of medicare (at least here in oregon i was able to get my mom set up with it).  my mom is right on the cusp of qualifying so some years she will get it and others she won’t.  senior and disability also can determine if he qualifies for in home care, having a personal support worker come out to help with grocery shopping, cleaning, meal prep, assistance with personal care etc.also, if you need legal advice there might be in your area senior law clinics that should at least have free consultations and provide referrals if they think you need further help.  if you have a legal aide service you can check with them to see if that’s an option.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dvc2u1/should_we_get_a_medicaid_lawyer_to_help_us_apply/,Should we get a medicaid lawyer to help us apply for medicaid for my dad?

"just an update on my dad - original post [here](my dad is still staying in alabama with family and doing well. i was expecting my dad's brother to be the one helping get him to the lawyer and doctor's appointments. unfortunately, on the day my uncle was supposed to take my dad to a pcp (primary care physician), he ended up in the hospital because of a pre-existing heart condition.so yesterday i had to make an unexpected day trip (3 hours each way) to take my dad to a lawyer's office and to the local social security office. my uncle also had open-heart surgery yesterday.what a stressful couple of weeks it has been. but, my uncle is recovering well and hanging out with my dad was more fun than it has been in a long time. i got medical and financial powers of attorney signed, we went and had lunch, bought him a new tv, and got his social security application processed - he's going to start getting checks next week.the blood pressure medicine has made such a huge difference in his temperament and attitude. he still has trouble remembering words and says things that don't make sense sometimes, but i would say he has gone from making sense 25% of the time to making sense 85% of the time. he isn't as quick to anger and get frustrated. i hope that he can maintain this baseline for a while.we had to reschedule his doctor's appointment and my aunt if taking him next friday. the hospital bills haven't actually been as bad as i expected - it's been under $5,000 so far. however, he isn't eligible for medicare or medicaid so i still have to figure out if there if any assistance for him before he turns 65.anyway, thanks for the support on my previous post and i thought a post about positive momentum might be welcome.", i'm glad your dad is doing better! it must have been great to feel that connection with him again. i hope things continue to go well for you!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/du4gkp/dad_is_doing_a_lot_better/,Dad is doing a lot better
"this is my first reddit post and i have spent quite a few hours reading posts from others in this community so i hoped i might find some wisdom for my battle to come. a bit of background: my mother is 70 years old and has been divorced from my father for well over 40 years. she has always been a great mom and grandmother to my daughter and i love her tremendously. she has live many states away from me for the past 10 years but we remained close for most of those. in the meantime, my older brother (who has never really made good life choices) married someone he barely knew, they moved to the east coast and then began having issues. she cheated, he drank, she kicked him out, he continued to drink, they divorced (he did not want it) and he continued to drink. he then had to move to live with our mother as he had no real connections where they lived nor the funds to support himself. he continued to be a closeted alcoholic, worked sporadically while my mother paid the bills. long story on that, he quit working and went to ""school"" and after he graduated, quit drinking cold turkey, screwed his body up by doing so and ended up in the hospital with liver failure for 5 months. my mother was already showing some signs of cognitive issues like getting lost trying to get to the hospital, forgetting passwords and such but was still working full time. she then retired as she thought my brother would need help when he got home from the snf he was sent to for rehab. once he was home, he didn't share how hard it was for him to get around (obesity, lingering issues) nor did he share how quickly my mother was declining. she and i would talk once or twice a week and i noticed she would repeat stories or ask me the same question multiple times but my brother assured me they had seen the family dr and he said she was fine. everything came to a head last week when he admitted he had again began drinking (to cope with our mother he said) and ended up in the hospital again. that's when a family friend called me, told me about the filth and squalor they were living in and that my mother was in a really bad way. my brother finally admitted he had not been cooking, only having fast food delivered, because of the filth in the kitchen he was unable to clean and my mother did not have the cognitive ability to do. he was ""embarrassed"" of the situation and thought he could get a handle on things ""eventually"".  it then came out that my mother had seen the dr once in 6 months and my brother did not go in with her to the room so he had no idea if her memory issues were even discussed. this all came out over this past weekend and i scrambled to get a plane ticket to her location, her friend brought her to the airport and i loaded her back on the plane and brought her home with me leaving my brother there in hospital. i was heartsick at her condition. she was filthy, she smelled, her clothing was dirty .... it was a very unpleasant plane ride home. i bought her a new shirt at the airport and that helped some but i had no facilities to clean her up and a plane waiting to get her home. once home, i was able to get her clean and such but that was just the beginning. she had no underclothes, no clean clothes packed ... she had been taking out of date meds ... she had rashes and tangled matted hair. i have sorted all of these issues, she has seen a geriatrician and sees a neurologist next week. the geriatric dr i took her to here said yes , dementia but the neuro will have to make the final diagnosis. now for my dilemma. i work full time and spend several hrs a day commuting. i have to work, i am single and have a daughter in nursing school. i am taking some vacation time and can probably do fmla for another month but my mother is a complete care. she cannot find her way around my house, can never find the bathroom or the room she was given. she can't toilet herself because she does not clean herself after. she cannot bath herself, cook her meals .... her personality is there but her short term memory is shot. she asks the same things over and over, she shuffles rather than walks, and has delusions (like thinking my brother was home when he was still hospital before i could get to her). i know in my heart that she deserves to be in a memory care center where she can have others around her, stimulation that is not the tv, therapies for those with memory issues and a shot at some independence but here is enough of her in there that i know she is going to hate it.  she keeps telling me that when she gets back home she needs to get a job so she can help pay bills. it;s almost like she forgets everything else but what would make things easier for her/me. i have only been her sole caregiver for 3 days and already i have screwed up. she gets mad when i help her with her toileting because it ""hurts her"", i forgot her evening pills tonight, i have has zero opportunity to figure out a way to get her blood pressure taken morning and night per her new dr's wish. i am not a huge people person and as i age, i find having people around me (even family besides my child) for long periods of time makes me anxious and sick to my stomach. as my routines are disrupted, my ra flares, i get small anxiety attacks ... i don't want to put her in a home but i know it's the best thing for both of us. i do. i am just so heartsick and scared to upset her, to make her hate me ..... i think she is aware enough to know somehow that its not really an apartment and those people coming in and out helping her shower are not just helpful neighbors. all of this has just literally been dropped on me in the last 5 days and i feel like i am losing my mind already. i refuse to allow my daughter to disrupt her life by making huge sacrifices. she has been a big help but i want her to live her life to the fullest. she is 23 and i do not want this to suck her dry. oh, and another fun note ... my brother has been released now and is planning on moving here to my house in 3 weeks. he will be in no shape to care for my mother while i am at work and i do not want to be at work/commuting 10 hrs a day and then be to weary to take care of mom evenings/weekends. do i suck as a daughter? i think i know that if she was all there mentally she would not want this for me. i know for a fact i would hate my daughter being stuck taking care of me in her later years. i just can't help feeling guilty and heartsick at how scared/mad/upset/lonely mom will be in a care center. what do i do to make this ok in my head? i am not even sure in home care would be enough with everything she needs. i am working on getting her state aide here and there are some wonderful looking ltc memory centers close by ... we would all visit daily and she can even take a pet (if we clean up after it) ..... how do i know i am making the right choice even if it seems to (probably) devastate her?"," wow it's amazing how fast time passes. i reread my original post and just cringe at how out of control i felt when i wrote that novel lol. i wanted to come back and follow up with everyone after the wonderful advise and encouragement i received following this post. it's been 3 months and many things have changed. it took 3 months to get my mother established with medicaid in my area. she also had a bit of funds to spend down before she could be approved so mommy daycare was our lifesaver. she hated it at first but grew to love the staff and other attendees. the sad part was her having to leave once she was approved and we found a memory care center that fit the bill. she was so angry with me when we told her. we tried everything to make it seem like a great adventure. that did not work in the slightest but i finally told her that we had to do this for now as i work outside the home and cannot be there for her. we bought some new furniture, some pretty decor, new linens and such and moved her in 4 weeks ago. the staff recommended we not visit the first 2 weeks as she needed time to settle in and make new routines. i made it a week then went to see her. first thing she said to me was ""why are you here. your work is more important then me, that's why you abandoned me here"". guess that second week should have been used. i was devastated but i left and waited another week. the next visit was a complete 360. she had friends at her dining table, enjoyed the fitness activities, started going to ""church services"" and loved the karaoke events. they do things like live music and story hours. she has settled in beautifully. no they do not take care of her just like i did. i only had her to look after and her caregivers have several. yes, i have visited only to find her sitting on her bed staring at the wall because she can't turn her tv on and the caregivers are busy but all in all, i have to stand back and realize that she is as happy as she can be, she is safe and cared for and that is all i can hope for. as a side: my brother stayed where he was because i called his case manager from the hospital and advised her of his living situation. she had him and his environment evaluated by the state and he was placed in assisted living/medicaid. i visit my mom twice a week, take her to all her dr appointments (except primary care as the facility has concierge drs that come in to see their patients) and try to get her out in the community every week. it was the hardest and most gut wrenching 4 months of my life and i have no idea how anyone does it for years on end. this disease (she was dx with alzheimer's) sucks so incredibly badly and i would not wish it on my worst enemy but we are handling things day by day. thank you to all that responded when i was losing my mind ...

"does anyone have experience dealing with family members taking your lo's money, and getting them deauthorized from doing so?some background: we added my bil (my spouse's brother) to my mil's checking account several months ago so he could help take care of financial arrangements for dementia care, meeting requirements for the medicaid application, etc. unfortunately, he is now just taking her social security money and draining the account, to the point that it's dipping below the amount needed to pay for the facility she's in. we took away his debit card, but he's still got it linked to apple pay, so he keeps making purchases and cash withdrawals and saying that he ""didn't realize"" he was using her account (which is a blatant lie), or admits that he knew but he ""needed money for food."" he has been told many, many times that he cannot take money out of the account. he keeps doing it. over and over. this is part of a whole long mess of atrocious behavior and dysfunction. we're kicking ourselves for ever having him added to the account in the first place, but at the time it was the best option, as we live out of state and her bank does not have branches where we live. there were so many things to do with the medicaid application, etc., and we needed things to be taken care of locally more often than my spouse and i could be there. unfortunately, bil's dysfunction just spiraled out of control in the last couple months, to the point that he is no longer trustable.my spouse now has financial poa for my mil, but since bil is authorized on the checking account (i believe it's now basically a joint account and not just a custodial situation, but we have to verify that this is the precise situation), we can't figure out if the bank can even do anything. if it's a joint account, he basically is entitled to use that money, right? we're trying to see if my spouse's poa will be enough to get him off the account or at least to deactivate his debit card so he can't keep using it in apple pay.ideally we would just completely close the account and open another one with no ties to bil at all, but we're still sorting out the payments for the memory care facility, as she just moved in, and we're trying to get them to bill ss directly, but it just takes some time. once we get direct bill set up, it will likely be easier to close the existing account and open a new one. there's just too much stuff going through that account right now (ss, medicaid verifications, billing from facility, etc.), so we don't want to screw it up after it took us so long to get medicaid approved and to get her into facility that would take a medicaid waiver. we're working with an elder care lawyer, but she is not great about giving us clear, concrete steps.in short, how the hell does one boot someone off of a joint account if they are literally just stealing your elderly mil's social security money?", why not open a new account and move the money?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dtpsni/getting_bil_removed_from_mils_checking_account/,Getting BIL removed from MIL's checking account

"so i've been looking around and because  the insurance industry completely underestimated the high cost and high number of seniors living  with chronic conditions (like alzheimer's , parkinson's etc) so their actuarial tables were flawed, and they took a huge losses financially ,.so to resolve this most just left the market (don't write ltc policies anymore) and the remaining ones offer stingy coverage options (most ltc policies have a coverage cap around 5 years) with no rate cap on what you pay in premium prices. keep that in mind when  you consider a skilled nursing facility costs average around $400/day ~ $12000/month . that's why the ltc market is very limited ,because someone with a chronic disease and no other major health issues could live 5-10 years needing a high-level of care. no insurance company wants to be out $1mln in payouts. folks that currently have ltc  plans are facing rising premiums every year like 20-30% increases.so i've looked everywhere and it seemsbasically the middle class is screwed. if your wealthly you can self-insure and just get a live-in caregiver or nurse , if your poor or indigent medicaid will cover you (but quality of care is atrocious in most cases) , middle class is stuck does anyone here have any experience with this? or any good alternatives?", $12000 a month?  i guess it depends on how skilled you need.  my dad is in an alf for $3200 a month - mom pays $2100 and medicaid pays the rest via a qualified income trust.  the home is wonderful and the people who work there are almost like his family.  he's been there almost 2 years.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ds7k0d/are_there_any_reasonable_long_term_care_insurance/,Are there any reasonable Long Term Care insurance options in 2020?

"&amp;#x200b;hi everyone! one of the hardest aspects of caregiving that i've experienced, has been feeling pretty invisible. my father began to show mild signs of slipping cognitively several years ago which gave me a sense of panic about what was to come. friends, co-workers, and distant relatives didn't understand it and would dispense platitudes such as ""you're lucky you still have him,"" or ""appreciate him for who he is."" i do not have children and while i'm at an age where i should be concerned with being a father and experiencing the known stress of parents my age, i was consumed with getting all of my father's affairs in order, and eventually pursuing a higher level of care for him.  we have established rituals for losing a loved one, but i have found that there's no playbook for how to cope with the sense of loss around experiencing a loved one's cognitive decline. as a counseling professional and researcher, i am committed to advocating for caregivers and facilitating dialogue in families around coping with the sense of loss around the cognitive decline of a loved one.  perhaps the most meaningful experience i had as a clinician and in my own journey as a caregiver had been a support group i ran for adult caregivers of parents with alzheimer's. i was privileged to hear about how this condition has a profound effect on family dynamics; namely how it creates rifts in a family, but also brings siblings closer. but was was most poignant and empowering for me to hear was the profound sense of purpose in life that some caregivers began to experience when taking on this role.  these experiences led me to pursue a phd in marriage and family therapy at the university of louisiana monroe, where i am writing my dissertation on sibling relationships in the context of dementia care. i recently got approval to begin my study, and am looking for participants to interview around their relationships with siblings and experiences as caregivers. if you are interested in participating, i'd love to hear about your experiences. my expectation is that my study will create an effective framework for clinicians do discuss the emotional aspects of caregiving in a family therapy setting.  please feel free to comment here if you're interested in participating, and i'll provide more information. i understand and respect the sensitive nature of what is discussed in this forum, and got permission from one of the admins before posting this.", [removed],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ds0tah/sibling_relationships_and_a_parents_cognitive/,Sibling relationships and a parent's cognitive decline
background:  i'm 26 m.  i take after my mother's father in almost every aspect genetically and behaviorally.  my grandfather suffered and passed from dementia about 10 years ago at the age of 86.  we were very close and what the whole family had to go through was horrible.  i've been married to my wife now for 3 years and the thought of me eventually having dementia has started to enter my mind.  i don't want my wife to have to deal with this 50-60 years from now.  i don't tell many people but i'm pretty sure my memory is not as good as it could be.  i struggle a lot with remembering peoples names and i cannot immediately recall events that happened even a few years ago.  i'm only 26 but i can't even remember what happened in when i was in high school without prompts from friends.  i know i may just be over-analyzing things but i'm worried nonetheless and not sure what preventative measures to take.  any advice or sources of information would be greatly appreciated.," what type of dementia was in your family? there are 100 classified types of dementia, alzheimer's being the most common. i have the 2nd most common, vascular dementia. it is due to shrinkage of blood circulation in the brain. some forms of dementia are hereditary, but it is @1 percent. ""forgetting things"" is a normal part of the aging process, but you can do things to reduce your risk now: diet, exercise and brain activities. and do some research on your family's types of dementia. if it is genetic, you can be tested, in most cases, at your age to determine if you have that gene. take care!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ds03zh/worried_about_my_future_possibilities_of_dementia/,Worried about my future possibilities of dementia.

"my dad and his dad had a conversation that since he can't drive anymore the best thing to do is to donate his car. grandpa is still struggling to grasp the fact that his condition has made it difficult for him to drive. his doctor told him that he can't drive as his dementia is severe. his doctor and my family fear that he will get lost, end up driving the wrong way or on a sidewalk, or possibly kill someone. his doctor has already told the mva that my grandpa isn't allowed to drive and that if he is driving, hopefully the police will stop him and take him back home without any issues. so dad spoke to a friend of his who runs a car donation company where cars are brought in, checked up, and donated to low income families. the friend said as long as there are no problems with the car, they'll take it. from what i heard, the company is going to pick it up either this week or next week. grandpa, on the other hand, is angry that he will not drive anymore. he will have to rely on family to do the grocery shopping, taking him to the bank and doctors, and other things that require driving. we are deciding on a date of moving him and my grandma into an assisted living and on some days, both will agree to go, but then change their minds. we hope they will accept on living in a new location. we are debating to move them in after christmas. just one more holiday in their home."," maybe donating the car right now is a bit too soon? just make sure he doesn’t have access to the keys. it depends on how advanced his dementia is, but if he forgets frequently perhaps you could come up with a scenario that does not involve him losing the car because he isn’t allowed/able to drive anymore. like pretend he cant use the car until it gets fixed or something and you guys are waiting on a special part.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/drm4mb/donating_grandpas_car_hes_angry/,Donating grandpa's car.

"i wasn’t there for this visit, but it’s honestly put me off going to visit my grandma in the home completely if i’m honest. my aunt and uncle went to see her about a week ago and decided they would come to ours for dinner after the visit. when they came back to ours they were both in shock and very upset and rightly so. apparently when they got there my grandma was in a foul mood, she wasn’t happy to see them and instead was very hostile and saying she shouldn’t be in the home, she wants a lawyer and a family meeting because she shouldn’t be here and we were all horrible for putting her in there. she lived with me and my mum beforehand and when my mums name got brought into the conversation all hell broke loose. they wouldn’t say exactly what she called my mum but they said that my grandma saw her as “the devil” for putting her in there. i’m sure much worse things were said but i’m trying not to let my imagination go too wild but the fact that it made my aunty cry speaks volumes.i know she’ll probably forget the conversation, she was like this when we first moved her in and to be honest we thought she’d forgotten she ever lived with us as at the last visit she thought she’d lived there for a year. it still shocks me how much this disease muddles the mind. another reason i think this could of happened is it was later in the  afternoon when they visited which is when her sundowning tends to start and from my own experience when she lived with us she could be horrid around that time of day. i just hate that someone who used to be so sweet natured and kind could become the total opposite of that. i barely remember the real version of her anymore which is the saddest part. the only thing that brings me any piece of mind is the fact that if the well version of her were to see this happening (like watching through a tv i guess) i like to think she would understand that this is for the best and that she would forgive us. i know you’ll never read this grandma, but i hope you know that we all love you. this wasn’t an easy decision for us to make and you’re in much better hands with the carers than you were with us. we were breaking our backs trying to keep you with us for as long as we could. mum is a good person and deep down i know you know that, she never did this to hurt you."," my mother-in-law and her brother had to stop visiting her mother for quite awhile.  the brother looks just like his father, who had long since passed away.  grandma r. believed that her son was her husband, and that her daughter was ""some hussy"" he was running around with.  it got hot and very emotionally damaging to everyone in the family.  you aren't alone in being distressed like this.  it's not really that helpful to find out that you aren't alone, but it's practically the only comfort anyone could offer you.  we all got through it.  sadly, by the time grandma r. passed away it was a huge relief for everyone. she was mega-tough and held on for over twenty years after her diagnosis with senile dementia. that means our families need to brace themselves for the long haul, with self-care and respite and all that implies.  nobody in their right mind would insist on torturing their own children that way.  so remember her as she was, and take care of the shell that remains, but first and foremost take care of you and your non-senile loved ones so you can bear up for years if you must.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dqsdsd/a_bad_visit/,A bad visit

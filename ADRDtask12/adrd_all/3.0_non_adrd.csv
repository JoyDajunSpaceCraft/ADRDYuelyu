first time poster here; while i always knew my grandpa was slipping more into dementia i wasn’t fully prepared. while my mom was in the kitchen he asked me how my mom was doing. the way he said it made it clear he didn’t know my mom was his daughter of who i was. i cried in the bathroom. not because he didn’t know who i was but because i knew it was the future facing me and my mom. dementia is scary.," my grandmother is going through dementia so i know how it feels. if you ever need someone to talk to, you can always  pm me",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7m3m2a/my_grandpa_doesnt_know_who_i_am/,,My grandpa doesn’t know who I am.
i mean he was a shitty father who used to beat me at any occasion he could find the excuse to. one time he threw me against my bedroom wall after a parent teacher conference and strangled me. he also told me  when i was ten that i shouldn’t exist and i was a mistake. he is dying from alzheimer’s related injuries and i was both his and my mothers inhome caregiver for the past four years or so. i’ve hated him so much over the years especially when he was suffering from the alzheimers. despising that i had to care for this idiot that made my life miserable and i admit that i didn’t care for him as best as i should have.i’ve wanted him to just die already and get it over with but he seems to be taking his sweet time with it though he isn’t expected to last two weeks. im pretty sure my mom and my sister want me to weep and gnash my teen at his death but it’s not gonna happen i think i’ll feel more sad when it comes time to put my dog down than i will at my dads death, dude he's still your father man.. wtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7jq24y/my_dads_dying_in_a_hospital_room_and_i_dont/,,My dads dying in a hospital room and I don’t really feel anything about it except wanting him to get it over with [no regrets]
"whenever i hear stories about depression, anxiety, relative's death, i couldn't care less. my grandparents died from alzheimer's and cancer but i never cared, felt slightly bad because my mother cried but that's about it. whenever people tell me stories about them witnessing death or something tragic happening to them, i don't care at all. my uncle has esophagus cancer, i don't care. i don't know why i'm like this but last time i felt terrible was when i watched the d-day scene from hacksaw ridge.i'm not apathetic or anything like that. i'm happy with my life and it's all cool, it's just that i have trouble giving two fucks about other people and i feel like an asshole.whatever.", so it seems like you are coming to the point of self-actualization that happens in every sociopaths life. this is a very misunderstood term and i suggest you do your own research. they have online tests and such. so check it out and learn how to function within society. i have met other sociopaths who are totally fine people and contribute to the world and have families and everything. it does not at all mean you have a tendency towards harm. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7ennq4/i_dont_care_about_others/,,I don't care about others
"[remorse] long post ahead.so, i'm a 19 year old university dropout with no prospects in life who has had the misfortune of living with my grandmother (nana) for the past 6 months. we live in the seventh floor of a condo, and since the rest of my family lives in a house in the path of hurricane irma, they evacuated to the condo. as i've mentioned in a previous post, i live with nana because she has alzheimer's and can't live alone anymore, but that's not the only reason. i've always been a terrible person. okay, maybe i didn't start out that way. i mean, who does? from the age of 6 until i was about 10, i was physically abused by my mother, with punishments ranging from getting my hands ziptied behind my back and thrown into a closet, to being drugged to make me shut up, to being chased around with a knife, to being forced to eat crayons, to just plain having the shit beaten out of me, to being forced to strip naked and do homework to earn my clothes back. (the therapist was in disbelief when i told her about that one, and i had to convince her that it was sadly a true story.) from the age of 6 til, hell, even now, i've been emotionally abused by my mother. she's called me a slew of different names throughout the years, and ever since she found out i was even remotely interested in being sexually active, she's added ""slut"" to that list of words, and as soon as i started gaining weight (i used to be a pretty skinny girl, but now, i'm 5'5"" and 190 pounds), she's added ""fat"" to that list of words. even when she's not outright abusive, she's still pretty harmful, with her constant hints that i should go on a diet, and the snide jokes about my university (the one i dropped out of) being a school that only the dumbest of the dumb get into. she's been through therapy, and she's stopped being physically abusive, and she's ""apologized"" for the (physical) abuse (although she still justifies it by saying that i really was a demon child and that beating me into submission was the only way to get me to behave), and she thinks that's enough. like that's supposed to undo *years* worth of torment that is still going on to this day. of course, the only reason she did all this is because i was a shitty kid. i'll rephrase that. a difficult kid. according to my mother, i threw way more temper tantrums than ""normal"" kids my age (that's another thing she did, she always tried to convince me i had autism), although there's no way i could have proven that, since i was homeschooled up until sophomore year of high school. at the age of 6, i probably threw an equal amount of hissy fits as my peers, and she was just telling me that i had more just to tear me down. however, later on, she was right. i grew up, and while the people my age grew out of their tantrums, i kept having them, and i still do sometimes. as a matter of fact, i think the tantrums got worse with age, both for the people around me, and myself. i feel like i only continued the tantrums because the abuse warped my brain and made me crazy, though.over the years, i started becoming more rebellious and more of a (deliberate) pain in the ass. once i started sophomore year of high school, i had crushes on so many different guys who were too heartless to return the feelings, and i took this out on my family. i screamed and cried to them endlessly about how much of a social misfit i was, all because i spent the previous 10 years of my life isolated from people my age and never ended up developing the people skills typical of a 15 year old girl. this was of course, brushed off with a ""it's not my fault you have ass burgers. you're socially retarded!"" one time, in my 2nd semester of sophomore year, my mom hacked my facebook, and wrote a bunch of posts as me that were supposed to be me putting myself down and describing how much i treat my family like shit. she did this once back when i was 13, too, but since i had more friends this time, it hurt even more. for proof i'm not lying, pm me, i have a link to an old deviantart journal i wrote in 2012 with some of the things she said pasted in.one night when i was 15, i overheard my parents fantasizing about murdering me, and i decided to tell a teacher. little did i know that teachers have to report that shit to child protective services, or whoever deals with all that, and my parents got a call saying that detectives were going to come to our house and do an investigation. my parents treated me like shit for the rest of the day, and i escalated the situation and became ferociously violent. i threw drink tumblers at my mom, and i picked up a barstool and swung at my dad's legs. before the detectives even got there, my dad called 911 on me and since my mom had been recording the incident on her phone the whole time, i got my ass thrown in jail. i was there for like a day before being put on home detention. i obviously didn't learn much, because i still hit my 13 year old sister when she's *really* pissing me off and trying her hardest to make my day a miserable one. i started getting even worse. i stopped even remotely caring about my grades, and i scouted yik yak at my school for sex all the time. (i went to high school on a college campus, and even though i was like 17 at the time, i didn't give a shit about sleeping with older men.) i didn't really sleep around until i turned 18 (the soonest i legally could), but since my mom thought that's what i was already doing, i figured i might as well live up to the reputation. that, and i continued the pattern of eating everything i could find, which caused me to turn into the fucking landwhale i am now. i argued with my mother basically every day, and in those arguments, my youngest sister always butted in and took her side. when those arguments turned to temper tantrums, the first person to feel my wrath was usually this sister. she has really sensitive ears and hearing, so one time, i screamed at the top of my lungs right into her ear. things like that, along with my attitude, my unwillingness to clean up after myself and do household work, my self-centered princess demeanor, and my extremely liberal political views which have led to me publicly blasting my mother on facebook for something shitty and insensitive she's said multiple times, have led to a mutual agreement that it would be best if i moved out. january of this year, i moved in to my former university, and i dropped out in march and moved to nana's where i am now. there's only been two times i've lived with my family since then. once in may, when my mom and nana went on a cruise, and just this weekend, when hurricane irma pummeled florida. both instances, i've physically attacked that 13 year old sister for chipping away at the dam that holds my borderline personality disordered thoughts in and eventually breaking it. the first time, she was just mercilessly roasting me for being a bad person. not going to deny it, but ouch. i tried to slam her head against the kitchen table repeatedly half hoping that i'd bust her skull open, but i was too weak for that, and it didn't actually happen. just tonight, she went into a box and took something of mine, and refused to give it back, (and i was already in a piss poor mood) so i held her down on my bed (we were in my room) and started to slam my fist down wherever i saw fit. later on, she tried taking that same thing again, and i smacked her in the back of the head. i feel like a monster just typing this out. i feel like even more of a monster because i felt good after it, like i wanted to do it again. maybe it was an endorphin rush or something.i'm remorseful. not remorseful that i've been hitting her specifically, because she's a real bitch, but remorseful that i did it in general. this is going to be the kind of thing that prevents me from having a family of my own when i get older. i don't ever want children, and one of those reasons is because even before i started hitting my sister, i knew i was predisposed to be an abusive parent. it only makes sense. my mother was abused by nana, and she grew up to abuse me. and well? now i know that i'm an abusive piece of shit. it's probably not just limited to kids, either. if i ever had a boyfriend who stuck around longer than three months, i would probably whale on them too. i'd be hopeful that i can recover, but considering the overwhelming negative response to anyone who's outed as an abuser, even someone who was formerly abusive on my online social circle, i have serious doubts. can i stop being this way? how? am i a bad person?"," i'm so, so sorry this happened. no person should ever have to go through anything like this. i really wish the best for you, and hope that you can change your life. continue with therapy, take the necessary medications (if applicable), and cut yourself away from your family (if possible). if you hope to continue with your education, i recommend starting at a community college and maybe transferring. however, this is totally up to you. if i were in your position, i'd want to move to the other side of the world, as far from your family as possible. as far as the physical abuse is concerned, it's really not your fault, but your mother's, for being the horrible parent. your sister sounds like a pain in the ass too. i hope this helped. all the best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6zkykz/support_only_im_becoming_physically_abusive/,,[Support Only] I'm becoming physically abusive.
"my grandmother is 86 now and not doing so well mentally. she doesn't have full-blown altzheimer's, but her dementia is slowly getting worse. my family gets together at her house every year because she lives in the town where they're all from, but it seems like no one actually enjoys being around her anymore. she does the typical things of an old person with dementia: tells stories over and over or even makes them up, mixes up people's names, asks the same question 10 times in a day, etc. but she does some things that are actually very disturbing. sometimes if she gets frustrated with something and we try to help her or remind or of something she forgot, she gets angry and says ""you guys just think i'm old! i must be stupid."" and of course everyone consoles her and says ""no one thinks that! we love you!"" i'm sure this comes from her being self-conscious about her age. she says a lot of things just to get a reaction out of the family or provoke an argument. she hates opening up to people or even being around when someone is having a deep discussion. i don't blame her entirely for the way she is; she had a rough upbringing and didn't have a great relationship with my grandfather. but nevertheless, it's so **maddening** to be around her. i can't help but love her a little bit (i kinda have to, because she's my grandma), but i honestly don't think i'll even cry at her funeral.", i may have alzheimer's but at least i don't have alzheimer's ,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6v8q22/i_cant_wait_for_my_grandmother_to_die/,,I can't wait for my grandmother to die...

"[remorse] it happened two years ago. i lived with my grandma, and while i thought i had grown out of young, idiot impulses, i apparently hadn't. ""what's the harm in adopting a dog? we already have one, she needs a friend. everybody says you should adopt anyways, it's the good thing to do right?""so i went to the pound, and picked out the only dog there that wasn't a barking pit bull (yes, i am biased against them, i was bit by one as a child, but this post is all about how i'm shitty and don't deserve a dog). he was a handsome american hound dog named rocko. when i asked for his backstory i was told he belonged to a little old lady who couldn't walk him, so she gave him up. scoffing at such a silly reason to release your dog like the judgmental prick we all are when we hear these stories, i brought my own dog up to meet rocko, and once satisfied they would get along, brought him home.except home was very different.rocko quickly became aggressive to my dog, and attempted to establish himself as alpha. i told myself dogs are animals and just need to work it out on their own, but i felt like a slighted parent every time this strange dog would snarl at her. then there was the training. my girl had been so easy to train, so quick and eager to please, i had taken for granted how great she was. but rocko was an absolute nightmare to try to teach. he was stubborn, and uninterested in any reward that didn't come freely. if i called his name and he was otherwise interested in something else he ignored me (an incident that almost caused an issue when my grandmother accidentally dropped his leash outside and he went after a neighbor dog). beyond being unable to give him simple commands, rocko was the most ill mannered dog i had ever come across. he took food off the table even if you were present (but he would always take it if you weren't), would challenge you for your own food, knocked over garbage cans and tore up tissue boxes, and could spend an hour outside and come back inside to crap somewhere twenty minutes later. and he howled, oh did he howl. he howled at people walking down the street, at squirrels darting through the yard. he even howled if people on the television were talking too loudly.i told myself i would win against this four legged nightmare. i could turn him into a pup with all the manners, docility, and training of my other dog. so i worked, day and night, for months. we even went to an obedience class at the local petsmart, but rocko was denied admittance for being too excited/aggressive towards the other dogs. no matter how many times i tried to coax him with rewards, or how many videos i watched, how many nights i woke up to the smell of shit, he simply showed zero improvement. finally, about three months in, i had an incident where i desperately wanted to strike rocko, and realized i was not the owner he needed.i wanted to find him a home, but my grandmother loved him dearly at this point (which i admit caused issues with his training when she deemed a tactic, such as crating, too cruel). so i acquiesced, and moved away with my own dog to my own place, for many reasons but not the least of which being i could no longer stand to be around rocko. i left them in their happy, chaotic lifestyle.just last month the family came to the devastating realization my grandmother has dementia, and cannot be allowed to live on her own. she would have to move in with my mother, who could not take rocko as well. so he had to find a new home, and so i started looking. he's a cute dog, and several people were interested in him, but all of them had the same (valid) questions: how is he? i couldn't bring myself to lie to them, to put them through what i had been through. i smiled and said ""he's very sweet, but he has a few bad habits you'll have to break"". only one person inquired further, and even then they ultimately decided he wasn't worth the hassle. i tried several rescues, but all were full or didn't respond to me- the one that did respond was eight hours away.so, i was faced with two choices: keep rocko myself, and lay in the bed i made for myself by agreeing to adopt him in the first place, or send him back to the pound he came from.god forgive me, i took him back. i'm so sorry. i'll never do it again.

"for the backstory:  i've been dealing with a dead bedroom on an off for the last few years.  in fact, i could probably say that since my daughter was born, i've dealt with these issues.   she is about 9.when she was born, i was going through a lot of grief.  my mother died, my dad was sick (would eventually learn he had cancer, which he eventually lost that battle a year and a half later), and we had the stress of a new baby.  i'll admit that during this time, my sex drive tanked.however, i dealt with the losses.  it took time, but my libido came back.  i was feeling like my normal self again.  but my wife never really recovered.  she did bring it up once in a while during my ""drought"" but when i did respond, she never really did as well (odd, i know).well, as my libido returned, it came along with a lot of frustration.  we were averaging 1x a month.  this was causing a lot of fights.  however, around the end of 2012, my wife suggested a compromise.  she saw on some talk show a couple that had some challenges like we had.  what a counselor suggested was having a date night once a week, we're we'd take turns planning out a date, and then having sex.this worked out nicely.  for about 2 months.   then we started to fall back to our old 1x a month routine.   and the fights came back too.   i'd put all the effort into our date nights, but she wouldn't.  going as far as saying ""time to stick it in"", and not put any effort into it.so we dropped the idea of a weekly date night.but since then i think we've, on average, come to happy medium.  there would be fights here and there, promises would be made, only to be forgotten, or ignored.  but we had been averaging 1x a week.  once bitten, twice as shy.  i have needs, and when we go a while without sex, i feel it.  i'm human and i have no regrets nor shame for feeling those needs.  but now i can't help but feel like an asshole, a selfish one.  as the title says, my wife's mother is dying.  she was diagnosed with alzheimer's a few years ago, and she has taken a turn for the worse the past few weeks.  my wife has told me she has accepted what is happening a while back, but i know this is a difficult time for her. i'm not pushing my wife for anything.  i don't want to cause her any more grief, but i'm dying inside.  i don't want to see our dead bedroom return either.  i've had the misfortune of experiencing one for many years."," it's not really my thing but i had ""no more mr nice guy"" recommended to me recently. i've just started reading it and some of the things you mention here are textbook examples of the kind of harmful male behaviours that it addresses. give it a try.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/4xzn3a/i_feel_like_a_selfish_asshole_my_needs_arent/,,"I feel like a selfish asshole.

hopeless as i did sees this, and decides to take action, whether it be honest or not. i spent a large portion of my life depressed, waiting for something to happen, but only after i started taking initiative and risks did anything meaningful materialize."," damn, good job!   i wish i could be that resourceful.   you know anyone going into human services, talk them out of it!  field sucks, it's

times and it would have never come off better. i was simply on fire that day. after the first in person interview they offered me a job on the spot. pressing my luck, i mentioned i had another current offer on the table and would like an extra 48 hours to decide, hoping to gain a signing bonus. the next day i received a call, saying they had upped their offer. it was for a salary that was over two times i had ever made in my life. i figured at this point what was the worst that could happen? maybe i'll get a week or two of paychecks before firing me. but that didn't happen. while in a lead generation role, my main goal was to create leads (shocker, i know) however, within my first month i got insanely lucky and struck a guy who basically allowed me to close a major deal essentially over the phone. after hearing the details, my impressed manager allowed me to attend the actual in person meeting, and credited me with the commission.i've been promoted 4 times since then, after starting off making around $50,000 a year (almost $25,000 a year more then i ever made before) to now my current role 6 years later. i eventually even told my former supervisor (i am in a higher department than he is currently) over a few drinks and after few years of success, and while he made me swear to never tell anyone else due to hr, commended me for it. to normal people i lied, but in the sales world i was resourceful, persuasive, innovative, and daring, all of which are integral qualities in the industry and in which helped catapult me into a better financial thought than i ever could of dreamed of.why am i sharing this? well for one, i can assure you it isn't guilt. as i stated before, if anything i think the experience showed more relevant talents to the actual job than an accurate resume ever could. the real reason for writing this can be boiled down to two points, 1: i never have gotten the chance to really brag about it due to the nature of the story, and as an ego driven person, do occasionally crave attention, whether it be good or bad. secondly, however, is the hope that someone who felt as hopeless as i did sees this, and decides to take action, whether it be honest or not. i spent a large portion of my life depressed, waiting for something to happen, but only after i started taking initiative and risks did anything meaningful materialize."," it would take

"tl;dr: boo hoo my life has been *really* shitty, and i'm having a hard time coping with it.obviously dealing with some depression over this... anyway.i was very sick growing up, until i had multiple extensive surgeries when i was nine i had spent more time in doctors offices and hospitals than i did in school. i went to one of the best medical schools in the country, twice, and they couldn't figure out why i was so sick. i had to be homeschooled on two separate occasions because any exposure to more germs would have killed me. i'm allergic to most antibiotics, which has also not made life easy. again, i have almost died from allergic reactions, and was even a few hours away from becoming an amputee because the doctors had only one general antibiotic they could give me, which thankfully saved my leg. after surgery, my health started to improve and i got to be an actual kid for once, but i was left with permanent fatigue issues, and a weakened immune system. it's practically guaranteed that i will get sick every time i travel outside of town, attend a large event, or become intimate with someone. when i get sick, i'm bed-ridden for up to a week on average, which makes a long term job nearly impossible to maintain.on top of all of this, i have endured an obscene amount of abuse growing up. after my health started to improve, my parent's narcissism came crawling out in an alcohol-induced fury, to a point that i chose homelessness over having a roof over my head for the last of my teen years. and i endured a lot more on my own from being taken advantage of due to my naivety. i survived, though. somehow... through all of this, i've maintained a relatively stable mental and emotional clarity. i lived, i made it to adulthood! i'm not a crazy piece of trash, or a drug addict! i don't have to take eight pills a day to function like i did as a kid! this shit is amazing to me. hell, making it out of my childhood is amazing to me. through all of this, through the abuse i endured growing up, i couldn't wait to make it to adulthood, i couldn't wait to start my own family and become a mother, a better mother than my own. have my own career, or a lucrative creative outlet while raising my family; whether as a housewife or a career-woman. goddamnit, i would think about this on a daily basis for years.then, i almost died in a car accident. i lived, but not without receiving moderate brain damage... it's been almost four years, and was easily one of the most traumatic things i've experienced. even getting raped wasn't anywhere near as bad as hearing your best friend screaming that they're burning, and there's nothing you can do to help them while the world looks sideways because you can't figure out where the ground is. while i don't have to deal with anywhere near as many problems now as i used to, i can still feel a piece of my mind missing, a good chunk of ""me"" didn't come back from that experience. the brain damage, while mostly gone, was extensive enough to where i now suffer from narcolepsy. luckily i don't have cataplexy, which means i won't have my lisence taken away, for now...along with all of this, in my mid-teens i started to deal with heart palpitations. it was brushed off as anxiety, at first, but after constant palpitations and fainting spells over many months, my doctors were able to determine i have tachycardia. although it wasn't until the beginning of this year that we discovered *why* i have tachycardia. it runs in my family, and it was suspected by extended family members, but my parents were so focused on trying to cure everything else i was dealing with, they didn't look into anything that wasn't directly correlating to my illness.with this long list of everything else, i get diagnosed with marfan syndrome. i get diagnosed with this, and the narcolepsy within two months of each other. i can't have children, because it will make my heart and/or arteries explode. i can't do anything beyond basic exercises, because my heart will explode. i can no longer hold a full time job, and haven't for years, because my brain cannot regulate my sleep. i can barely hold a part time job, because i will regularly sleep for 16 hours and my multiple alarms will not wake up. on top of becoming sick *every* time new people are hired. hell, i may not even be able to *drive myself around* in a few years depending on how my narcolepsy develops, if it decides to get worse. i may make it to my sixties, but then my heart will explode.i may make it to my fifties, but i will have early onset alzheimer's. because of my brain damage and dementia running in my family, it is practically guaranteed that i will lose my mind at a young age.i refuse to succumb to dementia. i refuse to lose my mind *again,* and when this starts, i'm killing myself. i will not turn into a rotting shell of a human like i the ones i have worked with in the past. i'm in my mid twenties, more than likely, i am halfway through my life, and i don't even know if it's worth it to try and do anything to build up to a better one, knowing what's ahead of me. i am not suicidal, thankfully. if i were to kill myself, i would have to be okay with figuratively killing -at minimum- six other people. i cannot do that to the people i love, i cannot kill someone else who has so much potential to be great. so i will stay alive for as long as i can, until i start to mentally slip away and can't come back. but by then my anchors will be their own people, and will be old enough to understand my reasoning. i have the opportunity to invest in a small house, and i feel i could use that as a starting point to owning a few small rental properties in the long run, building up until i have enough income from tenants that i don't have to struggle with a job due to my health. although it is still hard ass work, and i will have to do a lot of complicated work on my own, or pay others to do it, i would at least be able to work on my own schedule, to an extent. even though you are basically on call 100% of the time, there's nothing that would stop me from having an assistant of some kind, aside from a financial aspect.many people will say, and have said; ""why not apply for disability benefits?"" i know how terrible of a choice that is. i am too ambitious to settle for less than $700 a month. i am too frugal to not have a savings account, which puts you at risk for losing your benefits. even though i cannot consistently work well, i am still too much of a workaholic to be capable of spending all of my time not working, i feel like that would make me go insane even quicker than what i'm already dealing with. and there are plenty of people that need the benefits much more desperately than i do.it's just... i wish i wasn't broken. i wish i could one day experience being pregnant, experience having a job for more than two years, and, hell, even just a normal rem cycle for just one night would be nice. i talk to other people, who have had the most uneventful, safe, oblivious lives... life has never been something that is close to being fair. but goddamnit sometimes the sheer difference in scale of bad luck that i have had compared to others is agonizing.but hey, at least i don't have cancer.[remorse]: if you feel bad", i'm your age and i refuse to believe i'm going to die at 50 too so neither are you. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3y2u4y/support_only_im_not_even_25_yet_and_im_already/,,"[Support Only] I'm not even 25 yet and I'm already halfway through my lifespan.

"[remorse]: 'you killed my mother'i used to work at a care home for old age pensioners with severe dementia, the residents we're not there to get better but to put it bluntly, where there to be comfortable before they pass. well there was an old lady, a lovey lady who had been there for a long time, a friend of mine, she felt like family to me. (for the sake of confusion i'll call her the fake name of beth) beth became very ill and unresponsive as time went on, still alive, however the dementia had gotten so server that she was always confused, lost her speech and had no awareness on what was happening around her, she was there physically, but not mentally, a horrible thing to see and say however this was the case.we invited beths children in to discus about a dnr (do not resuscitate), i was involved in the meeting as i was one of her closest carers, knew her the best. during these meetings there always has to be an expert in dnr with us during the conversations who would have done many tests prier to the meeting to decide weather a resident (this case beth) was responsive enough to make the decision by them self, he decided beth was not able to so it was her families choice. the family said no to a dnr, a decision i disagreed with however it's there choice so i agreed.less than a week later beth had stopped breathing early in the morning, due to her condition we had to check her every 10 minutes so no more than 10 minutes had passed. she had passed peacefully without pain in a comfy bed but despite how badly i did not want to i had to move her from her bed to the hard floor to perform cpr on her until the on call nurse came by to state that she can not be saved. during the process of me giving her cpr i broke three of her ribs due to how frail she was, if she came back to life in my pinion she would have only stayed alive for a day or two but in enormous pain.when the family was told that beth had passed her daughter came down to discuss and seemed more interested in blaming us, saying that we did not do a good enough job than about her mothers death, beths daughter pointed at me and said to my face 'you killed my mother'. i did not, yes i felt she should have been put on a dnr and i hate myself for breaking the ribs of someone who was not alive mentally or physically but despite that, i did what the family wanted and tried to bring her mother back to life. sometimes you have to let go and and except that the person breathing who is alive physically isn't alive mentally, it's the hardest thing to do and i understand that not everyone can except that.i don't know how horrible it is to lose a parent, one day i will but not today, so i understand her daughters anger towards me and won't hold a grudge. i did the wrong thing in my mind but the correct thing by following orders of the residents family. it hurt me so much to have someone say 'you killed my daughter' when in reality i did not. my job wasn't to heal people, it's to make them comfortable in the last chapter of their life. i've forgive the daughter for her words and am okay if she continues to blame me, if it helps her move on from the loss of her mother than i am okay to hold her hatred. i don't feel bad because beth died however i feel bad for her daughter and wish it was different.i've never told a friend, a family member or a partner this and only recently told someone anonymous on reddit about it for the first time, it felt good to get it out so i wish to share it here. this happened half a year ago and i'm not the type of person to talk about what goes on in my head, i find it easier to bottle everything up and simply forget about it however i can't seem to move on from this. mods if this post is the wrong place than please remove, i got banned from offmychest for posting this there for reasons that they won't say so hope not to get banned from here, please just remove if necessary.**tl:dr** i performed cpr on a resident that had passed mentally and now physically, the family would not allow a dnr so i was following there request, the resident did not come back to life and her daughter blames me for her death, she said 'you killed my mother' to i and that worst thing someone has ever said to me. i still feel horrible half a year on.", my dad warned me about that could happen when i tried my hand volunteering at the er. you did your best but when our time is up its up. beth's suffering is over.,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3wjhj9/you_killed_my_mother_the_words_said_to_me_that_i/,,"""You killed my mother"" The words said to me that I still find hard to forget about, I feel bad about the situation but shouldn't."
"[remorse]:  i was born with some birth defects that among other things make it hard for me to use my legs and make me physically weak.  i can get by normally, and indeed if someone didn't know i *appear* fine, but on bad days walking more than a block down the street causes severe pain (on a good day i've hiked 2-3 miles before and really enjoyed it).  this isn't really about that, though, as i've long ago learned to just deal with my issues.  growing up my parents more or less made me feel pretty useless.  my dad is a very hands on kind of guy and he's said he was hoping for a son that was a football player and went into a career like carpentry.  both of those things are widely outside of what i'd ever be capable of, baring reincarnation.  i'm fine with that too.  i'm two weeks from getting my masters' degree in a field i love, and i know the most important thing is that i'm happy with where i'm at, but my parents' activity still really grates on me.  whenever i have to do something overly physical like help fix the house or work on my car my dad makes a big show about showing me how to do it ""the right way"" and that i ""need to put more effort"" into it, when i'm doing all i can to keep from literally breaking my back.  i had surgery around age 11 and he also made a big deal of going through the motions of physical therapy with me, but always put the focus on how much better he could do it than i could, to the point that i destroyed the tools we used to do the therapy so he'd stop.  not the best reaction and looking back i wish i'd have done more of the therapy, but an 11 year old isn't exactly the best at decision making.  my mom is better at putting on a facade, but one time when i was in a wheel chair after surgery she accidentally dropped me a two step drop coming out of church.  i fell out and screamed when my casts hit the pavement, because that's typically what people do when they get injured.  not a single ""are you okay"" or anything of the like, just a quick scoop back into the chair and rushed off.  once in the van i got a lecture about not embarrassing them in from of their friends.  it's just one example, but this attitude gets displayed occasionally still even today.  i've tried over the year multiple times to talk to it but my mom sometimes throws a temper tantrum like she's 2 or something.  i wish that was a joke, but it's not.  i ran away from home once, which made them take me more seriously at least for a few months, but it didn't last and they eventually found ways to spin it back towards their own narcissism.  i eventually managed to move out, after adopting a strategy of just biding my time and waiting for a good chance to get away from them.  my younger sister had worse luck and eventually just left when apparently she started to get the full force of their ire.  she's been sleeping on her friends' couch for the past 6 months or so.overall i don't hate my parents, even for this and the fact that they didn't help me with my degree.  they aren't obligated to, but considering the only way i can support myself is with a desk job, which i will have quite a few more open to me with a degree, i see it more of an investment, especially because they've told me that i'm their retirement plan.  that brings us to the point of the confession.  while i think it's a very sad affair, my mom is starting to show signs of dementia, and my dad is still working past retirement age and isn't a spring chicken anymore too.  sometime in the next 6 months i'm likely going to have to tell them that i'm not able to help them financially, because i have student loans to repay, need to move for a new job to a more expensive area, etc.  i'm not in a bad position financially, especially if all i need to take care of is myself, but there's no way i can take on my parents burden.  this isn't a ""college student moves back in with parents because of the job market"" situation, but a ""young adult graduates college to job as full time caretaker of parents"" situation.  i'm kind of looking forward to telling them that i can't take care of them, because then maybe they'll feel an iota of what i felt growing up.  if they had helped me through college i would be very eager to return the favor, but as it stands i had to go to great lengths to seek out other people and institutions to invest in me.  i'm big on paying it back, i'm just going to pay it back to the people who actually helped me in a dignified manner rather than made me feel like a useless sack of flesh.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3vq25r/im_mildly_physically_disabled_and_my_parents_made/,,I'm mildly physically disabled and my parents made me feel useless.

"okay, a bit of back story. so since i was a young lad i have been absolutely fascinated with stories of murders or stalkings. one thing that i noticed was, i only deemed the really sick and twisted ones to be worth my time. 3 people killed in a random home invasion? ok. a person tortured by a mentally deranged psychopath? lets hear it! of course i knew it was wrong, and it still bothered me that people could do this to other human beings, but i could not stop being fascinated by these individuals. in movies, those bad guys who were evil and insane were my favorite. i was always disappointed when they were stopped because i wanted to see them do more bad guy things. as i got older, and gained access to the internet, i read more of these psycho killer stories. i also discovered creepy pastas, my favorites being things like 1999 and ""your secret admirer"" where a clearly deranged and sick individual is featured, i had little interest in the rake or slender man. though, there was one story of the rake where the protagonist went insane, killed his parents and his little brother, and then himself, all while laughing. i read this story many times over. every time i read it, i wondered why. what made this boy go so south? the rake, of course, but i desired to know on a.... deeper level. i eventually discovered mental disorders, like schizophrenia and the such. i remember my first all nighter was reading a wiki page about them. i was so intrigued, fascinated by these things! i was excited to learn more and it became a hobby. i ""diagnosed"" the boy in the rake story with dementia and ptsd, due to his delusions about how killing his family woud 'save them' and being traumatized by the rake himself, only to snap years later after being tormented by nightmares and haulicinations. i felt proud, accomplished and excited that i knew really ""why"". ""diagnosing"" people in stories and news reports was a knew favorite hobby. over time, i got better at it. i discovered true scary stories, a whole new door for me as i knew these had actually happened to people, and i was ""diagnosing"" real people, unlike clearly fake creepy pastas. enter mia. 7th grade, a diagnosed girl with bipolar disorder is in my english class. she had a history of trying to kill herself twice, and trying to hurt her parents on the second attempt when they tried to stop her. she was a little cute, i guess in terms of looks, but she was my first real crush or ""love"" as i thought as a 7th grader. i talked to her daily. we had long conversations at a picnic bench outside of a park near our school, and i cared for her so much. i mean, i've had a few crushes before and since, but i've never cared so deeply about someone outside of my parents, ever. i guess i kinda loved her. i would try my best to help her, talk about her disorder with her, and she got so much better in the two years we knew each other. unfortunately, she moved away at the end of 5th grade. i remember our last day together, it was the saddest i've ever had. i got two things from mia. one, i'm drawn to mentally deranged women. second, i found something i enjoy more than ""diagnosing"" psychopaths- helping them. i honestly find that almost none of the kids at my school(currently a sophomore in highschool) are interesting or i like. online, i love talking to clinical psychopaths and sociopaths, and still reading about the mentally deranged. i understand them so well. i want to talk to them more, exposé myself more. so, to the confession. i want to work in a mental hospital or asylum. i want to diagnose these people, care for them, hear there sick stories, and be with them. i want it to be my career, to care for and treat the criminal/mentally insane because i enjoy it more than anything. and, i know it's crazy, but i truly believe i will find true love at a place like this. i've never had feelings for any girl other than mia that were more than ""oh, she's cute, i guess"" i'm scared to tell others about this, i know they won't understand. why would i want to work there for my career? why would i be attracted to the criminaly/ mentally insane? i plan on telling my parents when i go to the clubhouse to college, as psychology will be my major. as for now, i study psychology as much as i can.sorry for how long this was. got a whole life's worth of stuff to confess.[no regrets]", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3ral4a/what_i_want_to_do_for_a_living_no_one_i_know/,,"What I want to do for a living, no one I know would understand...."

complaining about their problems that only they perceive.  if by some chance you, the reader, make it to end, then let me direct you to the focus of this post - it is a massive, massive cry for help.  i am lost beyond all measure and i am too much of a pussy to kill myself.  still with me?  cool.  let's get to it.i am freakishly large.  like, big show large.  i'm not quite as tall as him, but at 6'6"" and 507lbs, the difference in height is negligible at this point.  i always have been.  at first, when i was ridiculed and punished in school for this, i began to feel like an outcast.  but, as i entered high school, i began to develop an outwardly defense mechanism to this by making fun of myself before others could.  in doing this, i would steal all of their thunder and leave them with tired insults that i'd heard a million times before.  inside, however, i pitied them.  i had compassion for those who sought to destroy me.  why did they feel like i was the perpetual target to better their self image by destroying mine?  shit, i even started to embrace it, thinking i was enlightened and making the world a better place by sacrificing my own happiness.  i still do, to a degree, because i value the laugh above every other thing in the universe.  if i can make people happy by shutting myself down, i'm game.  so, at this point in my life, i'm moderately ok with being big.  i should also point out that i was molested as a kid by a family friend (male), but i personally don't feel like it affects me.  i'm only pointing it out to further paint a picture of what my life has been like.let's move on to the few years after high school.  i graduated with an academic honors diploma, was prepped to go to college with a pretty decent scholarship, began smoking cigarettes (one of the worst decisions in my life), had a girlfriend that satisfied my needs in most ways imaginable, and got along well with my parents (who i still lived with).  i got a job over the summer to save money to help pay for school.  everything was going well.  my band was playing shows every weekend and was actually gaining some steam in my city's punk rock community.  it didn't matter that i was fat.  i was loved, and loved everyone.i crashed my car.  because of this, i was forced into a 6 year loan to buy a car with my credit score, as my parents had just filed for bankruptcy.  so, here i am, making around $220 a week, paying $390 a month for this car, as i wasn't approved for any other cars, paying for everything with my girlfriend, and being her personal taxi service.  rip college.  i'll say it was because of not being able to afford it, with some semblance of honesty, but it was more due to laziness.  i had just graduated and the thought of no more school was too tempting.  the band and girlfriend were too important to focus on anything else.then i met ""p.""  p showed up to every show we played, as her and our bass player had been friends prior to my meeting her.  i fell for her instantly.  we talked on the phone all night every night i wasn't with my current girlfriend (which was becoming more and more often due to fighting and her lack of self esteem).  eventually, i finally had had enough of current girlfriend and broke up with her.  she accepted it, but as a slightly crazy and definitely immature girl, made problems for me for a while afterwards (slashing tires, throwing rocks through windows, etc).  what i didn't know, was that p was straight edge and didn't believe in having premarital sex.  no big deal - i'm a silver tongued devil.  it'll happen.  two months go by without so much as a boob touch.  we're in a relationship at this point, since i didn't mention it.  two months.  no sex.  and i love sex.  i love it.  not because of the physical feeling of it, but because of the emotional connection and trust between myself and my partner.  it was killing me.  so, after a night out with p, i return home, alone.  p was too hot.  she was perfect.  i even called her that ""perfect p.""  alas, the admiral took the wheel that night and i called my ex gf, telling her to come over so we could ""talk.""  she knew what i wanted.  she got all dolled up and came on over.  within minutes, we were fucking like the freaks we used to be.  after i finished, i knew i had fucked up.  i was in love with p.  i didn't love my ex anymore.  and i told her that.  this is in the top five things in my life i wish i had never done.  i destroyed that poor girl.  i mean, leveled her.  i suppose what is going on now is punishment for this and a few other despicable things i've done in my life.  after my ex left, i called p up crying.  i fucking lied to her.  my ex had already called her somehow and told her what had happened saying that i had happy face underwear on to prove she had been at my house.  somehow, i convinced p that she was lying and she had just guessed what underwear i was wearing.  don't ask me how i did it.  silver tongued devil, remember?  this night is the night i consider to be the crux of the downhill slope of my life.so, p and i stay together.  i treated her like a princess, partially out of guilt, but more because i had wised up a little since my ex.  we have sex.  lots of it.  i thought my ex was a freak, but once i got the ball rolling, so to speak, with p, she couldn't get enough.  i'm not trying to brag, but that's the way it was.  two years later, i'm thinking about asking p to marry me and start a family.  i hadn't said anything to her yet, but i was reasonably certain she'd say yes.  things were working out.  her family loved me, and i loved them.  hell, it's been 7 years since this all happened, and i still talk to her brother multiple times a week.  my family loved her, and she loved all of them.  i had a big, wonderful family that i definitely took for granted at this point in my life.  two weeks before i got my just punishment for cheating on p, my uncle died of cancer.  that was my first death in my adult life.  i took it pretty hard.  i cried a lot.  two weeks later, p breaks up with me out of the blue.  soon after that, i find out she's engaged and pregnant with this other guy's child.  i thought this was rock bottom.  there was no way out of this, but if only i'd known.  besides, that's what i get for cheating, right?a few depression filled months later, a family friend (not the one that molested me) died of throat cancer.  about a month after his funeral, my dad has quadruple bypass surgery.  this.  this is the real beginning of the end.after my dad's quadruple bypass, his health just free falls.  not only is his heart an issue, but his diabetes goes above and beyond all measure of out of control.  he develops gangrene in his legs.  his kidney (he only had one) starts shutting down.  he gets copd and has to be on oxygen all the time.  he's essentially confined to his bed for 22/24 hours out of the day.  my mom and i's focus in life becomes caring for him.  at this point, i'm still in decent shape.  i'm around 405, lots of muscle, lots of determination, a zest for life, and a big smile on my face.  my mom starts to get sick with diabetes as well.  for her, it was neuropathy.  she had a lot of trouble walking for any length of time and had no way to alleviate the pain.  my grandpa (dad's dad) had alzheimer's and it progressed into near dementia.  my dad, who had previously worked two jobs, had his own hvac/handyman business (that he named partially after me, since i worked with him a lot), and still managed to be a big part of my life, went on disability and left his employer of 25 years.  our financial stability was shattered.  my mom's gambling addiction exploded.  i don't blame her for any of the things she did in this time.  our home life was, simply put, miserable.  she stole money.  from my dad and me.  up until then, my mom was your textbook wife and mother.  she cooked, cleaned, micromanaged the day to day, and worked.  sometimes two jobs.  my parents were incredible.  they were saints.  absolute saints.  no matter what i did with my life, they supported me and loved me unconditionally.  god, i love them.  so, so much.  but life happens.during this time, i opted to stay at home to help with bills and taking care of both of them.  this entailed making/getting dinner, helping my dad walk to the bathroom, doing chores, making drinks (water for dad and diet coke for mom), etc.  i grew the fuck up.  i also cared for my grandpa to some degree.  he'd fall in the middle of the night a lot and my mom and i would go over and put him back in his chair.  if he shit or pissed himself, we'd clean that up too.  this lifestyle destroyed me.  i was constantly worried at work (basically the only time i left the house) that i'd come home to one or both of them dead.  they fought a lot.  violently.  things were thrown.  i had to break up physical altercations on several occasions.  i started to eat more.  i smoked more.  i started drinking.  within a year, i had gained 150lbs, putting me in at around 575lbs.  i weighed more than andre the giant at this point.  i weighed more.  than.  andre.  the giant.  fuck.  when i realized that for the first time, i shut myself off.  i wasn't laughing any more.  i started to lose friends.  our house began to resemble one from hoarders.  there was black mold, cat shit clumped into the carpet using cat piss as mortar.  i never changed the litter boxes because i physically couldn't do anything after walking for 8 hours in a hospital for my job.  i started hearing voices.  they weren't malicious or anything, but i definitely was beginning to experience auditory hallucinations.  i was a prisoner of love.  i loved my parents too much to give up completely, but i wasn't helping them anymore.  i don't put any blame on them, as the decision to eat, smoke, and drink was mine, and mine alone, but what was going on didn't exactly help the situation.  this went on from about 2006 (when i was kicked out of the band) to 2013.i have to briefly say that during this time, i also began to see my parents as real people and not people that i took for granted and saw as governing forces in my life.  i'd give anything, anything, to have my dad call me on my cell phone (he was just on the other side of my room's wall) and have me come help him to my room so he could watch me play minecraft to handle his anxiety attacks.  he smelled so bad from not ever bathing and the infection in his legs.  it was weird because of him being in his tighty whities.  but damn, do i miss that.  we really bonded, not only as father and son, but as adults.  my mom slept on the couch during all this.  on my nights off, i'd eat supper with her and watch everybody loves raymond and king of queens.  we'd talk about movies we loved.  she showed me the movie, ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest.""  it's one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  every time i watch it, i cry uncontrollably (much like i am now) and think only of her.  as awful as this time was, i thank god every day that i was there with them.summer of 2013, both of my parents are admitted to a hospital.  my mom for an infected cyst that had progressed into her abdomen from her groin and my dad for his gangrenous legs.  my dad spent the entire summer in the hospital on iv antibiotics, as did my mom.  meanwhile, selfish potato_4 was living it up at home with no responsibilities for once.  i visited them, yes, but not nearly enough.  had i known what was to come, i'd have never left their side.one morning, i'm sleeping soundly after a long night of binge eating, video games, and cigarettes when i hear a knock on my window.  some random person that had been walking by informed me that my dad (who was supposed to still be in the hospital) was laying in the street, calling for me.  i will never forget what i saw.  never.  he was laying there with pieces of his necrotic flesh hanging off of his legs in the dirty ass street, screaming at me to help him up.  he had left the hospital against medical advice so he could smoke a cigarette.  his legs smelled so bad.  i could see necrotic muscle and partial bone.  i picked him up and carried him to our porch.  i fucking smoked with him.  how stupid am i?  fuck, i'll never forgive myself.  i was a mess.  i've never been one to exhibit much emotion in public, but heaven help me, did i weep that day.  i begged him as he lay in the street to let me call an ambulance to take him back to the hospital.  i begged him.  he refused.  he slept in his own bed and pet his cat that night.  that would be the last time he ever slept in his own bed.  the next afternoon, he let me take him back to the hospital.  i know it's psychosomatic, but i can still smell his legs in my car to this day.  when he returned, the doctors told him he had to have both of his legs amputated above the knee or he would die.  i can't imagine myself ever being so brave, but the man accepted it.  he loved us so much to prolong his suffering just to be with us.  they took one of his legs soon after.  this landed him in an assisted living group home.  my mom recovered soon after.  she visited him every night, despite him being understandably difficult.  i visited on my nights off.  i ruined our last 4th of july.  i had quit smoking in the hopes of them seeing me and wanting to follow my lead.  we met at his home and prepared to watch the fireworks, but i was disgusted by them blatantly smoking in front of me, not willing to help themselves.  it pissed my mom off.  so we left.  we left my poor dad alone on his last 4th of july.  a day that we used to celebrate with our entire family.august 5th, 2013 is tied for the worst day of my life.  i was off from work, thankfully, so i slept in.  i worked 2nd shift, so this meant i was waking up around 2pm.  at around 3, my mom calls me.  she's frantically trying to tell me that my dad is coding and she was 45 minutes away.  the home is 5 minutes from my house.  i get over there immediately.  this is yet another image burned into my soul.  i was alone - watching my dad, the strongest man on the planet, who i considered to be super-human, die.  he puked on himself, despite being unconscious.  they pounded on his chest.  i was alone.  by the time my mom and his sister got there, he was gone.  i'll never forget hearing my mom down the hall screaming.  she knew he was gone.  there were hugs and lots of crying.  as i left, i noticed that i had parked right outside of my dad's window by accident.  i'll never forget seeing his mouth open with the tube in it.  i said good-bye and went home.  i couldn't be there for my mom.  we never said it, but i know we were relieved that not only was his suffering over, but ours was as well.  or so i thought.the following months consisted of financial woes.  our house was destroyed.  we were nine months behind on our house payments.  my dad's life insurance payout was either very small or taken to the casino by my mom.  i don't know.  but after the dust settled, we banded together and really made an effort to get well again.  i lost some weight, cut back on smoking, and made an effort to go out and socialize.  she stopped going to the casino, started taking her meds regularly, and also cut back on cigarettes.  we got our utilities paid up.  things weren't getting shut off anymore.  we applied to charities to get our shower and toilet fixed.  a check was coming for 5,000 dollars that we were going to pay the house payments up.  we were going to make it.  things were going to be ok.in early january, my mom got what we thought was a bad cold.  she was having trouble breathing and walking more than 10 feet.  i saw it happening again.  this time i would stop it.  i had her go to the hospital i worked at, since i had faith in the doctors, nurses, and pharmacists that i had become great friends with.  they blew her off.  they diagnosed her with fibromyalgia and depression.  no shit.  i could have told her that.  the next day, she returned, saying the breathing was more of an issue.  she collapsed in the waiting room.  same thing.  the next day, january 22, 2014, i was awakened by her screaming.  i rushed to the bathroom where she lay, sprawled out on the toilet and bathtub.  i called 911.  i stayed calm and comforted her.  surely she was just having a little trouble breathing.  she smoked, after all.  the paramedics got there and put her on a gurney, taking her to the hospital i worked for.  i got dressed, thinking i had all the time in the world.  thank god i told her i loved her.  thank god.  when i arrived, not too long after she did, the nurses that knew me took me aside and said that they had some things to tell me.  she coded in the ambulance.  they were getting her back and she'd code again.  this went on for what seemed like an eternity.  i prayed.  i bargained.  i humbled myself before god and begged him to spare her.  she didn't deserve to die.  but i knew what was happening.  i knew that once again, i was watching one of my parents pass away alone.  after an hour, they asked me if they should keep going or not.  as a pharmacy tech and amateur enthusiast of the field of medicine, i knew that this was the point of no return.  we're looking at brain death even if they could stabilize her.  i knew my mom wouldn't want that.  so i told them if she coded again, they could stop.  she coded again.  this time it was my screams that i'll never forget.  my normally reserved self turned into a delirious, screaming banshee.  ""what am i going to do now?"" was all i could say.  the only two people in the world that loved me the way i need to be loved were gone.  they had been robbed from me within 5 months of each other.  what a loss to the world it was to lose them.  they touched so many people's lives.  my mom was an assistant teacher for underprivileged and emotionally disturbed children.  in the summer, she took them to the zoo and out to lunch because their parents couldn't afford it or were drug addicts.  my dad was the funniest man i've ever known.  he made everyone around him feel special and brightened so many dark days for so many people.  myself included.  what a loss to the world.  senseless, senseless, senseless.two days later, my poor grandpa, who i genuinely loved dearly, passed away.  i was too numb to grieve for him and i live with that guilt too.  i live with the guilt that i failed to save my parents.  everyone tells me that it wasn't up to me to save them.  fuck them.  it was.  they cared for me growing up.  they sacrificed so much for me and my well-being.  and i couldn't do it for them.  i failed them.  the only thing that keeps that guilt from consuming me is knowing that i tried my hardest.  not many people would have willingly gone into that situation.  but i loved/love my parents.  i didn't do it out of nobility or because i wanted to be recognized.  i did it because it was the right thing to do.  and even though i still suffer physically and emotionally because of it to this day, i would do it again in a heartbeat.  there's no question.after all the funerals and celebrations of life, i went back to work.  some people were sympathetic, and i can't thank them enough for that.  but others wanted me to deliver meds to the room my mother died in.  nope.  couldn't do it.  i was late nearly every day because of panic attacks when pulling into the parking lot.  i received about 60,000 dollars from my mom's life insurance.  so when i got fired, i didn't give two shits.  i didn't move for two months.  i paid people to clean my house.  i paid people to get groceries for me and feed my cats.  i started smoking weed.  i started popping pills.  i did shrooms.  i drank.  i binge ate.  i fucked prostitutes.  i tried to fuck my cousin, who was also a prostitute.  the only reason i didn't was because she flaked every time she was supposed to come over.  i tried to buy heroin from her.  i tried to buy acid, e, coke, and painkillers from her.  i almost had sex with a man.  it was awful.  i found a girlfriend on okcupid.  we moved really fast and she was going to move in with me.  turns out she was crazy.  after 4 months of fixing up my hoarders house, she bailed on me.  that was august of 2014.then i met l.  l saved my life.  i met her through a high school friend, since they were in a relationship.  we regularly hung out and painted figurines and watched movies.  i didn't want to be seen in that manner, so i cleaned up.  i started moving again.  i cleaned my house.  i did chores daily.  getting me going helped get me out of the deep, dark depression i was experiencing at the time.  before meeting her, i had put a gun in my mouth.  i was a centimeter away from killing myself.  i couldn't do it.  i promised my mom and dad at each of their showings that i would survive this.  so i put the gun down.  i later sold it to prevent this from happening again.  l and i hung out more and more as time went on.  she'd go with me to hang out while i played my tabletop game.  and while i've had problems maintaining a ""just friends"" position in the past, i held firm this time.  i respected her and my friend's relationship and did not allow myself to fall in love with her.  at first.he cheated on her.  given my history of infidelity listed above, i have grown to despise cheating.  so i took her side.  she moved in with me.  i grew to hate my friend that i had known since high school.  i fell in love with her.  i'm still in love with her.  i'd do anything and everything for her.  she's had her own problems since their break up, and i've tried to be supportive, since no one else seems to care.  i know what it's like feeling alone.  but i'm freakishly large.  and it's still a fresh wound to her.  i try not to bring up being in a relationship with me, but it slips out sometimes.  i love her more than all of my ex's combined.  i'd marry her in a heartbeat.  but i'm freakishly large.  and that's all people see me for.so, i took it upon myself to start the process of getting bariatric surgery.  i went to the doctor and got an antidepressant, a pre-diabetes med, and a blood pressure med.  i am pursuing therapy for the shit i went through with my parents.  i exercise.  i work so hard to keep the house clean for her.  i bought her new plants with hooks to hang in the house so my cats wouldn't destroy them.  she loves plants.  we hung her canvas paintings in the living room.  i talk to her all day, every day.  we play cards and watch intervention together.  i melt when she laughs.  but i don't know what i am to her.  i get all the signals of being friend-zoned, but at the same time, she's told me she loves me.  we act like a couple, but with no touching.  i couldn't care less about fucking her.  i just want to hug her and feel loved.  i want her to feel loved.  i show her i love her when i make dinner for us.  i learned how to cook, for god's sake.  i was clueless in that department before i met her.but nothing ever comes of it.  i'm waiting for the day that she up and decides to kiss my cheek before going to bed.  i haven't talked to any other girls since this started.  i'm loyal as fuck.  i'm responsible.  i have a good job, a house, cook, clean, fix things, take her out to dinner, surprise her with thoughtful things.  for instance, she had a bad cavity about two months ago, and i'd bring her care packages of ibuprofen and tylenol at work.  i know it sounds like i'm smothering her, but i am not the initiator of contact the vast majority of the time.  i am very cognizant of being too much.  i know she's still hung up on her ex, but i am 30 years old.  we're wasting time.  i know she loves me.  i know it.  i've been friend-zoned before and this is nothing like it.but, since making all those great steps towards wellness, i've begun to lose faith.  all i've ever asked out of life was to be a father and a husband.  given what i've been through, and despite it sounding like i'm being a baby, i think i fucking deserve some happiness.  and it infuriates me that i'm not getting it.  being a husband and a father would give me purpose again.  my antidepressant is fucking with the chemicals in my brain.  i'm hearing auditory hallucinations again.  i'm thinking about killing myself whenever alone.  it would be so easy to just drive into an oncoming semi truck and just be done.  i found a shotgun in the garage.  it would be so easy to blow my brains out.  i just want to be needed and loved again.  i want my family back.  i want a future.  i don't want to die.  i want to see my child graduate from college.  i want to teach him/her all that is beautiful in life and be the best dad/husband that's ever existed.  but nope, stupid, fat, potato_4 isn't allowed to ever be happy again.  if anyone makes it to this paragraph, i hope your life is filled with happiness.  i hope you don't take your family, friends, or anyone you care about for granted.  leave your wife a love note.  do the dishes for her.  cook your man some bad ass hot wings.  spend time with your elderly mother.  be there when your child sings an awful solo in the school christmas play.  i'm begging you.  right the wrongs that have been done to me.""be generous - with your time, with your love, with your life.""tl;dr - there is no such thing as karma or justice.  save a life, love a fat guy.  we're grateful for anything we get and we try harder.take care of yourselves."," i cried reading this, all of this.i had a really bad week, and you made me appreciate myself a whole lot more. so a big thanks to you op.when i read this, there was so much emotion in every single word i read, i felt like you were just saying this to me face to face. your life is full of hardships but you yourself, are so strong and beautiful. i know you are going to find happiness again because there are so many

"okay, a little background, i'm a male in my late 30's. i grew up playing football and loving the nfl. some of my fondest memories are of watching nfl games with my family and witnessing the amazing athletic competition.over the last few years, however, i found myself with a diminished capacity to enjoy the nfl, or even college football. why? the horrific toll that the game takes on players bodies and minds. i don't want to name any names because so many have already gone public but the number of players who can't even walk at age 40 or who suffer from dementia, early death and cte is just not acceptable.not only that, i can no longer tolerate the actions of so many professional football players, committing rapes, **abusing children**, brutally beating women, maiming other men, shooting people, murdering people, the list of crimes goes on and on. i feel remorse that i ever enjoyed the nfl, just because so much harm has come to players i grew up admiring who are now shells of their former selves or just plain six feet under.i love the nfl so much but i just can't tolerate this any longer. i don't know what i want from this confession—maybe somebody to talk some sense into me and change my mind.the nfl is like that crazy ex that is horrible for you but you can't let go. what do you think good peoples of reddit? anybody have a good rebuttal?[remorse]: if you feel bad"," i watch because i love the sport.  as for the players committing crimes, it wouldn't be a big deal if people didn't glorify these players and have them as role models.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3isj1q/i_can_no_longer_enjoy_the_nfl/,,I can no longer enjoy the NFL.
"i (single mom 47f) am a caregiver for my gammy (96f).  i moved her into my house after my divorce 10 years ago, as she was just lonely after my (step)grandfather passed.  i have 2 teens (19f and 17m) that help when they have to, but not often, and a respite caregiver for 3 hours a day mondays, tuesdays, and fridays. my mother(68f) (this is her mom) can not help out with her care as she is a full time caregiver for my father (71m), but she does all the.errands and shopping for gammy when she is.able and handles all the financial issues and has medical poa for gammy.  gammy has 2 other kids, bill (75) and rich (62).  they don't want anything to do with her, as there was a lot of alcoholism and abuse from their father against them.but mostly her.  when she left her husband, she left the kids with him and i believe that is the reason.why they don't want to deal with her.  but i.digress... so, those are the players involved.  in the last 8 to 10 months, my gammy's mind has slipped.  she has always been mentally sharp and showed no signs of dementia or any other neurological issues until recently.  when it all began, we had her checked and the diagnosis was ""rapid onset dementia"" and the doctor warned that she may swiftly deteriorate.   well, she was right.  my sweet, loving, nurturing gammt has morphed into a screeching, insulting, verbally abusive harridan.  we have had the police show up to our door 2 times in the last couple months, because the neighbors her her screaming at me and call the police on her.  she insults me, throws things, she even told the respite caregiver that i ""physically attacked"" her when all that happened was i shook my finger at her (not even my middle finger!)  she is getting progressively worse, and i am.nearing.my breaking point. before she got so bad, i would take my kids on a summer vacation every year.  friday early am to sunday late pm, i used this.vacay to rest and unwind, and it is a much anticipated and appreciated respite from my normal duties, and return from it with a renewed sense of purpose and energy.  but!!!  this year, we may not be able to go anywhere at all!  not even for a single day!  she refuses to leave the house at all, and my mother has offered to have her stay at her house while we are gone, but no dice. my best friend has offered to stay here at my place and care for.gammy, but my friend is a lesbian and married and my gammy is.horribly homophobic and refuses to allow ""that sodomizing lesbian"" to infect (??????

"hello, i just found this subreddit and was looking for support. i posted in r/offmychest my story then looked for help. just quickly, i am a 31f that is caring for my grandmother with dementia. i am mostly alone doing this as my dad does help but he lives in another state and has a wife with breast cancer he now is caring for. only 2 of my cousins help from time to time with paperwork and mental support but outside of that no else helps. i have been doing this since my grandfather's second stroke about 6 or 7 years ago. i am now 31 and feel like i can't really date, go out with friends often, and that i'm going to miss my chance to get married and start my own family because it feels like i will always be taking care of my grandmother.  she has an aide but the aide is so limited in what she can do that i still have to do so much. these last few days have been extremely difficult because my grandmother got covid from someone at her church and the aide can't come until she is covid free so now i'm all alone caring for her. it's been 5 days and i want to just burst into tears. i'm so scared for my future because i'm scared no man will want me if it means he will probably have to become at least a part time caregiver too. is anyone else dealing with this or have dealt with this? did you find love?"," how is the aide limited in what they can do? the only limitations i can think of are if your grandmother refuses to cooperate with her, so the aide can't force her to do anything.  or the aide is too small/weak to perform the necessary duties.  you may want to look into hiring someone new if it's the latter.  i am always surprised when people have aides who can barely perform the tasks, because that signals they're not right for the position.  as for your situation, i can totally relate.  i am 32 and take full care of my mother after my dad died.  i am married, but my husband works and is gone most of the time, so i feel alone too.  i am lucky in the sense that i have an incredibly understanding husband who is fine with our unique living situation, but i know many guys wouldn't be.  can the state pay an aide for ft help? my two cents, if a guy can't accept your life circumstances, it's probably a sign it won't work out in the long term anyway.  people who are unable to adapt/accommodate for people they love generally don't make the best partners.  i would try to still find a way to date and get out of the house.  i know it's not easy, but it's doable.  get to know people and have them get to know you before you put all your cards on the table.  it's also hard to know what the future entails, pretty much anything is possible! everytime i have worried about the future, i have found that once the future becomes the present, it has a weird way of working out.  things end of being not nearly as complicated or as hard as you might anticipate.  hold tight op!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/w2y1jd/how_do_you_deal_with_being_a_young_woman_and_a/,,how do you deal with being a young woman and a caregiver

"hey yall, i’m gonna try to summarize my current circumstances and explain what’s going on because i’ve found myself in a heck of a situation very suddenly and i need support/advice/whatever. i’m 18 (19 on july 30) and my nana is 79 (80 on august 31). nana has been having severe and ongoing health issues for as long as i can remember, but about 4-5 years ago, our family built an apartment connected to our house to be closer to both of my grandparents. they moved out of their beautiful house 45 minutes away into their little apartment, and the stress of moving must have aged them like 10 years because things are bad. my gumpa (83 on august 8) got diagnosed with dementia a couple years ago, and he is literally completely unable to help out my nana anymore &amp; needs help of his own. this is really bad because my nana has severe scoliosis, osteoporosis, awful circulation, basically everything under the sun that could have gone wrong has gone wrong and she needs a hip replacement now. she can barely walk on her own. a few nights ago, nana fell and broke her wrist. like shattered it. so yesterday i was with her at the hospital all day waiting for surgery. surgery went well, she’s back at home now, and i stayed overnight to make sure she had everything she needed and i’m going to be staying all day today too. this is going to be a looooong recovery process because she needs to completely rest her wrist for 5 weeks and then needs to go to physical therapy for a couple months after that. like i said, she also can’t really walk anymore and doesn’t have any help from my gumpa, so taking care of her has all fallen on me. they’re both my mom’s parents and she spends a lot of time over at the apartment helping them out, but she also works a full time job and can’t be there as much as someone needs to be there… so considering i’m currently unemployed and not in college, but i drive a car and am generally responsible, i’m the perfect candidate for the job. i was actively interviewing with a potential employer immediately before this happened, but this is way more important. caregiving is challenging enough work as it is, but there’s more important context to this; my nana is a very difficult person to be around for extended periods of time. she has so much completely unhealed trauma and untreated mental illness- her entire existence these days is suffering, because she’s completely trapped in her own head. it’s not her fault obviously, but she is literally the most obsessive, anxious, and pessimistic person i have ever met in my entire life. this is particularly heavy on me because i have the same hereditary mental illness as she does, but i’ve been treating it all in therapy since i was like 11. i still struggle plenty on my own. fortunately, my presence seems to lighten my nana’s mood a lot and she is really appreciative of having me around and having my help, but oh my god. this is getting draining and i’ve only been doing it for a couple days. i love her dearly and i will help her with anything she needs ever for the rest of her life, and she keeps trying to compensate me with money and whatever because she feels so guilty, but like… i’m not doing this so she rewards me, i’m doing this because i love her and she needs someone to take care of her right now. my parents and my brother have been awesome in terms of being supportive and getting me off the hook when i need it these past couple days. i’m just anxious about the fact that i’m gonna be doing this nonstop for a while. i know my nana feels so bad about stopping me from living my life and taking care of her, but her guilt really isn’t helping me out here. basically, i just want to know what some of you guys have done and how you felt in situations like this that were out of your control. i feel like i got thrown in the deep end, but i really need to keep myself and both of my grandparents afloat, preferably without any of us losing our marbles. i want to be able to do my best but i’m very new at this and i need help from pretty much anywhere i can receive it. tl;dr my elderly grandmother destroyed her wrist but she also can’t walk and my grandfather has dementia and can’t do literally anything, so i’m suddenly taking care of them pretty much full time until my grandmother gains some independence back, and i’m afraid i’m gonna actually go insane. pls for the love of god send me some encouragement or advice or literally anything that could possibly help bc i need it", it is an insane situation to care for 2 people at the same time. one is already hard.   you definitely need to ask your parents n your brother to help or hire someone.   you are young n i'm sure very capable. but it's alot emotionally to be this responsible for 2 people's lives at your age.  just bc you're free doesn't mean you're it.   definitely speak up.. get a schedule made where you get time off.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vzmmoa/suddenly_thrown_into_caregiving_situation/,,suddenly thrown into caregiving situation??
"not sure where to post but i just need to talk...my dad is a caregiver for my grandmother who has dementia. he currently has some health problems but is having trouble getting care for himself because he's a caregiver. my grandmother had an aid but the company has been terrible and the last aid gave them covid and that was the last straw. he had made some progress but had to reschedule because of the covid. now he has to either wait months to get care because everything medical is delayed due to covid (and probably other ""events"") effects in the country or get admitted to the hospital asap for the same care by the same doctors that can treat him immediately. this was a last resort because he will have to put my grandmother into temporary hospice and he will need help from family while he's in the hospital.fast forward to now, he is starting to get plans in place but i'm nervous, scared, and frustrated because the only family that can help is me, my sister, and a cousin and we all live in other states.  this will be financially tough for all of us. i'm a last resort because i'm farthest away but i still don't know how i'm going to get through this. what if my dad finds out he will need more care which means more help? what if my grandmother is neglected while shes away? travel is expensive. also i can only imagine how expensive my dad's medical bills will be if he needs more care and just for the hospital bill in general. even with insurance, my dad already doesn't have alot of money.  i'm frustrated with us healthcare and i'm overwhelmed and scared for my family and myself. how has anyone gotten through this kind of situation?"," idk what kind of medical procedure your dad needs but, in general, hospital stays, even for major surgeries is surprisingly short. you could consider taking care of both gma & dad at home. with 3 possible caregivers, maybe y’all can take turns, say 2 week shifts to care for both. you could hire a temp caregiver to come in 2-3 times per week to help with showers. i took care of both my parents and sister post op recently (3 people) by myself this a few months back. my parents’ caregiver walked out for 4 days, my sister, the primary caregiver, had knee replacement surgery, and my brother died from covid. i was there for 2 weeks but it wasn’t too bad if you plan for everything in advance. the 4 days without the other caregiver where i took care of all 3 people and made burial plans for my brother were pretty crazy. but i survived and so will you.personally, i’d keep gma at home bc short term environmental changes are really hard in dementia patients. y’all three possible caregivers can take turns taking care of gma or gma & dad. this should give them almost 6 weeks. (i’d stagger it where each caregiver stays 2 weeks, with 1-2 days overlap to get errands done.)my sister’s surgery was outpatient and came home that afternoon.here are some tips:1) whoever is doing the grocery shopping now, presumably your dad, have him give you a list of weekly groceries and find out if you can have them delivered to the house. or, stock up on non perishables. plan on not being able to leave the house very much, if at all. if possible, ask a friend or neighbor to pick up fresh groceries weekly. non grocery stuff were ordered from amazon for delivery to our front door.2) cook as much food as you can before your dad goes into the hospital. freeze a lot of cooked proteins & veg. pasta & rice can be cooked daily as needed. meals should be kept simple. you might have to eat the exact same thing for days on end for simplicity’s sake. you can also order meals from rest for delivery, if your budget allows.3) showers are the biggest issue, requiring 2 caregivers. for this reason, we only shower my parents once per week, up they’re feeling up to it. in the winter, they’re usually too cold and we towel bathe them. we usually towel bathe them every other day or so. my sister’s surgeon said that she’d be moving around well within 10 days and i was skeptical but his estimate was accurate. she was able to go for a walk down the block and back before i left. so your dad would probably recover quicker than you think. ask his doctor.so no worries, it’s doable if you plan ahead. good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vz0el9/frustrated_and_scared/,,Frustrated and scared
"over the past 3 years, my gf has been a caregiver for a 91 year old grandmother with dementia. she has been very passionate, has gone above and beyond, and sees her as family. her employer, the daughter of the patient is a doctor and has always paid in cash. i can attest that my gf truly loves the grandmother like family. she has spent weekends there before watching her overnights. last wednesday, the employer said she needs my gf to watch her mother friday-monday. told her she could come and go as she pleases and that she will pay her $900. this was all agreed upon over a phone call. in order to make these accommodations, my gf paid $200 to board her dog for the weekend as she couldn’t bring her dog to the house. she canceled plans to go to a concert with her best friend that lives out of town and was coming in town for her birthday. she got there at 8:00 am. she first left the house at 9:00 pm to get food with me. we were gone for 2 hours and came back to the house to sleep. her employer does not like me, so i remained in the living room and never left the couch. the next morning, she cared for the patient until 4:00 pm, doordashed food using her own money. we briefly left for 30 min to run to get food. in that 30 min, a family friend came over and panicked when nobody was there. instead of contacting anybody, he rushed and woke up the patient who had just laid down to nap and gave her an extra breathing treatment which she had just received an hour prior. he called the employer to report what happened and said that an unknown car was there. the employer then calls my gf accusing her of negligence and putting her house at risk by my being there. for the rest of the weekend, my gf didn’t leave a single time. come tuesday, the employer began texting my gf making a slue of baseless and untrue accusations. made many claims saying she was negligent and that she had her dog there. we all know she was really just mad that i was there. sure my gf was wrong by bringing me there, but there were no problems that came from my presence. she now made a facebook post saying that her mother’s health is declining due to “a negligent caretaker”. she is now making increasingly baseless claims and accusations and is really bullying/gaslighting my gf. with each conversation, my gf fears that her employer isn’t going to pay the $900. regardless if the employer is upset that i was there for 12 hours, my gf still performed all her duties that they had agreed upon. my gf is heartbroken at the treatment she’s receiving from those she saw as family. but she spent roughly $350 to make that $900, so she’d be out $1250. the details were discussed by phone, so nothing is in writing. she is a fresh graduate in student debt and can’t afford a lawyer, especially considering her employer is a well off doctor. is there anything that she can do to make sure she gets paid the $900 that had been agreed upon?"," she can tell the ""employer"" that she will report her for tax fraud.  pretty sure ""paying in cash"" means that employer is not contributing to social security, paying unemployment and workers comp taxes.  employer may let her go but she sure as shit will cough up the $900.having a loved one in dire straits does play crazy games on people's emotions, i will say.  it is easy to get irrationally irate at caregivers for any slight.  your gf should only take the steps recommended above if the $900 is not forthcoming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vyz7xp/is_my_girlfriend_entitled_to_her_compensation/,,Is my girlfriend entitled to her compensation?
"i'm sorry this is going to be pretty long, i just need somewhere to release it all. i've (32f) have been a caregiver since i was 16 years old. litterally half my life. my mother was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's my freshman year of high school, by sophomore year she had already forgotten my name. junior year i quit school and started to take care of her full time. my father had left us (my mom and my siblings) because she cheated on him before she got diagnosed but i know that, it was probably caused by her mental illness. in 30 years of marriage not once did she even look at someone else. i became the new defacto mother. taking care of my sisters (who are the same age we're triplets) and my mother. i found a job that would pay me under the table, and i was lucky we were already in government housing.by 17 my mother was a total care, couldn't speak, couldn't feed herself but damn could she excape from anywhere. she went wondering for the first time on my 18th birthday, it was a very cold, snowy december 1st. i spent hours outside looking for her with neighbors, i can't even remember how long it was when we finally found her. i do remember crying in my bed that night unable to sleep listening to the lightest noise that she may be getting out of her bed.my sisters and i grew up, me being everyone's mom, and them i let them grow up, finish school. they eventually got married and moved out leaving me and my mother completely alone for the first time. that's when my father came back gone for 4 years leaving basically children to fend for themselves and their mother. but he was hurt, a broken foot and needed someone to take care of him. i don't know why i agreed but i did. adding yet another who required my care. my sisters come around... but are already busy with new family. old doesn't matter anymore. by 21, i had gotten my ged and attempted to go to college online, while working from home, and taking care of both my parents at the same time. i was doing great until my father got really sick. he couldn't keep food down, and was swelling up like a balloon. doctors appointments later kidney failure. he'd have to be on dialysis for the rest of his life. his doctor chose a newer method called peritoneal dialysis. it would just require me to set him up on a machine every night. which i agreed to. 28 years old and i've never held a job for longer than 6 months, something always came up. i've had loved ones leave me because i had too much responsibility, not enough free time. i didn't and don't want kids because i've been taking care of someone else my whole life already. mom's no longer eating anything i make, she'll chew it up and spit it right back out. her doctors make the decision to put in a peg tube and teach me how to feed her. the second week feeding my mother through her belly, she coughs, and coughs, and then can't breathe. she vomits and gasps for air. i call the ambulance and in less than an hour i'm told.... she might survive the night. i call my family. my sisters show up and so does my brother. they come in for a couple minutes then leave after the doctor says it won't happen for a while. less than 5 minutes after they leave and it's just her and i again, and she's gone. i listen to her ragged, rattle and then the final sigh. i feel... light... a weight is lifted from my chest and i could breathe for the first time in years. 29 years old and everything is going great for the first time in a long time. i've been in school for a year, and working at the same place for just as long. i still have to hook my dad up at night, but i've got free time in the mornings for just me. i had been going to the gym and lost the 60lbs i gained after my mom passed away, and was looking forward to the vacation i had lined up. it was just a staycation at a local hotel but it was more freedom than i had ever tasted.on march 6th, 2019, i got a call from my father. he's frantic saying he fell and he couldn't get his legs under himself. i call the ambulance and rush home, he's lying on the ground can't even lift his head up, his speech slurred and left side limp. i'm comforting him waiting for the parametics, but in my head i'm just screaming not again. it was a stroke, one that he might not recover physically from. days in the hospital they bring him back home... incontinent, unable to feed himself, and unable to walk. but still all there mentally. i call my siblings... and they come and see him.. and just as quickly leave again. alone again, with my father.once again unemployed, quit school. a full-time caregiver once again.july 12, 2022, my fathers amputated toes, from a wound that wouldn't heal, legs like a skeleton. mentality he's gone, i've known it for months. nothing of his 6'3 233lbs left on him. hasn't ate in weeks and now refusing a ng tube. a peg tube on his dnr as a never. tomorrow i find out if i take him home and watch him go just like my mother, or if he qualifies for hospise (which he won't.)i now sit... in bed again wondering who i'll be once he's gone too. if you read this... thank you for letting me share my thoughts with you. tldr: caregiver for

"so i have been caregiving for my dad for 7+ years, he has parkinson’s, psychosis and dementia. over the past 8 or 9 months he has rapidly declined. 9 months ago he was getting around relatively well on his own, only using a walker. recently we had to make the decision to put him into a long term care facility as he had lost the ability to walk and required assistance to use his wheelchair/dress/toilet/eat. it was all too much for us to handle as we all have full time jobs/school. that was about 1 &amp; 1/2 months ago. i’ll be honest it was a relief in the sense that taking care of him was like working another full time job and time to take care of ourselves or even just relax was extremely limited. that said, it was still a very hard decision to make and we cried when it was made. we all love him so much.now, in the last few weeks he has gone completely down hill. he has lost so much weight as he has lost the ability to swallow and lacks an appetite and the last few days he has become non-verbal and now today completely unconscious. i don’t even know what to say. i’m certain the end is near and i just want his suffering to end. i can’t sleep at night, i keep waking up with anxiety thinking about him. all day i cry. i don’t want him to die, but i also don’t want him to be in pain any longer. this isn’t a life anyone should have to live. my dad is a good man, he doesn’t deserve this.does anyone have experience with this? how long is someone in this state expected to live? he’s slowly starving to death, its horrible. i’m not religious but if you could pray for my dad and my family i would be eternally grateful."," i am so sorry for your loss but just know he is no longer suffering.  if he believed in god then rest assured, he is in heaven.  having faith in jesus christ as i do, is an individual decision for every person to make.  once faith/belief in christ starts in a person, salvation becomes eternal as it is the gift from god no one can take away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vrt7xn/nearing_the_end_and_im_scared/,,Nearing the end and I’m scared

"this has been on my mind for as long as i can remember, and i have never been able to say a thing about it to anyone i know. here's to hoping my friends/family don't recognize my username and learn this stuff. this is the first time i've ever put words to my thoughts.\], so let me just dump my whole life story on a bunch of internet strangers in a long, rambling rant that no one will read or truly care about like the absolute idiot i am. you'll probably read this thinking you can prove i'm not a hopeless case and ""everyone can be helped uwu!"" you're wrong. here's a prime example as to why:my life is great. i have two loving parents and two siblings (older sister and twin sister). i have an adorable 5-year-old dog and a 4-month-old bearded dragon. my best friend and i have known each other for 10 years, almost 11. i go to a great school, my family is financially stable in a comfortable house, and i've never been bullied. i'm a 15-year-old male who 2 years ago in march came out to my parents as transgender (and gay). i have a huge family besides my immediate relatives since both my parents and grandparents have divorced and remarried. not a single. person. in my entire family was hateful towards me in any way, shape, or form. everyone accepted me and moved on. my friends accepted me. hell, even my school accepted me. most kids knew i was trans and didn't treat me any differently (they didn't talk to me more or less than they usually did--i only hung out with my twin and 2 friends but was kind to everyone). i got started on testosterone shots fairly quickly, and plan to get top surgery when i'm 18. i don't think i've ever faced any prejudice for being trans. and even the results i got from the t were great compared to ""normal standards""--my voice deepened quickly, i didn't get acne at all (and still never have), my hairline is not receding (yet), and my periods have stopped. anyone in my position would be happy, right?i fucking hate myself and my entire life. i'm a stupid, entitled, attention-seeking brat who wants to use mental illness (i've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety) as an excuse for my actions and i hate myself for it. my dad is arrogant and thinks he's always right. my older sister is loud, self-centered, makes it her mission to hate anything and everything, and argues with/yells at my dad all day, every day. she gets scared at horror movies and decides that that means she has anxiety and must bring it up in almost every conversation (even i don't do that) and complains about her job every. night. at dinner. my mom is a pushover with about 80 autoimmune diseases, and my twin sister is so indifferent to everything it makes me want to scream. at the same time, my dad is confident and successful, my older sister is social and outgoing, my mother is kind and caring, and my twin is a genius and understanding. i hate myself for thinking so poorly about my family because i know it can be so much worse. they accepted me, cared for me, and my dad once broke into tears at my temple (my family is jewish, though i hate religion) because of my rabbi's willingness to accommodate me at the summer camp i've been going to since 2012 (it's become such an ingrained part of my life that i can't imagine going a summer without it). even there, most kids knew i was trans since my family is very well-known at the camp (my dad was president of the board of the temple and headed the search for a new camp director--everyone at my temple knows my family) and i got no flack for it. my family should mean everything to me.but i hate them a lot of the time. my friends, too. i hate anyone who is close to me. i'm trapped, wishing that i could just completely start over fresh and get rid of the person people think i am, but unable to do anything because of the expectations set in place for who i am and how i act. i doubt i'm going to kill myself--it's too scary and final a decision for me, and god forbid there be consequences for my actions. plus, i would never do that to my family or friends or even people who just barely know me. the thought of being the reason for someone else crying makes me want to rip my brain from my skull. most people think people like me think ""nobody loves me"", ""nobody understands me"", or ""i'm alone."" i know my family loves me. i know there are people out there going through similar things. i know my family would go through hell and back for me. i know i can reach out to them any time i wish and be hugged and loved and helped. i hate it. i hate the thought of going to a person for comfort. i tried therapy; never worked. i hate it so, so much, and i really tried to get it to work. if i don't know you, i don't trust you with my feelings, and once i begin to know you, i'm scared to share them because i don't want to jeopardize what you think of me. and i know in reality my family and friends won't care. they'll help me (or rather support me; i still don't think i can be helped). but no way am i ever going to voice any of this to them. it's like i'm physically unable to. i wish my family and friends would hate me; i wish i could just vanish from their thoughts so nobody has any expectations of me and i can go off somewhere else and start a completely new life. for example, when my dad cried at my temple, i was shocked. he's not an emotional person. seeing him cry made me want to cry (i have since seemingly lost the ability to do so). my family doesn't think of me as someone who cries. i constantly hear whenever we're watching a sad movie or something ""oh yeah, mom's going to definitely cry. but (my name) doesn't cry. he never cries."" thus, i think to myself that i am not allowed to cry. i rarely feel the urge, anyways. my mom saw me covering my mouth and said: ""(my name), don't laugh at your dad!"" i wasn't laughing. i wasn't really crying either. but the thought of me crying is so foreign to my family and friends that it seems an impossibility, and thus, it's become a foreign concept for me, too. no matter how much pain i'm in, how sad i am, or angry, i can never cry. i want to. i want to be able to cry. but i can't.this isn't even the brunt of what i want to really rant about. the big problem is my seemingly complete polarity in thought. it makes me so angry, hating what i'm doing but not stopping it. i feel like my brain is splitting, trapped between who people think i am, who i really am, and who i want to be. i'm angry, sarcastic, and incapable of any emotion besides anger and humor. i can't remember the last time i said ""i love you"" to someone non-ironically. any pleasantry seems to die on my tongue; ""thank you"", ""you're welcome"", ""sorry"", etc--i swear it's like it's impossible for me to get the words out. i can't even fake it. saying anything sincere or serious out loud is an impossibility. if my mom needs to talk to me about something important (like, for example, when my testosterone levels dropped and my periods started up again), i'll tell her to go into the other room and text me. i can tell it annoys her just a little, but i don't care. i feel no empathy for others. yesterday my sister had some strange drive-through graduation ceremony at our school because it was closed. she's been so upset that her graduation and everyone else's was practically ruined. this time i managed not to say anything because i was in one of my weird silent moods, but i didn't want to go. i couldn't care less. i can't seem to care about anything in real life (specifically real life; i'll get back to that later). i hate having to be on a call with family members to wish them a happy birthday; i refused to hold a sign i'd (begrudgingly) helped my twin make for my sister at her graduation because i thought i'd look stupid; i complain whenever i'm dragged to important services, even though my dad tells me it means a lot to my family to come (especially for high holidays); anything that inconveniences me, no matter how important for others, i hate. and don't think i think i'm in the right on this; i hate myself so much for being like this. i curse myself in my head for being so selfish while continuing to be an asshole on the outside because i have zero self-control. it's stupid, right? hating what i'm doing but not willing to put in the effort to change it. seems like a pretty hopeless case, right?do you wanna know the worst example of this? my grandma on my dad's side. she used to babysit me and my sisters a lot; we'd play uno, watch a movie, eat ice cream, and play club penguin on her tiny old desktop computer. ever since late 2018 or early 2019, she's been bouncing from retirement home to retirement home because she, to put it simply, can be an asshole. she started to get dementia and, since she and my dad weren't too too close, he left it to my mom to take care of her. and man, it weighed on her. she already has a tough life, what with her autoimmune diseases, growing up practically raising her siblings, and this shitshow our once-kind family has become. every day we'd hear something new on the way home from school about my grandma and what trouble she'd gotten into that day; insisting that her caretaker was abusing her, throwing fits before bed, threatening other housemates' lives, then sobbing to my mother because she couldn't remember any of it. i started to wish she was dead. it would be so much easier for my mother if she were dead, and then i wouldn't have to go out of my way to visit her. i hated myself for thinking that, but i assume at this point in my rant that's already a given. ""hate"" seems to be pretty ingrained in my life. she cared for me, accepted me eagerly even though she's very religious. with her dementia, she could never remember my new name. but she would always refrain from saying my old one because she knew it was wrong. she'd say to my mom ""i can't remember his name, but i know he's a he."" that just made me hate myself a whole lot more for wishing she was gone.so, finally, the day came. she was in the hospital for one reason or another (and has been in and out of hospitals all year), and they took her to hospice care. family flew in from all over to say goodbye. i felt nothing but relief that i didn't have to keep visiting her and that my mom didn't have to deal with her, as well as anger at myself for not feeling sad that someone so close to me was dying. my sisters went to see her. i didn't. i didn't want to, and in the end, didn't have to. i jumped on the bandwagon one of my uncles when he said he couldn't bear to see his mother in that state. that wasn't really true for me, but i pretended that it was. she died 3 days later. my mom woke me and my twin up at 4 in the morning to tell us that we didn't have to go to school that day. i took her offer, because why not? when the funeral came, i was very cold and distant. i didn't cry. my sisters did, my mom did, and of course, my dad did. everyone did. i didn't until later, alone on the floor of my bathroom with the shower on so as to provide an excuse for my absence. and i didn't even cry because she was dead. they weren't tears of sadness. they were tears of anger. i was so, so angry at myself for how selfish i was being, and how little i cared. i cried for myself, not for her. how pitiful is that?my mom chalked my coldness/distantness up to relapsing slightly since my grandma died. my doctor upped my dosage of citalopram (depression meds) since it wasn't enough to keep me 'stable' during mentally trying times. i don't remember if i cut my arm more because of this, but i definitely did for one reason or another, can't remember why. i started cutting before transitioning, and i don't even call it that. i was too scared of pain to really cut. i just wanted to do it because that's what people like me do, right? also, i wanted the scars. i wanted the attention that would come from them (and then shy away from any attention that might have consequences). i took a mechanical pencil and took the lead out so it was just the sharpish metal bit at the end and just dragged it on my skin over and over again until it was deep enough to scab (never really bled). then i'd pick at the scabs over and over and over again until they scarred. so, no razors for me.i don't think i've cried since then. it's just casual inner hatred that sometimes flares up every now and then. oh, also, i'm a toxic friend. i've got 2 friends i actually care about that go to my school (one who went to my camp, i'll talk about her in a second), s and e. e is really more my twin's friend, but she's outgoing and social and we're close, though not close enough for me to talk to her even over text about anything wrong with me. i don't consider her someone i could go to. s, on the other hand, is the friend i've known for nearly 11 years. her family life sucks, too. when her dog got put down (a dog she'd had for as long as she could remember), of course, she got sad. and i'm her best (and at the time only) friend. i should comfort her, right? well, not wanting to talk about my emotions goes both ways. i don't want to hear about them either. i don't want to hear about your problems, and no way on earth am i going to know how to fix them. i want friends (or a boyfriend) who is fine with dealing with my shit, but i don't want to ever have to deal with theirs? what kind of messed up shit is that? my mind tries to make up an excuse saying i'm not mentally stable enough to handle anyone else's grief, but i've learned to call bs on my mind's excuses long ago. i just don't want the attention off of poor old me, the angsty side character with the tragic backstory that all the readers fall in love with. my friend from camp, m, is probably the sweetest and most empathetic person i know. but she's never even touched a mental illness with a 5-foot pole. she's happy-go-lucky, perky, friends with literally everyone (and when she and a friend fall out, give it a week and they'll be friends again). every time i see her i have to hear ""are you okay? you look sad."" those are my two least favorite sentences on the entire planet. i'm not sad, i'm empty and angry. i'm not smiling because nothing funny is happening at the moment, and i guess i have resting-suicidal-face. and who honestly replies ""no"" when someone asks if they're alright? i've heard those two sentences so much that they're just white noise at this point. anyways, m wants to be a therapist. i'm sure she'd be great at it. i went to her once at camp, back when i hadn't closed my emotions off completely, to talk about s and her family life (pushover dad, verbally abusive mom, but she and her older brother have gotten closer, which is sweet). she had good advice. we sort of used to date, though i don't count it. i'm gay, pure and simple. i thought i was bi because of her and s (i'll get into that in a sec). she liked me, and i liked the contact. yes, she's pretty, but still. i'm gay. i didn't love her like that, i loved her closeness. we got together over text and broke up in like 3 months without ever seeing each other in person or changing our mannerisms at all. we're still great friends and text multiple times a week. i'm a very touch-starved person, similar to the reason i can no longer cry. before transitioning, i was dysphoric and didn't want people touching me. that's become a sort of reputation now. i do hate it when my family touches me though, no idea why, but i thought i loved m and s (and for a tiny bit, even e) because i loved it when they touched me. and not sexually, i couldn't care less about sexual shit. never done it, and likely won't trust anyone enough to do that for a while. just a simple knee brush, hand-holding (i've never done that in my life), head resting on a shoulder. i thought i had a crush on s and m (at different points in time) when in reality i just craved closeness and physical contact. though i don't like touch half as much when i initiate it (and if i get a boyfriend, i'd probably be too shy to). sometimes when trying to fall asleep i yearn for some warmth there to just hold me and hug me without zero expectations to talk or do anything besides lay there. i think i'll probably burst into tears the day that happens, which never will with my personality. even now, writing this, i feel like i haven't come into physical contact with anyone for years. but i digress. back to me being a toxic friend. before we upped my meds, i'd go through what i like to call asshole hours. i was such a jerk to my friends and family (but never to teachers, peers, or friends i didn't have too close a connection to, because oh poor me what would happen if i actually had consequences for my actions?). it's been a while since my last asshole hour due to my meds having been upped in november, but i was harsh and rude. s is a pushover and an enabler, which probably stems from her never being able to make a decision in her life because her mother is a grade-a helicopter parent. and she's the type of person to text ""are you okay?"", ""i'm here for you &lt;3"", ""i love you, you know that?"", etc. fuck, i hate that. i'd call her out on it too during those asshole hours. i guess my thoughts are ""i know this stuff, so why do you have to say it? it's implied."" but who knows. i've since stopped coming to her with my problems, which is kind of the straw that broke the camel's back. family is too close for me to share shit, so if i've closed myself off to the person i'm closest to, what hope is there? i'm closed off to everyone now unless i'm anonymous, i suppose.so i said i'll get back to the ""i can't seem to care about anything in real life"" so here it is. i'll admit it's a bit of an over-exaggeration. i do love some things. i love animals more than i love myself, which isn't hard. if i live past 18 i want to become a wildlife rehabilitator, though they don't get paid shit. i love music, though only songs with lots of drums and guitar. i used to love to read and write but barely do so anymore. i just watch youtube because reading and writing takes too much effort and i'm a lazy piece of shit. my twin sister got me into anime--oh boy. for some reason, i only seem to feel things for fictional characters. i think they're more attractive then real people ( you fucking weeb), cooler, kinder, etc. i get genuinely angry over truly evil villains and hate them to my core. and for characters i like, that's a whole other can of worms. i won't name specifically what character/what anime they're from, but one look at my icon and it's not hard to guess. i only watch the anime, since my twin and friends have read the manga, so i'm like the test dummy and the only person who doesn't know what's going to happen (which i'm fine with--i think it's fun). the anime just introduced this character, but i've known about him for a while. he's immensely important in the manga and my twin told me about him because she knows how much i love people with wings (which he has). bad idea to tell me about him. i learned he's in some deep shit in the manga and people think he's going to die, which truly, genuinely terrifies me. let that sink it. i'm more upset over the fact that a bunch of lines resembling a person drawn by some dude in japan might die over my own grandmother. i almost had a panic attack over the thought of him dying. why the hell do i feel so much for a fictional character and so little for real-life people?also, here's the obligatory the-world's-gone-to-shit paragraph. i hate the world (how corny), i hate people, and i have no hope for us. take a guess at what country i'm in and maybe you'll see why i feel a little justified for at least these thoughts (here's a hint; guns). i don't care about the big bad you-know-what as much as i care about the absolute thick-headed idiots who either think it's fake or are proudly protesting it. i want them to die, and i suppose that makes me a bad person. i like watching those instant karma videos of assholes getting beat up or put in jail or crashing their car. and that goes for any of the dumbasses of the world. any asshole who's an asshole just because they can be. there's too many of them and not enough kind people. the world will not get better in my lifetime, and i don't care about the future as much because i like seeing results. i don't donate money to charity since i don't see the results--i'd rather be there handing out food or building a shelter for homeless people or whatever. the world sucks, it's not gonna get fixed anytime soon, and if i wasn't so goddamn scared of consequences i'd probably become a homeless alcoholic or druggy (i really do have very little self-control) once i move out, if i ever do. i have intense monophobia, which means i'm scared of being alone. funny, right? and by alone, i mean without someone i know. so i can't go out in public, or go to college, or live alone, which is something i really want. i'm going to get a service dog when i'm 17 for this (i don't need one now since i don't do shit and when i do my twin comes with me, but my doctor said my anxiety/monophobia qualifies as a disability). so it's kind of funny that i'm tethered to what i desperately want to get away from.i'll boil this whole post into a simple tl;dr. i'm a selfish, lazy, entitled, angry asshole who wants to use his mental illness as an excuse to be a piece of shit, and, while recognizing that i'm a horrible person, i don't want to put any effort in to change that and just want some magic swish of a wand to make it all better or else i'd rather do nothing but sit in this shit and fester. i don't want to die but don't want to live as i am now, so i'm stuck in a limbo of my own making with no desire to get out, crying to a bunch of internet strangers who, after reading this and maybe replying with some inane ""it gets better, you're not alone!"" bullshit that just goes in one ear out the other, will go about their day without truly caring because they don't even know so much as my name. you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped, right? that's the saying. so try telling me i'm not a hopeless case now. wave your wands, reddit. prove me wrong. or call out my blatant attempt at attention and pity and how stupid i am for complaining about my life but not be willing to change it. i don't know what i expect from this. words can't seem to reach me now. but hey, maybe one of you can surprise me.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/gimmod/how_do_i_even_begin_to_explain_how_much_of_a/,,How Do I Even Begin to Explain How Much of a Hopeless Case I am?
"my husband (33m) and i 28(f) bought a house 3 years ago with a down payment provided by mother (55f) with the intention of building her a wheelchair accessible back house and taking care of her for as long as possible (she has early dementia, ms, non mobile, and a history a small strokes) she was living with her 80 year old parents and it wasnt a good situation for anyone. it took us a year to build the back house and then a year of her stalling to move out here until i was 7 months pregnant with our first child then she pulled the trigger and finally moved out in december of 2018. fast forward to july 2019 i’m a new mom of 5 month old, exhausted from months of caring for her and a new baby. and while i’m at a drs appointment my husband finds her wheeling around the backyard naked, crying for help because of (later learned) a delirium caused by a uti. we realize that it is unsafe for her to live with us and be taking her own medications without 24 hour care (that we can not reasonably provide) and we hunt for her forever and find a super nice (but pricey) assisted living facility, that will take a 55f with me, with a dog, a lot of places wouldn’t take ms patients or someone as young as her. i finally slept good and felt relieved for the first time in years the first night she was there.anyway, she’s been in assisted living since july 2019 seems to really like it there, but it is expensive, she’s paying it out of her savings (dads life insurance) and we’re renting out her previous back house to at least cover 1,000 dollars of her expenses a month. but i just have this constant mix between extreme guilt, that we have this house because of her down payment and i failed her. and also this exhaustion again of being the only caregiver (family member?) trying to do anything. i’m pregnant with our second child and i just so badly wish i could be like any other young mom with doting grandparents that could watch the kids and who i could talk to, and instead i’m just a caregiver who is sometimes the enemy. i just don’t know how to feel anymore. besides constantly upset. i just got into a stupid pointless fight with her over the phone because she she doesn’t know she has memory problems (i mean of course she doesn’t) and thinks she’s in assisted living only because i couldn’t deal with or as punishment for her uti. i’m so sorry, i know no one will probably make it to the end of this. and maybe i am a horrible selfish person. but if you made it here thank you for reading and letting me get some of this out."," hi, i just wanted to reach out and say no, you are not selfish at all. i am the same age as you, and our situations were similar. i have moved home, to help my mum care for my father with ms and dementia. it is very very hard, and a specialised facility is truly sometimes the best option. as you no doubt know, both ms and dementia are very complex, and take a very high care load. if you ever need someone to talk to, hit me up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/gfo6o5/i_just_need_to_vent_if_thats_okay/,,I just need to vent if that’s okay
"i'm really glad i found this place. i haven't been able to find much in the way of irl support groups, and it's been a rough time.me: my dad has lewy body dementia (lbd). my mother (72) is his primary caregiver. she's physically ok but emotionally overwhelmed. i'm living there to take care of everything else while she focuses on dad, as well as to keep a close eye on the situation. i work full time, though, so can't keep an eye on things 24/7.the issue: my mother has news/talk radio on 24/7, and it's making dad crazy. what tends to happen is that, due to the lbd, dad will get confused about something he sees or hears and then form a delusion around it. the lbd has made him very anxious, so generally these delusions are upsetting. examples: a few weeks ago the news was covering tornadoes several states away but dad became convinced that they were talking about here, so he was pacing the house, wringing his hands, shaking, pulling us away from doors and windows, demanding we get into the basement, etc. a while before that he became convinced he was a whistleblower who was in trouble from the government for revealing state secrets and now they were coming after him and he had to go into hiding to protect us. just today he became convinced that some russian guy called bernie sanders hacked my parents' bank account and stole all their money and was coming after their house next, and i needed to call chuck schumer to get it back. and so on.it's pretty clear to me where these delusions are coming from. not only is it upsetting to see him get so upset, it honestly gets exhausting for the rest of us to deal with, since he gets really fixated and cannot be calmed or redirected once the delusion takes hold, and sometimes he'll obsess over them for days. i know that, due to the nature of the beast, i can't eliminate all of his confusion and anxiety. but i think it's reasonable to, having identified one source, eliminate that source.thing is, i have tried to get mom to see the connection and limit dad's news exposure (or at least wear headphones), but she won't. she says she needs to watch/listen to her shows to stay informed. i just don't know what to do short of blocking those sites, but if i do, she'll have a meltdown, and that'll upset dad, so i'm afraid i'll actually make the situation worse, not better.has anyone been here? what do i do?  what can i do?", im going to be honest. being a caregiver sucks. if listening to the news 24 7 makes its easier on her leave it be. you cant cater to bim while stepping on her toes. if its not the news his mind will latch on to something else. and he still going to have a fit. you cant fix everything. and you dont want resentment. let her win this one,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ge1np4/how_to_persuade_my_mother_to_limit_dads_news/,,How to persuade my mother to limit dad's news consumption?
"hi. i used to work for a family who had two kids, an autistic toddler and maybe daughter, and a young bedridden father with good humor. i also did housekeeping. i was 18 with no education and it really opened my eyes to a new environment i was not used to. i worked for them for 6 months until the son was sent to a special needs program and the mother was done with school. it was fun, stressful but i did enjoy the company of the kids and parents, kept busy, and was pretty happy. i cleaned, bathed, and fed everybody. i was woefully underpaid.                   ————————————————————————-in february (i’m 19) i picked up (my current) job doing part-time home healthcare for a lady with parkinson’s syndrome. plan was i come, clean a bit, make food and company. the other  hha that comes at night was having a lot of health issues (during the start of the pandemic) and her husband suddenly asks me if i want to work full-time. i say yes. why did i say yes? —————————————————————————i’m the caveat in this story, i realize now this is a very emotionally taxing job built for the certain few (not me). i should’ve just stick to babysitting. she can walk, with a cane and can mumble words. i come in and clean the house, give company, showers, etc... she then starts asking me to clean the pool, pull out weeds, and help her sneakily throw away her family’s belongings (i refuse). being older now i do not want to do more than my job for the pay i am getting! the pool does not work but i’ve been cleaning it everyday just so i can be outside of the house. i’ve grown very resentful of her.  it is so depressing here compared to the other family, i feel more stressed at nothing and lonely and i don’t know how to communicate properly to her, she doesn’t take “no” for an answer. —————————————————————————i stopped taking care of myself (i am prone to depression). i carry no hope here. i try to understand where she is in life and see where she is coming from. her mother had dementia and is dead.                                                                                  im sure i’m here as a placeholder because obviously the husband knows i don’t have the education or experience or character for this. i can’t help feeling like a fraud. i informed him of my leave date mid-may and have a retail interview scheduled later this week. —————————————————————————now i am just stuck in the present. thank you for reading my story, i know most of you have had to deal with your situation for much longer if not harder with actual family members but i really really really needed to write this out. my dream is to be a better, un self-centered person and i can’t do that here. i’m simply going crazy. toodles"," you sound like a wonderful person. so not a fraud, but honestly accept that you have gotten in over your head. not a thing wrong with taking a step back, and realize it is time to do something else.i'm not sure what country you are in, perhaps uk or usa?in the usa we have [parkinson.org](  in the uk is [ for the usa the ""[aware in care kit]( is a wonderful help for those times we need to go to an er or hospital. very least make sure she keeps all her medications in a clear ziplock bag in the original pharmacy bottles.

"👋 hi. first time posting. i will try to make this easy to digest.... but it might just be a long vent. im sorry and i will delete this if it is against guidelines. i am 30, female, ft student, ft work. i live a half hour from my 87 year old grandmother, and my drunk/drug addict/hoarder uncle who lives in her basement.the rest of the family (her actual children) live out of state. they have written her off because she won’t kick out the drunk filthy/dangerous uncle. my father has medical poa. he is out of state and busy running his business.my aunt has financial poa. she is also of state, comes 1-3 times a year for a day or two, and won’t relinquish any financial information. i have been taking care of my grandmother for over a year. i have pleaded for help and they have all ignored me, belittled me, and derided me. my grandmother has been showing increasing signs of dementia for years, no one will believe me. she’s also deaf and now fully incontinent. i have had to drive to her house in the middle of the night multiple times to call ambulances because the drunk uncle called me to inform me she was “lookin real bad” —to which i have recently found her suffocating in her bed, covered in her own feces.there have been so many specialists. it’s one thing after the other. i had her cataracts removed. then she developed a tooth abscess and didn’t tell me until it progressed to sepsis. then the uti’s because she didn’t tell me she wasn’t cleaning herself anymore. then all the cardiologist appointments. getting meds right. she won’t take her meds on time. she won’t use an alarm clock. she won’t get up and move. she won’t wear clean clothes. i often find her with food mess on her face. she has false memories. and will often refuse to answer you when you challenge her in direct conversation. or she will change the subject. or she will just tell you she is confused when you try to ask her serious questions. she’ll say really weird things out of nowhere when you spend enough time with her. i mean— weird. for instance, out of nowhere she informed me “yeah, she just thought i was god,” and after she went on for a while i finally realized she was talking about an old hairdresser of hers from 30 years ago- completely unprompted. however otherwise— she can appear very, very sharp. she’ll make conversation about current events. make jokes, seem jovial and enthusiastic. and she also lies. she lies about everything. she will cough for 3 minutes and then tell you she doesn’t have a cough. she labors for breath between sentences, then tells you she breathes fine. she lies about cleaning herself or feeling well. she fools everyone into thinking she’s “doing great!”i think she has early onset dementia. i think she presents with full personal neglect. i think she needs full time care.my family is fighting me on this. they refuse to visit her and have not taken her to a single doctors appointment or er trip in the past two years, only me. yet they tell me she is of sound kind and if this is the way she wants to live, so be it. they say i am too emotionally invested.i disagree. these are my values and my morals making me act. i want her in full time care. i want someone to wash her so she doesn’t die in her bed, covered in filth. i want someone to feed her and give her medications at the right times. i threatened to call adult protective services if changes were not made by those wielding the ability (poas). my family has stopped all communication with me, (and i them) except for my father, who is now working to get her home cleaned out, my uncle evicted, and to get her a 24/hr nurse or into assisted living. i think he may only doing this because if i call adult protective services, he is the one on the hook. but whatever. at least he’s finally doing something.i cried all day yesterday after my uncle called me a pest. but i refuse to believe that trying to get my grandmother into any semblance of humane conditions is wrong. and she has plenty of money in retirement and investments— it’s not a money issue. i’m pretty exhausted. i don’t even know why i’m writing this. i’ve just felt so alone for a long time. and now i have cut ties with all family members who refuse to help me get her care. it’s draining in a way i can’t word.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/g9y2p4/family_fallout/,,Family fallout
"i want to scream at all of my friends and family.  they are bitching about being unable to do things and see people because of the pandemic.  they are complaining that their lives are so upended and how will they get through this.  they whine because they can't go out to their favorite restaurants or take their spring break.meanwhile, my life has essentially been a case of self isolation since i became a caregiver, and i've only been doing it for a year (some of you are amazing for doing for it so much longer).  it was months before the pandemic since i'd been able to really see friends.  i haven't been able to work since my mom got sick.  i have to worry now about getting necessary supplies to deal with my mom's infections, the same supplies that stupid idiots hoarded.  this whole situation isn't fair for anyone, but dammit i can't stand seeing people griping over having to wear a mask to the grocery store, while i'm literally cleaning shit from my incontinent, dementia affected mother.  i know people have it worse and people have it better, and you cant fairly compare situations, but i just need to yell.i can't even safely and reliably get help right now because everything is locked down.  i'm going crazy and though i'm not diagnosed i'd bet anything i'm fucking depressed as hell.  i hate this.  i hate that i've become a person that hates caring for my mother.  i want to help her get better, but she doesn't want to do the things she needs to.  i'm fighting my need to push her to do things and acknowledging that she has to want to get better for it mean anything.and there is no escape.  i can't go anywhere to get away anymore.  my dad, who is worse than no help, isn't going anywhere either and so it's just the three of us stuck here having the same fights everyday.  i hate watching my mother decline and feeling like i'm the only one trying to save the ship from sinking.  i'm mentally, physically, and emotionally beat and i don't see an end in sight.  i can't do this for the rest of my life.  it's not fair.  and i'm angriest above all that i don't have my mom anymore.  she was my rock before all of this happened, and while my sister is great, and my friends are great, they aren't the same.  i lost my biggest support system when i became her support.i'm sorry this is so long.  i'm sorry for anyone going through any of these same things or any battles of your own."," being a caregiver to a family member is a tough tough job.  you’re on duty 24 hours a day, no wonder you’re aggravated.  it’s a job that very few people actually eagerly volunteer to do.  we do it out of love and duty.  but we can hate the job while we still love taking care of our family member.you say your mother is incontinent and has dementia.  i’m sorry to say that if it’s definitely dementia, she won’t get better. dementia is a progressive disease. most dementia patients eventually have to be admitted to a memory care facility or nursing home because their care requires more than what one human can do.  they end up requiring care 24 hours a day, which isn’t sustainable at home.  it takes 3 shifts of aides and nurses to care for them properly.  a few also become violent or wander away from home, which is also a sign that a higher level of care is needed.it sounds like you love your mother very much and will give her the best care you can.  just remember that you are only one human, with needs like sleep and companionship and lack of stress - or you will need someone to take care of you!  take care and don’t forget to take care of yourself too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/g4h3d4/self_isolating_before_covid19/,,Self Isolating Before Covid19
"hi everyone,i'm brand new here, and honestly haven't even had time to read any of the other posts just yet, but you were the first subreddit that came up when i typed in carer support, so i'm really hoping that this is the right place.i'm really struggling just now. i'm very new to caring for someone and i just need to vent for a little bit. thank you to anyone who reads through this.my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago but managed to live on her own with the support of her three local adult children. my family had moved to a different country when i was a child. the family had decided that she was no longer coping on her own, and decided it was time to move her to a nursing home just before covid struck, but this clearly was no longer an option. as my university course became remote-learning and i had a little of the theoretical knowledge of how to cope with patients with advanced dementia (i am studying medicine), the best idea seemed to be for me to move in with my grandmother and become her full-time carer. this also allowed for fewer people to be in and out of her house all day, reducing her risk for coronavirus. i have now been living with her for the past two weeks.i love my grandmother to pieces, and we were always incredibly close. i am her eldest grandchild and i have frequently stayed with her for long periods before. i know that right now she is scared and confused. we had spoken years ago about how the one thing she feared in life was losing her memory (long before her dementia started) and now her worst fear is coming true. i want to be there for her and i want to be able to help her to stay in her own home and as independant as possible, but right now i'm finding it difficult. when at university, i live a fairly typical student life. i'm probably a little more restrained than your average student (no wild parties or frequent flings), but i'm not always the neatest and probably live off slightly too much ramen. having said that i am a fairly good cook when i want to be, and given my grandmother will insist she isn't hungry unless you put food in front of her and eat alongside her, i've been much more regimented with making sure i'm cooking two or three varied meals a day. (on a side note, she desperately needs nutrients and to gain weight, so i've probably been eating more veg than i have in years!) having said that she is frequently making comments about how she ""understands that she can't expect me to meet the standards she would set herself"", how ""young girls today don't understand the merits of a clean kitchen"" (whilst refusing to allow me to clean and insisting on doing it herself), and ""how i really should follow her recipe exactly"" (when the bread i made isn't exactly the way she'd make it without having ever let me know that she had her own recipe).logically i understand that this isn't really her fault, but today was the first day that i argued with her. i shouldn't have, but i was overtired and stressed, and i tried to reason her out of a position that she didn't have the capacity to reason herself into. i actually think i'm more annoyed at myself for not being able to accept that this wasn't the grandmother that i love criticizing me. this was alzheimer's being frustrated that it couldn't understand why the world was so confusing and different. i just need someone to remind me of that.seriously after two weeks of this, i have so much respect for all of you who have been doing this for so much longer than i could dream of right now. (and double respect for anyone that made it to the end of this essay!)"," old people can be extremely hard to deal with. mad respect to you for caring back for your grandma. just think back to the many years she cared for you when you were young and how you have to return it now. the roles are reversed and she's the child now. you have to treat her like a child. you know what she says isn't true. she's just being picky like how we all were when we were kids about food. yes, she can be unreasonable but she's a kid now. she reverted back into a child-like mindset. you have to coax her and play along. and don't ever let your self esteem get down due to it, or even question your love for your grandma. the fact that you chose to do it already proves a lot. do not feel bad about anything and do not take anything to heart. she's old now and whatever she says just treat is as the request of an unreasonable child that you have to coax. :) once again, good on you for caring for your beloved grandma!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/g3rckp/need_some_tlc_right_now/,,Need some TLC right now

"hi, i want to apologize for the wall of text but i truly am lost, i am drowning and struggling to keep my head above water. (trigger warning for death.)i grew up with my grandparents, they took me in as a newborn because my mother didn't care to take care of me/was responsible enough to take care of me. they were in their 50s by then. growing up was fine and things were easy until my grandpa got a blood cancer diagnosis in 2011. it was manageable since he was in his 60s by then; i was still in high school but this is when i started taking my first steps into caretaking. i had to watch out for temperature spikes, i had to watch out for signs of pneumonia, blood clots, and other general things the more his disease progressed. in 2017, things took a turn for the worst and his health decreased more and more. 2018, i was officially in full caretaker mode; i didn't go back to school to finish the handful of credits i had left, i left the comfortable job i had there in order to be there to make sure he was okay which i never minded. my grandpa and i were closer than anyone in my family, so i felt like it was only right that i do this for him. in october 2018, i went on a short trip out of town without knowing how unwell my grandpa was, and he told me i should go, even though i desperately wanted to stay. but i bought the plane tickets and the person i was going to see in not so many words didn't want me to cancel the trip. four days into my trip, my grandpa went to the hospital and died of kidney failure as a result of his cancer. i feel guilt over this every day and it's hard to forgive myself; what do you do when a seemingly routine hospitalization turns into the last time you'll see them? this is where my grandma comes in. we've never been close, and she's been mildly abusive to me my entire life (verbal, emotional and sometimes physical) but the death of my grandpa made me feel as if i needed to reconcile and put the past behind us in order to make sure she was okay. she's turning 80 this december, and while i love her things have gotten exceptionally hard, even harder than it was dealing with my grandpa's frequent hospitalizations and incontinence. she went into the hospital august 2019 very sick, and i didn't know with exactly what until the doctors told us she needed to have emergency gallbladder removal. after her surgery, they moved her to physical therapy rehab to help her regain her movement since she was in a hospital bed for almost a month. it's at the rehab/long term care facility that the doctors told me she's in the early stages of dementia.while in the rehab, i tried to help the doctors and physical therapists with making sure she did the exercises (physical and mental) that she was supposed to be doing; but if she wasn't ignoring and yelling at the doctors, she was ignoring and yelling at me and it reminds me too much of my childhood. they wanted to send home help in the form of weekly physical therapists and cognitive therapy and medication except once she was home, she yelled and ignored them to the point they stopped coming with no notice all together. i felt too guilty after that to make her take the pills; i regret this, because maybe things would've been better. so now, it's just me taking care of things like cooking her meals, making sure her medicines and doctor's appointments are tended to, making sure she's keeping herself busy instead of staring at the television except she still fights me. she refuses to eat when she's upset with something i've said, she doesn't sleep normal hours, she won't let me ask the other family for help because it's gotten to the point where my health is finally plummeting. i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was 11, and living with her without my grandpa around to talk to has made my mental health worse. i can't see a therapist or make appointments for my health as often as i'd like because she has separation anxiety when i'm gone, and i can't talk to her about how i'm feeling because she takes it as personal attacks, calls me crazy or sometimes downright turns her head away from me in an obvious show of ignoring me. we argue more and more until it's gotten to the point i can barely get out of bed for fear of what she'll say that day to make me feel terrible or to make me cry, but it's the guilt of my grandpa and knowing he'd want me to take care of her that keeps me here. i feel guilty that i don't want to do this. i'm 24, i was only two years into my degree and now i'm not sure if i can even go back because i've forgotten almost everything in the midst of death and grief. i don't have any friends, and the only people i can talk to are people on twitter but. no one wants to hear about something so depressing all the time so i slap on a mask and pretend i am coping but i'm not. i haven't felt this unwell since depression first stepped into my life and not since my first suicide attempt (that my grandma initiated). i have two aunts, a mother and even an adult cousin that all have more resources than me except they're the ones taking trips, going to work and living their lives without any regards to us. they only call her to make sure she's not dead, they never call me. i've never gotten along with them either, except for one of my aunts but it still feels so unfair that this is all my responsibility. i hate the bitterness i feel, because you're supposed to do this for family, right? except i feel like a shadow of myself, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't recognize myself anymore. i don't feel pretty anymore, i don't feel like i have worth anymore. and it's hard trying to take care of someone else when it feels like they hate you every single day but cry and say they need you when you want just an inch of space. i'm not sure what to do anymore. i need help but we don't have the income for home help i don't think. any advice would desperately be appreciated because i feel like i'm failing her and my grandpa, and myself. thank you to anyone listening, not many do lately.", danghey tell your family she's their grandma too they fucking better step upguilt them into ityou did right by your grandpa you were present as much as possiblenowwwww it's a bit much. got to get a caregiver to hang out sometimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fh5i36/taking_care_of_my_grandparents_fell_on_my/,,"taking care of my grandparents fell on my shoulders, except i'm getting crushed under the weight of loss and grief."

grandparents until my grandfather died. i went on to help my grandma until she was eventually placed in a home where she currently resides. they both have/had severe alzheimers/dementia and my grandma is a diabetic. i would cook, clean, and administer meds for them both. because of my experience with this, it was naturally expected of me to be there to help my mom adjust to taking care of my dad

stroke, they were doing great on their own and they actually had a healthy dynamic. now some backstory: my parents have an extremely toxic relationship. my mom was a lifelong alcoholic until last year

because of my mom's alcoholism. i constantly got into verbal fights with my mom while trying to defend myself. i would get in trouble for stuff my siblings did, i would fight back about how unfair it was that my youngest brother and sister were never made to do chores or clean. this affects their adult lives, with my brother only learning how to do basic things from his gf and my sister turning into an unchecked ego. ithere was a lot of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse that happened pretty much my entire life. my parents constantly fought and would refuse to divorce because they wanted to stick together for my brother. long story short about my brother: he is the christ child and can do no wrong. they worship him. standard sexism in the family unit stuff. my mom would bend over backwards to make sure my dad and brother got everything they ever wanted, while myself and my closest sister were treated like the help. i was the only one that was ever hit and anytime i did something that upset my dad, he would spank me and blame the pain on me, saying stuff like this hurts me more than it does you. i would get my behind shredded for making a b in 3rd grade. stuff like that. the one time i told a teacher about it, she contacted my parents and told them everything. i was having trouble sitting at school because my dad had beat my behind the night before for not cleaning my room in a timely manner.anyways, i will move on to the current situation. a few months after i moved back in with my parents to help out, my mom broke her back. burst fracture if her l1. turns out if you have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis, and you drink heavily every day for 30 years, you make your bones so brittle that a sneeze could break your ribs.who knew right?so i was suddenly not just helping, i was taking care of both of them.now keep in mind the emotional abuse i had experienced in the past.my dad's emotional filter in his brain was basically destroyed. he lost his left side to paralysis. he would verbally lash out at me and my mom for little shit and on a few occasions he tried to hit us with his cane.he could have actually killed my mom if he had hit her but thankfully that did not happen.fast forward to now. i have become their full time caretaker and take care of literally everything.i could go on and on about all the shit that has happened in the last 4 years but this post is already too long. now i am completely burnt out. i can't be around my dad without being triggered violently and i have to stop myself from blowing up. my mom is a narcissistic guilt trip master and i literally cannot leave the house unless it's to take them to doc appts or to buy groceries. the few and far between times that i can leave the house, they both guilt me and make me feel terrible and treat me like a child. i'm gonna be 30 this year. i have no life. i have one friend. i almost never leave the house. we are living off of my dad's social security disability check which isn't enough to actually survive on. my mom is waiting to get on disability but they are taking their dear sweet time. we haven't paid rent in the last 2 months because if we did wouldn't have any money for food or for medicine and that's a whole other bag of dicks right there. both of their meds together cost roughly 800 a month. and that's even with my dad now being on humana and medicare.i don't know what to do. i desperately want to escape and get on with my life. literally everyone i talk to tells me to get out and i know i need to.but here's the thing...i would feel so guilty, despite everything. i would feel like i'm abandoning them. i have tried to reach out for help. nothing is working.both of my parents are technically capable of taking care of some things themselves but they won't do it and when i try to explain how it would help me greatly, it turns into a ""you're so ungrateful and selfish"" argument.i have to make phone calls for them that they could make themselves. fill out paperwork they could do themselves. i even have to talk to their docs for them because if i didn't, they wouldn't care and wouldn't advocate for themselves. there is an extremely unhealthy attachment going on here and i just wanna hear from anyone who is or has experienced something similar. i just need help. i am so fucking tired and i'm scared that i will send myself into a cardiac episode or worse because i'm under so much constant stress. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'm sorry if i have posted in the wrong area. this is my first ever post."," this is a truly terrible situation. wish i had better ideas for how to get you out of it, but someone already suggested calling adult protective services, which i

"so just a very broad question/ discussion about end of life legal issues between doctors and hospice. fil has battled alzheimers for at least 12yrs. it was definitely taking it's toll, but his body seemed to be doing ok. the brain, not so much. his quality of life was going downhill fairly rapidly, but was still able to get around with minimal physical help. he began getting infections, and had a couple hospital visits to address them. long story short, his long term family doctor was sure he was septic, and that anything else they could do would only prolong his life, but the quality of it would be terrible. he suggested that he be admitted to hospice care, just to keep him comfortable. we kinda scratched our heads a bit, as he was still responsive, and didn't appear to be in physical duress. we asked an attending dr. what they would do if it was their dad, and they said hospice. now, we all agreed that this was the place where he would have ended up sooner, rather than later, but under the hospice meds, he couldn't /wouldn't eat or drink hardly anything. after about a week, he was struggling breathing, so his dr instructed the hospice nurse to give him meds every 30 min(!), she had never had that instruction before, but she carried it out. within 6hrs, he passed. nobody could find the dr to have him sign off on the cause of death, and it appears that he is out of the country. now we get word today that the county coroner didn't accept the listed cause of death! like wtf?! so i was just curious what anyone here knows about it."," what was the cause of death provided by the hospice staff physician? terms like “cardiac arrest” are often listed by hospital and er physicians but in the forensic community these are not acceptable causes of death - rather they are terminal events that happen to everyone when they die.it is up to the discretion of the coroner or medical examiner (depending on which state you live in) to determine whether an autopsy is needed and what the cause of death is. if it is straight forward as the hospice physician claims, then the coroner should review medical records and the cause of death would be something along the lines of “sepsis due to complications of alzheimer’s disease”. typically an autopsy would not be performed in this case, given that the decedent was in medical care with a known medical diagnosis before death.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f2e3hy/coroner_wont_accept_cause_of_death_that_was/,,Coroner won't accept cause of death that was listed by hospice for FIL.

"hello all. it’s been an exhausting 24 hours. my little brother (23), fiancé (m25), and i (f25) have been taking care of our paternal grandparents for the last two years. our dad and aunt have been pretty absent until recently only because i forced my father to take poa within the last few months. my pop (grandfather) has been fragile my entire life. he was a coal miner but was sent all over the world to look at mining machinery and make diagnoses. he’s truly brilliant and gifted and never had any education past his ged. unfortunately the men in my family have horrible heart problems. great grandfather passed in the middle of meeting from a massive heart attack at 65. my pop (his son) is 82 so he’s done great (but has had open hearts surgery and so many other procedures, my dad has had a heart attack but refuses to go to the doctor anymore). two years ago my fiancé and i bought my grandparents home and moved them in next door (handicap accessible) so they could maintain their freedom a little longer. pop quickly deteriorated and we’ve become regulars at the er, hospital, and nursing home. we’ve only had pop home for 2 weeks at a time before he was back in the hospital and then to the nursing home for 90 days over the last two years. my mim (grandmother) has dementia but won’t seek treatment and has put so much stress on him. we all love her so much but she is a bully to pop at no fault of her own. it’s an ugly disease. she’s extremely manipulative and we’ve begged for help but have gotten nothing. she went as far as threatening to kill herself and slapped a paramedic when pop had fallen and amr was called to the home in the middle of the night. she blamed me many times and sometimes it felt like she didn’t see me as a granddaughter. she would scream at me for no reason and would think i was a home nurse at times. i know it’s not her but it still tears my heart up. pop has had to call the cops on her when he was home because she could be so mean. my blood pressure had gotten so high i was in stage 2 hypertension. yesterday i was heading out the door for work when i received a call from my dad that i needed to get to the hospital. pop coded 2 times and his heart had stopped beating for 15 mins. it took over an hour for the team to get him stable and then an eternity to get to see him. he was strapped down. had to tubes everywhere. blood everywhere (port put in his neck) ice cold, and green in color. his heart and kidney functioning are down to 10%. he’s lived the last year at 17% heart and 23% kidney. my little brother and i talked to him. held his hand. and tried to comfort him . i don’t know if he could hear us but we wanted him to know we were there. his body twitched a lot but i want to think it was him squeezing my hand to let me know he’s there too. this week we found out my little brother has 45% heart functioning and his valves are letting blood in and out. he’s been having problems the last year and finally switched doctors and within a week had some answers and a referral to a cardiologist. my brother told pop that he got his results back and that his heart looked good and he’s healthy as can be. we don’t want him to worry.   i just want to hear his voice again and tell me “everything is alright, kiddo”. my cousins (aunts children) haven’t even bothered to see or call our grandparents in the last few years. they’re 27, 30, and 34 years old. i couldn’t sleep last night so i browsed social media to keep my mind busy. all three cousins have been posting pictures and talking about all their memories on the farm and doing things with our grandparents that they never did. it enrages me. it’s silly to let it bother me but it breaks my heart for my mim and pop that they haven’t been around (they all live local too). the 27 year old is also diabetic and called pop a few years ago asking for a bottle of insulin. my pop didn’t even recognize his voice or know which grandson was calling. cousin didn’t even stay and visit when he came to get the insulin! his baby momma and 5 kids stayed in the car so he ran in and ran out. i know it’s their loss and they will have to deal with this own conscious but i can’t stand that they pretend to be involved. we begged for help and everyone was always conveniently “busy”. this has turned into such a long post and if you’re here with me to the end. i thank you. it means more than i can even express. my heart is so broken and i’m so lost. my wedding is in 2 months and my number 1 fan won’t be able to see it. i’ve dealt with loss before (friend committed suicide right after high school) but i’ve never watched someone deteriorate in front of me. i know i will get through this but it seems impossible right now. i would give anything to have one more talk with him."," i don’t normally respond because these are always so heartbreaking and i never feel like i have the right words to help.  i usually come to this sub to feel less alone.  but this one hit home for me. i’m in the same place with some cousins and family, but they’re out of state and i’m the only grandchild helping.  it’s super tough.  we lost my grandpa almost two years ago and they visited to claim dibs on his stuff (and my grandma’s stuff, even though she’s very much still alive).  your grandpa hears you, and he knows you love him!you and your brother and fiancé sound like fantastic people!  wish i had better advice other than that i think you’ll feel at peace with your choices where your family might feel regret someday in the future.  stay off social media (reddit excluded, of course).  that is what helps me.  it hurts when you feel like you’re just starting your life but you have so many responsibilities that none of your friends or family will understand.  seeing people doing fun stuff on facebook sometimes can be a bummer (although people only share the good stuff—we can never see what their lives are actually like).  it’s probably difficult, but take time for yourself when at all possible.  go on a coffee date with your fiancé.  i love wandering every aisle in the supermarket.wishing you all the good things, and hope your brother gets better news (my dad just got his second valve replacement—they’ve made a lot of advances in cardiac surgery so hopefully your brother can get the best and easiest treatments).  hang in there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/etau73/my_pop_is_on_life_support/,,My Pop is on life support.

"hello fellow carers! throwing out a request for some advice/thoughts on making decisions about my father’s future. i am currently living with and caring for my father, who has parkinson’s dementia alongside other health issues. my mother died recently and i am now the sole carer and decider for the household (alongside my brother who lives overseas). dad’s house is currently a small house with bedroom, bathroom and sitting room on the ground floor level (all upside down and round-about) , with the kitchen and his current bedroom+bathroom downstairs in the basement. my parents always planned that he would someday move up to the ground floor bedroom and still have access to the sitting room and obviously the front door and outside! we have also been wondering about the possibility of moving. ideally to a bungalow (one level house) or an apartment, so that unlike in the first scenario, he could have access to the kitchen. first scenario is most definitely the simpler option. it would just involve some furniture moving and buying, with a little bit of possibly muddle-dum from dad being in a new room. (his dementia is relatively early, although getting worse by the month and he is very confused). the stairs are for sure getting scarier for him. thankfully i am here 24/7 and do all cooking, so really, him not being able to reach the kitchen is not a big tragedy for now and certainly not as his condition will certainly progress. also thought about getting a stairlift, but unsure how long he might be able to use even that and if it’s worth it.second scenario-move to bungalow or flat-possibly dad’s ‘old age dream’, but frankly one that should have been put into practice a few years back. alas they did try but found the prices were beyond their reach. there do seem to be a few available now, but in some not so nice areas that he doesn’t really know. and similarly with apartments. (he is also very fussy about noisy neighbours but beggars can’t be choosers hey!) moving would for sure give him the access to all rooms that may not be possible here. but i guess it’s quite obvious...i have my worries.-could he cope with a move...physically, mentally, financially-are we laying out huge stress, to put off the inevitable (going into care)-to afford what he’d really want, it would have to be in an unknown area (and so possible disorientation) and that is not so ‘safe’apologies for long waffling. just wondering if anyone has any experience with similar situations and any thoughts."," what about setting up a small kitchen on the ground level floor. small fridge, microwave, sink. this will give him a bathroom, shower (tubs are not good due to falls), living area and kitchen.  this allows a caregiver to use stairs and ""say hi"" as they come and go (he has his bedroom for privacy/sleeping).  the biggest concern is ""if he fell and couldn't reach a phone"" how long before someone discovers him?  i was out changing the oil in my truck and couldn't get off the garage floor for four hours. thankfully my son stopped by and helped me up, but i didn't fess up about how long i had been on the floor. since starting my boxing works outs i can not get up off the floor by myself (we have to practice on getting up without using our arms in class, harder than it sounds)dementia, by definition, means we forget thigs. pdd (parkinson's disease with dementia) is different than alzheimer's - so be specific with medical personal that as treatment/drugs are different.  with alzheimer's a friend's dad forgot how to stand, he would fall on the floor. so a much higher level of care. with pdd we have balance/stability issues but remember how to use a walker to navigate the flat. i'm 36 years into parkinson's. it started when i was 25, at 61 still active. my boxing classes (for parkinson's) help with keeping me active both physically and mentally.  my memory is not good, fine during the day but i don't drive at night. critical is reducing his stress and for him to get a good night's sleep./r/parkinsons for those with and family and friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/erk4w2/should_my_father_move_house_or_stay_put/,,Should my father move house or stay put?

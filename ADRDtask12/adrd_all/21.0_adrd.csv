"he has been having pronounced short-term memory problems for several years after a bad seizure, and both his mother and grandmother had early onset, but i guess i had hope that it was some other memory disorder. i just got the call from his doctor and we are going in tomorrow to get more information and ask questions. i'm so lost right now and am not sure where to start. i know a little bit about the progression from watching what happened with my grandmother when i was a teenager, but i know everyone is different."," my advice would be to take action early. get power of attorney and finance taken care of, and then come up with a plan for how your will take care of him in the long term. you will find that it is often just as hard for the caretakers as it is for the patient. start early with getting him comfortable with spending alone time with different family members so later down the road he won’t cling so hard to one person who will then have to bear the burden alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ikobjd/my_father_was_just_diagnosed_with_early_onset_he/,"My father was just diagnosed with early onset.

"does anyone have experience with hiring/providing light at-home care for someone with alzheimers? it would be for a few hours a week to start, just to give my mom a break. my dad (83) was recently diagnosed with alzheimers. he seems to be around stage 5 of 7: gets confused and upset really easily, but can still bathe himself and knows who people are. he's not ready to go live in a facility but he's already blown up the microwave, flooded the house, and gotten lost three blocks from home. he needs someone to warm up my mom's food, chat with him a bit, and generally keep an eye on him. my mom wants to hire a couple of friends/children of friends to do this for him, but we (the kids, 20s-30s) don't like this dynamic. he's wasn't an easy guy to begin with and he now has daily outbursts when he is confused or upset. he behaves much better with strangers than with family because he's very image-conscious, but since his impulse control is fragile and he can be vaguely inappropriate with young women (not handsy, just weird compliments), we don't want anyone who isn't trained in dealing with dementia patients. he has become abusive to my mom (64), who works full time and is overwhelmed by the scope of his needs and his harassment of her. we have urged her to look into hiring someone professional for a few hours a week to give her a break but she is convinced that, because he isn't ready to go into a home, there is no help to be had. they do have money since my mom continues to work, but she is concerned that by starting to spend it now, she will run out of funds when his needs are most serious. my mom is also very protective of his mental state and worries that a stranger, as opposed to people he already knows, would be more difficult for him to adjust to. we the kids disagree: he loves to be the center of attention and having a person around dedicated to his wellbeing would calm and delight him. has anyone else been in this position? what did you do?"," yes, i have been there. my dad was my mom's caregiver and had many of the same arguments. we couldn't convince him otherwise. ideally, we'd wanted them to at least move to a smaller one-level home closer to us. he refused saying my mom wouldn't want to move to something unfamiliar or with new neighbors.then he had a stroke and they found a brain tumor that was too aggressive to do anything. suddenly, we had our own lives and families, a mom in the mid-stage of alzheimer's who could function but was similar with the burning meals, wandering, etc., and trips of 35 miles each way for me to go feed her, make sure she took her medications, etc. my mom wasn't ready to move either, but her delusional behavior, wandering, etc. was concerning. she became fearful of all neighbors saying they were trying to kill her. we found a memory care community that was set up to be as similar to the european one (hogeway) as possible. you have apartments, courtyards inside and out, ""shops"" etc. it's in a cloverleaf design so residents keep walking without ever hitting a dead-end. the nursing staff all have to go through certified dementia practitioners certification. they know how to handle my mom far better than we can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ikc5in/resources_for_light_inhome_care_ny/,Resources for light in-home care (NY)

"so my grandma (75) on my mom’s side has alzheimer’s and it’s been a while now. my grandpa takes care of her but my mom (47) does a lot too to help such as cooking food, cleaning her house and all that. and then there’s me (21) i see my grandma a couple of times a week because we live super close. basically my grandma keeps forgetting that she is retired from work and so everyday she gets dressed and goes walking to her “work” (it’s a 5-6 mins walk from her house). we always tell her that she’s retired everyday but it doesn’t seem like she’ll ever understand or remember and i understand that there isn’t much we can do right? but my mom is having a hard time accepting all this and all she does is yell at my grandma. i can’t take it anymore. i can see my grandma being confused and i see that she’s getting dizzy. i know for a fact that you should not show anger or frustration in front of someone who had alzheimer’s and definitely to not yell at them. she is making her feel bad that she can’t remember. just now she told my grandma “are you trying to punish us?”am i wrong for being absolutely disgusted with what she is saying. i have told my mom over and over again that we can’t act like this in front of her and that it is not her fault that she’d forgetting. we cant make her feel bad for it, she doesn’t know. and when i explain this to my mom she yells at me because i’m not the one really “taking care” of her and says “maybe you should cook and bathe her maybe you’ll understand”. okay like i get it it’s hard but like you’re not helping at the end if you’re talking to her aggressively. my mom also forces her to put on manicure when my grandma says that she doesn’t want to. idk man there’s other things but i don’t know what to do...", [  this is a great class for caregivers to gain insight.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ijkey3/how_do_i_handle_this_situation_in_the_best_way/,How do I handle this situation in the best way possible?

(i really wanted to live in a place with public transport, pedestrian life, and cold weather.)a lot of my father's mind is still intact. he knows who he is, he knows who my mom is, he knows who i am, and he knows that i am here. he knows that i'm living abroad. there is still a lot of him left. he knows what's going on around him, to an extent. he likes bbc podcasts and he follows along. we went to the supermarket and came home and he remembered details of what we did at the supermarket (he found it impressive that i knew how to buy food).my parents' house has been overly cluttered with shit, and i convinced my mom to give a lot of shit to goodwill. most of the shit was random gifts from random people - glass tigers, giant miniature sailboats, metal apples on metal plates, wooden russian spoons, a large yellow vase with red chinese dragons (this object was very expensive and had been important to my father's mother), little sculptures, decorated plates and bowls, all kinds of *objects* from all over the world that people brought to us without asking and expected us to keep forever. every solid surface in the house was covered with this garbage. *expensive* garbage, but garbage nonetheless. the dining room table, the desks, the kitchen counter, the shelves, the dressers, everywhere was covered in stupid objects. thirty years of accumulated garbage ate up all the space, collected dust, cluttered the house. we spent the past two weeks collecting all this garbage into plastic boxes and dumping it off at goodwill. my dad wanted to participate in this cleaning project, but he really couldn't. he kept doing bizarre things like brushing the floor with a small brush instead of using a broom. we have one room that's full of books (which we're mostly planning to give away) and he started cleaning that floor with a wet mop, which was damaging the books. we told him to stop, because first we would take the books to some library and *then* we would clean the floor, but he angrily insisted to do it anyway because ""oh i won't damage the books."" the thing is, my dad was already like that when his brain was working. he would often do things that made sense to absolutely nobody but him, and he would fight you if you tried to interfere. it's one of the reasons my mom wanted to leave him. in my opinion, he had undiagnosed asperger's syndrome, because in the wikipedia entry for asperger's it describes my dad's personality a lot. as it turned out, he had no idea that he was using a wet mop (because he insisted it was dry), so i replaced it with a dry broom and he just kept sweeping.there are some objects that my dad would not want to throw away, like the large yellow vase from china, or a sprawling set of ancient wine glasses we never use, or a heavy crystal-glass bowl that was a wedding gift from some cousin, but he wasn't really capable of recognizing that we were getting rid of those objects. he just went along with it.i also found something which i thought was sort of incredible - a diary kept by my dad's mother during the years 1929 to 1933, when she was age 19 to 23. my dad asked what it was and i told him, i said ""it's a diary from [her name] from 1929 to 1933,"" and he said, ""oh wow! i want to read it!"" but then i guess he forgot about it five minutes later. it had been in the garage, sitting in humidity and heat, so i brought it to my room and read it. i can't say it was that interesting - she visited cleveland and new york, and she was in love with some guy named ray who is almost certainly dead - but having a 90-year-old diary from a deceased relative written when she was almost younger than the dog is quite remarkable. (the dog has also gotten really old and she doesn't like to play anymore.)there are a lot of little things that are getting worse. in 2015 my dad couldn't find his way to an elevator in a small hotel. now he can't recognize cabinets that he built himself twenty years ago. or he'll hold up an object that's very obviously a simple object like a cup and ask what it is. my mom installed some hooks in the bathroom for holding towels and he ripped them off the walls because he thought they were door handles for a cabinet that didn't exist.i've been staying home because i don't want to collect corona and bring it home, but last night i went out with one of my childhood friends, mike, and we sat at an outdoor table at a taco restaurant. he knows my dad. i told him what was going on, and mike said, ""he's going to start forgetting who you are."" that comment sort of caught me off guard, because i guess it didn't occur to me that it will get worse. it didn't occur to me that it's sort of a big deal that my dad still knows who i am and that i am here.i sort of avoid my parents, especially my dad, when i am home, because old habits die hard. he needs a lot of attention (even when his brain worked he needed a lot of attention) so i tended to stay in my room with the door closed, and now as an adult i'm doing the same thing. i feel like i am wasting this valuable time while my dad's brain is still working at the level that it is.i didn't expect to write this many paragraphs, i thought this would be a short post. but anyway i guess i would like to spend some more time with my dad, but i don't really know how because whenever i'm in his presence i feel overwhelmingly driven to go back to my room and sit in bed and browse instagram or some such stupid bullshit. i guess i'd like to know what are some things i can do during this early stage while he's still there. like how can i take advantage of this time.", take him to the park. talk and feed the ducks.or simply hold his hand. it's powerful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/iexpba/what_are_some_things_i_should_do_with_my_dad/,What are some things I should do with my dad while he still remembers who I am?

"i've posted here before but it's been a while.  i feel the need to post my thoughts at what i expect to be a very quick end to my father's life after a very hard, but very short (less than two years) experience since my father's alzheimer's diagnosis.the first time i personally noticed symptoms of his decline was around thanksgiving of 2018 (so not much less than two years ago), though thinking back i'm pretty sure i saw symptoms before then.several months ago (i think it was around march, but of course this year has taken up centuries so i'm not sure anymore), we put him in a memory care facility.  that lasted all of about three days.  my dad in his alzheimer's state has been prone to extreme violence, that he never showed when he was still ""himself"".  he physically assaulted one of their staff members, who had to go to urgent care to receive attention on her wrist.  as a result my dad was kicked out and sent back home.  one sister from another state was still home in our state for an extended period due to covid, so my stepmother still had competent live-in support to help make sure he was taken care of.after some time, some experimentation with his medications, and with consultation with his doctors, we found a new place that was able and willing to take him, even knowing about his history.  it's a seven-bed residential facility, in a moderately well-off area in my city.  all well and good.  until he got violent again.i got an emergency phone call from them about a month ago that told me the police had been called on account of his throwing chairs and being extremely aggressive towards the staff.  two of their staff members are pregnant, which added an additional safety concern.  it was a late sunday night when i was called over to meet him at the facility, remove him from the house, and take him over to a nearby hospital for a check-up.  after which he was released back into the care of my stepmother, who took him home again.  the on-call doctor at the facility told me around that time that his behavior is the worst she's ever seen, in her 20 years in the field. (for the record, i had little to no concern about my stepmother's safety, since my dad still recognizes her to some level, still trusts her, and was never domestically violent.)  but interestingly, it's been a consistent observation that his behavior is better when he's around men.  with the memory care staff (mostly female) he's aggressive.  with me, and with the male police officer in the house that night, he was fine.  non-confrontational.during his time back home was when he was present enough to start complaining about pain in his side.  he was taken to the emergency room where an mri was taken, and they discovered blood clots in his lungs and in his legs.  he was put on blood thinners and those got better.  but, the mri also revealed what his gp thought looked like lesions on his liver, which (in the gp's opinion) was potentially a sign of metastatic prostate cancer.  it turned out that the oncologist disagreed (it may have been that he couldn't hold still during the mri), so he requested instead some observation for a few months, and another test in august.  so the potential cancer diagnosis was (is still) in a holding pattern.in the meantime:  after discussions again with his neurological doctors, his medications were further refined.  with the med changes and a negative covid test (required after his hospital visit), his memory care facility allowed him to return.  he's been back for a few weeks now.  and his condition has pretty much dropped off a cliff since then.  last week he was diagnosed with a fever, and was complaining again about significant pain.  at one point, trying to get up from a wheelchair they provided for him, he fell.  he didn't break anything but he's remained in a constant state of pain which they're treating with morphine.  he's currently (as of today when i visited him) pretty much sleeping constantly in a morphine coma.all this time, the medical staff at his facility, with the support of myself and my two sisters, have been strongly encouraging my stepmother to reach out to hospice, which she's been resisting.  at first the request was related to the potential cancer.  but his memory care doctor has moved that over to a different perspective.  with the speed of his decline, she believes his death from dementia is imminent anyway, even without cancer, therefore an oncology test would be irrelevant.  when i spoke to the doctor last month, she gave me a prognosis of about six months from that point.  even with that information, my stepmom had been resisting any hospice movements.  until last week when he had his fever and his fall, the doctor called her in the afternoon, and had a hospice representative at her house by that evening.  all the hospice paperwork has now been filled out, with the exception of one piece -- the dnr still has not been signed.  but everything else is in place.short version now, with the rapid drop-off over the last couple of days, the hospice and memory staff now believe his death is imminent.  within a few days.  a couple of weeks at the maximum.  i request whatever ""vibes"" you believe in to help him and my family through that process.and in the ""life goes on"" category, my wife (an eighth-grade teacher) and my daughter (an eighth-grade student) have both started their school year in the experimental full-remote system that our district has implemented.  so far it's going well.and for me, after having been on furlough from my travel-industry job since early april, i got word today that i've been called back to work starting at the end of september.  that's my rainbow at the end of the flood.  after my dad is gone (and he will be, soon), i've been officially invited back into regular life in my corporate job.  for which i'm grateful.because i remember the strongest connection i've ever had with my dad was the summer in 1996 that i spent working as an intern in his high-rise company in another state, learning how to live and function and be competent in a corporate-type job. and that's the lesson that has stayed with me through covid, and i'm grateful.  his time is ending.  my time has just been restored.  and i believe it's no coincidence that those two changes are corresponding so closely.may you all be well."," i'm so sorry. i went through this a few months ago myself. i have no words of advice, it sucks, just know you aren't alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/idoifq/holding_vigil_at_the_moment_of_my_fathers_death/,Holding vigil at the moment of my father's death
"get your loved one the device from angel sense.com (no spaces) i’m not being sponsored or paid for this, i just want to share this with this community because i know i would be happy if someone told me about it. so my dad has early onset alzheimer’s, my brothers and i live nearby but we work and so does my mom, full time. my dad stays home and mostly watches tv but sometimes he goes on a walk around the block. the problem is he doesn’t think to bring his wallet or phone with him...ever...so he fell last week on his walk and thankfully a neighbor (who didn’t know who he or my family was) called an ambulance for him and got him to the er. he has a couple bumps and bruises and it was a tough day for all of us. that day made us realize the absolute necessity of him having id on him and a way for us to keep an eye on him.we got the angel sense device two days ago and it’s been a god send. the device was free but there’s a monthly charge if you want the walkie talkie portion of it. it attaches to any clothing (the only downside here is if your loved one lives alone this might be more difficult if they don’t know how to put it on or take it odd) and only a special key can remove it. it’s small (like a security tag youd find on your clothes when buying them) and is super light weight. it needs to charge and also needs to be put near a window for a couple hours so the gps can get its bearings. the app allows you to see where the person is on a google maps type screen, it will also text you when your loved one leaves their home, tells you where they go if they go to a store, etc and gives a time stamp. it gives us so much more peace of mind and i hope it’ll help anyone of you too.", website it is about $40 per month depending on the plan you pick.where do you attach it to him? is it light/small enough to not bother him?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/idmuup/an_awesome_helpful_device_to_keep_track_of_your/,An awesome helpful device to keep track of your loved one from afar

"hi. alzheimers runs on both sides of my family, and my dad's side in particular has seen multiple people over several generations acquire it in their 60s and decline. i did 23andme and i have two copies of a gene that is predictive of the disease, with my results suggesting a 60-80% chance of having it by 70. the fact tons of my relatives have contracted it in their 60s and died quickly afterwards is an additional risk indicator.i am deeply troubled. i want to have a family (i'm 28), but at this rate i'll have alzheimers when they're budding into adulthood, and my so (a decade older) will statistically be declining, too. i don't know if he carries the gene or has a history; we need to discuss it, that's certain. i'm just worried about my relationship and my family planning and i am upset that i am about halfway done my life of being able to remember things. i'm halfway done being me, and even though i am academic and bilingual and adore learning and play instruments, etc., i will most likely acquire this atypical neurological geriatric disease and become a shell, like my grandfather has been for years now. i am worried my father will develop the disease or that my children will inherit my genetic minefield and suffer for it.i understand that it's not a guarantee, but it is incredibly likely due to genetic profile and family history, without considering other ongoing health issues. i just needed to vent a bit as i knew the risk was there but had no idea that it was going to be this statistically likely... i thought maybe 20% by 75. now i am kinda wishing i die before 65 from something else so i don't burden myself or others. i am also doubting that i can be a desirable spouse and mother when i will likely deteriorate quickly in my 60s and have awful genes. i feel suddenly unlovable/deeply flawed."," hey, i would highly suggest finding a therapist to help you through this fase of realisation. you've been hit with awful news and you deserve to be supported. i'm sorry this could be happening to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/id5i8v/family_planning_and_heredity/,Family Planning and Heredity

"spoke to someone at the council earlier about setting up direct payments regarding getting mum a carer/sitter while i'm at work.  jesus fucking christ, it's insane.   mum isn't wealthy but has lived frugally and saved so is over the threshold where she has to cover all costs.  (£23000)now we've got to look at setting up employee insurance and payroll providers just to get care for a fucking illness.  she's spent her whole life scrimping and saving to enjoy her retirement, never had a job that earnt above average but now she's deemed rich enough to get no assistance whatsoever.  just seems fucking mental, what's the fucking point in trying to live responsibly?"," i'm in the u.s., but it's just as insane. we sold the family home to have money to cover my mom's care in a locked memory care community ($7,000 a month). she was wandering and it was either i sell my house and move in with her (my home only has two bedrooms and one bath, and i have a husband and college student) or move her into a community trained in alzheimer's care. her house was under a reverse mortgage that my dad had taken out a couple of years before he died, and there was a rule that once my mom was no longer living in her home full-time, everyone had to get out within 30 days. house hunting in a tight market was too risky. we didn't want to risk being homeless or having to live in a hotel.here, we've been working with lawyers. we were originally told that once she's down to her last $2,000 in assets, she will go on medicaid and go into one of the four area medicaid alzheimer's communities. even those are about $5,000 a month private pay and one has a wait list of 5 years, the best is also the scariest and has a year wait. she has about six months of rent left at the place we were able to find her space. the latest word we've been given is that because her ss and 50% of my dad's pension is more than $2,000, she will never qualify for medicaid and that she will have to move in with me. the entire system depresses me. i will end up quitting a job to provide her full-time care. i also spent almost two decades staying home with my kids because of the cost of daycare and the lack of school bus service in my area once they were in high school. at a point i thought i'd be returning to work and building up my own retirement funds, i think it's all going to be a loss. i don't see easy answers, but the current system sure isn't working in most areas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/icr9ph/uk_centric_rant_direct_payments/,UK centric rant - direct payments

"hi, my father (79) was diagnosed about 4.5 years ago and honestly for all that he's pretty high functioning, speech is unaffected, feeds, dresses and cleans himself without assistance etc etc. i (35) live at home with both him and my mother (72) to help out as best i can and for the most part we were plodding along well enough. however the last few months have thrown a lot of turmoil into our lives and i don't know if my father feels unable to help or if he's not understanding what is going on.basically my mother was rushed into hospital at the beginning of july with major breathing/eating difficulties and after emergency surgery to debulk a tumour and fit a tracheostomy, a weekend on a ventilator and a nervous week of waiting was diagnosed with a thyroid lymphoma. she spent almost the entirety of july in hospital and has been home around three weeks or so. in those three weeks it is looking more and more likely that my father doesn't really understand the realities of what is going on with my mother. for example despite my mother's best efforts the strap holding her trach over time starts to smell as the mucus that leaks from her stoma soaks into it and dries. my father has gotten it into his head that this is because my mother isn't washing herself properly and that the smell is body odour basically, i've explained it a couple of times but he doesn't get it. generally speaking she's finding life with a trach awkward and quite simply my father is standoffish at best. my mother thinks he might actually be jealous of the care and attention she's been getting. either way his reluctance to help is really getting hard to cope with. i'm up multiple times every night to help my mother out (most often it's just setting up and putting her nebuliser to go as her throat dries out a lot especially at night and the trach makes the mucus hard to clear), my father will sometimes wake up and basically lay there watching. i feel like he just thinks he can't help but then other times it seems like he just doesn't get why we're doing this stuff that is waking him up. i'm holding things together for the moment but as time goes by i think i'm going to struggle and could really use my father's understanding if not his active support."," routine is important. its also important to remember that people with alzheimer's are less like adults and more like children in many aspects.its very likely that he does not, and will never understand the issues surrounding your mother. its one of the sad realities of this disease.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/iavccz/i_dont_think_my_father_understands_whats_going_on/,I don't think my father understands what's going on

"hi all. my dad was diagnosed early onset around 7 years ago. he’s now in his early 60s and is unable to work/drive/etc. i’m home for a few months before i begin a grad program, and my mom works full time (8-5 m-f &amp; 8-12 sunday’s before corona). i’m spending most of my day playing caregiver, to the extent of helping dad get dressed, get meals, turn on the tv, run errands, etc. he complains often that he can’t do anything and is lonely; we’re in a difficult stage where he is aware of his condition and inability and apologizes and resents himself often. my question is when i return to school in january, a few hours away, what changes we’ll make. my mom thrives at work and loves her community there. we are pretty sure my dad cannot be home alone from 8-5, but we’re trying to decide if he can manage being at a day center for some of the day, or to what extent my mom needs to cut back her hours. is there such a thing as someone who could ‘evaluate’ my dad’s capabilities at home? i know my emotions cloud my judgement of his abilities and it breaks my heart to see him struggle so i over-assist. when left for short periods of time, he believes he’s been alone for hours and is bored and lonely. my mom and i are struggling with our next steps and would appreciate any insight. for context, we have plans in place for the future regarding home care &amp; eventual hospice; a nursing home isn’t in the plans so this ‘middle’ period is really challenging."," if you're in a state that has pace programs, they'll do exactly what you're asking about. ask for resources from your local senior center.day programs can be absolutely great even for people in the early stages, and honestly the earlier they start going, the better so they can get familiar with the program and staff before they get in to the later stages.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/i9cgxi/alz_home_evaluation_advice_needed/,Alz home ‘evaluation’?

"my father was diagnosed last summer, and he is doing well at the moment. but i'm hoping to connect my parents with an actual person (social worker?) who can provide essentially an actionable checklist of what needs to be prepared (legally, around the home, future care options, etc.) and what my parents should expect and do in the coming months and years. does a resource like this exist? i am having a difficult time compiling a direct set of guidelines myself, and feel they won't take the initiative. thanks for any help you can provide – glad to have this community."," okay, first, i definitely agree you need to get this done. my dad was there for my mom and then he died unexpectedly. he had a stroke and seemed to be doing as well as can be after it. a day later, the mri results found a brain tumor that was grapefruit in size, pressing against his brain stem, and inoperable. they'd made no plans as he'd fully expected to outlive her, even though that thought depressed him.we rushed to find exactly what you're looking for. start by finding your area's agency on aging, and don't expect them to do too much unless you have a great agency. ours told us to call: a, b, and c. and when we called those places, they'd tell us to call agency on aging. it was ridiculous. the local alzheimer's association was one of those places and they weren't of much use beyond discussing support groups and adult day programs. who did help? we called an assisted living community for alzheimer's. they gave us incredible advice. in the end, we moved mom in there when it became too risky for her to be left alone at night. it's expensive, but mom has 24/7 companionship and trained nurses and caregivers who are certified in alzheimer's care and know what they're doing.we also set up an appointment with an attorney who specialized in elder care. the attorney was useful in getting us set up with poas. this was also important as the attorney my dad had used for their wills had gone out of business without any sign that he knew and no one knew where that attorney's files went.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/i8hkdn/my_parents_need_to_be_walked_through/,My parents need to be walked through recommendations on how to approach short-term care for my dad and how to prepare for the future.

"my dad's memory has been on the decline for several years. his friend called me on monday and dropped the bomb that he has been out of work for 6+ weeks, has been messing up little jobs that she gives him (small landscaping jobs - he was supposed to remove tree stumps but ripped out a customer's landscape lighting against their wishes!). basically he has completely run out of money, but he won't tell me. it got so bad that his phone was turned off and there's a $600 bill to turn it back on, his electric was turned off for several days until his friend paid the bill, and his water was turned off.  i think this issue is a combo of him not having money and him not remembering and not being able to work because of his bad memory. he has extra vehicles and plots of land. he, however, will not actually sell anything. i think it's almost like a hoarding situation where he's attached and can't let go. talking about his finances is an uphill battle and he will not share his information. he's so prideful and private, and honestly probably embarrassed that he is in this position. i'm not interested in shaming him, i just want to solve this problem. does anyone have any tips with how to even deal with this? i feel awful because my dad has helped me so much, i do not want him sitting at home without electricity and water! but he won't accept help. do i force my help on him and just go through his stuff and find the account numbers and what not? this may be unethical. or do i try to gently and slowly get him to let me help by talking to him about his feelings/what's going on? thanks in advance!"," start by talking to an attorney about whether you need to do anything else to start acting as his poa.you'll probably have to mail or fax copies of the durable poa form to every company your dad has bills with (call each one to find out what their preference is) in order to start paying his bills. you might have to spend a couple hours at the local branch of his bank, too. what we did with my dad initially was set up a prepaid debit card just for him to use, with something like $200 on it, while taking away the debit card and checks for his main checking account and instructing the bank not to let him withdraw money in person (i had to call the bank to warn the tellers one day when i saw him leave the house and get into a cab on our security camera)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/i8erik/dad_who_is_61_with_undiagnosed_early_dementia/,Dad who is 61 with undiagnosed early dementia will not accept my (26F) help and is not paying his bills

"**tldr:** my nana's dog is morbidly obese. nana is in denial of it and feeds her probably 6-10x the amount of food she should be having, not including chocolate and food from her own plate. really need some advice on how to help the dog. hello reddit,my nana has suffered from alzheimers for roughly 5 years now, and she's aggressively in denial about it- even when face-to-face with the doctor who diagnosed her, she refused to accept that her memory is declining (this is relevant later). my grandad was still alive when we first suspected something was up, he was extremely supportive and understanding but he eventually grew resentful and he and my nana frequently upset eachother. my mum (their daughter), had the idea to get them a dog to give them something to care for and hopefully improve their communications with eachother. she discussed the idea with both of them and agreed that, should anything happen to them, my mum would take the dog and care for her. at first, the dog was a lifesaver and they both seemed so much happier. unfortunately last year we lost my grandad, and my nana has become extremely attached to the dog as she now lives alone. however, due to her alzheimers, she overfeeds the dog so excessively the poor thing is now entirely unrecognisable from when we first got her. she's a shih-tzu, so she came to us a fairly small dog. she's now so grossly obese she can't urinate or defecate without covering herself in waste, she's basically immobile, and she just looks so uncomfortable in any position she sits/lies in. also, we've noticed lumps of fat clustered around her chest, i can't imagine it would be helpful to take her to a vet at this stage for investigation as she's so fat it must be extremely difficult to palpate/she can't be healthy enough to have a general anesthetic. my nana refuses to admit her dog is overweight, i genuinely can't tell if it's because she lives with her and therefore can't notice a difference or if it's embarrassment. she will insist it's the dog's fur making her appear larger than she actually is- i've tried showing her pictures of the dog when we first got her to compare, and pointing out her weight after she's just been cut but she won't hear it. we've tried gently approaching the fact that she is overfeeding her because she's forgotten that she's already fed her, but nana gets so defensive and becomes upset that we thinks she's crazy. this post is getting long so i'm going to summarise what we've noticed her doing:* nana feeds the dog off of her own plate- we've caught her feeding the dog an entire pizza before * nana buys a new crate of dog food every week and always asks us to pick up more for her as she's ran out (that's 40 pouches of food in under a week, so roughly 6 pouches of food per day)* nana gives her dog treats for literally anything, she's gone outside? treat. she's not barked at the postman? treat. she believes she hasn't given her a treat in a while? treat* whatever my nana eats, the dog eats. i'm talking anything. chocolate, toast, crisps, pizza, you name it. i've had heated arguments with her when i've caught her taking a bite of chocolate and giving half to the dogwe've tried taking the dog away, nana actually tripped over her a few months ago and broke her hip. while she was in hospital and recovering, the dog stayed with us for approximately 2 months. she seemed so much happier, our house was a fat camp for her. she was walked twice a day, no treats, and a normal amount of food per day. she lost so much weight. but nana wouldn't forget about her and eventually we had to give her back, she's put all the weight back on and more. i'm sorry this became so long. i'm just totally out of options and lost for what to do here. the poor dog is my nana's lifeline as i know she hates living alone, but i feel like the only member of my family to recognise this as animal abuse. any advice/similar experiences would be hugely appreciated, i feel like i've already failed the poor dog and god only knows how many health issues she must have/be developing already. thanks so much"," your family is lucky to have you.  that dog will die in that home.  you can't control your nana, you can't stop other people from giving nana all the dog food, you can't stop nana from overfeeding the dog people food. if i were you, i'd stage a funeral.

"immediately before the covid outbreak (weeks) we made the incredibly difficult decision to place my dad in a very expensive luxury accommodation long term care facility. he had been in their physical rehab and was flourishing. it was such a blessing to happier than he had been since his dementia had progressed. it was life changing for both he and i to see him so happy. so, covid lockdown...and there have been deaths. not nearly to the level of other facilities but any deaths is too many. i can’t move him elsewhere but the care he is receiving now isn’t anywhere on par with when he was first admitted. hygiene not as good. less people on his very small unit (he’s so social so this has greatly impacted him). he’s definitely not getting what we are paying for amenity wise, socially and hygiene. it’s not terrible yet very off brand for what we are paying with this very high end facility (which includes memory care, skilled nursing &amp; independent living). amenities such as pools, all fine dining throughout, a lounge, activity spaces galore - all of which is no longer an option with covid). i can’t even see him through a window (we do facetime). this facility is thousands more than the other “best” facility in town. i feel as if we are being overcharged now under the current conditions. this facility is an affiliate of the largest hospital in the area. so while i realize their expenses are increased, they have that lifeline of support for ppe etc. additionally, there is much less staff. anyone here familiar with these facilities? if so, do you have any thoughts? obviously my dad is priceless yet i also have a responsibility to be a good steward of his estate as well. thanks in advance for any insight or thoughts. i appreciate it more than you know.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/i3xd0t/luxury_long_term_care_facilities_need_advice/,Luxury long term care facilities - need advice PLEASE!
"hi, let me apologize in advance for the dramatic title. i'm currently crying and need to get out my frustrations. recently, my mother seems to be losing her touch on reality. i can't say for sure when it started, but my father and i are at a point where we feel that whatever is wrong with her is starting to peak. for reference, i'm 22 and my mother is 59 and retired. i still live at home and am home with her for most of the day unless i'm at work. for what feels like a few months now, my mom was having common problems with her memory. i didn't think much of it as it was mostly situations where things were on the tip of her tongue. she would get increasingly frustrated with herself and i tried to console her. more recently, she started experiencing audio and visual hallucinations. when i would come home from work, she'd insist someone had been in our backyard or that someone had been banging on the windows. she was sure that it was my ex-boyfriend (that i haven't seen in 4 years) was trying to break into the house and kill me. i didn't even know what to say. the house next door to us was also doing a remodel, so i think a lot of these noises she heard were the contractors working. however, she also started to wake up randomly in the night, sometimes as early as 3 am and insist that the contractors were blaring radios. my dad would wake up, hear nothing, and try to coax her back to bed. now, i'm reaching my limit. i tried to play off the other signs. she recently had a ct scan because she was having some motor issues and it came back completely normal. i felt good about this. i came home from work yesterday to the house turned completely upside down. my mom told me there were mice. i believed her at first, but the more i listened to the story the more i realized just how bad this really is. she claims that there's mice in every couch cushion, every mattress, every chair and no amount of talking to her can persuade her otherwise. she claims she can feel them running underneath her and poking her and that they've scratched her. she shows me her 'scratches' and theres nothing there. needless to say, there are obviously no mice. i tried to explain to her that infestations don't work like that and theres no way that that many mice have invaded our furniture without us noticing other signs. theres no food missing, no droppings, and i can't feel or see a thing. neither can my father. my mom gets defensive and mean when i try to bring this up to her. she calls me an ass and tells me i'm being condescending. but i'm just trying to help her. but i realize i can't. i don't even know if these are signs of alzheimer's, but i can't think of anything else to do. my father is at a loss and i'm an only child. my sister died 4 years ago. she gets misty-eyed occasionally and cries about being scared she's 'losing her mind'. it's like a moment of clarity before she's swallowed again. i desperately need advice on what my next step should be.  i feel like i'm supposed to be making big decisions here, but i don't know what to do.", did you ever get a diagnosis for your mom? i’m so sorry you and your family have had to go through this.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/i3x015/im_terrified_for_my_mom_i_do_not_know_what_to_do/,I'm terrified for my mom.

"this is my first time here, i read the rules and none of which seems that this discussion/question will disobey, if it does i apologize to the mods.ive studied into dementia and watched some films, and witness a grandparent suffer with severe dementia for the last 8 years of her life, and this will lead me into my question(s)?as im canadian im going to leave the canada official website below which should also try to make the point that i am making.it states on the website that you must be medically coherent in order to make the request of the assisted death, and it must be severe to the point you have debilitating symptoms. im going to post a quote so i try not to make too much confusion.""be in an advanced state of decline that cannot be reversed""""you must be mentally competent and capable of making decisions at the time of your requestyou must also be mentally competent and capable of making decisions immediately before medical assistance in dying is providedthe physician or nurse practitioner must ask you to confirm your choice before administering the service""now, i dont know the disease to its full effect, but what i saw from my grandmas perspective, in her very late stages she seemed that she was not clearly able to make such a decision as the website states.now this is where it gets tricky. above i quoted the website in saying that it must be in an advanced state of decline. so, at what point does the disease consider to be advanced? is it at the point where your mental state is declined to the point where youre no longer capable of making the decision? if i could have it my own way and change the laws for it, if youre being diagnosed with the disease, and you take what treatments you can, but after the treatment if the treatment loses its effect or does not contain your stage. you should at some point, along a very thin line, be able to the make the request before it becomes too severe. as far as im concerned, once the disease is clearly known to not be slowing down for said individual, i believe that if the state of your disease is the mild to moderate form you should be able to make the case that you want to be assisted in your death.my grandma was a shell of her former self, she was imo, not ""alive"" on top of the suffering she went through, it damaged my family members mental health  very severely watching her wither away. here's a good example of why im at the point im at. my mom died back in 2010, which at the time i was only 12, and i do believe my grandmother was in her early stages. as her diseased progressed, she always remembered that my mom suffered with cancer for a number of years, but forgot that she died. so every once in a while she would ask ""is *....* still alive?"" and we reminded her the truth. and she grieved every single time. im sure most people here if not everyone knows more about the disease than myself, so this is my question.should there be an exception made for the disease(s) that you ask to be assisted even if its in early stage but progressing after treatment or even during treatment?here in canada as far as i know there is only a few cases that has been assisted while the person was coherent.im linking the two articles below, one in reference to the article of the assisted patient, and the laws[laws]([patient ](if what i am stating is already being discussed or approved amongst some states, countries, provinces, please feel free to enlighten me and tell me what you think i should know. this is a subject i feel very strongly about."," i don’t know any laws or what’s going on with this where i live but my mom has alzheimer’s and she would be so pissed with her standard of living right now. she would definitely be a supporter of assisted suicide if it was legal and if she knew what was going to happen. as for me, i am terrified of having alzheimer’s too and i feel the chances of me getting it are very high. watching what my mom goes through and seeing what my brother and his girlfriend have to deal with is awful. i am certainly hoping that assisted suicide in this scenario will be legal if/when it happens to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/i34yot/should_assisted_death_in_alzheimersdementia_be/,Should assisted death in alzheimers/dementia be looked into more when it comes to assisted death?

"i always like to start these off by saying how much i appreciate anyone who takes the time to read or comment, especially if you're going through this with a loved one or healing from the passing of someone you know that went through this. your emotional labour in comforting myself or others doesn't go unnoticed and its extraordinarily kind. my mum has been with my grandparents all week trying to help take some of the pressure off my grandad. my grandma finally had an assessment to be put on a crisis care long term care list. however, the lihn coordinators seem to think because family has been up there with my grandparents, that there's enough family support that its not nearly as urgent as the initial assessment dictated. family has only been able to go up so much because of covid (face palm) and with things re-opening we were banking on them helping us bridge the gap between being at home and getting into long term care.that happened two weeks ago.this past week, after my grandma (the dementia patient) once again threatened my grandad, my mum took her to the hospital to maybe see if there was something up with her medications. they got to the hospital but hadn't even parked and my grandma took off.9/11 was called and she was found within the hour but in such a deep state of psychosis that she got placed in a psychiatric hold and will likely be there for the next two weeks. the positive is that she is somewhere safe, the negative is that she has gone basically non-verbal in like 3 days, the geriatric team we've been working with is on vacation over the next few weeks, and we've just been told that once my grandma stabilised they want to transfer her to a psychiatric rehab facility which is so far away from my grandad (who cannot drive due to his vision).i'm emotionally spent. i'm so desperately sad for my grandad who has endured months of the woman he loves going from sweet to sour on him daily (she broke up with him nearly every day). it feels like the worst ending to their beautiful and wonderful life together and i don't have any words to really bring him comfort. and i'm so mad at the universe for doing this to my grandma. it feels like an unfair end to her life as well. i can't begin to imagine the frustration and confusion she must be feeling. this just sucks and i just want a fraction of good in all of this. literally the only thing i can cling to is the nice lunch her and i had a month a go. i listened to the same story 5 times but she was chatty and animated and happy."," i'm so sorry this continues to be so hard. i feel for you all, truly. the redditors who say to hold on to the good memories or moments are right - really it is all you can do. re: the lhin, if you haven't already, please be very clear for them them this psychiatric rehab's location is going to mean a significant hardship in terms of social contact with loved ones as the distance will prevent grandpa from having any access to his wife. the covid-19 dillemma means that visitations have been halted or majorly minimized already & to take that lifeline away from her is not a small thing. what have the lhin said about your very valid concerns?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/i2458f/always_feel_like_its_going_from_bad_to_worse/,Always Feel Like Its Going From Bad to Worse.
"(tl;dr at the bottom)as a preface, i’m 18 years old and i just graduated from high school. my dad is 70 and has moderate alzheimer’s. my mom died years ago, so it’s just the two of us living together.this year has been the worst year of my life. i spent new year’s day in the hospital with my dad after he had a serious psychotic breakdown. he was in the hospital for about a week and required 24/7 supervision to make sure that he didn’t try to leave the hospital room.once he was discharged, it was obvious that he would need constant assistance with eating, taking his medicine, and *literally* everything else. the original plan was for me, his girlfriend, and his family to all assist in helping him, but that plan didn’t even last a full day. his family completely abandoned him and it’s been me and his girlfriend taking care of him ever since.the most disturbing thing to me is how quickly he deteriorated. last december, he was able to drive, cook for himself, shower, hold conversations, etc. but now he hardly has the strength to get out of bed. i’ve known two other people with alzheimer’s but they didn’t deteriorate nearly as quickly. (he also has cancer and takes chemo, which might have caused his alzheimer’s to progress so quickly but i’m not sure).i’ve had to sacrifice so many things because of my dad. i had to give up a scholarship to a college out of state in order to stay and take care of him. the deadline to apply to the college in my city has already passed, so i’ll have to start school next semester. if he gets covid-19, he will die. so i have to be extremely cautious about where i go and who i hang out with. this means that i can’t go to the gym or hangout with my friends, which are my biggest coping mechanisms other than smoking (which i also had to stop doing because i’m having surgery soon). i was hoping to finally start working but now i have to consider where i work and how often i’d have to interact with people, but early all of the jobs for 18 year olds require social interaction.and to make things worse, i’ll be out of state for 11 days for top surgery. i’ve waited my entire life for this surgery and waited nearly nine months for a surgery date. i’ve already packed my bags, bought the plane tickets, booked the hotel, and payed for the surgery with pretty much all the money from my own savings account. my friend who’s staying with me has already bought her ticket, which was hard for her to afford. i was able to find people to take care of my dad while i’m gone, but i had to beg and bribe them to do it. regardless, canceling is not an option.his girlfriend told me that she wasn’t going to be around after july (for whatever reason), so now it’s just me. i’ve considered moving him into a nursing home, but that wouldn’t work for several reasons. financially, he has $3000+ that he owes for his cancer treatments. he had to take out a $4000 loan to get the ac fixed because the heat was becoming unbearable. he gets a retirement check each month, but it’s not much. also, the process of moving him into a nursing home would be long and difficult because of the pandemic. they’re not allowing any visitors so i wouldn’t be able to visit him very often.tl;dr: i’ve had to sacrifice a significant part of my youth in order to care for my dad. i’m more depressed now than i’ve ever been in life. there’s no one who wants to help. i have no one (especially my age) who can relate to what i’m dealing with."," i would suggest talking to his doctor about a medical social work consult. an msw in your area can help you and your father find the resources you need to help make this period of time more bearable. i am assuming you live in the states, if so your state may have a medicaid program for long term care assistance. that could help or entirely pay for an assisted living or long term care facility. you might also ask about home health in general. physical therapy may help strengthen him so he can get out of bed. occupational therapy may help both of you learn how to help him complete his activities of daily living with less stress, less wasted effort and greater safety. these costs are covered by medicare.respite care, if there is money available to pay for a caregiver one day a week so you can take a break, or at least focus on needs other than your father's.finally, do you think your father is at a point where hospice care may be appropriate? and are you at a point where you are willing to discuss hospice care for your father?i wish you well. this is a difficult experience under the best of circumstances. you can get through this though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/i207ll/my_dads_alzheimers_and_other_health_issues_are/,My dad’s Alzheimer’s and other health issues are completely ruining my life and mental health

"hey. my grandmother (88) has alzheimers/dementia. it was at an okay stage but it deteriorated when my aunt, her youngest daughter who lived with her and her kids, got cancer and eventually died less than a year later. she saw her body so that she would believe us and grieved and cried and everything. afterwards, my other aunts started having her stay with them for a while and she was basically moving between like 3 houses every couple of months which i now realize is really bad as this destroys routine and consistency but what's done is done. anyway, she finally returned home yesterday which she didn't remember at all or her grandkids who lived there until she actually saw the house. when she got there she began to ask about my aunt. she can't speak very well and her sentences are very very loose and vague but we can make out that she's asking about her. it's been brought up a couple of times and no one know show to address. we just switch conversations and try to distract her. we're not sure if we should keep doing this or show her a picture of her and ask her if this is the person she's asking about? but to do that we'd have to be ready to tell her she's no longer around and deal with the circumstances of that.i think it wouldn't hurt her to forget about her as incredibly painful as that sounds considering she took care of her all her life. it would only cause pain and confusion. i'm not sure what to do."," if an alzheimer's patient says you are the president, you are the president.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hz2kfb/reminding_an_alzheimers_patient_that_a_loved_one/,reminding an alzheimers patient that a loved one is dead

"my mother-in-law has this dreaded disease and she opted to go to assisted living in a rage, some years ago. she got tired of us asking her if she was alright because of how much she was struggling with everything. before that she had been living with us and getting progressively worse, not eating on her own, just laying about and very fixated on things she wanted us to do or get for her. my wife mentioned how needy she was to her mom one day and her mom flipped and started calling assisted living places on her own.now, she's been there for several years, in a very good place and they are great with her. she gets her diet needs seen to, gets her meds (this was a big issue when with us, she would forget and double up or just not take them) and they have all kinds of stuff for her to do, even in the pandemic.all the time, still, she calls and says that she thinks that she can go live in the houses on the property, where older folks live without assistance. she misses cooking, being free to do what she wants, etc.she keeps saying that she's in prison and that my wife put her there. these outbursts are happening more and more.this time, she wants a new chair, so my brother-in-law opted to buy her one. he's been researching it but apparently taking too long. so she (mil) calls my wife and asks what's taking so long. then she goes into her routine about how she can be living in unassisted housing and that the doctor said she's fine to do that.aside: when she was diagnosed, and then rediagnosed there were about 10 years in between. when we got the official diagnosis, it was recommended that we move her, because it would get harder and harder for her. she thinks every time she goes to get a physical that she's being reevaluated and rediagnosed and if she gets some answers right on her test it means that she doesn't need to be in assisted living, anymore.back to our regular story:so she calls my wife and blasts her because she doesn't know or care about how bad she's been getting and my wife takes it personally. basically neither of her siblings answer when she calls or do much to help. mil takes it out on us and lately, she's been brutal. she called one day while we were driving back from helping move one of our kids and since we were almost having fun, she belted out one of her classics about how we could have fun and she was stuck in prison.once in a while, her being upset, especially in this new and dreaded pandemic, i get it. you feel cooped up, and we do too. but turning her rage on the one daughter that does everything, and being so brutal and making it as though we've had her incarcerated is awful. my wife feels the guilt. she knows her mom needs to be in there. she can't do her own meds, she can't remember anything. she gets fixated on certain things (chair) she can remember and then harps on it to anyone who will listen. but my wife just feels so bad and so, she takes it personally. she knows her mom has to be there, but she can't just let it bounce off and ignore it or hang up.i feel helpless to help her, because for me, it would be different. i won't put up with that shit. i will tell it like it is and that's maybe mean or cruel. when she was with us and would harp on something, i would keep a tally and show her: ""you've asked me about this 7 times, today."" she'd get abashed and stop for a while. it wasn't to be mean, but it helped both of us.i suggested printing out the doctor's ruling that says she  needs to be there (assisted living) and having it framed and when her mom freaks out, show it to her, like some dick version of the notebook.i just get so tired of her being treated this way when she's done so much."," your wife’s sisters don’t answer when their mom calls them, but your wife does - so your wife gets all the crap her mom can throw.  the sisters are the smart ones here. your mil isn’t going to change obviously, so the only one that can change is your wife.  are all of her calls this bad?  if so, take her phone away!  the staff will call if something is wrong or if she really needs something.  if your wife can’t go that far, let her calls go to voice mail, then delete them unheard. (but that’s going to really make mil mad). your wife can call your mil one time a day, as soon as she starts with her crap, your wife gets off the phone.  it won’t train your mil, but it will stop driving wife insane.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hyrs0t/brutal_treatment_of_my_wife/,Brutal treatment of my wife
"about a month or two ago my dad (61) was diagnosed with alzheimer's and i just don't know how to emotional deal with it. doctor said he'll lose most of his functions in 3 years time. growing up my dad was a host home provider so it's not really an issue for me to think about or helping out with long term care for him. what gets me the most is knowing how scared he is right now. i remember when he told me about the diagnosis it was the first time i've ever seen him cry, seeing him just breakdown. i can't imagine how terrifying it most be for him to lose his memory. i don't want my dad to go through that type of pain i'm not ready to say goodbye to him he's done so much for me and i love him so much he doesn't deserve this. i've spent weeks looking up treatment trying to find any hope any experimental treatment for a cure, nothing. i remember when i was 8 we went to a wave pool they started high tide and i almost drowned, he saved my life that day. now he needs my help and there's not really anything i can do to help him. i feel so pathetic. how do you deal with this? ty for your time."," i feel for you! my husband has early onset. he was diagnosed in 2014 but was already having problems.six years later he has been on hospice for 3.5 years, and still hanging in there. i feel bad for him. all he can do is lay there and sleep. or not.we did as much as we could in the short time we had. we took trips, we tried almost every supplement that was thought to help, he had his favorite ice cream and dr. pepper. lolmost important things... get his will, poa, dnr, etc. all done before he no longer is able to sign. when he is frustrating remember, ""it's the disease, it's always the disease."" and as others have said, make memories now!dm me if you have any questions!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hyo09y/coping_with_my_dads_diagnosis_vent/,Coping with my dad's diagnosis (vent)

"my wife’s mom, her older brother, and i suspect fairly soon her older sister have died from alzheimer’s and the complications it brings on. my wife has shown signs of it for well over a year, and pretty much is in denial. our family doctor mostly dismissed my concerns last year saying that i was overly sensitive to her behavior because of her family. it’s now undeniable, although she still resists being tested. she’s coming around, and will in time i suspect, but it’s hard. with all the rest of the crap that’s happening in the world, and then this. what do i do next?thanks for letting me vent."," i'm so sorry to hear what you're going through.   there are some good recommendations on posts already that are very practical.  i'd like to add (unfortunately learned from me not making the right decisions in the past) that it's very important to create a real and executable plan very early that helps you and your wife both be as happy and functional as long as possible throughout the journey.  this will mean making choices and changes very proactively, when it's very tempting to want to avoid the situation instead.  for example, if there's an underlying orthopedic issue that needs to be addressed, get it addressed now (otherwise there could years of unwarranted pain and/or the need for surgery for someone who is mentally not able to rehab).  as another example, getting in a routine of going often to an adult day care facility is radically easier for someone in an early stage and gives tremendous respite to their spouse/caregiver... if you wait for them to be in a later stage to introduce it, they will be scared and confused and the primary caregiver will already be exhausted.  also, many activities (some even simple ones like watching the news) can become stressful and difficult over time, so having other things lined up proactively can greatly help limit boredom and anxiety.  in summary:  while it's tempting for everyone to avoid the diagnosis and dealing with it, proactively staying a step ahead will actually make life more functional.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hwntds/it_begins/,It begins...

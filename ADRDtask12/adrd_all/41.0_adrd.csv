"backstory: my dad passed away from cancer several years ago. my mom had been caring for him for 10 years, trying to keep him going. when he finally passed my mom (59 at the time) was very absent and forgetful for about a year and my sister and i were quite concerned. my mom's father died from early onset alzheimers, i think he was 50 when it started, so there is family history. however we attributed her absent-mindedness to grief over the loss of my dad. for a few years mom seemed pretty normal but over the last couple years she has been more and more forgetful. she spends most of her time alone in her house reading and has developed a weird habit of pulling her hair out and leaving it in piles on tables. i have now had 2 of her friends comment to me on both her forgetfulness (asking the same question 5 or 6 times in a row and still not remembering the answer) and her hair-pulling.   which brings me to now: i don't know how to approach my mom or what i should say. i know she probably needs a health work-up and also mental health work-up. she tends to be very frugal and suspicious of people stealing her money (always has been) so i am leery of suggesting that she put my sister and i on her accounts. anyway, i just need help getting started. her best friend was on the phone with me for 2 hours last night, crying, because of my mom's recent behavior during a visit. any help is greatly appreciated."," i also recommend you going onto the alzheimer’s association’s website or calling their helpline. they can guide you as well, especially when it comes to behavior challenges and getting her diagnosed. helpline number is 1 800 272 3900. good luck,  i am so sorry for what you're going through.

"hey reddit,i got the call i’ve been dreading.  a friend in my hometown called and explained that several people at my mother’s workplace are worried about her, followed by a couple specific examples of confusion and forgetfulness.  i’ve had my suspicions as well, but told myself i would wait for a specific event before acting.  and now, i think the time has finally come for the torch to be passed on to me.alzheimer’s is no stranger to my family.  both of my grandparents had the disease (her parents), and several of her brothers and sisters have it currently or have passed from it.  for fifteen years she sacrificed, along with the rest of the family, to care for her parents.  they were both kept at home from diagnosis to death.  i grew up in the middle of all of this and know well how this disease progresses.  so, i guess i want to get thoughts, opinions and ideas from the hive mind on my next steps.first, i need to talk with her.  she has made a couple of comments about “not being like she once was” and is taking a supplement that is supposed to improve brain clarity.  i think she is aware that there has been some cognitive decline, and with her extensive history in taking care of her parents/siblings, i believe she will be open to this conversation.  i have a call into a local memory care clinic for information, but i’m not sure if we need a referral from her primary care provider before i can make an appointment.  second, she is still working.  she is 67, so i think the time has come to have a conversation about retirement.  she is still high functioning, though i’ve noticed a decline in understanding layered ideas and processes with progressive steps.  for example, teaching her how to use a new oven and microwave a month ago was difficult for her.  (as i write this, more and more example are cropping up that i have apparently compartmentalized, which is making me feeling even guiltier.)  her co-workers have noticed things like her being confused and forgetful.  this has apparently gotten worse in the last few weeks.third, driving.  her siblings live in a town 30 miles over and she travels there two to three times a week.  that is originally her hometown.  she has no family in the town she currently lives in, but it’s a small town and people help take care of their own there, to an extent.  when is time to call it quits on driving?  fourth, finances.  she has very little money, maybe a net worth of a 100k.  and the money she has, she ends up giving a significant portion away to charity.  she literally gets 10-15 pieces of mail a day from charities asking for money.  she is donating $300+ dollars a month to any number of charities (i made the mistake of looking at her monthly bank statement that was sitting out one night).  i brought up her giving, indirectly, and she told me she is only giving $20-30 a month.  though she did agree to be more mindful of her giving and acknowledged that there were a lot of scams out there.  this was probably four months ago, and i dropped it because it is her money and i don’t want to feel like i’m overstepping/micromanaging.  i haven’t looked at a statement since so i don’t know if it has continued or not.  do i talk to her about becoming her durable power of attorney and restricting these financial behaviors?  do i just let it ride?  i feel like either way, i am going to lose.  i suppose that’s the over-arching theme in alzheimer’s, isn’t it?  doesn’t matter what you do.  you lose.fifth, living arrangement.  i have a decent job, and i can support her through most things.  but i don’t make enough to pay a $3500 - $6000 / month for assisted living.  i’m not sure what her social security check will end up being.  her home is paid off, so we are only on the hook for food, taxes, utilities and maintenance.  i can easily subsidize those.  she could come live with my fiancé and me, but that takes her away from everything she has ever known, plus i worry about the strain of her living with us on our relationship.  i am thinking, at least for the time being, about hiring someone to swing by a few times a week and check in on her, buy her groceries, etc.  she is still capable.  any thoughts or ideas on this?my mother has never been married and i [32m] am the only child and live 2 hours away.  i don’t know if i am in denial on her actual condition or if i’m overreacting.  i don’t know a lot of things.  i was prepared for some feelings in this, but i was not prepared for the amount of selfishness, anger, and guilt that i am now experiencing.  selfishness in my personal life.  selfishness in my career.  i know the toll that this has on families.  i’ve lived it.  taking care of my grandparents consumed her life for fifteen years, and now, ten years later, she is subject to the same path.   i am angry.  i am angry that a good woman, a strong woman, is slowly being erased by this damned disease.  i feel guilty about not being there for her more in the past.  i feel helpless and guilty in knowing how the story ends, but only being the starting line.  i am heartbroken for her to have to suffer through this.  she has already offered up so much to the alzheimer’s gods, and now they are demanding her life.  she doesn’t deserve this.  she has paid her dues.  done her time.  without question.  without regret.i’m sorry if this post is a mess.  i needed to write this.  i know all of you caretakers and family members out there have sacrificed so much yourselves and i am not in a unique situation.  i think i just need to know you are out there, and what you did at the start of your journey.  my fiancé and family are great, and very supportive.  i know i am not alone in this, but i feel all the responsibility acutely.  i very much appreciate any feedback you can provide.  i have already talked with, and received information from, alz.org and plan on talking with mom friday.  from there, scheduling a visit with a physician, getting rx meds, etc.  after that, who knows?  here we go!edit:  you guys are awesome.  thank you so much for the advice and support."," the first thing you need to do is to get her a thorough health work up.  there are many treatable conditions that can lead to these sorts of behaviors.  eliminate them before you jump to the worst case.  for example, we were certain my mil was suffering from alzheimers, she was tested for sleep apnea, put on a cpap and has been sharp as a take for the subsequent 20 years.  my fil, on the other hand was diagnosed after we had eliminated everything else.  i wish you the best on this.

"hi. my grandma haves alzheimers for some years now. 2 years ago my mom found out she haves breast cancer. after 1 year of treatment, my mom was all set for the surgery, when my grandma had a stroke and she went blind. my mom had to pospone the surgery to take care of gradma ( she was living at the country side so we had to bring her in the city so she can stay with us ). she kept on throwing up a lot ( i never saw someone throw up this much) and she barely ate something for weeks. she didn't know how to tell us how she feels or what it hurts. eventually we called the ambulance and they took her to the hospital for surgery ( she had an enormous gallstone).anyways.. after the surgery we decided to keep her with us since she can't take care of herself. since then ( october 2016) she had mostly only good days, but in the last month she is impossible. she keeps on saying that she can't breath, takes off her clothes, says she haves to go to the bathroom like 60 times a  day, she obviously doesn't know who we are 85% of the time and some times she gets violent.. when she gets this type of behaviour she barely listens to me.since my mom had the surgery i had to leave college so i can take care of them and it's pretty hard taking care of my mom after her chemotherapy sessions.. it's even harder to take care of my grandma too. i love them both a lot. my grandma is like my second mother, i'm sad to see her like this.so my questions are : 1. do you have any ideea what hobbies can she have since she is also blind? i read to her and i play her music but sometimes she gets quickly bored.2. is she just spoiled or is her late behaviour normal for an alzheimers pacient?3. how do you calm down someone who doesn't listen to you ? 4. how do you keep youself sane ?"," i am sorry for what you are going through. i don't know what country you are in but i hope you can contact the alzheimers association for some suggestions on getting help for your grandma.1) i wish i had more ideas. search for sensory type toys on amazon. magic sand, etc. 2) you know her best, but if she is different than in the past its not jus t being spoiled. it depends on the person. there are many symptoms and behavior changes that happen with dementia. those sound like alz.3) distract them if you can, this also works with children. :) bring them water, open the window. walk away if needed. it will pass.4) self care. baths, walks, massages, dance... whatever makes you feel calm and at peace.thinking of ya. xo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5tw60m/need_some_advice/,Need some advice

[deleted]," keep in mind that i'm responding not as a clinician, but as someone who is now a primary caregiver. *caveat emptor*a few years ago, my wife was complaining about depression and terrible anxiety. i took her to meet with a shrink friend of hers -- a person she has known since her school days. i was expecting the friend to write a script or two for antidepressants. my wife seemed otherwise perfectly normal to me, other than the signs of depression.i was shocked and even a tad insulted that her old friend said she might have alzhemiers, and who suggested we see a neurologist. but i went through with it. got the mris, cognitive evaluations, blood-work, etc.yep, alzheimers. i'm now so grateful to her friend to have been perceptive enough to see what i couldn't. i would otherwise have continued on my merry way, making excuses to myself for her decline. instead, i was given a chance to prepare myself mentally, emotionally, financially for what was sure to be coming.now don't get me wrong -- i didn't fully prepare myself, and i made more than my fair share of mistakes, especially in the patience department -- but at least i had something to hold on to as a reason for her changes in thought patterns and behaviour.if in fact your father has had all the requisite tests and was correctly diagnosed, then be thankful that you've been given a good heads up. it takes a good long while for you to switch mental and emotional models to know how to appropriately deal with this. like i said, i was thankful early on to have been given the time to evolve from the state of denial to a state where i can be as supportive as i can be.please feel welcome here to talk and ask any questions that may come up.

"my mil has alzheimer's. we are her prime carers due to geography - other family members live a long way away. we're in uk. **tl:dr** :- we don't know what the truth is. is my mil lying to her family or is she lying to the professionals?there is a back story, naturally.she has always been a challenging person who, throughout her life, sought to gain personal sympathy by trying to set family and friends against each other by telling lies about how they behave towards her e.g a nice day out would be later related to other family members as being horrible because, ""they took me to a noisy restaurant"" or, ""they didn't look after me properly for x,y,z reason"". so everybody feels sorry for poor 'jane', she has a hard life and her family doesn't look after her properly.she seems to have been quite successful in all this, over the years, and it's only now that her children are realising how they've been played throughout their lives, and how they might actually have been 'closer' to each other if they hadn't believed her lies about the others.latterly we are each being told that the others must be stealing her money because she doesn't have bank statements even though they're right next to her, so she thinks her money has vanished. ditto jewellery and other belongings. if she gives something to person y when they visit, the others are told they took it without permission and she wants it back. person x isn't answering the phone, so they're doing it deliberately; either that or the phone company has been told to stop her phone working - who has told them that, it must be person w.my mil has also *always* wanted to move - to be somewhere else.  family have, to some extent, humoured her to shut up her moaning and i have personally overseen three moves even though i had to travel a long way to help her because those living closer wouldn't/couldn't. within a couple of weeks she doesn't like the new place either, and the moans and complaints begin all over again. it's a normal pattern, mirroring her own parents who didn't stay in any place longer than a couple of years.she lives in sheltered accommodation - her choice, decision made before diagnosis. she now has meals delivered, has a visiting cleaner and hairdresser, and now has morning carers. she has a social worker and a mh csw who see her every so often, usually after we've had a little crisis. she refuses to even visit our house, not even for christmas and birthdays etc - and no, she is never expected to make her own way anyway, hasn't been for many years.we know she can't/won't cook, can't/won't do laundry (cleaner does this, if/when she lets the cleaner in), sleeps in a recliner (bedlinen still perfect), can't/won't go out unless it's with somebody other than family, can't/won't use the shower, wouldn't wash her hair ever if she didn't have a hairdresser etc etc - but if she's asked about her needs she tells lies and says she is coping just fine.she had a recent assessment visit by a consultant because she has asked to move to extra care housing and her needs have to be assessed to work out priorities - we were there during this assessment which was nothing more than a chat, so not at all threatening. she said everything was 'fine', she likes where she lives, manages with personal care, enjoys going out a couple of times a week, her nearby family looks after her very well, has friends etc etc. i mentioned that she'd said she is bored, she told me i was a liar and then pretended i wasn't in the room - and hasn't spoken to me since, completely blanks me we visit.that night we and other close family had the ranting phone calls - who was that man, i'm bored, i'm lonely, i want to move etc etc. these are now almost daily with constant repetition of the same old things that we're all used to, but increasingly verbal and aggressive so much so that oh doesn't want to answer the phone to her any more - and neither does any of the rest of the scattered family. she is further alienating/has alienated all her children and their respective spouses over the past eighteen months, just at the time when she/we really need them and their support.we all know she has what are described to her as 'memory problems' - but we don't know what is guile and what is fact. it's as if she opens a script book depending on who she is talking to. is nice to 'x'; rude to 'y'; needy and helpless when talking to 'd', not coping when she talks to 'z' - but always, always, presents as self-sufficient and capable when talking to the professionals."," narcissism does not recede with dementia unfortunately. eventually the disease will overtake her, at which point you can step in and do what you want for her safety/living situation. for the moment, i would just keep my distance as she sounds toxic!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5t012s/how_to_work_out_which_are_the_lies/,How to work out which are the lies.

context: i'm 20 and live with my grandparents while i attend university. my grandfather is now in his late stages of alzheimer's while we are waiting for the call to put him in a home. in the meantime i help my grandmother with him as best i can as she is under immense stress. my question is: is it normal for dementia patients to revert back to childhood? my grandfather thinks he's back in the village where he grew up and constantly asks where his parents are even though they've been dead for 30 years. if it is normal: how do we deal with it? would it be best to just agree with him?," i think it is. i was reading about strategies for families who have a loved one with alzheimers and they start to lose their more recent memories first, and their memories from their childhood last. so in the later stages they'll think they're a child, won't recognize themselves in the mirror, might think their children are their parents, etc. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5s0z1j/is_it_normal_for_dementia_patients_to_revert_back/,Is it normal for dementia patients to revert back to childhood?

"i have read in a few places that early onset alzheimer's progresses more quickly, however i have not found scholarly sources that confirm this. i think i recall reading somewhere that this is erroneous and that the discrepancy in interpretation is because early onset is diagnosed later. in other words, younger patients may be given a longer battery of tests and treatments for conditions they don't have before they are formally diagnosed with alzheimer's. since life expectancy is usually measured after diagnosis, this would change the stage at which they are diagnosed. does anybody have any knowledge or sources on this question? do early onset alzheimer's patients really progress and die more quickly? thank you.", would assumption be that there really is no way to tell at this time how long an early onset diagnosis gives the person to live?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5rqsh1/early_onset_vs_later_onset_life_expectancy/,Early onset vs Later Onset Life Expectancy?
"i'd like to get tested for the genes that have associations with alzheimers (because my mom has it and it is getting pretty bad).i've googled a few options, most seem to be in the $100-$150 range.my insurance probably won't cover this, so i'd like to get the best value for testing. any suggestions?i guess i was wondering, is there just a comprehensive test that alerts a person to multiple gene associations (diabetes, etc) and would it be more cost effective to take a comprehensive test, over one that is focused on just the genes associated to alzheimers?backstory on my mom. she started exhibiting signs at 70, which might not seem abnormal, except all of our other relatives, including her mom, were very lucid well into their 90s. she is the outlier in the group, and i suspect some link to her biological father, who she never met, because her mother divorced him before she was born. the story is that her mom divorced him after having to bail him out of jail multiple times for public intoxication."," firstly i would like to say that i have researched this quite a bit with my mothers neurologists in the past, and there really is no one test that can give you an accurate answer. because of how many different forms of alzheimer's/dementia there is no one test. i would like to share my experience with this subject. i lost my mother to alzheimer's this past may, and i too wanted to see if i could get tested. ever since my mom passed, the slightest bit of memory loss i might have (which is of course totally normal), freaks me out. her doctor is one of the best neurologist at mass general hospital in boston. i personally called him and asked about tests so i can figure out if i am at risk.  although in my mother's case the only way to get a good read on my risk factor was to autopsy my mothers brain which we were not prepared to do as a family. aside from that on a more personal level he advised me not to get tested as the chances were very slim that my mother could pass that down to me and also the affect knowing can have on your future life.  basically, say the test came back positive that you were at risk it's still not be 100%, would you want to live the rest of your life worrying about symptoms? course everyone is different and everybody can make up their own mind about these things, but after thinking about what the doctor had told me, he was right.

"about five years ago my family and i noticed that my mom wasn't remembering things and even simple tasks like putting a dish in the right cupboard became almost impossible. we took her to our gp to do the standard tests for dementia and she passed and her psychiatrist said she was over anxious and stressed and put her on a low dose of zoloft. my aunt, myself and other friends and family members however saw she was getting worse and repeating herself over and over but she kept passing the memory tests. fast forward to last week when there was a massive shift in behavior and memory where she doesn't recognize my dad at times and doesn't believe she's married but recognizes me as her son. we took her to the hospital because at the time we thought she might have a uti which can affect the mind. after two trips to the hospital she was diagnosed with eod. even though we have been down this road with my grandparents the shock that it progressed so rapidly in a matter of a week is still wearing off. add in the fact that i just got engaged a month ago with now trying to be a responsible adult child helping my dad manage things i am tired and stressed. thankfully i don't get angry when my mom asks me the same question over and over again but it does wear me out and i do feel the stress of the situation. what are some practical things i can be doing to help my self and my dad to make things a little less stressful? right now we have ladies from the church that she still remembers coming in on shifts during the day while my dad and i are at work so she is not alone while we work to get her a visiting nurse/home aid. i would appreciate your insights.", thank you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5n9rx8/moms_eod/,Mom's EOD

"i have dealt with too many cases of alzheimer's and dementia in my family, most closely and recently my father. i have had this disease all around me for my entire life. it's like watching debris falling from space to the earth. at first it's just kind of floating, which isn't too bad. it's hardly noticeable. then it starts falling slowly and gaining speed. the closer it gets, the more scared and more frustrated you become knowing you can't do anything to stop it. toward its final descent it catches fire and gains more momentum, culminating in its impact with the earth. it finally dies, and people come and take it away. the crater it leaves affects everyone around it, and you're left with a pit of where it used to be. there are few things harder to watch."," that sounds about right to me.in my current experience, one gets used to the status quo for a period of time. everything seems 'normal' for a given value of normal.then, one day -- perhaps every few months, give or take, something happens, and it feels like we've moved down one step in the ladder. he abilities have lessened. it's a new normal.this new normal always throws me, and takes me a while to adjust. and then it's 'normal'.we have a great behavioural therapist who comes once a week who has to remind me not to hold her hand when i want her to go someplace -- to allow her to be as self-sufficient as she can. so it seems i have to fight against this 'new normalcy' as much as possible.one thing that comes to mind regarding your metaphor (or is it a simile?), is that we're slowing hearing from her extended family and friends, who from time to time offer to take her out for coffee or whatever. it feels like the blast radius of the impending crater is being softened somewhat by the occasional kindness of family and friends.of course, family and friends don't see the day-to-day that i see, but it's somehow comforting to know that they are at least aware.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5mfqe4/i_feel_like_this_sums_up_alzheimers_well/,I feel like this sums up Alzheimer's well.

"on a throw away because this is a really hard topic for me.  my grandmother has alzheimers.  it has progressed at a fairly alarming rate since may, but she is still able to recognize her family most of the time.  i long ago accepted that she was turning into a person that i didn't recognize anymore and for a while we were all terrified of the violent person that she had become.  the violent phase seems to have passed now, which we are all grateful for.  being called the wrong name is common place.  none of that really makes me upset like it used to.the bad part is she knows what's happening to her.  she has the mentality of a 4 year old most of the time and if it's a bad day and tantrums begin, then we simply treat her like she is a toddler.  however, on those lucid days, it's very difficult.  there are about 40 years of memories that she doesn't have any longer.  she remembers her childhood, her brothers, her parents, her children, her first husband, her current husband, her grandchildren.  she can't remember what she had for breakfast an hour earlier.she wanted to have a talk yesterday about things.  she asked if she was ever going to get better.  this is the first time that she's asked that since her decline in the summer.  she said that she misses doing the things that she used to be able to do.  i told her that it's just all part of getting older.  living in a nursing home, having to have someone take care of you, needing some reminders of when to eat and when to take your meds...it's all just part of growing old.  i didn't have the heart to tell her that she was ill and she wasn't going to get better.i don't know if she'll remember that conversation.  i honestly don't think that she will.  it disturbs me that she is cognoscente of what is happening to her.  i can only imagine how much fear she has when she has those lucid moments.  is there even a good way to answer those questions when they're asked?  i don't want to lie to her, but i do want her to have some hope.  i want to make this normal, because the fact of that matter is, it doesn't matter how abnormal this gets...this is our reality and it will be until the day that she dies.  i can't give her back her memories and i can't stop this illness, but i can give her respect and dignity.  i think that's what i'm really struggling with right now."," i always answer my mom with the truth - there's no point in anything else.  she's been violent, delusional, slapped one of my sisters and i, stabbed a fellow resident and tried to push and punch others.  the staff at her facility do their best and they manage her quite well.  the biggest learning for me about alz is that patients have emotions and respond to what their brain is telling them, even when it's inaccurate.  my mom has lost all nouns but the word 'walker' so everything is a walker.  yesterday she told me about this 'walker' on the walker (while she pointed to the window of her room) and how it had rained (it was snowing) and then she cried because she didn't like the rain.this is our new life.  she's lost one of her hearing aids and broken the other.  i'm waiting for replacements but she will only get one set - that's all she can afford. and she'll likely lose them again anyway.  they told us to engrave her false teeth with her name because she'd lose them and she has.  your grandma won't remember these conversations.  i've had the same chats with my mom for three years.  she wants to go 'home', she's upset that she can't remember her own daughter's name and she cries for about 10 seconds (until she remembers that the walker outside the walked happened yesterday) and then she sings a line form some french song.this is the pattern of alz.  nothing you say will make her feel better except for maybe a moment or two.  she has feelings and if she's like my mom, she will continually try to make sense of her world, until even that desire leaves.  then she just exists.  i watched a staff member yesterday help a man swallow his lunch because he sometimes forgets how.  it's a tragic illness and ugly at every stage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5kffih/how_to_take_away_the_fear/,How to take away the fear?

"my grandparents are in their mid 80s. my grandfather was recently diagnosed with inoperable heart failure and has started having quite a lot of episodes that required them to go to the hospital.  my grandmother has always been melodramatic and appears to have early onset alzhemiers/dementia. up until recently it had always been seemingly benign things like being overly reptitive but now it is getting worse. we suspect that she mixed up my grandfather's medication and fed him eggs that had gone bad.after the hospital incidents both are incredibly scared that he is going to die soon. she has started saying aloud extremely melodramatic things in front of him and other people about where she would like him to get buried, he's holding on until his eldest child (my mother) comes back from overseas, holding on until christmas etc.  questions i haveis this kind of behaviour (saying stuff with little to no filter) another symptom of alzheimers or dementia?  how did you broach the subject of getting your loved ones tested for it without causing too much stress and heartache?"," i would recommend calling the alzheimer's association helpline. they are great help and really kind. they have given me great info and will have ideas on how to talk to your family. i am sorry about your grandparents health. those definitely sound like symptoms of dementia. being in mid80s is not ""early onset"" that term refers to when people develop alzhemiers/dementia the ages of 40, 50 to 65 years old. specifically diagnosed before the age of 65. wishing you the best.

"hopefully, there are some phd's and psych/neuro mds on here.  i am a graduate student, and i am currently in the middle of writing a ~30 page review paper on ad. this is both as practice writing a journal-style article and to complete a course i am in. i picked ad for the paper since i have a clinical and cognitive neuro research background from undergrad as well strong family history of the disease, but i do not have as much experience with the pure physiology and its literature. if you can point me to some articles for any of pathophysiolgy, progression, treatments, future directions, history, etc., i would be super stoked. thanks in advance."," just ""alzheimer's disease"" generally is so broad it might be tough to fit in 30pages. but, alzforum is a great resource for good background and links to seminal papers. www.alzforum.org/timeline/alzheimers-disease#1906they've got it nicely laid out chronologically too, so i think that will be interesting for you to flip through.in terms of where the current understanding is, let's just say it is controversial. the main issue i'll mention is that the amyloid hypothesis is typically considered to be mostly true, although almost anyone you speak to who is very familiar with the field will give you a multitude of reasons they are sceptical. after you have a strong grasp of the basics, i'd search pubmed for a review published within the last couple years that touches on some aspect of ad you find intriguing and just follow the rabbit hole of citations that are supplied. when all is said and done, you may want to narrow your topic down.edit: i see you've said ""physiology and mci"". advice still holds. there is so much research out there on ad. mci is more new, so that's a good way to narrow it a bit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5huhl4/best_literature_to_use_for_a_full_review_of_the/,Best literature to use for a full review of the physiology of AD and possibly aMCI
"i'm 23 and i live with my grandparents. my grandfather is in his 80's and my grandmother in her 60's. grandad has had a pretty tough time - he was in a major accident about 30-odd years ago and has been (for want of a better word) crippled ever since.  this has meant he's been on super strong painkillers ever since, as long as i can remember he's had trouble with names and places but never has this been anything particularly worrying. my grandmother says he's always been fairly vacant, even before the accident. but earlier this year he stated he didn't want to drive anymore. he said he didn't feel safe driving  (he's always been confident; was a lorry driver prior to his accident). other things have been more common too; he stated walking to the front of the house before remembering the kitchen was moved to the back at least 20 years ago. he forgot where his clothes were, which door the bathroom was through. but more recently (this weekend) he's told us that he can't read anymore. he starts reading a line and then gets lost and forgets where he was. we've suggested audio books might help. he loves reafing and its painful to see this taken from me. although i've been begging my grandmother to get him to the doctors for months now this has made it more real and i'm terrified. can anyone give me any advice on what i should do or how i can help him? my father is in the navy and was away when i was growong up, while mum worked grandad basically raised me. i feel selfish for being so devastated about this but it feels so unfair for him and i hate it. edit: thanks for the advice everyone, i appreciate knowing that people are out there who understand what i'm going through here. we have an appointment scheduled for him now but the soonest we could make it is the 9th january. some days are definitely worse than others but the less stressed we are seen to be the better he seems to be, for now.again: thank you so much everyone. i hope i won't be back to seek further support but i am not getting my hopes up too much, i don't want to be unrealistic &lt;3"," hi! i am 23 and my father, 65, was just diagnosed with alzheimers. we noticed slight changes in him in the beginning of 2015. forgetting names, ""i know i asked you this already but"", etc. in 2015 he was diagnosed with dementia, but after a recent pet scan it was confirmed alzheiemers.when my mom and i first noticed the changes we did some research, talked to family etc and made a doctors appointment with his primary. my father hates the doctors, so we fabricated the story saying we have new insurance and they require an up to date physical. during the visit my mother explained the situation. we had cat scan after cat scan, which resulted in some white spots. saw a neurologist etc. i could go on and on if you want to direct message me.in this situation there is my father with the disease, his wife (my mother) who is emotional, trying to be strong, still hopeful, and then there is me who is brutally honest and strong. as hard as it is you have to accept the fact that there could be something wrong that is incurable, though if caught soon enough some medicines could be prescribed to prolonge any damaging affects. if you are not honest with yourself, it will only get worse more quickly. please reach out for anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5ht12r/possible_alz_presenting_rapidly_in_a_loved_one/,Possible Alz presenting rapidly in a loved one.

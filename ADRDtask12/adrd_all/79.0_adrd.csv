"my mom is in her early fifties. i don't know too much family history, but my mother's mother had a series of strokes over my entire childhood leading her to be progressively disabled. i lived in the same home with her for some years, during which time my grandfather was still working and so me and my siblings were her prime caregivers during the day at the young ages of 5-10. it was a nightmarish experience and she was verbally and physically abusive despite being extremely obese, nearly 500 pounds at the time of her death. it was definitely not the little media trope of forgetful sad little grandma. she was angry, paranoid, short-tempered, and absolutely unwilling to try to do anything for herself. i was the youngest sibling but only by two years. she knew my siblings got older, but she never seemed to ever recognize, on a very literal level, that i was older than 6 or so, so she would angrily yell at me for doing things like turning on a microwave or tell me i was incapable of dusting the tops of doors because i was too short, even when i was the tallest. we had to clean her and feed her and cloth her and she fought us. she was mostly incontinent and for some reason, probably because i was the youngest and didn't fight back, this was always my job to clean up. my family always brushed it off because ""what can we do?"" and since her death, she is never mentioned. when i came home the day she had died, the first thing i was told was, ""it's okay if you're happy she's dead."" and i was, because i never loved her, and she was such a burden on my grandfather. since her death he has begun traveling the world and is very happy. it is a little sad because apparently she was a different person before her strokes and subsequent dementia, but i never knew her like that. she just spent 12 years dying slowly, painfully, and meanly. for many years this has been a sort of underlying issue or scar, in regards to my mom. she doesn't take good care of herself and never has. she's significantly obese and has had a lifelong depression, and neither of these things she has ever made successful efforts toward improving. she has told me things like, ""i'm going to die fat"" and ""when i'm in a wheelchair, please take me outside sometimes"" and always, always tells me that she's going to have dementia someday, and that **i'm** going to take care of her. the only thought in my head is nope, no, never. i will never pin myself down to be abused like my grandfather was, like i was as a child, ever again. in the past couple of years, my mom has started to show a lot of signs of mental decline, and it makes me very angry. i'm living with her as it's the summer and it seems like every summer she's worse. she's just more short-tempered and easily confused. she does this, throw-up-my-hands and repeatedly say, ""i don't know! i just don't know!"" thing that my grandmother always did. a lot of times if i have something in my hands for whatever reason, she thinks it's something else. sjust today i asked if i could have a ball of bright yellow yarn that's been on her dresser in plain view for months, and she looked at me in confusion and asked, ""do you have a wound?"" i said, what are you talking about? she said, ""what do you want that for?"" i said, for my weaving. she said, ""oh! i thought that was a roll of bandages. where did you get it from?""i told her i got it off her dresser, and she told me absolutely not, she had never seen it before. **i just walked away at that point, which she huffed at because she always thinks it's rude. it's way less rude than the things i would say if i didn't just walk away.** stuff like that happens *multiple times a day*. she gets very agitated thinking that i haven't eaten all day and comes and tells me i make her feel like a bad person for not cooking for me. if you haven't gotten the idea, i'm a very independent person and haven't relied on her to cook for me since i was in elementary school. what happens, i'm pretty sure, is that she doesn't remember or doesn't realize ever seeing me in the kitchen. but she comes and guilt-trips me and says, ""*you're* making me feel like a bad mother!"" it happens pretty much every day. she's a very bad driver, sometimes driving past her own workplace and, if she's in a new place, she'll get hopelessly turned around even if the destination is in plain view. she forgets to brush her hair often and sometimes forgets to feed the pets. i mostly take care of them now, but i feel bad for when i go back to college.she won't go to the doctor for anything because ""they'll just say i'm fat and unhealthy, and i won't listen to them anyways."" this is true. this is the hard to understand part:**my mom is working on her doctorate and is doing very well in her classes.** she writes 20 page papers and does massive studies and is working on her dissertation, which is on a very cerebral topic that i don't even understand. i don't think any of her coworkers see any/many of these behaviors, although she rarely interacts with them outside of work. they know little things like, ""oh, she has such a bad sense of direction!"" but i feel like i'm going insane a little, or that people would think i'm insane to say it looks like my mom is having the start of a cognitive decline. i just don't think that ""normal old people aging"" is staring at a ball of yellow yarn two feet away for 15+ seconds and thinking it's bandages. my 80 year old grandfather is much more mentally fit than my 50some year old mother. it's not right, and i don't like it, and i don't feel like anyone would believe me. that's why i came here. i just wanted to talk about it all. i find myself having a lot of fantasies for her to suddenly die in her sleep, just because it seems so terrifying, the path she's going down. for her and for me and for everyone else. and then it makes me very sad, that i wish my mom to die.", bredesen protocol,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ognj0h/mom_is_very_highfunctioning_but_also_not_my_story/,"Mom is very high-functioning, but also not?

"my father has been showing signs of dementia/alzheimer’s/lewy body and my mother is bearing the brunt of his care and supervision. she reached out to me asking for help, but i thought i would ask here to see if anyone has already tackled this. my dad was always very good with technology, he was instrumental in the early days of fiber optics and telecommunication, but those skills seem to be going the fastest. my mom is frustrated because she is not able to get in touch with him if she has to leave the house. when the phone rings he will try to answer the tv remote. this ends up with mom not talking to dad, and the tv being inputs being changed to the point he can’t figure out how to get back to his shows. mom is looking for some kind of solution that 1) he does not have to keep up with or remember where he set it down, 2) requires minimal steps/button presses to access. my first two thoughts were either a smart watch that receives calls, or something like an alexa or google assistant. do any of you have any experience that may help?  any preferences or suggestions based on the options above?  thanks for your time.", is he ok using the phone when he finds it? we had to try a few handsets but eventually found the doro 1360 worked well for him.if he manages to get out of hospital and use it again i’m consideringgetting a lanyard so that the phone is always around his neck.i found that recently even the most blatantly obvious signage like “tv” or “phone” would often be missed…interested in hearing any tips you have if you make progress.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ogm59c/help_needed_reaching_dad/,Help needed reaching dad.
"hi everyone. first of all, sorry my english is not perfect. my dad is having a hard time communicating. he kept saying he can’t find, can’t find, can’t find. eventually the caretaker know he meant he can’t find the words of the topic he wanted to talk about.i was thinking maybe giving him like a… book of pictures, if that makes sense? like the ones for kids or babies. so that he can point to the things he wants to talk about. do you think it will help? any advice is appreciated. thank you."," yes, that's a great idea. by the way, the term is called aphasia. knowing that makes it easier to google techniques, products, and ideas. one idea is you can print out an emotions wheel, one for children with big images that he can point to when he is frustrated and trying to describe some emotion.for example i saw on the iphone shortcuts program, there is one called ""what do i need?"" with a big green hand (and you can make it a huge widget) and it has options like ""i'm too hot, too cold, hungry, need the bathroom..."" etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ogliob/any_advice_to_help_communication/,Any advice to help communication?
"my mother had a recent test score of 20 (up from 17 a few months prior but it was late afternoon when she took the first assessment) she's in a retirement facility and still living independent, although we got her a medacube for meds disbursement and there's a daily wellness check-in and one good meal in her plan (right now).  on the testing scale, she is at moderate cognitive impairment.  she has a neurologist.  he has her on donepezil and just started her on a tiny dose of prozac.  i can see that she is slowly losing ground with her memory loss, but has not had any changes in personality besides the normal confusion of not remembering any new information.  her mri shows the typical narrowing of the ""memory centers"" in her brain.  at what point do we get some type of official diagnosis beyond moderate cognitive impairment?  she can ""age in place"" and we can bump up her level of care as she needs it.  but how do we know when she needs it?  she's almost to the point where she can't remember when she's having problems...i don't want to wait until something hurtful happens to her, and i thought having a diagnosis might help us decide on when she needs more help.  another reason we need a diagnosis is that she has a really decent long term care insurance plan that will pay quite a bit of her housing and care once she has some sort of official diagnosis.  i don't know how they find out what is causing the dementia and memory loss and what is causing it?"," do you have medical power of attorney? can you contact the neurologist and tell them about the issue with needing a solid diagnosis for care financing?as far as when to escalate her care, i would guess that if her facility can accommodate her, maybe they can assess her too?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ogk3xq/moca_test_score_of_20/,MoCA test score of 20
"my mom and dad live on their own in a rural area. i am unable to visit/help as much as my dad seems to expect me to, and he will not accept other forms of assistance in caring for and supervising my mom. as you can imagine, shenanigans are frequent and patience is thinning.my mom has, for the last year or so, been secretly cutting up things at their home. most notably, her targets are clothing and shoes. my dad says he will find them in the trash, in the yard, stuffed in nooks and crannies around the house. he always calls me when something has been hidden/destroyed and asks me to replace whatever it is. he keeps pushing me to take her shopping, but that is not a realistic expectation. she won’t even try on anything at home. i can’t handle her temper in a store by myself. that said… it’s frustrating to go through the process of scouring the internet for something that fits and is easy to maneuver, then have to do it all over again a month or two later. this is not sustainable.i don’t know if this is me searching for suggestions or if i’m just whining… any input?side note: i know the scissors are a safety issue. i have no idea where she keeps them, since i don’t live there. my dad can’t keep track of her all the time, and she’s pretty sneaky. i’m making it a mission to go on the hunt at my next visit."," before my mom was moved to memory care, she liked to cut bills and tax information up, thinking it needed be the right size, for what?  we weren't sure but it created a lot of headaches while i tried to round up what was left of documents.cutting up clothing is worse, because of the expense and the hassle.   at this point i would strongly suggest that box or trunk with a lock be purchased to hold several changes of clothing, shoes and also the scissors.  have a second lockable trunk for dirty clothes so they can be safely held until it's time to wash them.i agree with the others here- children's scissors are fine but i also just remembered- my mother had a go at her hair, too.   just hacked off chunks so perhaps if you could find children's scissors that barely cut paper.   is there an activity that your mom could be redirected to?  using children's scissors can she clip coupons?   one friend asked us all for old calendars- her mother had dementia but needed to ""work"" and she would write all over piles of last year's calendars and if she didn't have that activity, she'd mess with the real appointment sheets and checkbook of my friend if she could find them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ogjkfv/mom_hiding_scissors_cutting_clothing/,"Mom Hiding Scissors, Cutting Clothing"
dad just barely survived his aspiration pneumonia after two weeks on antibiotics. but they say it will surely happen again no matter how careful they are as the dementia is progressive and starts to impact autonomic systems like the swallow reflex. so the doctors recommend he go into hospice altho he looks back to his pre-pneumonia self - dementia not withstanding. his advanced directive is no artificial mechanisms. so now we're left with the dilemma as to how much to treat him to his favorite foods and how much to preserve every last minute of life. what i understand is even people on feeding tubes often succumb to more aspiration pneumonia by just swallowing saliva down the trachea. has anyone come to this fork in the road? it's so hard because even before dementia he didn't even want old folks home food (which is actually quite good) let along hand fed mush. yet on the other hand i don't want to accidentally bump him off with a big juicy steak.," my mom is in ynt same state as we speak.  she's on hospice the last 2 weeks.  i believe she had aspirated again but we're basically waiting to see if she gets pneumonia again.  it's hard and heartbreaking.  she's only 65 but has had it rough and didn't take very good care of herself.  thinking of you and yours.  just so you know... we're giving my mom nearly anything she wants to eat.  you can aspirate from water,  saliva,  anything.  so why not let them go having eaten thier favorite things? 💛🦋🙏🏽 strange but that's how i see it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ogitu2/aspiration_pneumonia_survivor_age_late_80s/,Aspiration Pneumonia Survivor Age - late 80s

"our dad was 70, he had ftd for the past 4 years. we always struggled to accomodate his changed behavior. the sleepless nights, the agitation and unrest. in the past months things seemed to be a bit better on this side. he looked more relaxed, this now makes us be even more angry for how things ended up. at the end of may he went for a day hospital surgery, an inguinal hernia. it went ok, but since then he had started breathing exclusively through the mouth. 3 days later he gets the second dose of pfizer covid vaccine. one week later gp thinks he had bronchitis and started a cycle of antibiotics. 4 days of antibiotics the gp says his lungs sound clean. it was a saturday. we felt happy.on tuesday, the gp comes to see him again, she suggests an x-ray cause “there’s something in his lungs”. meanwhile he had started i.v. antibiotics. i suspect something is wrong with his throat. i go buy thickener powder for him to drink gelatinous water. on thursday i bring him to a pneumologist. the specialist doesn’t think there’s anything particularly bad with his lungs. he said father might have aspiration pneumonia, cause of swallowing issues. father was followed by neurologists and geriatricians. but no one had ever mentioned that aspiration pneumonia is a major cause of concern for people diagnosed with dementia. according to the lung specialist, on a later stage he might had needed a feeding tube. nonetheless for now it was more or less ok. for the second time in 2 weeks, we felt relieved. two days later, saturday. father is having hard issue breathing. he can’t eat or swallow. we bring him to the er. after a ct scan, the doctor tells us he has a serious pneumonia, with “very evil bacteria, hard to destroy”. they send him to another hospital to get admitted to a ward. there are no beds, he spends the night in the er. i had asked them to be with him, they agreed and i watch him all night long. he has oxygen, and his breathing is at times difficult but he’s awake. in the morning they tell me there will be no available beds for a couple of day. i decide to drive him to the capital city, 2hours drive. we’re in italy and covid-19 measures lowered the number of available beds for non-covid patients. in the metropolitan hospital they admit him to the er again. here, they don’t allow anyone to be next to him. he stays here 3 days alone, waiting to get admitted to a ward. as many people with dementia, he is hard to control. that’s why they wrap his hands and tie his arms to the bed. the hospital is full, i pressure the doctors to admit him to a department so i could stay with him. covid-19 rules make impossible for care givers to stay within the er spaces. on the 4th day at the er, they call us. father situation is critical. they say his kidneys collapsed. he might die any moment. me and my brother rush to the hospital, the doctor says there are no beds and he is in a very critical situation. if he was her father, she would bring him home. that’s what she tells us. the time of a sentence, and the all world collapses over us. we call an ambulance to drive him home. he breaths with great difficulty. i untie his arms and can feel the tension of 3 full days of fight against the constriction they put him in. his muscles vibrates. he’s shaking his forearms. when home, in his bed, for two nights he resists. i pressure the gp to give him water. i call the pneumologist to come see him. they come. but they’ve given up on him. he’s in a pre-coma state. we sleep next to him for two nights. until on the morning of the third day his breath slows down. until he stops moving and closes his eyes. all happened so fast and in a rush. we have so many questions and very few answers."," my dad recently died too, and he went probably 2-3 weeks after getting his second pfizer vaccineit started innocuously enough with hiccups that wouldn't go away...over the days it became difficulty swallowing, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, restlessness, loss of the ability to speak...then one day suddenly he has a fit/seizure where his body went rigid, and shook violently...after they took him to the hospital they found that his body was having a severe auto-immune (attacking itself) response to something...they tried figuring out what, but his condition worsened and in a couple days he was gonei'm sorry to say this, but yours is just one of a number of reports i've heard of an old person suffering some strange symptoms/injury/death in the weeks following their second injection...**ask the people around you in your life to tell you their experiences**...from what *i* have heard from *my* people, i do not trust these fucking vaccines",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ogcuy1/in_a_rush_father_died_ftd/,In a rush father died - ftd

i am back again. i am wondering if paranoia maybe related to feeling the fbi is controlling only his devices. (because he has an interest in conspiracy theories) he also is paranoid that my mom or i am going to get kidnapped on a 10 minute trip. he is also paranoid someone will steal my mom’s purse and leave her stranded. the difference is the rate of crime in our city is so incredibly low that it’s stupid. it’s to the point that he doesn’t want me or my mom to get out of the car alone. i am wondering if this is paranoia related to something else or dementia. thanks.," paranoia is common. my dad has it pretty bad. believed he'd done something and now someone was coming to ""get"" him. (details varied but that was the theme.) he also was super anxious about cars and didn't want to go in a car or for us to do so because he thought we'd get stuck/kidnapped/drown (?). beliefs that someone is stealing their possessions or money are also super common. so what you're describing sounds familiar, and it's really difficult to manage, because these delusions may be insane to us but are absolute reality to them, so you can't really reason with them. sometimes cognition enhancing meds like aricept, exelon or e:namenda help with delusions/paranoia. if he really gets agitated or aggressive or prone to wandering and nothing else works, you could try an atypical antipsychotic like seroquel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/og9aaj/types_of_paranoia_with_dementia/,Types of paranoia with dementia

"my mother has dementia, she's had it for probably 10 years now. i feel troubled, extremely troubled by it. two years ago my father said please come home, i'm not sure how long your mother has while she is still together. so i've been coming home every 6 months for a month or so to spend time and her deterioration is slow but noticeable. now i'm heading back to where i'm currently living and my mother's mind is very scattered. it's infuriating to me. i'm trying, i'm trying to be tolerant of the same four questions every day, every 10 minutes. but i snap and i bark and i get surly and i feel terrible about it. i don't feel like i am the good son. almost a 50-year-old son. she thinks i'm a woman sometimes, doesn't realize that i'm her son, thinks my father is a friend and she sees children in the house and her mother. so she's hallucinating now (maybe it's her meds causing it). her short-term memory is completely gone i would say at this point and when my dad asks her to make dinner salads she'll ask you 10 or 12 times how many people for dinner,  how many people for dinner? and then she'll still make four when there's only three people. i'm not sure why my father hasn't gotten help for her yet. my brother and i ask all the time if he's going to do something and sometimes he says ""well you know i will try"" and then nothing happens. i think he's just trying to handle it himself to keep the cost down and i get it as medical care is obscenely expensive in america. but i'm leaving tomorrow and i just came home by myself for a little bit, they went off to do something and i was just reading over some papers and on the counter i saw this note that was left by my mom and it says her  'name' with 'medicine- vitamins-?' below that 'please help me'. i was  wowed and saddened. she's frightened, she knows there's something wrong but she can't fix it. we can't fix it. the doctors can't fix it. what do we do? how do we comfort her? i take her on walks just to get her out of my dad's hair because she'll ask him the same four questions all afternoon. and i think he's appreciative of down time. it's so frustrating and very sad for the situation. i know it won't end well."," i'm in a similar situation. i try not to give her information any earlier than necessary but sometimes she knows what's coming up and it stresses her out. then we are in for an endless round of the same questions. when is your brother coming? do we know what we're having for dinner? do we have everything or do we need to go to the store? what day is he coming? do we know what time? etc.she's used to being the responsible one, but she can't be any more. she knows on some level she can't handle it, so she struggles to get her head around it. alas, she does this by asking questions, and there's almost no gap before the circle repeats. it is so tough, especially since she installed the buttons she is pressing with her ""nagging.""my dad won't do anything either. i am now urging him to get her into day care at the local memory care facility. some activities and a change of scenery for her, and some respite for him so he can get stuff done. he has vetoed assistance of every other kind except housecleaning. and they have the money for just about anything. sigh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ofqqey/the_same_4_things/,The same 4 things

"**tl;dr:  75 year old parent with short term memory loss is constantly wearing our patience thin and causing us to lose sleep and a bit of our own sanity.  need advice for next steps.**for the last decade we have shared our home with my 75 year old mother in law. she is blind in one eye (glaucoma i think) and takes prescription eyedrops.   she also takes cholesterol and blood pressure medicine.    she is also diabetic.unsurprisingly, she has been increasingly forgetful over recent years.   often bringing up the same gossipy topics at dinner time that we often don’t care to hear again -- not even the first time.  her vision required a family member to take her wherever.   but around the house she had been relatively independent.    cooked her own meals, sometimes for us as well.   generally ate what we ate as long as it wasn’t too spicy or salty or whatever.when she feels a headache, she instinctually self-checks her bp (digital tabletop omron) so a few weeks ago she caught a 200-over-something reading and she was taken to the er.   there they found her sodium levels were very low.  so she spent a week in the hospital.  and the whole time she was calling my wife’s home literally every hour.  “they haven’t fed me.”  (yes they did.)   “what pills do i take?” (the hospital is giving them to you.)  they had to put a “safety nurse” in her room to keep her from getting out of bed unnecessarily and escorting her to the bathroom.  after sodium iv’s and pills, eventually her sodium got back to normal and a week later she was discharged but transferred to a physical therapy place to work on her walk -- which over the years has been more of a shuffle, i assume due to her decreasing eye sight.  but not even 2 days into what was going to be a multi-week stay at the facility, she was frustrated at not being fed (she was) and not getting her medicines (she was).    she exercised her “patient’s rights” and basically checked herself out.  my wife picked up her up the next day. it’s been a living hell at home ever since.every morning we now give some of her pills and eye drops because we don’t want her to self-administer multiple times due to her memory.   then we give her the others in the evening.   and throughout the day she will call (her room is on the other end of the home -- by design)  or she’ll come upstairs (to our bedroom/home office) and ask “where are my pills?”  “we gave them to you this morning” “are you sure? because i feel like i haven’t taken them.  why don’t you say while i’m taking them ‘mom, here is this pill, that pill, etc’”     “that’s exactly what we do.”  sometimes it ends there.  other times it ramps up:   “well i don’t think you are giving them to me…why are you holding my medicine? i don’t want a stroke.  i don’t want to go blind.  give them to me.  you’re killing me.  don’t make me call the police.  you can’t do this to me...”   last week she went to her pcp for a post-hospital follow-up and they did a basic memory test.  something to the effect of “can you recall the three words you were asked to  remember earlier?” to which she then asked my wife who took her to the appointment, “what words? was i supposed to remember?”   so the pcp prescribed donepezil and vitamin e pills, and we are praying they actually do something.  though from what i’ve read, even if it does, it doesn’t help much after a year or two.  and everyone’s experience here seems to vary wildly.on reading this to myself, i admit it comes off like we are simply tired of bearing her burdens and are horrible children/in-laws.   we do our best to put ourselves in her shoes -- being a generation older, once in charge of our lives, then suddenly told that our perception of the truth (i.e. not being given medicine) is wrong.  but being berated exacts a toll on us as well.  even just having to repeat for literally the 50th time in a day that “yes, you took your pills and eyedrops, yes we know you don’t remember this is why you write it down.  what paper?  the paper by the whiteboard where we list all your medicines.  no you cannot keep your pill bottles. because you can’t remember anything and you might keep taking them.”  my wife recently had a baby which was already a strain.  ironically having the in-law live with us was a boon at first, but now she is basically one more child to contend with, and frankly more difficult than any of the real children we have.  my own grandmother developed alzheimers late in her life, and i saw the toll it had on her, my mother, and her siblings and their families.   so as much i feel a prisoner in the present, i dread the future of escorting her to her bathroom, keeping her from eating napkins at the dinner table, and having to (re) child-proof all the entryways into the home.  we were looking forward to welcoming a new pet (or even another child) to the family at some point, but that feels like a distant dream now with our plate of responsibility.financially, the in-law has retirement savings, my late father in-law’s pension, and presumably a very good health insurance plan.  my wife and i know very little of the other programs (medicaid? medicare? social security?) to understand how that would help with future care.i desperately want a return to sanity -- for all of us.  i want to work at home without getting “triggered” when i hear the in-law dialing the cordless phone because 99 times out of 100 she’s going to call us to ask about her medicine.     i want to relax at night and not be triggered by the lights in the hallway coming on because i know she’s going to beg for her pills that she doesn’t remember we gave her hours ago and threaten to call the police if we don’t hand the pill bottle over. for the first time since covid started, i actually want to leave my house to work in a cube and bear all the annoyances of office life instead of working from the comfort of my home -- just to not hear this broken record chipping away at my own sanity.   but that’s not fair to my wife who will now have two babies to tend to.i recognize this is my wife’s mother we’re talking about.  and my wife deserves a lot of credit for putting up with the bulk of the in-law’s repeated questions, criticisms, and lapses.   but she will go back to her own work and career soon once maternity is over.  and while she’s also work-from-home due to covid, it’s bound to revert to the old fashioned office sooner or later, and then who will care for her mother and listen to her fret every 15 minutes over pills she doesn’t remember already taking.police threats aside, this past winter  she almost blew up our house (with my pregnant wife inside) by not closing one of the gas stove top  burners completely.   thank goodness for that rotten egg smell they put in it and that i came home in time to catch it.  my wife didn’t even smell it upstairs.    we’ve since installed a natural gas leak detector.  and then there are the recurring issues.  misplacing her eye glasses, her egg timer, her necklace (why did it move from her jewelry box in the first place? she rarely goes anywhere since covid.  we would find pools of water inside pots and pans in the cupboard that we know she “washed.”like all in-laws she also has a penchant for telling us how to parent and being horribly out of date with all the latest best-practices (on her back, not her belly.   no water, only milk/formula).  and while she’s stubborn about that, her new “mindset” if you will is the last straw, even if it’s not her fault.  many of her other faults i chalk up to just being a product of a different time.  but under it all was/is this thoughtful, kind, generous woman.  and while she’s in arguably an early phase (she has not seen a specialist to get an official diagnosis) my wife and i and other family agree that a memory care facility seems to be a logical next step.my wife has had the “nursing home” talk with her, and she of course is hesitant.  after all, during the day when she’s not pestering us about things she forgot 5 minutes ago, she can still talk on the phone with her few friends/family, operate her tv, etc.  she will proudly pass our pop quiz about who she talked to 5 minutes ago, but not remember what medicines she takes and when.    instead the in-law insists on bringing someone in to help in the house.  but that seems pointless and besides the point.  it will be a replay of the hospital/therapy situation where she thinks this person is withholding her food or medicine, and she’ll just blow up our cell phones anyway.  especially if that person comes in, does their thing, then leaves to care for the next client.  and it won’t do anything for her nighttime trips upstairs, begging for medicine, threats to call the police, etc.i’m reaching out to this community for suggestions, resources, next steps.   she goes back for a follow-up with the pcp to see if those memory pills helped.  but that’s a long 4 weeks from now.  we are trying to get a visit w/ a neurologist sooner than that.   my in-law’s sister’s family (in another state) has offered to have her stay for a couple weeks, but even that is a long two weeks away and is just a temporary reprieve.  i don’t know what else to do. i wish we could take the in-law to the hospital and say this time don’t send her home til her mind is whole again, but we can’t.   or take the in-law to a nursing home against her wishes, but we can’t.  we’re trapped in this living hell.i hope this was readable.   honestly, i feel like we all need help now, and at least i get to vent to an audience that can perhaps relate.   i guess we’re specifically interested in how to cope with this, who else to talk to, how to pay for memory care (if that’s the right place for her to be), etc.thanks for reading and thanks in advance for your help.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ofoz10/vent_75_year_old_livein_motherinlaw_has_lost_her/,"[VENT] 75 year old live-in mother-in-law has lost her short term memory and it is destroying my home, work, and family life.

"hello all, i’m new here and this is my first post so excuse me if i break any rules unintentionally. i am writing because i need both to vent and some advice/support. my adoptive mother is now 91 and has been declining since 2018. i am only in my 30s so this prolonged mourning process has been somewhat difficult on me to say the least. at any rate, my mother’s cognitive impairment/dementia is very difficult at times. she is staying with me right now because my sister (in her 70s) was going out of town with her family for the holiday and desperately needed a break. i really don’t mind my mom because a lot of her behaviors are amplified versions of who she has always been. she has always kind of been selfish, paranoid, and somewhat cruel in her language to some extent. she does have her positive traits as well, but it’s something that you learn as an adult to either accept of the person or not and love them despite their negative traits. i’ve finally learned to cope with not taking her vitriol to heart, but last night, she said some mildly homophobic things to my partner and i. (we’re queer.) we are also getting married in august and after last night my partner doesn’t want my mom at the wedding. i also don’t truly want her at the wedding either but for different reasons: she has never expressed excitement or joy at the fact that we’re getting married, she reacted when i first came out to her 15 years ago, she’s always been against “gay marriage”, and lastly and selfishly, i don’t want her to come for the wedding because i don’t want to have to take care of her or stress over her on my wedding weekend. my partner was extremely hurt by her last night because she doesn’t have the same love/empathy/patience i have for my mother—which i do understand why. my mother has hit her before and has done some terrible things to us as a result of her illness. as i write this, i realize that it sounds like i’ve made my decision about her being at the wedding and i felt like i have, but there is a lingering fear/sadness/guilt inside me that i will irreparably harm our relationship if she’s not at the wedding. and that i will regret her not being there after she’s passed. i also don’t want to feel the shame from my family who is coming to my wedding about not having her there. what can i do to explain to everyone involved my reasoning? how can i explain to my partner that it’s not worth confronting my mother over the things she said?", i would think that a wedding may be a confusing event for someone with dementia. confusing events would likely bring out the worst in her and make for a very unpleasant time for her and everyone around her. congratulations on your upcoming marriage!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ofl4cb/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,I don’t know what to do

"i am a long time lurker, but first time poster. i have no idea if this is allowed here, i need advice on how to approach my mom and brother concerning my dad who has apparent dementia, but is undiagnosed. my dad’s cognitive state has been in decline for some time now and i live three states away and each time i see him, he is getting worse. my mom is unsympathetic and has very little patience. my dad has been semi-retired for about 10 years, and my mom just recently retired within the last month. now that they’re both retired full time, it’s painfully obvious that my dad has seriously declined now that he has someone around to observe him more hours of the day. they somehow made a cross country drive to visit me here in colorado from arkansas. i have no idea how they made it out here because my dad typically does the driving and my mom has to be the navigator. my mom has reported that his driving is erratic, and she had to remind him multiple times of where to turn. they will be staying here for three weeks. just in the last week, my dad has gotten lost in my small rural community and had to ask for directions to find my apartment even though i live just down the street from their hotel. he has no idea which direction the major cities are from our location. as a result, i’m genuinely concerned about how they will get back to arkansas on their own and my 17 year old daughter is going with them for the return trip to stay with them for two weeks before flying back to colorado in august. she knows the way as she’s taken the trip with me multiple times, but it’s unrealistic to entrust her with getting them back to arkansas on her own. other concerns include:1. he frequently talks to himself with full blown loud vocal conversations. 2. he will completely forget a conversation from just 15 minutes prior. 3. has a lack of self-awareness (he tried to give a partially earn hamburger to my neighbor’s dog until i told him no).4. he has difficulty comprehending complex conversations and scheduled road closures. 5. he forgets important dates and often enters them incorrectly on his phone. 6. he forgets common information such as how wifi and cellular data and hot spots work when he previously understood how this works7. his conversations are very circular in which he will ask the same questions that have been previously answered. 8. he acts very childish at times such as trying to randomly pick a fight with me over the dumbest things and will latch on to it until he “wins the argument.”9. i seriously think he’s functioning on a level of about a 10-13 year old. 10. he has difficulty getting around and refuses to take care of his health. he shuffles around like a penguin when he walks. 11. when my daughter got upset, she excused herself to her room to cool off, my mom and i had to explain to him that she went to her room and he had no recollection of this. 12. he frequently gets choked on his food which signals swallowing concerns that can be deadly. we have had a previous incident in our family in which my maternal grandfather confused the gas pedal for the break pedal and drove into a building killing an infant a few years ago and looking back on that we realized we should have taken the keys from my grandfather at least a year or more before this happened. i am scared that we could be setting ourselves up for another incident like this with my dad if we don’t take some action soon. does anyone here have any advice on how to approach this subject with my family? i foresee that we will need to have a serious conversation about this within the next few months where my dad can checked out by a medical doctor to get an official diagnosis, and to eventually take his drivers license away before someone gets killed. this is hard for me because my mom is unsympathetic and my brother doesn’t seem to want to get involved. my relationship with my parents is testy at best. long-term care isn’t an option due to my parents finances and doing so would likely mean selling my parents land and house to afford a nursing home. as quickly as my dad is declining, i suspect that he will need around the clock care within the next 3-5 years."," can you say a little more about how your mom is unsympathetic?  i get the impatient part and how she may feel like your dad is ""putting on an act"" or that dementia isn't that big of a deal.  do you think she has a true understanding of the implications of his illness if, in fact, he does have dementia (and ianad, but what you describe does not sound like normal aging and should be checked out).  i ask these things because i have found many people don't really ""get"" the way dementia affects the brain, or they are in denial about it's severity.i would start from a place of gathering information.... has she or he verbalized noticing these changes?  how do they feel about it? i would have something on hand that you can reference and say ""i came across this article and i wonder if you've noticed anything like this?"". then just as you have already offered them help to get home, offer to help figure things out should they learn he is becoming incapacitated.  the are lots of options before you get to nursing home, but your mom will really be the gatekeeper there.  above all, try to show patience and acceptance, even if you have a rocky relationship.  it's hard for parents to feel treated like a kid by their kid.  i have found my parents to be much more open when i offer support without demanding they change this or that.  they want to stay independent and they will only fight back if they feel criticized or bosses around.  thinking of you and your parents.  they are fortunate that you care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/of074a/first_time_poster_need_advice_on_how_to_approach/,First time poster; need advice on how to approach mom concerning dad with undiagnosed but apparent dementia.

"my mother has mild dementia, though i think it's beginning to gain traction. she's been battling some health stuff lately, so i'm home and staying with her for a few weeks to lend a hand. something that i've noticed over the past few years is how she'll go from one room to another to another as she's getting ready for the day. my husband was the first to point out this non-linear behavior. she was kind of always like this, so i didn't take much notice, but i've seen it get worse as she battles the onset of this disease. this has never been more apparent than during the past few weeks while staying with her. she finds it very difficult to get herself to bed at night. she'll shuffle back and forth from her bedroom to the bathroom to the kitchen doing godknowswhat. sometimes i'll fall asleep and hear her moving about in her bedroom and go to check and she'll just be on the other side of her bed looking at something. this bedtime routine can take hours.last night she was moving around quite a bit and i suggested she go to bed. she said she was and did go into her bedroom and then 2 minutes later, came out and stood in the living room where i was preparing to fall asleep. i said, ""i thought you were going to bed."" she said, she was, but wondered when i was leaving in the morning. i had to remind her that i wasn't, that i was still here for a few weeks. her head is just so overloaded all the time. is anyone familiar with these kinds of habits? is there a way to help her to bed a little easier?"," ohh, sounds similar to sundowning, but later.  my mum often does same - before bedtime, it can go on for hours.  back n forth -- checking doors & windows are locked, kitchen cooker / oven is off, porch light is off, kitty is inside, if the bins need to be kerbside in the morning, etc... sometimes she'll decide to sweep the floors at 10pm, or do some chores... she'll finally go to get into bed, only to come back out & do it all again.   i try confirm to her - ""mum, the doors locked the oven is off the kitty is inside, let's just go to bed!""    yeh, sometimes it's difficult to get her to just go to bed.  sometimes i've had success by going into her room while she's by the bed, & giving her a ""look at this great <whatever novel> i found for you, it's perfect for reading in bed, here, get cozy & have a look"".  i turn off the overhead light put on the less bright bed-side light - sometimes it works & she'll get into bed, distracted by the book. sometimes just telling her ""we'll go to the park / the cinema / whatever tomorrow, let's get a good sleep in"" works to distract her.   otherwise, just got to let her do her thing.  i noticed though, that my mum is more likely to do that back&forth before bed when she's unsure about eg something happening or not the next day - i often write a clearly legible concise note for her, either on kitchen counter or her bedside table (or both).   that significantly decreases her seemingly aimless wandering back & forth.   eg ""supermarket shopping & cafe lunch tomorrow morning 10 a.m.""    ""gardener coming at 2pm tomorrow/wednesday""     i also sometimes put note on kitchen counter in the morning, if somethings happening later on.  just so she can easily see it & keep herself in the loop. i think, you ought to write a clear note for her, ""meligonia staying for another 3 weeks until july 20""  and mark it clearly on the calendar, and/or put a note on the fridge or where-ever. notes work great for my mum - then she's not in that space of knowing she's not remembering whats going on & having the feeling she's lost & confused.   best of luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oeqvkg/mother_roams_at_night/,Mother Roams at Night

hello! recently my grandpa moved in with us on hospice. he has other health issues but his alzheimer’s is really really bad. this is the third day and each day has gotten worse. i am 21 and in school and i have to him help a lot. tonight he told me if he dies it’s my fault. i’ve been reading much of the sub and wanted advice. what do i do with him when he’s super confused? he needs help doing things i can’t leave him alone but he’s a real s.o.b sometimes. thank you," as much as you can, try to let it slide off you like water off a duck's back. i know it's easier said than done, because their behavior is incredibly crazy and frustrating, but you can't argue with them (they're in their own reality and you can't make them join yours no matter how hard you try) or reason with them (their brains are too damaged to string two coherent thoughts together) so all you can do is distract, redirect, and kind of go with the flow. i swear, a lot of dealing with dementia is like doing improv - they say something nuts and you have to figure out how to roll with it. if he asks where someone is who's been dead for 20 years, for example, don't tell him they died, just tell him they stepped out. (keep your therapeutic lies vague and simple, though. anything complicated just confuses them more.)  do you have other family there to help out? i really hope so. if you're not his primary caregiver and just need to watch him to give the other caregivers a break, just try to be there with him, roll with the crazy, and then when you're done you can go outside and scream at the sky for a while. you could also ask the hospice staff for advice, or watch how they handle him and try to imitate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/oeljx6/grandpa_moved_in_with_us_on_hospice/,Grandpa moved in with us on hospice

"i'm posting this 10% to vent, 90% for advice.  and i have a habit of analyzing things from a cool, calculating perspective......but don't let that make you think i don't love my father.  i think in this calculating way to keep myself from breaking down and crying.i feel like my father is --this-- close to being shipped off to a nursing home.  on the one hand, i feel that it will be necessary, but on the other hand, it seems like such a waste, since he is still able to enjoy many parts of his life.  maybe there's some better way.a little background:  dad and i are basically best friends.  we've always spent multiple days per week together (even while living an hour's drive apart), and we've always had similar interests and wanted to do the same things together.he is 81, has some physical health issues but they seem to all be under control.  i know these things are hard to predict, but i expect his brain to (further) fail before his body does.  and.......i hate to hear myself say this......i think it would be for the best if somehow his body could fail before his mind fully tortures him.in my non-professional opinion, his dementia is at state 6.  he knows who his family members are, most of the time.....except when it's night.  he can bathe, dress, and eat, with careful supervision.  he cannot cook, clean, or manage his finances in any way.he has a long-term live-in girlfriend who has now become his primary caretaker by default.  she is cold and unkind, and is never willing to have a discussion about her way of doing things......but on the other hand, her way is the right way about 90% of the time, which is pretty good.  she takes him to all of his doctor's appointments, follows (most of) the doctors' recommendations, and takes care of both his house (cleaning, gardening, light maintenance) as well as all of his basic needs (food, bathing, laundry).  she manages his money and keeps the bills paid and the house stocked with groceries.  by day, dad and i can get in the car and go for long rides, and while we don't do all the things we used to do (he gets bad anxiety in large retail environments, always feels cold outside even if it's slightly chilly), we're still able to do quite a lot-----we spend a lot of time driving around in the car, he can handle small, simple, quiet restaurants, he can handle a quick trip to a convenience store if i need to buy a thing or two.  he can carry on a simple, pleasant conversation with waitstaff and gas station clerks (most of the time).by night, he's someone else.  he gets out of bed to urinate every ten minutes non-stop for several hours, often getting confused in the bathroom and needing help.  then he sleeps for a couple of hours or so.  then he gets up and wanders around the house, slamming doors and yelling, says the most cruel, irrational and nasty things you can imagine (his great vocabulary and wit have stayed with him, for better or worse), and makes threats.  at night, he suddenly refers to his girlfriend as ""the staff"" and thinks she's there to work for him in some way.he hasn't quite fully attacked his girlfriend yet, but it's gotten pretty close.  he's threatened to kill her.  he's shoved and bruised her.  she's terrified of him at night.  since he only sleeps for a couple of hours per night, that's all the sleep she's been getting as well.  this is obviously an unsustainable situation that needs to stop before it gets worse.i just spent one with with him, day and night, and can confirm that everything the girlfriend says is true.the girlfriend said that it's probably time for me to find a home for him, and sadly, i agree.by day, he doesn't remember any of the things at night.  when he's told what he did, he feels terrible about it, and says ""what the hell is happening to me? i must be losing my mind"" and makes it very clear that he doesn't want to hurt anyone, and is terrified at the possibility of hurting and/or losing his girlfriend.  he's too wealthy to get medicaid, but very likely too poor to afford in-home care for very long.  he has a little money in the bank (somewhere in the tens of thousands), but long ago put his girlfriend's name on his bank account.  (which means she has the full legal right to drain the account for herself if she wants.)   his main asset is his paid-for house.  i suppose it's likely the house will have to be sold off to pay for his care.i feel i will have to go to the courts to get control of my father and his affairs. his girlfriend will certainly feel insulted and offended, and there's a good chance that will drive her away entirely. while that will be her choice and not mine, i'll feel bad if my father loses her.  tldr version:  \--dad is a mostly functional human being by day  \--dad is so dysfunctional at night that he's a danger to himself and others, especially his smaller-than-him, also-old girlfriend. and he doesn't sleep at night so she can't sleep either\--while i'm no doctor, i believe the medical options to get him to sleep at night have already been exhausted\--i don't think he can afford an all-night caregiver at home, at least not for long, and even if he can, his girlfriend will find something not to like and will cause problems\--it seems like such a cruel thing to take a man who's fairly manageable for 2/3 of the day, and toss him in the nursing home because he's a monster for 1/3 of the day\--while i have a flexible schedule, i'm only able to spend about 10-15 hours per week with him, maybe even double that but not much more\--i wonder if there's some kind ""adult night care"" place instead of adult day care. i've looked at adult day care and he can probably afford it, but all that would do is give his girlfriend a break to nap and clean up the house. he'd still be a threat at night"," i realize you don't have a lot of control over the medical decisions here, but this sounds like some combination of sundowning, bladder issues, and maybe him having difficulty distinguishing between dreams and reality.meds: melatonin is a great start. thc-free cbd may also help keep him calm. i've seen and heard of good results with atypical antipsychotics like seroquel and clozapine. but see if you can persuade his gf to try the ""small guns"" approach of giving him melatonin and/or cbd. they tend to be well tolerated with minimal side effects, and both i (with my dad) and other folks in my support groups have improved the night time restlessness with those.other: has he been to a urologist or even his gp to make sure he's emptying his bladder completely when he urinates? urinary retention isn't uncommon in these situations and can lead to lots of waking up at night.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/odr8hn/father_is_mostly_ok_by_day_but_an_aggressive/,"Father is mostly OK by day, but an aggressive terror at night"
"all stories welcome my dads stil somewhat ""there"" at 66 but requires assistance with basically everything get lost in our house can't find a place to sit without lots of directions any feedback is nice just feel like chatting"," you're not alone, its a big decision we were recently forced to take. :( my grandmother's sundowning has officially reached the point where she risks killing or severely injuring herself each night. just 2 months ago, she nearly pulled down a glass shower enclosure onto herself at 3 am, when she got confused and couldn't figure out how to get inside.  we then decided to lock the door to her ensuite at night, and restricted her to the bedside commode only. a few weeks later, she got out of bed to rummage in her drawers as is customary. the next morning her entire forehead was black and blue. after reviewing footage from her bedroom camera, we saw she'd repeatedly smashed her face into her nightside table while reaching for items in a lower drawer... then a few nights ago at 3 am, she tried to rip the commode out of the floor (anchored for her safety). we heard a loud crash and ran to her room only to find her on her back. again, upon reviewing footage we saw that she'd braced against her walker while pulling on the commode..she and the walker went flying across the room when the brake mechanism failed, and the back of her head bounced twice on the floor as she landed... currently we're monitoring her for a subdural hematoma as we work to get her placed in ltc.on all 3 recent occasions my mom had fallen asleep, and therefore didn't hear anything until it was too late. she's having an extremely hard time processing this, but i reminded her only a machine is capable of working fulltime and staying awake 12 hours per night to ensure grandma doesn't somehow kill herself. to expect that of herself is madness. can't think of any way to keep her safe, short of tying her to the bed at night, which is both cruel and illegal. we honestly tried for as long as we could, including ramping up our home to the max. we added gates by the staircase, which progressed to locking her bedroom at night bc she'd try to access the stair lift and fall.. we installed locks at the top of every exterior door because she constantly attempts to wander outside during the day. we closed off kitchen access with a wall + door because she dropped and managed to embed a knife into her foot last year (also b/c the psw who bathes her every morning constantly found knives/other sharp implements she would hide in her room to cut fabric and saw at wires/plugs). during the day she's relatively sweet and manageable, and since i've been doing online courses for the past year, i typically spend 9-5 taking care/interacting with her, then study after dinner until bedtime. the problem is that we just can't find a way to keep her safe at night, as her behaviour gets progressively more and more outlandish. she only sleeps from 9pm-1 am on average, then she will rummage and attempts to wander the house until 6 am. currently our 3 bedrooms upstairs are vacant as at least 1-2 times a week, she'll rant/scream all night (mom can't get her to stop). my dad, sister and i all sleep in the basement bedrooms so we can study/go to work. my mom probably hasn't slept a night through for the past 2 years and it shows, she has so many white hairs now that she didn't before. we really tried, but it just doesn't make any sense for us or any of our extended family to take care of her anymore. prior to this she was staying with my uncle, who similarly threw in the towel after 3 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/odpoxh/when_is_it_time_to_send_your_parent_to_a_home/,When is it time to send your parent to a home?

"hi everyone, i'll try to make this as brief as i can, and apologies if the problems stated here don't exactly have to do with dementia alone; but as many of you probably can relate to, his relationship with us (me and my sister) is complicated and it's hard to trace the threads.i am 37, my dad is 64 (65 in october). when he was 18, he adolescently tried to race a train and lost, resulting in a tbi that is now manifesting as early-onset dementia. this was only recently diagnosed, though, and all my life he was a slow thinker, borderline illiterate, not ""stupid"" (he could design, build, and fix things brilliantly but his mom had taken him out of school at 16 to work and i think that seriously set him back), but shy, maybe anxious, and a man of few words. and, importantly, largely absent in our upbringing.both my mom and he are alcoholics, which is another topic for another sub, but importantly my dad was largely just not around when i was growing up, even though my parents didn't divorce until i was in my 20s. he worked a lot i think (various kinds of construction but mainly putting in pools), but he was also out in the garage drinking with his buddies, out fishing, or god knows where else. starting in my early adolescence, furthermore, he basically moved into the basement (the stated reason was that the waterbed he shared with my mom upstairs was bad for his back and she refused to get rid of it, though i was never quite convinced by this) and from then on he was barely more than a housemate, or some distant uncle who'd weaseled his way into a basement apartment.so we grew up being used to not having him around, not expecting communication or support from him, and basically operating as a one-parent family. now, he seems to have clued in belatedly to some of this, and seems to want to ask me if/why my sister hates him. i don't think she does, and nor do i, but we definitely don't have much affection for him; my primary emotion about him is pity. and, i know that if he wants to know how she feels he should just ask her instead of me (though he is right in saying that she and i are close enough for me to basically know her pov).he went to a 3-month in-patient rehab two years ago after some kind of alcoholic episode (his dementia diagnosis must have been around this time too), and since then i think he might be realizing that it's likely to be all downhill from here. my perspective, and my sister's, is that we basically don't want any more than the bare minimum to do with him. we don't want to see him dead or in the streets; but taking over his finances, making decisions for him is not something i want to do, or my sister. i feel like we're going to end up doing it anyway because we're good, compassionate people. but i don't think it's going to remedy our negative feelings toward him. so what am i asking here... solidarity, i guess? advice, maybe, but if you're going to tell me ""swallow your pride and bury the hatchet before he can't any more"" i don't think that's going to work for me. i'm the furthest thing possible from a proponent of 12-step, but until he makes an effort to make amends with us regarding the effect his alcoholism had on us, my wall isn't coming down. any similar experiences? similar choices, regrets, validations? i expect that there will be less and less cohesiveness and stability in his discourse with time, and since phone calls with him are already torturously anxiety-inducing for both him and me, i don't expect to want to increase communication with him. we don't understand each other, we don't communicate on the same level, i doubt he has the emotional intelligence to really name his emotions (something i had to learn as an adult because we were so goddamn repressed at home), let alone express them.is it possible to have an ""arm's-length"" relationship with an absentee parent declining into dementia? or am i fooling myself into thinking there's anything but all-or-nothing, that i either just cut him out or dive into power of attorney?thank you for reading, again sorry if not enough of this is directly to do with dementia but i hope there are others who can identify with my experience."," my dad wasn’t absent growing up, but to make a very long story short… he battled alcoholism and it won and eventually ended up in nursing home. he did some really terrible things to us - not like sexual abuse terrible but he was just a terrible parent as a teen and in out early 20’s any way….what i’m getting at is he has spent the last 20 year in nursing 5 different nursing homes and the first 4 years i didn’t visit him. neither did any of his 8 kids. but at some point you realize (especially for me - when you become a parent) all the sacrifices he had made for me in my childhood, that he was a good man a one point and still is but booze got the best of him. so i guess my point is, at some point you will realize you might want to “bury the hatchet” because he’s your dad… but i base that off of my dad who sucked terribly but i still love him when i get to the bottom of all of the bullshit. good luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ocwv4d/dad_was_absent_most_of_my_upbringing_now_dementia/,Dad was absent most of my upbringing; now dementia is starting

"hospice started doing weekly check-ins with my gran this past week. afterwards she was furious. she told my aunt that we (the family) must stop thinking she is dying; she is still cleaning her house, and cooking every night. (she does not. someone comes in twice weekly to clean her house, and her boyfriend cooks for them.)in a way this is more a philosophical issue… my grandmother is (was?) a very intelligent woman who thought deeply about life and death. she also had major depression in her earlier years (she is still on an antidepressant). these days she barely believes in death. perhaps that is self-protective? she clearly doesn’t want to know that she is dying (she recovered from cancer twice), so perhaps it is best for her to continue being happy and believing that she is capable and strong?"," if she is taken care of i don't see what the problem is. you might want to continue the check-ins but ask that the people pretend to be from another type of agency like senior services or a church if that would make her feel better. if the boyfriend is the main cartaker, talk with him and see what support he needs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ocv7lm/my_grandma_believes_she_is_okay/,My grandma believes she is okay

"my mil was diagnosed as having what they believe is a mild cognitive impairment / early dementia. she scored a 20/30 on the moca. however, last year her symptoms were out of control. personality changes, suicidal ideations, lying, wandering, and what we thought were psychiatric symptoms since she is 60 years old. her father did have alzheimer’s. regardless her symptoms were so out of control we (her kids/spouses) admitted her to the hospital and after being there for 2 weeks, they found infarcts (mini strokes) on her mri as well as more dementia like behavior that was creating such behavioral concerns. since then, she is on an abilify (anti-psychotic) and an antidepressant and definitely is better although not nearly her old self. seems to cognitively went downhill since her memory isn’t great now and has this urge always to move and cannot sit still which is probably from the meds. she is definitely a lot calmer though and seems a little more lucid.anyway my dilemma: my husband and i are having a baby. she keeps saying she wants to babysit and does babysit my nephew (his parents however live in the same building as her) and he is 5 years old. i don’t know if someone with a mci is supposed to really watch a baby on their own or if i’m comfortable with it. i will probably ask her doctor but i was curious how people dealt with this or if they had any experience with this. i feel sad because i know she’ll never really know my children the way she would have and my husband is really upset about what has happened. it’s also to me at least not clear exactly what this is. it’s not full on dementia but something hasn’t been right for years and it doesn’t seem purely psychological but they haven’t given her drugs for the impairment."," unfortunately not. it is not safe for a patient with dementia to be left alone, and leaving her alone with the baby would be setting her up for failure. i would only allow supervised visits for both herself and your children's safety. that be like leaving a toddler alone with a baby. my grandma will switch from sweet and loving to hitting and screaming faster than i can dodge, you just never know when their personality will switch and it's not fair to subject a growing mind to that stress. i'm glad you asked this question, it's totally normal to be worried, or even feel like you're causing your mil to miss out. just know you aren't the reason, she isn't the reason, it's the illness. dementia is a terminal illness, remember she is extremely sick and just can't handle the responsibility of children. sit next to her on the couch with your baby, see if she wants to hold them, maybe put on a movie you've already seen and supervise until she gets distracted/bored and you can safely take baby back. just be extra careful she can't wander into babies room at night. my grandma does the wildest shit at night so we started locking her in her bedroom while she sleeps (her adult daughter sleeps in the same room so it's safe and legal for us to do so). good luck. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ocokox/mother_in_law_babysitting/,Mother in Law babysitting…

(i’m not a doctor or a social worker, but i do have experience with non-clinical work)here’s one way you can deal with something like this:1-lie. i know. it stinks. but “therapeutic lying” allows you to skim over the things that will make your papa sad and get back to what makes him (and you) happy:  he loves you so much!  you love him so much!   to use your post as an example...papa: huh?  i thought i was your father, not your grandfather!you: oops. my mistake! you’re right!(now quickly divert his attention to something that will make him feel loved!you: that’s a nice class ring you’re wearing. what subject would you enjoy teaching to kids if you were a teacher? 2-cut out details, because details can make people with dementia feel overwhelmed. 3-direct the conversation around his feelings.  why? because they don’t involve him trying to remember something. they also allow you both to have an enjoyable, meaningful conversation. (see above?  you asked him what he would enjoy teaching. this doesn’t require him to remember anything. this meets him exactly where he is. maybe he plays the piano, and he’ll tell you he’d enjoy teaching music. now you can smile, give him a hug, and tell him how much you love his music.)4-if you’re out, away from home, ask him his opinions. “papa, which car do you think is a better car—that one there, or the one next to it?”  in a museum?  “do you think you’d be good at painting, papa?”  at a restaurant? “wow, she’s got an octopus tattoo. what’s your opinion on tattoos, papa?”i know how scary and sad this can be, and i’m sorry this is happening.  i do think you can continue to have a meaningful and loving relationship with your papa if you can learn some of these tricks. you may even get to know him better!   my grandparents are deceased, and i have no idea what either of them thinks about tattoos!   maybe you could write down a bunch of things you dont know about your papa and start weaving those questions into your conversations. one more suggestion: find some good (free) online classes to help you navigate this. caringkind has some great ones. feel free to dm me or reply on here with any more thoughts or questions. sending you a hug!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ocmk59/my_papa_is_starting_to_forget_us/,My Papa is starting to forget us.

"my gran has always (and will always) be my best friend. i’m unsure about how far along she is with her dementia, but it seems to be spiraling quickly now. she is a tiny lady, and my grandad fell on her last year. this resulted in a broken leg that just won’t fully heal. because of this she has had to use a walker, but is quite stubborn about using it. my greatest concern is- i want to know the best way to react to her memory loss and her being confused about where she is and what day it is. my gran has a history with the excessive alcohol consumption (she always kept this a secret). a few months ago i found that there were several bottles of hard liquor that had her lipstick on the lid. she has been taken to bed several times for being too intoxicated (sometimes even as early as 6am).thus, her live in carers removed all the alcohol. this throws her into a type of withdrawal which i think makes her memory worse, and her behavior more aggressive.we recently had to move her and my grandad into the frail care facility. she has woken up every morning at 5am and calls about 16 times before lunch time- terrified- unsure about where she is. recently she thinks she is alone in the train station and calls crying not knowing which train to take. yet, she is in her room. 💔my grandad has severe parkinson’s and is paralyzed, struggling to talk. but recently he was moved to another room because he said my gran keeps waking up in the middle of the night and slapping his face. the facility nurse said “i don’t know what is wrong with your gran”. how can a matron say this at an old age cate facility? it’s so so sad, it’s dementia! to make matters worse, the carers in this care facility scream at her (i’ve heard them shout at her to “shut up and get in the shower” and “you’re an alcoholic” etc.) when i have tried to address it i am told she is rude so what do we expect from the carers. 😢 i just think they possibly don’t fully know how to deal with her dementia. but the verbal abuse toward her has been mentioned by other people that have heard them shouting at her. since my gran was moved to another room, she is worse. she keeps thinking my grandad has left her or died. it’s so traumatic for her. my beautiful, precious gran :( this breaks my heart because she is so scared, and i’m trying so hard to be strong for her, to help.the care center gives her a glass of wine in the evenings because she seems to be so reliant. but i’m worried about the constant withdrawal and what alcohol is doing to her brain. but she loves her wine so much, and it is the last thing in this world she has that she can enjoy. i’m worried she is hurting and i can’t help her more than i am. when she is confused and thinks she is in another country or another era- should i gently reassure her that she is a little confused? or should i just lightly brush over it and go with what she says? i’m struggling to sleep and eat, because i’m so worried about her. i just want to do right by her because she has been the biggest part of my world and i love her with all of my heart.is there a medication i should look into for her aggression and fear? how can i ease this pain she is in? how can i do better?i really just want to do the right thing. 💔"," what is happening is awful in so many ways.   your poor grandad suffering from parkinson's.  and your gran is getting yelled at?  that's not acceptable at all.  i understand that dementia patients can be very challenging (my mother is very foul at times) but i would be horrified to find out staff was screaming at her.at this point, the amount of alcohol isn't the issue unless your gran becomes a danger to herself or others if she's had too much.  does she become easier if she's had more?   you are right to be concerned about the problems with alcohol withdrawal.don't try to argue with someone who is confused or even gently tell them the truth.  my own mother thinks she's back in another part of the country and yells at me for putting her in a facility ""in that other county, on the way to college"".   it took me a minute but i then realized she meant back in the midwestern us and not where she lives now.yes, there is medication for aggression and fear but from my experience with my mother, it can take awhile to find the right medications and the right dosages.  for my mother, it took 6 weeks.  one calming medication had the exact opposite effect, which was miserable.my advice to you is to take good care of yourself- to eat properly and get exercise when you can.   the sad part of this disease is that there is no getting better, only a decline and it is sad and stressful to see loved ones so confused and miserable.   how is your gran's medical care provided?  do you have to take her to appointments or is it done through the care facility?  if medications could help improve her mood and regulate her behavior a bit, could she rejoin your grandfather in his room?  i would definitely speak up to the director about medication and with that, reunification of your grandparents if possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/obv8u4/desperate_for_answers_desperate_to_do_the_right/,Desperate for answers.

"my 90 year old grandmother has mild dementia… her short term memory is not the greatest and she could not tell me the details of, say, her hospitalizations for different things over the last few years, but her memory when it comes to the important things is pretty intact. the problem with her is she is an alcoholic… she has always been a heavy drinker but in the last year she has been consuming about eight shots of vodka daily and a couple glasses of wine. for her entire marriage she’s always enjoyed “cocktail hour” on her patio and this eventually morphed into drinking heavily at night and sometimes during the day. my mother was buying her the alcohol and she was going through it like water. well, she fell because she was wasted and broke her hip, and now, like other times when she was hospitalized for various reasons, doctors have recommended that she stop drinking. she has stopped drinking in the past per recommendation because we pretty much forced her but she has always slid back into it again. my mom or uncle would let her have a glass of wine and it would spiral from there.the problem is, now, she is calling us almost every night complaining that she doesn’t have anything to drink. we remind her that her doctors say she is not supposed to be drinking and each time she act surprised as if she’s never heard it. i don’t think that her dementia is that bad that she could be forgetting that she can’t drink; i think she may be manipulating us - but i’m not totally sure. i’m tired of receiving the phone calls asking me to go to the store to buy her booze. i’m honestly afraid she’s going to find someway to get it and start drinking again. what can i do to support her, a demented lady who might forget the repercussions of her drinking, to stop drinking?", i was talking with one of my mom's nurses today about her drinking and she reminded me there is a pill her doctor can prescribe that will make you sick if you drink with it. it's used to help patients form a negative connection to drinking.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/obn8rm/how_to_help_an_alcoholic_with_mild_dementia/,[deleted by user]

"my mil presents with undeniable cognitive impairment. her brain scans show tissue degenerations, she absolutely failed the slums test in every catagory, cannot remember what was said to her 20 minutes ago or less, is having visual hallucinations, doesn't care about her hygiene anymore, doesn't eat and has lost a significant amount of weight, not to mention there is an extensive famiy history of alzheimer's. today my so got the results of her cognitive testing back - while she failed the slums she passed within reason (on the low end) the other tests (bai, gds, trails, token, scwt). she was not given the wms iv based on how thoroughly she failed the slums. so, because she barely passed other tests, despite miserably failing the slums and appearing visably disoriented, confused, and unable to remember anything said to her, she's given a diagnosis of moderate to severe major depressive syndrome with psychotic episodes. what we aren't given is any real way to get her help, regardless of the diagnosis. she's encouraged to go to therapy, take medication, and be more social. that's the prescription that's supposed to cure her. the only problem is since she can't remember what she had to eat 10 minutes to go, much less the fact that she can't remember that she doesn't remember something, how in the hell are we supposed to her her to willingly seek treatment? she told the psychiatrist flat out she wouldn't go to therapy or take medication. so what do we do with a person who presents the symotoms of someone with moderate to severe dementia, to the point that her primary care doctor was convinced it was dementia, but who supposedly doesn't have it? with a person whose symptoms could be reversed if they sought proper treatment, but who refuses to do so? in part because she's stubborn as hell, but also in part because she currently isn't capable of making good decisions on her own behalf? what the fuck is it going to take for someone to place her into inpatient treatment so she can actually recieve the care she do desperately needs but will never agree to on her own terms? am i just supposed to let her become more and more insane until eventually the police take her away for being a danger to herself or others? we could maybe have seen a light at the end of the tunnel with a dementia diagnosis. we would have known she is the way she is, that there was really nothing to do to ""cure"" her. we would have had access to resources and help. this diagnosis gives us nothing - it just cruelly reminds my so that his mom could be well if someone could force treatment on her, but gives no avenues on how to make that happen. meanwhile my mil continues to get worse, and refuses all treatment. it feels like we thought we were running towards the finish line and instead ran straight into a brick wall. even though i guess i should no longer post in the group, if anyone has any recommendations i would so appreciate it. i just feel like we have no where else to turn, and i'm so damn tired."," how old is she? i am no expert but my mil (rip) had a lifetime history of mental illness, had been institutionalized a few times for psychotic breaks, took drugs for schizophrenia on and off during her adulthood. then she hit her 70s and had another psychotic break, for which we took her to the er expecting to have her committed again/ need a med tweak. turned out she had a uti which was causing her hallucinations. a uti brought on because her memory was so bad she'd forget she was using the bathroom midway. it was clear at this point she also had severe memory issues like your mil. compounded by the uti. once the uti cleared up, she improved but had a new ""baseline"" which was worse than before. they wouldn't allow us to take her out of the rehab until we had a care plan lined up. and this time around, they would not prescribe antipsychotics at all! something about her age. the treatment switched to addressing the dementia instead. i always thought it weird that you can be schizophrenic if you are under 70, but hit 70 and now, nope, you have dementia.....",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/obc7qm/utterly_defeated/,Utterly defeated

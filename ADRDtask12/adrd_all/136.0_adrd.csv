i have no idea what resources are out there for finding care for my father and what type of things are legit. my dad has medicare a and b and is in the late stages of dementia. my mom has been paying out of pocket for a person stay with my dad while my mom works. i was just wondering if anyone has any experience with medicare covering homecare costs for dementia? do we have any options for a nursing facility or how does that work when the time comes if money isn't available to cover the expenses of a nursing home/memory care facility?," hi - if you are in the u.s., the department of health and human services has a site to help folks in your situation called eldercarelocator.gov. this is a free resource.  you will find some quality information about things like...where to find benefits programs that can help pay for prescription drugs, health care, rent, utilities, and other needs. there are other tools to help with long term care and advanced care planning and more.  again, these resources are free to use as a service from the hhs.gov. i hope this ends up being helpful. jb",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4mes2r/finding_care_for_my_dad_with_dementia/,Finding care for my Dad with dementia
"hi, the title kind of explains it. i've been caring for my grandpa since november 2015. doing his laundry, dishes and getting his groceries. things like that. it was his birthday today, he's 87. after we all went out for lunch with the family, i went back to his place to help him put away gifts and to wash his feet (he has poor foot health so i soak them for him and apply the necessary creams so they don't get infected).  when the visit was over, i went to leave and gave him a hug. when i hugged him he aggressively grabbed my chest and put his hand up the back of my shirt. he muttered that i was ""too much for him"". i'm kind of horrified. i fully understand that he was not in his right mind when this happened and even though this happened only a few hours ago, he doesn't remember it at all. i also realize that this kind of behaviour is common in patients with dementia. my family knows all about it, and when my mom tried to talk to him about what happened, he said he simply didn't remember. she also called his case worker today and we are now finding him a higher care facility that can take him sooner than later. i love my grandpa. this is the only time he's ever acted this way towards me. i don't want to let this incident change my opinion of him, but frankly i feel angry, disappointed and violated. i've never been assaulted by a man in this way and i think that's why it's effecting me so much.  i'm posting this in hopes that someone has been in this situation and can offer me a different, more positive perspective on this incident... if there is one. i don't want to feel angry and would like to move on. tldr; birthday grandpa groped me and now i feel weird about him. seeking perspectives/advice", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4mayt5/27f_was_felt_up_by_grandpa_with_dementia_seeking/,27/F was felt up by grandpa with dementia.

"my father (early 50's) lives in a very small town in arizona and is showing early signs of dementia (forgetting things, getting obsessed and stuck in conversational loops). my mother is a very spiritual person, and is the type to reject most forms of western medicine, and therefore doesn't want to ""call into being"" this sickness, and believes that all will be well with exercise, mental stimulation, good eating habits, and happy vibes - things that, while helpful, he already practices and clearly isn't enough. i had a long conversation with her about steps that might need to be taken (finding a doctor, getting a diagnosis, preparing financially, accepting that they might have to move to a place that has better facilities) and she either rejected them or humored me with just a ""mmhmm"". i'm concerned because both of his parents are currently in the advanced stages of dementia themselves, so i can see what my father is in for. i can't ask for help from his family, as they already have their hands full with my grandparents, and i'm an only child. i guess i need help knowing how to get my ducks in a row so that my father has the best care and can get his finances sorted while he still has the mental ability to do so. also if anyone has had luck convincing family members that are in denial/stubborn about treatment, any advice is welcome."," there will come a point where the situation will come unbearable and your mom will ""turn the corner"" with regard to her current insistence on avoidance.   i can't tell you what the circumstances will be, but it will happen.  at that point, she will finally reach out for help.  in the meantime, consider visiting various memory care centers in their area for research purposes.   put together a list of pros/cons along with pricing so you'll have it when the time comes.

"my mom, recently widowed, has vascular dementia. it's not too bad; it's mainly absentmindedness, but not like she's continuously asking the same question every 5 minutes. she remembers past events and people fine, as well as things like which day we go to church and if an important event occurred, such as that one of our close cousins recently passed away. she's not so good at knowing which day it is or which month, who's president, what she did earlier in the day, where she put something, etc. the situation is that we're in the process of consolidating the family trust and also working with the attourney my dad retained. as trustee, whenever my brother needs to do a bank transaction the bank requires my mom's consent every time, which involves them asking her various questions, date of birth, last 4 digits of ssn, etc.. the attourney gets a bit more detailed in trying ascertain her competency, rightly so, and my brother wants me to start ""asking her questions"" (i call it quizzing) in order to ""prep"" her so she knows the answers to questions like about things she owns, who's president, our address, the year, her mom's maiden name, etc. is that productive and will it work? i'm skeptical.note: we got our mom hearing aids last year, and she's got it that when we take them out each night, she has to open the battery ""door"" on each, who the caregiver is who comes twice each week, and who the instructor is for her exercize class."," with many dementias, long term knowledge (or ""old"" information) is the last to go, so i'm wondering why she needs to be quizzed to prep her on answers such as her date of birth, last four digits of ssn, address, etc.  that said, because your mom *will fail* the competency quizzing at the most inopportune time at some point in the future, your family's better approach would be to activate the poa so that her designated representative can speak for her regarding family business.  depending on how the poa is written, activating it may require two physicians (usually in the fields of neurology or gerontology) to declare her incompetent to handle financial business.   an elder law attorney in your state can give you guidance on this process.

"i've been posting here recently about my mother. she's 50 and was recently diagnosed with early onset frontotemporal dementia with indicators of alzheimer's back in september. been noticing problems getting progressively worse for the past few years and back in january i took away her car and made her move in with me because she got lost for 8 hours driving to the store with no gps or cellphone. thank god she somehow remembered my cellphone number (probably cause it's been the same for 15 years)since moving in with me her condition has definitely gotten worse, and even though it's happening very slowly, it's starting to become more of a problem. she chain-smokes (which i've pretty much given up on trying to stop), never changes her clothes unless i pretty much force her to by removing her old clothes while she's showering, and she has pretty much reverted to the mindset of a child at this point.  her vocabulary is limited, she laughs it off when you question what she's doing or what she just said, and all she cares about are her 'disney world socks' which she meticulously will fold and place inside of her purse 100 times a day.obviously it's a lot of work taking care of her because she needs to be constantly reminded of things like eating, hygienic activities, etc.  thankfully i have a family support system (which could be a lot better but i guess it's better than nothing)okay; so the latest development i've noticed is that she is starting to get a lot more clingy at home.every morning, when i work from home, i will wake up and make coffee and breakfast for myself and mom.  then, typically, i would set her up on her laptop playing some online games of her choice ( i tried luminosity but honestly it's already too difficult with no reward for her, so typically she plays online roulette, slots, etc. if she thinks she can win money she will gladly play fake gambling games for an hour or two per day )my brother will go for a run and take her in the morning and then she takes a shower (after being told 100 times).then after that i would typically spend some time with her looking at old photos, talking, etc. then comes lunchtime. afterwards she watches a movie (or two if i'm lucky) and then finally it's time for dinner, her pills, another movie or games, and bedtime between 8:30 and 10pm.lately things have been slowly changing...  she won't play her games on her laptop.  she won't sit and watch a movie for more than 10 minutes unless it's the sound of music (which thank god i bought and didn't rent because it's come in handy when i have work to do) , she doesn't want to go for runs or jogs, and most annoyingly of all she is starting to hover and follow me ***everywhere*** i go.at first it was totally okay.  ""sure, mom. come on downstairs and sit by my side while i work on the computer.""now, i can't even go take a leak without her trying to get in to the bathroom, following behind me... jiggling the doorknob. i yell out, ""i'm in here!"" and she says, ""okay"" while continuing to jiggle the doorknob.i go outside to walk to the dog and she will appear right behind me after i tell her stay inside and i make her go sit down on her computer or something.if i try to relax at night and i set her up on a movie in the living room adjacent to my bedroom i will usually close my door but leave it cracked open slightly.  sometimes i will notice the faint image of an eyeball staring at me through that crack. just silently staring at me... not making a sound.  ""mom, what do you want?"" i will ask... the eyeball silently disappears as she walks away.  i'll come out and she's no longer watching the movie but instead just wandering around the house.  then usually she'll ask for a cig (even if she smoked one 10 minutes ago)the worst is when i'm working and i have set her up on an activity and then out of nowhere she will appear behind me like a ninja. i have very good spatial awareness and hearing but somehow, sometimes, she will suddenly just be right behind me which is a bit startling. i yelled at her once cause she scared me but she wasn't even phased by that! (i never yell or get angry with her ever because obviously nothing that's happening is her fault.) i was surprised by her lack of a reaction to me yelling... just the same old smile and blank expression. ""i want to sit here and watch you."" ...................*okay*...anyway i guess this is more of a rant than anything else. i'm starting to look into homes that can care for her because it's honestly getting to the point where i just can't handle this shit anymore.  and i know that in the near future she's going to have bigger problems, i.e. bathroom hygiene, etc, which i have already made it clear to the rest of the family that i **am not** comfortable or capable of handling at all. i have my limits. plus, if i was her i wouldn't want me, her son, helping with that anyway. it's embarrassing.oh, and did i mention she has a 7 year old kid that i've been tasked with taking over the custody battle for with her ex-husband? yeah... that's just great.  especially the part where i have to watch her **and** my little kid brother for days at a time while trying to maintain a steady income freelancing. been trying to get more 'work-from-home' type freelance work but, as you could probably guess, that is easier said than done.**tl;dr**mom's 50 with dementia / alzheimer's. she's at the point where she has completely lost her will to do anything on her own besides smoke cigarettes and play gambling games on the internet. she sneakily follows me everywhere and eavesdrops on my conversations. she will silently stare at me through doors that are slightly cracked open. my only respite for any chunk of r&amp;r is putting the sound of music on for her to watch. or when she's sleeping. starting to look into care facilities for the near future...", given the fact that she's younger with dementia she may be harder to place.  try to find a facility that specializes in memory care maybe even an assisted living with memory care. make sure to look at all the financials and make sure that she's enrolled in some sort of medicare and medicaid program. i figure i'm somewhere about your age and i can't even begin to imagine what you're going through. i work in memory care and if you ever need someone to talk to or just get advice or something inbox me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4l5eg9/following_me_everywhere/,Following Me Everywhere

and you and your family - are going through this. it's one of the most heartbreaking illnesses i have ever experienced - along with everyone else that goes through it. just to introduce myself - i am 22 years old and i have a granddad who has dementia, and has done for around 6 years. . . although he was properly diagnosed only a couple of years ago. i was one of the first people to spot that my granddad wasn't well back when i was 16/17 through little things that he did (quite similar to your mum, actually) like getting lost driving through a town that he knows like the back of his hand, driving through red lights and forgetting who saint george was, which, believe it or not, was a massive flashing warning sign in my head, as everyone in my town referred to him as that (my granddad is a bit of a local celebrity). from the point that i could see he wasn't very well, he declined rather rapidly and nothing could be done to stop it. during the time of his decline, around two years after we spotted the early signs, i was at university in london whilst all of my family were the ones experiencing the effects of alzheimer's back home. in my mind it made me sad knowing that i wasn't there whilst he was ""well"" and, to some extent it still gets to me but, what i will say (and this may sound selfish, but please don't see it this way) if i was there, back home, i would have gotten very annoyed at him for the little things he couldn't help doing - like my family often did whilst they were trying to deal with it. i'd have regretted having a short temper with him, i'd have regretted getting annoyed when he couldn't remember my name or that i was his granddaughter (which he would often ask me when i went home during term time) so, what i would say is this (and excuse the bluntness please, i just want to be as real with you as i can): don't go home. if you put your life on pause to go home to help a situation that can't be stopped when you are struggling already, you will come to despise everything surrounding you. you won't remember your mum in the way you'd like to. you would witness your mum's decline everyday and, slowly but surely, your childhood memories would be replaced by you witnessing your mother digress to a childlike state.whilst she will be mentally ""gone"" at some point once the illness takes its toll, what i will say is this; just because she will not be able to do the things she once could, she is still there. in human, living form at least. a common situation i have found from alzheimer's is that people see the person as dead once the alzheimer's has taken over, and that's not the case. when my granddad got put into a home last year, my uncle spiralled into a downward spiral of depression and didn't work for nearly a year. he witnessed my granddad become progressively worse day in, day out as they lived together and, eventually, just didn't acknowledge that he was actually still alive when he moved to a home. from this i have learnt that any time you spend with your loved one suffering from alzheimer's is just as credible as spending time with them when they're lucid, so you don't need to move home. what i would suggest you do is come to terms with alzheimer's first, read up about it and become acquainted with it so that when you see your mum, you will be able to embrace it rather than get upset and struggle some more. whenever i see my granddad now, we are still making memories. sure, it's more one-sided, but take it with a pinch of salt. i love seeing my granddad and he comes out with some of the most hilarious things i've ever heard. he's still there as the sarcastic, cheerful ladies man i've always known him to be, but he just doesn't remember things. i do think that my response to his condition is partly credited to the fact that i wasn't at home all the time during university, where i would've become annoyed. if both your dad and brother are struggling to cope at home, then i would suggest that they look into a home that specialises with alzheimer's patients or getting a visiting nurse to pop in to help around the house to ease the pressure. please don't feel selfish or helpless. there are things you can do, which will make a huge difference. just be there for her when you can, don't be short tempered around her and embrace the illness as much as possible. there is an amazing network around for those who are affected by the illness such as the alzheimer's association, the alzheimer's society and many, many more, who are all there to offer guidance and support to you when you need it. they will be able to listen to you and reassure you that everything will be ok but, in the mean time, what i would suggest - and it worked for me, but obviously may not work for you - is that you read up about alzheimer's, what happens to those that have it and just generally become acquainted with it - because if you understand it and come to terms with it, it will most likely affect how you respond to your mum. try and get involved in these societies in whichever way you can - me and my mum raised £2,500 for the alzheimer's society this christmas because i want to raise awareness for it and hopefully find a cure. maybe this will make you feel a bit less helpless. if you ever need to chat, please just let me know. i know how difficult it is and think that having a support network to listen and talk to is the best way to cope with these things! and sorry again for being straight to the point.

"my dad is living in an assisted living facility.  he's definitely got dementia--has had for about 6 years but just got bad enough that he couldn't live independently last fall.for the last 15-20 years, he and his significant other have had a rather weird relationship where one of their favorite bonding activities seems to be developing different medical maladies and going to the doctor for them.  for example, she had pain in her feet, so she went to a podiatrist who eventually recommended she needed to have nerves severed in the soles of her feet.  (this is a legitimate treatment for very advanced plantar fasciitis, but often causes additional trouble.)  next thing we know, dad has *the exact same problem* and gets the nerves cut in his feet.  but he develops an issue where he can't keep his toes straight while walking and ultimately needs to have a toe amputated.  seriously, the list just goes on and on.i hesitate to say he's a hypochondriac, but he's ""nearly"" had cancer at least a dozen times.  nearly.  now that he's in assisted living and his lady friend legitimately has cancer and they can't do recreational doctor visits, he's developing all kinds of issues.  many of them have been legitimate; he is going in for surgery tomorrow (outpatient) to release pressure in his eye that could lead to glaucoma.  he's getting physical therapy 2x/week for balance issues, and my brother and i take turns attending those.  my brother and i have to take him to the doctor appointments--the assisted living could handle transportation, but they don't have the staffing to accompany him, which he desperately needs.he called last night and said his knee ""has finally exploded.""  when pressed to clarify, he dazedly said something about the area between his leg bones (but not his kneecap) getting off-centered and then popping back in frequently.  i'm not aware of him *ever* having a dislocation, so i don't think that's it.  he said it's never happened to him before, but then a few minutes later he said it happened 3 times yesterday and wouldn't go back in as quickly as it usually does.  he wants to go to the doctor.i had him to talk to the nurse at the front desk about it and get some ice for it.  i haven't heard anything further today.  i guess i don't know if there's any way we *can* tell when it is a legitimate issue.  but my brother and i both work full time and have families, and we cannot be taking him to the doctor and to physical therapy several days per week if he's just doing this to get attention.any suggestions?", does he have a formal documented dementia diagnosis? this could really help with further care planning,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4jtdcc/how_can_i_tell_when_he_really_does_need_to_see_a/,How Can I Tell When He Really Does Need to See a Doctor?
"i woke up with a migraine today. 9 times out of 10, it's a sleep migraine, so usually i can take care of it with meds and taking a nap. today, no. my parents went out and of course need someone to watch grandma. i told them i have a migraine but my mother just tells me ""oh that's too bad; get a blanket and sit on the couch"", and keeps going on about grandma's meds and then breezes out the door.(i dont know what she said *that* for; there's no point in even *thinking* about sitting on the couch; grandma needs something or is messing with something she has no business messing with, every 5 minutes.)  so now that my parents are gone my grandmother is flat out ignoring me. my mother gave her her meds before they left, but left a medication bottle in grandma's room, so here comes grandma saying she needs to take it ""because the bottle is full"". i told her she already took it, and to just put it on the counter, and she makes that stupid bewildered look and then walks back to her room with it. i followed her and asked her if she just took some on her own but she made a show of ignoring me this time; stares right in my face with a smirk and drank her cup of water she had and then walked around me out of her room (and of course froze in the hallway because ""...*what was i trying to do?*"".   i want to just go upstairs and lay down and let her do what she wants, but we really can't leave her alone because she was left alone to the extreme before, and now panics at being alone just for a few minutes. but i'm angry. and annoyed. i'm angry at my parents for dumping her on me like this. i'm angry at her for ignoring me, cause i know she's doing it on purpose; i'm annoyed that she's so damn *needy* that you can't even have 5 minutes for yourself, and i'm frustrated at all of it, mostly because usually when i don't take care of my migraines, they get worse until i puke. but *everyone elses* needs are more important.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4jm32q/frustratedannoyedangry/,Frustrated/annoyed/angry

"i [30sf] live far away from my parents [late50sm] and [early70sf].  they visit us approximately twice a year, since i was pregnant with my son.  i started to notice my mom's memory wasn't quite the same as it used to be, a few years ago.  not so bad that it was worth mentioning to anyone other than my husband, just to ""make a mental note"".in the last 2 years, and with the perspective of not seeing my mom regularly for 6 month intervals, i've noticed a pretty steep decline in her short term memory. i mentioned it to my older brother (also lives far away, but sees slightly less of my parents due to a difficult wife), mainly to see if he could see it too.  he wasn't too worried at first, but keeps tabs on what i tell him (privately).this last visit with my parents, i had my dad on his own and i asked him directly about it.  he said that i'm right, her short term memory is pretty bad.  he also mentioned that she is very very good at hiding it from most people (and that she is aware of it herself).  she can reason things out, her overall ""intelligence"" is seemingly unaffected, but she really struggles with organisational things: where did she leave her purse, what does she need to do before leaving the house, having trouble keeping track of names occasionally, repeating questions or things said in the previous 10 mins to 24 hrs....  to hide it (from my husband, for example) she resorts to telling anecdotes/stories that require long-term memory only.  subtle, but effective.my grandfather was sharp as a tack until the day he died of complications from an unexpected stomach ulcer (age 83).  by contrast, my grandmother had a 2 year downspiral of her cognitive abilities before she died of heart attack (age 86).my son is only little, i want to have another baby and my parents love coming to where we live to help out and spend time with their grandson.  i'm just worried that her memory is declining faster than anyone has control over.  my mom had undiagnosed heart issues (that required an emergency pacemaker installation), and the doc said there was a small chance that those issues could have contributed to some cognitive decline.  if that is the case, the doc said that it should level off where it is.  if not, i think it's more than just age-related mild forgetfulness.my parents do crosswords and sudokus together daily, and read a lot and watch tv/movies and go to concerts.   but because of my mom's organisational issues and also a leg issue related to a childhood case of polio, she won't go out and walk much anymore.  she used to drive and walk and take the bus, but now she avoids it.  i noticed it on this last visit.  i also read that daily exercise in the form of short walks is one of the many things that can help with dementia/memory loss.  she just won't do it though, and it's really frustrating to watch!i trust her with my son, but i'm not sure my dad does - so when they're watching him, my dad takes primary responsibility.i guess i'm not really asking a specific question...just more to get it off my chest.  that being said, i know my mother well, and i know that she never wants to be a ""burden"" on anyone.  the country my parents live in (they are resident there, retired after 30ish years working in that country) has very liberal euthanasia laws (in the legal comparative sense, not political).  the laws have been around a while...i wish i could just ask her how she really feels about that."," i went through this with my dad. eventually i had to just say to him, dad i'm worried about your memory. he has gone back and forth about agreeing with me and saying he's fine but he's definitely changing. mom wouldn't acknowledge it either, until recently.what i would recommend is having your dad talk to her first. she might be in denial but if you both sit her down or the family does it will likely be more overwhelming and she may become more upset or feel attacked.i agree with the other comment about framing it in a life planning sense. when my dad would shut the subject down i'd let it go but always made sure i verbally expressed ""fine we don't have to talk about this if you really don't want to. but, ignoring it isn't going to make it go away, and getting medical attention is always better to do earlier than later.""sometimes hearing someone else say that is enough. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4j7gbn/getting_moms_mental_decline_off_my_chest_not_sure/,Getting mom's mental decline off my chest.

"hi everyone!i am a final year design student at loughborough university currently undertaking my final year project. at the start of the year whilst researching for possible ideas that i could explore for my project i began researching ways to help people suffering from dementia maintain a healthy sleep cycle. this led to bright light therapy and the beneficial effect it can have helping sundowning and maintaining a heathy circadian rhythm. during the research i also learned the term 'burnout' and read abut the physical toll caring takes on the caregiver. after reading about it i knew i wanted to design a product that could be beneficial for both the carer and cared-for. after reading numerous scientific articles about alternative non-pharmaceutical treatments such as bright light therapy and aromatherapy and the positive effects they can have, i was surprised to find no published research about the combined use of both treatments. this gave me the idea for my project. a device that combines controlled doses of bright light with aroma, using two senses to maintain a healthy sleep cycle. the bright lights and aroma would helped the cared for and the aroma would hopefully create calmer atmosphere for the carer.the device uses two sets of lights one set of 6000k light (cool white) and one set of 3000k (warm white) representing morning and evening. inside the device is a two part aroma diffuser, this is so different aromas could be smelled at different times of the day for example. in the morning a grapefruit essential oil could be set which is known to increase alertness and mental activity and in the evening lavender could be set to relax and promote sleep. the device can be programmed to come on at different times of the day using an app for an iphone or ipad such as coming on early in the morning increasing the brightness to mimic the sun rising and vice versa for the sun setting. many of the articles about studying the effects of bright light research used much higher levels of light than those that are available to purchase. i noticed that the commercial models marketed for sad emitted 10,000 lux (the intensity of light required) at distances of around 20-30cm which i thought could be improved. at double the distance the intensity of light is quartered which effectively makes them very bright lamps. they all looked quite clinical and not something you would really want in you house, i wanted to design something that you would want for its form and function and not just for its function. that anyone would want in their house just for its design, getting rid of any stigma that may be attached with this type of product.i wanted to increase this distance so something more practical, so i made my device 2x more powerful than those currently available using 16 15w led bulbs giving a power output of 240w versus 160w of the most powerful product currently available. as there is a demand for more research to be carried out into these alternative therapies i added 4 infra-red sensors to the product to detect sleep disturbances. these instances are recorded and presented as a graph in the app. these can be turned off if you didn't want to have this data recorded. the aim of gathering this information would be to present what levels of brightness works best, when are the lights being used, for what duration and are they being used in conjunction with a particular oil. gathering this information from many of these devices could develop these forms of treatment and would build a picture if these forms of treatment are more effective together rather than by themselves. although it was dementia that brought me to creating the product, i also feel it can be beneficial to those suffering from depression. my younger brother has struggled for the past few years and one thing i always notice is that the curtains in his room are always drawn, shutting out natural daylight. he has expressed interest that having a device that would turn on in the morning waking him up naturally, with an aroma he likes could help him in the mornings and reenacting the sun setting in the evening with a smell to help him relax could help to get a better nights sleep as he often stays up until the early hours on his computer in his words 'just doing nothing staring at a screen'. i would really appreciate any feedback you have on my project love it or hate it all comments are welcome. everything you say would really help me out. i'll attach some more photos when i finish the electronics in a couple of days so i can show you it working. here is a link to the mobile prototype i have madethis is designed for ios so on the add data and time screens the native date and time picker will appear on you phone but won't display on the computer. :)thanks!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4i9vkc/combined_bright_light_therapy_aromatherapy/,[deleted by user]

""what do you mean? we're at the greg school"" it was obviously very embarrassing, i can remember things if i really try, but the problem is i think i have ""trained""  my brain to forget new information without really realizing what i was doing, and now i'm wondering if i fucked up so big and i just want to know who i am in another 20 years, do you guys think someone like me will have a higher chance at dementia later on or if i go back to school and read books, etc should i be good? should i visit a professional? i  know it's hard to say but any opinions will help, thanks guys"," i do not see any signs of dementia/alzheimer's in what you have described. i totally agree with lordica, go see a doctor. i'm almost certain what you are experiencing can be treated.

"my mom is 49 and was recently diagnosed with early-onset with indicators of alzheimers. family noticed strange things happening the past several years but now it's official. it's degenerated rather quickly to the point where she's had to move in with me and i had to take over her finances, get rid of her car, get disability, etc etc.  her short-term memory ranges from 5 seconds to a day at this point.  needless to say it's been a lot to handle. but i have a good family support system so we're working through it together.anyway; when i was a kid my mom smoked. she would quit on and off for a few months here and there, but then when she had her final child 7 years ago she quit for good.  then, a few years ago when she started having noticeable problems, my mom started smoking again. i attributed it to the divorce, custody battles, etc.now that she lives with me i'm trying to get her to quit again but it is very difficult. she asks me for cigs every 5 minutes and if i let her have the pack it will disappear within several hours due to chain-smoking.we are currently hiding the cigs and then making up excuses why she can't have them but then she gets extremely irritable and goes on rants about us treating her like a child (which she pretty much is at this point) and starts directing her anger towards things like re-arranging furniture or cleaning stuff. the cleaning stuff aspect is not so bad except when she uses the wrong cleaning supplies and i have to hide the dog from the area she cleaned and re-clean her 'cleaning'.anyway i guess i'm ranting here. but my main question for the group would have to be:   has anyone else experienced a person with dementia chain-smoking? and if so, have they tried getting them to quit? suggestions on making that happen? i actually smoke, too, and am also trying to quit. i was quit before mother moved in. but having the constant smell of smoke, combined with the stressful situation, i started again too. i'm trying to get us to quit together but the idea is always shot down with, ""i don't want to"" or just being straight up ignored. i only smoke a few a day but it's still the worst habit you can have.  i was quit for several months but this led me back to buying packs recently and i **really** want us to quit together. for her, for myself. for everyone.need advice, please..."," it's not my business, but why bother at this point. if you get to sit with your mother as she smokes 2 packs a day, and get a little bit of her memories as they pass through, and a little bit of peace when she goes outside to smoke and you stay inside, its worth it for all parties involved. she has a limited shelf life now, which sucks to say, but is true. get the most out of that shelf life",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4hneiu/dementia_and_chainsmoking/,Dementia and Chain-Smoking

"my grandmother has had dementia for as long as i could remember.  i always remember that things were a little bit off when i was a child.  she could go into sudden rages.  little things would set her off.  she was forgetful.  she would ask the same questions over and over again.  i learned recently that her doctors have diagnosed her with dementia, however, she does not take that news well and will start doctor hopping if anyone suggests it.my grandfather's health has begun to fail.  they live in a mountainous region and he had been told to get out of the altitude or die in a year.  at 92, he is very ready to go to a place where he can be taken care of.  however, after finding repeated places that he enjoyed and putting deposits down on an assisted living apartment, my grandmother will inevitably throw a raging fit, accusing people of trying to put her in jail, and he will quietly cancel their plans.about a month ago, he made the decision that he wanted to move to a town about 40 minutes away from me.  he found a facility that he loved.  she seemed alright with the plan.  they are suppose to move in next week.now, the phone calls to my mother have started.  my grandmother told her to go to hell, stating that she would never be put in a prison and she didn't understand why she was forcing her to do this.  she has threatened my uncle with being written out of her will, one of her favorite threats.  everyone is tried, upset, and struggling to understand. my mother wants to have her declared incompetent, but her brother doesn't see the need at the moment.  it has caused a rift between two normally close siblings.it seems as if i'm the only member of the family who she does not get angry with.  i am in my early 30s, have a full time job, and hobbies which take up the rest of my time.  i feel like i need to step in and be peacemaker but at the same time, i decided long ago to stay away from my grandmother simply because she is not the woman that i know and love anymore.  i'm just so confused by the entire situation and i have no idea whether it is my place to step in and say that i'll take care of her if they will only move.  i feel as if she will be fine once she gets moved and settled in a new place, but i also understand that she is scared of something new because of her illness.  how do i keep my family together in all of this?"," from my experience seeing many families deal with similar situations, by far the best solution for everyone, especially your grandmother and grandfather, is to move into an assisted living facility. your grandfather is a smart man. he already knows it's the best solution. hopefully, he will finally make the move, even if it means your grandmother will be kicking and screaming the whole time. if the facility is good (and there are a lot of excellent assisted living facility all over the county), in a couple of months your grandmother's attitude will probably change for the better, especially once she sees the good care she and your grandfather are receiving. as far as you, your mother and uncle, it's hard to give people advice on how they should or could react to a situation, but if it were me, i would tell grandmother as lovingly as possible (mom for your mother) that you agree with your grandfather (father), and that both she and grandfather need assistance, while constantly reassuring her that this is the best solution. she will probably still be upset, but like i said before, once she gets accustomed to being taking care of, she will adjust.the phone calls. the phone calls always start. usually many times a day. i was helping a lady for a few weeks recover from back surgery. he mother had dementia. she and her sister started getting phone calls from their mother 10, 15 times a day. it was driving them crazy. their mother lived in another town but had excellent around the clock caregivers. so the sisters decided that they would both take 1 phone call a day from their mother and all the rest would go to voicemail. i think this was/is an excellent solution to all the phone calls knowing their mother was being taken care of. also, they learned not to feel guilty about this and it have worked out great for everyone. good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4gxoc2/grandmother_tearing_family_apart/,Grandmother Tearing Family Apart
"my grandfather suffered from dementia during the last 10 years of his life. in the period where he was still able to live independently (at home and then in sheltered housing), there was constant worry that something might happen; and regularly something did. on numerous occasions the police showed up at our door at 4am having found him wandering in his pyjamas. another time he had left the oven on and almost caused a fire, or his windows wide open when he went to bed in the evening, and once just couldn't get out of the bath but was too embarrassed to pull his alarm to call his carer and couldn't reach the phone to call us directly.thinking back on this experience and interacting with others recently it’s clear that these aren't occurrences that are unique to my personal experience with dementia. essentially, for the past few months i've been developing some technology/sensors that could allow families of dementia sufferers to non-invasively remotely monitor their relative’s environment and activity. the devices completely wireless, small, and discreet. they allow families to check up on activity or receive remote alerts to their phones if something unexpected happens at their relative’s house. they will be able to monitor and receive alerts on things such as unusual door and window activity,  temperature, humidity, and light in individual rooms. with these measurements close family members are able to be alerted if their relative has gone wandering unexpectedly, left windows open, the oven on, lights on, the bath running, etc. the sensors can even be used as a direct-to-family panic alarm or automatic fall alert if the user is willing to keep it on their person.i'd really love to hear thoughts on this, and hear about your own experiences and difficulties in caring for relatives. what day to day problems do you face that you could envisage this sort of thing solving?having been through this myself, i am very passionate about using my engineering abilities to hopefully provide solutions that could really help ease the lives of both the sufferers of dementia and their families."," i have worked with persons with alzheimer's and other dementia's for 28 years. anything to add a level of safety is brilliant. a community that has 24 hour staff and peers to interact with is a best choice, as it allows the family primary caregiver/spouse/child to become the loved one again and provides a better quality of life for all. this isn't always possible primarily due to finances. average income for those 65+ is $24,000 annually and the average cost for care is conservatively $72,000 annually.

"i hope i'm not putting myself in a weird situation here, i'm assuming this is mostly safe space.a few years ago my grandmother, 94 at the time, said that her cognitive abilities were slipping. last december, at 96, she said that she no longer remembered any of the things she used to tell me about my childhood. this march she barely knows who i am most of the time. i went to see her in the assisted care facility, and it turns out she's been upgraded from can-mostly-take-care-of-herself-knows-whats-going-on to this-lady-is-losing-it-keep-an-eye-on-her. in 3 months.she was one of those grandmas who was always like ""remember when we did such and such"" and ""i remember when you were 2 years old you blah blah blah"" ... we were all tired of hearing about these things because if it had been a day, or a year, she'd be like ""lets talk about that thing you did when you were 2."" and now when i call her i'm like ""hey, remember that thing i did when i was 2?"" and she's like ""no honey, i dont remember that.."" and it makes me sad.sometimes i get a call from my dad or my uncle saying ""hey mom's passing"" or ""hey your grandma is not going to have her mind much longer, time to get in anything you ever wanted to get in""so i call her and tell her things like ""remember how you always wanted to spoil me rotten?"" that's the one thing she hasn't forgotten...well except for those times that she forgets me all together, but when i can get lucidity from her she remembers only that her goal was to spoil me rotten. i've tried to let her know that i am spoiled rotten. i am part of a generation of children who grew up to be spoiled rotten, although i never tell her that the entire generation is spoiled, i try to tell her that she succeeded and that i am indeed spoiled.she will say something like ""aww precious, why shouldn't you be"" and then drift away into weird things like ""wait til you meet the girls. they are outgoing and very gregarious.""each time, just before nodding off she'll mention ""i'm going somewhere soon. i don't know where..its not new york. but i have a feeling that i'm going somewhere"" which translates to me that i think she knows she's gonna die.because of her age and state of mental decline, every time i call her it is the ""last call"" every time i call her to tell her i miss her its the last time. i've talked to her a half dozen times in the last year, watching this dementia unfold...and the last 3 have been goodbye calls and visits.i want to keep calling her because i love her and she's part of who i am, she has impressed upon me how to behave in public. she's my closest grandma. when i had a driver's license, the first place i drove was there. when my grandpa died i wore his clothes and ate his favorite foods for a week, it wasn't a planned thing, i just ended up doing it without thinking about it. i'm his namesake. my grandma and i have been close. not like weird creepy close as the last statement would have you believe, but she's part of my small family. growing up she was always my mom's best friend, and my dad's best friend. she was always just there. first school graduation, there. first play i was in, there. you name it, there.now she's dying and i keep saying goodbye but it's never goodbye. when should i stop calling? when should i stop trying? this is killing me to watch this happen. neglecting her because she can't remember me seems like such a dick move. i don't know what to do.the long goodbye sucks. i know a lot of people don't have a chance to say goodbye, and the fact that i'm able to say goodbye over and over and over seems like a blessing. but it's also a curse. to forever say goodbye to your loved one, but for them to always be there only slightly worse off every time. anyone have any experience? anyone have any words?i hope this doesn't break a rule, and if it does, you can edit my post or put a thing by it...but damnit, dementia's a f*cking b*tch. i sincerely apology for disrupting the safe space but i'm very...emotional. this is the first time i've poured my heart out about this to anyone. i can't bottle it anymore. i can't. i added asterisks to the bad words if that helps. i'm angry. i'm confused. i'm sad. i'm everything in that steps of acceptance chart all at once.i know she wouldn't want me to stress out and worry about her, but that's the thing about loving someone...you can't just turn that off. there is a small part of me that wants her to pass peacefully in her sleep before she loses any more. my dad has said: ""when i get there just blow my brains out. give me a 45, i'll do it myself"" to which i said: ""if you have that level of dementia i'm not giving you a 45."" we use humor to cope. dark shitty humor...but its a dark shitty situation. i'm sorry. i forgot the stars...is this common? this feeling? anyone else feel this way? like, if she passed in her sleep i wouldn't have to keep saying goodbye? she's not happy. this isn't entirely a me-thing. if she was always chipper and enjoyed life i'd say: ""fudge it, let her just be happy"" but she doesn't like not knowing anybody. she doesn't like not knowing where she is or who anybody is. i don't like it, the family doesn't like it. we're certainly not mad at her for this. we're not mad at god. we're just mad. and confused. and sad. god this rant has gone on long enough. thank you if you made it this far. i'm sorry. i don't know where else to go."," i don't think you're terrible to think this way. my grandfather didn't have dementia, but he definitely had pretty terrible memory by the end of it (died at 96, iirc). the thing with him was that his body gave out before his mind did, which may be worse, depending who you are. it was really hard watching him go down—a similar figure to your grandma, always at things, only close family member outside of immediate family. i definitely felt a kind of relief when he finally passed, though it was from pneumonia, so not as painless as one would hope (though it was fairly quick). it was hard watching him go and watching the way my family had to handle it for the last few years. i don't think you should feel ashamed for feeling this way at all. it's not easy dealing with this sort of slow death, which is in many ways a sort of sequence of deaths, especially when memory is involved. i think the relief i felt was largely based on the fact that, to me, my grandfather had died years before he died, when he had lost his ability to work (he was operating a tractor until he was 86), go on walks, or simply take care of himself (which was incredibly important to him. as an anecdote, while i did some nursing help for him, he'd often, when i asked him if he needed anything, he himself would say ""a gun""). it's an absolute shit situation, and dementia is a fucking bitch, as you say (and i think it's fine to say that, nobody here would disagree with you). i think you are completely reasonable to feel this way (and i realize this post is old, but still, don't feel guilty, life is hard, watching people go is hard).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4g2iqx/the_long_goodbye/,The long goodbye
"almost every day we end up going for walks to find people who know her dad to get a message to him since she thinks he went back to arkansas or texas to help out other family members. she doesn't want me to pay the rent. we're living on her social security and widower's benefits from a pension, and since i can't work since she would just go wandering, i'm 24/7 here. my savings are completely burnt through and moving to a new home and faking it isn't possible.edit: i do some freelance stuff but pretty rarely. i can't do most online contract work like cha-cha because half the time, i end up getting called away from my pc to deal with something. i have a patreon but not a lot of people have elected to be my patron. i know for a fact my great-grandfather died 34 years ago. i showed him her grave next to her mother's--a photograph as it's in arkansas--back before the diagnosis. she just didn't believe it was real. she has two friends that occasionally help out--m drives us to appts and stuff, a takes her to church and occasionally takes her out to special events--but basically we're homebound most of the time. my mom occasionally shows up to help out by taking me grocery shopping and stuff but she can't help much either."," i know this must be tough for you to be dealing with all of this on your own. make sure to know your resources with the alzheimer's association, they have a 24 hour hotline you can call if you feel like your at your wits end in figuring out what to do or say in situations and there are tons of support groups available for all ages. support groups can be a pretty good resource for peer to peer support and ideas. the best thing to do in this situation is to join her journey. you can redirect her by going on the walk and then coming up with different things to talk about rather than her trying to get the message to her husband. it is very common for people dealing with dementia to seek out their parents and other loved ones that have been gone a long time, convincing them other wise will be of no use. you may also try a therapeutic fib. tell her he's safe, validate her feelings of seeking him by letting her know you've been in contact he will be home again soon and he's okay. you can try saying tomorrow and see if she remembers you saying that the next day. if not, always tomorrow. its a difficult journey, know your resources and find some support.

"," heya! i'll just copy what i posted on the topic a while ago in another thread. best of luck for your report, and it's really a superinteresting field of inquiry! :)_____i have had so many positive experiences with music for my 90 year old grandma! she can't remember anything for half a minute, but she still remembers the melodies (and sometimes even words) to certain songs from her youth. when those songs play, she often hums / sings along and is generally happy, peaceful, and distracted, focused on the music. her joy is even greater when i sing along with her, it makes her laugh so happily. and awesomely enough, i can even go away for a few minutes to fix something without her worrying or following me as she usually would, i just hear her humming happily from the other room.we built her a ""music button"" a few months ago so she can at least sometimes listen to music even when we are not there: we attached a light switch to the table, wrote ""music"" on it and ""on"" and ""off"" on the respective sides, so that when she comes into her kitchen and inspects the button, she sometimes manages to turn on music by herself for herself. pic: we built the button by buying a simple bulky on-off light switch and hooking it to a raspberry pi, a cheap tiny computer that you can easily program to do what you want when the electricity is turned on. we filled it with 20-30 songs we know she recognises and likes and those just start playing via the connected audio boxes whenever she presses the button. total cost around 100€ including cheap audio boxes.finding songs she recognises was also relatively easy: i digitalised old cds she had lying around, searched online for songs from old cassettes, and just generally played a lot of oldie and classical stuff from her youth times from youtube. if she didn't recognise a song she just didn't really react at all and we talked about the same things as always, if she did recognise them she just sort of lit up and sometimes started humming or asking what that song was called while it played.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4dxt4u/dementia_and_music/,Dementia and music
"the thing about guilt is that it always manages to get you eventually. it will sit in some dark corner of your unconscious mind and fester, slowly growing into this big grey cloud that gradually covers your mind until all you can do is look at it head on and decide what you are going to do about it. my guilt is that i have barely contacted my father since january. i’ve tried calling, once or twice, but in reality it’s more of a ‘tried’ than any actual effort. why should this be a source of guilt? there are plenty of parent child relationships where the two do not communicate regularly, and i have a lot of experience in this, as i am estranged from my mother. who unfortunately is still married to my father and still lives in the family home. so i know that there are situations where the child can no longer mentally afford to have a toxic parent in their lives. but, no matter my relationship with her, i should not allow it to negatively impact my relationship with my father, more than it already has done. and believe me, it has done enough damage.one of my favorite memories of my dad was when he would drive me to school in the morning, specifically during a time when he was listening to a cd box set of war of the worlds but set to some kind of rock music, with a lot of iconic rock tunes littered throughout the story. it was epic, and my dad would sing along to the tunes while we drove the 30 mins to my school. in fact, several of my favorite memories with my dad are when it is just the two of us, in the car. no threat of a fight from the dictator, no rude teasing because we both liked to sing along to the music, just the two of us, talking, or singing. it was an easy relationship because my dad was awesome. he was loved by everyone, he could walk into a room of people and they would stop and listen, because when he spoke, he was charismatic, thoughtful, funny and highly intelligent. he inspired the best in people because he genuinely saw only good.he was flawed, let’s not beat around the bush, i mean he chose my mother for goodness sake, there was some seriously flawed thinking behind that decision. he believed her narrative of me to the point where he was genuinely surprised that i went on to get an ma degree. convinced of my mother’s absolute knowledge that i was in fact stupid, he actually said to me, several years ago, “you know, if someone had told me a few years ago that you would have got your undergrad and your ma and been happy, i would never have believed them.” now he meant that as a compliment, but it just confirmed to me that her story of my lack of ability really affected not just my own self-confidence, but how others saw me as well. despite all the evidence to the contrary.he did his best to protect my brother and me from my mother’s toxic form of parenting, but to be honest, leaving her might have been a better option, instead he chained us to her by showing us that leaving her was not an option. i was 27 years old before i finally pushed back and 31 years old before i finally said no more. there was guilt in that decision too, but false guilt, born of a social norm that daughters must defer to their mothers no matter what and other family ties nonsense. my brother is still bound to her, despite his hatred of her and the damage she has wrought on him is far worse because of it.but even through all that, my father did the best he could, he loved my mother unconditionally and i learned that such love could exist, i saw where mistakes were in that love so i knew how to avoid it, but also knew how to show such love, to jump in feet first when it came knocking at my door, and i did.  dad was always happy despite his fun tendency to pontificate at the dinner table about the latest disaster or future disaster that was on the news or global horizon. he would engage us in conversations about history and politics to ensure that our minds went further than the generic box the english school system builds around young kids.and for that i am grateful, because it taught me to look for more, to read more, to always question. so i hope you can see, i had a great relationship with my father. so to have not really tried to call him since january, well, this is where my guilt comes from.my father has advanced frontal lobe dementia. it is so far advanced that he no longer says names, in fact my brother says he is almost non-verbal now. he is 62 years old. he has teams of carers that go in throughout the day because dementia is the least of his health issues. but it is the one that has robbed us of him. of the essence that was my father. and that is what makes it hard to call.  last time i called the carers were trying to get him to wake up, but they could not rouse him. they had me call to him through facetime, but it did not work, he was out for the count and sleeping more than ever. i called back about 15 mins later and he was awake, but only just. his face was vacant, even a little confused. he could see me, and hear me, but he was having trouble figuring out what he was seeing. he seemed happy to see me and said that he loved me. but that is his go to position, he loves everyone. he barely said more than “i love you”, there was little in the way of a response to any other question. the carers tried to get him to talk a little, but dad was not there. he has been there less and less over the last few months. stripped away to the very root of his personality, still kind, still loving, but in the most basic of ways, which i know is still a blessing, but it is still tragic to see. everything else that grew above those roots, that made him the unique power house of a man has gone. lost in the fog of dementia. it would be easy for me to say i don’t call home anymore because i don’t want to risk catching my mother. such accidental moments of contact are often aggressive and painful for both of us and are not worth the hassle. but in reality, it has become more and more painful to see him that way. i’m not there, i can’t wrap my arms around him and let him know that i am there. instead i have to look at him through facetime, relying on the kindness of the carers to hold the phone so i can see him and he can see me. it is so remote. it was my choice, i couldn’t stay there, we moved across the ocean for a chance at better lives and we got it and i am forever thankful and i know we made the right decision. but it means that i sacrificed having a few extra moments with him before he was swallowed up.and that is where my guilt comes from. every time i get through to see him, my day is ruined because all i see is the shell of the man he once was. i try to tell myself that he is in there somewhere and that he appreciates seeing and hearing me. but the emotional toll it was taking on me, it’s so selfish, but i couldn’t do it anymore. it would appear that the carers felt the same way as the odd time i have tried to call at the correct time to catch them, no one picks up. i think they find it hard to watch. or my mother has told them to stop answering the phone, which is possible too as they are afraid of disobeying her.but still, this should not stop me from calling him. should it…last night i had a very vivid dream. i was walking through a labyrinth of caves and tunnels, i was running with a friend, although it seemed to rotate through the different friends that i have. we were scared and running from something, trying to make it to the outside. when we reached the outside we were in a small hillside town that looked like an ancient ruin. the people there told me that my mother had driven my father out into the moors and was going to leave him there to die. i ran across those moors searching for him. fully aware of how terrified he must be all alone like that, stuck, abandoned. some people told me he wanted to be out there to die, that he wanted that, but i didn’t believe that and was convinced that if i could find him, i could bring him back.i didn’t find him. the moors were very clear, bleak, wintry, cold and unwelcoming with rocks jutting out. basically the worst kind of environment for a wheelchair and a sick man. when i woke, i just felt so drained and sad and afraid. i thought i had conquered my guilt and accepted what was happening, but i guess not.i still feel that sadness several hours later and i think it will be with me for a while. i’ll call him over the weekend, maybe. because that is the thing about guilt, once you have looked it front on, you have to decide whether to act on it, or stuff it back into the corner it burst out from. i’m not sure if i can cope with either option."," my heart goes out to you. i have had some similar experiences as far as family dynamic goes, though it is my mother with dementia now. the hard thing is when we have unfinished business, things we wish to say to our loved one with dementia, but we know they can no longer understand because they are lost in the fog of their disease. my advice to you is that if you think a call would relieve some of your guilt, you should fortify yourself in whatever way works for you_ meditation, yoga, a xanax, just whatever works for you personally (i usually have a glass of wine before calling my dad), and just do it. even if it seems he can't understand you, can't reply coherently, say what you want to say. we never know exactly how much the demented understand. sometimes way more than we think. they certainly recognize the tone of voice that expresses love. tell him your happy memories, regrets and that you love him. if you feel like apologizing for anything, now's the time.  i think it would lift a weight off your chest. sadly you'll never get an apology for the shitty things he said about being surprised you were able to advance in your education etc. i think it's best to just look at those comments as being from someone with huge emotional limitations who was just parroting what your mother said. my dad did similar, still does. and i'm not gonna lie, it still hurts and pisses me off, even though he is now a very frail, sick old man. but i also know i'll have huge regrets if i spend  our last conversations being angry, waiting for an apology that will never come, arguing etc. if you can still call him with love in your heart, i think it will be greatly to your benefit. there will never be closure between my mother and me either, and never be closure as to why father enabled her either. just have to move on as best we can, leaving ourselves with as few regrets as possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4dtqxh/the_thing_about_guilt/,The thing about guilt...

"i'm about to write to the va, but need advice, especially from people familiar with the va. main question: for ftd patients mobile and mostly physically healthy, how can you get more home aide care hours of watching them, if your local va clinic says your at the max? (obviously cheaper for va to pay for than alf's!)* i'm thinking of trying to do that and get 4 full days a week of home aide help (is now 8 hours), and maybe adding locks to the doors so my dad can't sneak out when we're in the bathroom. my mom is so stressed from caregiving that she said to research alf's, but i think this plan would relieve us enough to keep him home. my intuition tells me the alf would be bad, and trying adult day cares was awful, they upset him and he refused to do anything but try to escape and run home.* background: my sweet dad is 100% disabled veteran, 62, supposedly all his health care should be taken care of for free now. the va reasoning my mom cited is that he can do most ""normal activities of living"", he just needs to be supervised because he likes to go out of the house walking, 3x a day and obsessively say prayers at different neighbors lawn statues, crossing a main road often too. i try to always jump up when he heads to the door and walk with him so i know he's safe. (no issues getting lost, always goes the same route, knows how to get everywhere/home, careful around cars) he has to be cooked for, and cannot say many sentences anymore, or express himself well.* so he has to basically be monitored all day. my mom's taken great care of him the last 3 years, but the stress of this is destroying us health wise, we both developed high cortisol, auto-immune diseases, failing thyroids, anxiety disorders, went from healthy weights to obesity (despite working out and eating very healthy!). and he treats her like a piece of furniture mostly while hugging me every day, so extra heartbreak for her.the other day she developed a scary sounding cough, and i decided she can't do this anymore (even with me giving her time off 3 days/wk) i cannot lose her too and be alone in the world with no family (kind of selfish, yea).* [fyi: if everyone thinks ""va just won't give you more hours, only a nursing home"", i will simply visit my senator to change it. i am an activist thanks to my dad's influence and will not accept va status quo anymore]any advice welcomed!!"," first, you are absolutely not selfish. the amount of help that the va will approve will depend on the amount of assets your parents have. if they have only approved him for 8 hrs. of home care and/or a few days a week at adult day care, you are doing better than most. my mother has alzheimer's. she has private insurance, and medicare. neither offers any help at all for her daily care needs. my father was a veteran, and because of this, she would qualify for va assistance, but according to the va she has to many assets to qualify for their assistance. my mother is not a wealthy woman. she does have retirement but buy the time this disease causes her death, she will completely wiped out. my family is trying everything we can think of to make her retirement last, but we cannot predict how long this disease will last. my point being, we have tried every avenue that we can think of and more. unless a person bought and paid for a very expensive long term care insurance policy, there is nothing available in the us that will help anyone that has a few assets. private insurance, medicare, the va, they are all failing the elderly, and their families that have long term care needs. until the government forces changes, diseases such as fatal dementia's are going to continue to place the elderly and their families in very dangerous situations. please visit your senator!

"tl;dr caregiver for grandma, she be old, and i am burning out, any tips or such that can help?&amp;nbsp;apologies in advance for wall of text.  i had meant to post years ago, but problems kept changing and getting fixed that it always felt it would be out of date.&amp;nbsp;**about her**she is 92 years old, physically as healthy as one can be at that age.  (sciatica likely caused by years of bad posture, causes pain in her hips.  cataracts in both eyes, but successfully had surgery for that, eye drops basically done at this point).  i feel her problems are mostly emotional.  her late husband (my grandpa) was kind of an asshole, so there are likely years of emotional abuse.  so she has seemingly very low self esteem, and is constantly depressed.  she constantly tells me she cannot do anything because she is old and stupid, and despite my reassurance that i either do not feel that way, or do not care even if it is true, neither approach seems to remedy her emotions.as a side note she is also completely embarrassed by the idea of wearing depends, even though she clearly needs it, but i think i am slowly chipping away at that barrier, so less of an issue.&amp;nbsp;**about me**soon to be 29, male, typical gamer.  prefer to be alone in my room for days at a time, come out to eat frozen food and iced tea.  this is no longer an option.my gaming sessions are now a series of 10 minute games interrupted with me checking on her, asking how shes doing, what she wants to do next, and such and such.  obviously it would be best for me to not game entirely, but i find trying to do that i really burn out and lose the will to do anything.she was in a wheelchair at the peak of her sciatica problem, which as far as i know is not something that goes away, you just make it less suck.  after several pain shots, medications, and physical therapy, she is now able to walk on her own, albeit with a walker.  so i now do physical therapy with her 1-2 times a day 30 mins or so a session, every day every week.lastly i am not a talker, i have never been social, and kinda enjoy  being left alone.  but i now talk with her daily, for hours at a time, i have likely talked to her more than everyone else combined.  (likely an exaggeration but the statistic would be interesting.)&amp;nbsp;**options i have considered**assisted livingit seems sending her to a home is the easiest solution, but i will feel guilty.  i have been told numerous times that if we had sent her to a home years ago, she would likely not be alive now.  whether or not this is a good thing i am still unsure.the main 2 issues i have with sending her to a home, is she 1 does not want to go, which i assume is common, and 2 she really does not need to.  she is perfectly functional, not a real danger to herself or others, she is just pretty bummed out all the time.&amp;nbsp;familyshort answer is i am the 'family' help.  i am excluding her step-children as they seem less inclined to help, maybe a coincidence.  eldest son takes her and me to lunch weekly, eldest daughter is living in hawaii, youngest daughter is my mother, who does the majority of the work, and youngest son helps with taking her to dr appts and such.  getting help from the rest of the family does not seem to be in the cards, they know the issues but out of sight out of mind i guess.  my mom does a lot, but i refuse to ask her for more help because of it, i cannot increase the burden on her as she would be swamped even without my grandma in the picture.&amp;nbsp;at home carewe currently have some part time caregivers to help me out, it is mostly for companionship, cooking, and cleaning, it is more to relieve some of the pressure off me, rather than a substitute.&amp;nbsp;medicationi have been told this is a bad idea with someone her age, and i have firsthand experience that agrees.  when she was on pain pills for her sciatica, and we were in the process of weaning her off them she went crazy.  talking to herself, making no sense, crawling around on the floor, etc etc.&amp;nbsp;**the problem**i am thoroughly exhausted.  i do not know how to help her, and in the process i do not no how to help myself.  perhaps venting here will be enough to keep me going, and i have know idea what i expect to come out of it.  it just kinda feels good to write everything down.she is constantly complaining, despite what i do.  i do everything in my power to make her life as simple and pain-free as possible, but every time i turn around she is sleeping or staring at a wall.  i am trying to keep her awake and active, as i witnessed first hand with my grandpa what happens if you just sleep with no restraint.  she currently sleeps close to 12 hours at night, with a 1.5 hour nap after lunch.she tells me she is always afraid, but she does not know why.  my assumption is she is afraid that she is a burden on me, but it's that fear that is the burden.  she is always worrying she will do something wrong, or do things in the wrong order, or doesn't know what to do.  i have tried to explain, basically weekly at this point, that there is no wrong, i am proud of her regardless, all i want is her to keep active, and alert.  there are notes all over the house as my attempt to remind her of things, but i think after a while she ignores them.i have no children, but it feels very much like the horror stories i have been told about.  there is no rest, you sleep with your head in the hallway to keep an eye and ear open, you can never relax, always need to know whats happening, and i have very little time to enjoy by myself.&amp;nbsp;thanks for listening if you got this far, i've no idea what i expect from this, but i already feel a little better posting it, i hope this is the correct subreddit and i am not just further wasting people's time.edit - i cannot spell words."," hello there, have you considered adult daycare? it has activities and socializing she might enjoy. this would give you many hours of downtime from her as well as probably being very good for her mood.

"my 68 year old mother has had early onset dementia for at least 7 years and has been permanently in a home since my father died about 3 years ago. before her illness both my parents said that their worst fear was being in a state like my mother's and would ask me to kill them if that ever happened as i am an only child. of course i would always say i could never do that, but i'm pretty sure my parents made a pact.    the home my mother is in is great and considered to be the best one in my country and generally she has been as happy as could be expected. a few weeks back she started having seizures and ended up in hospital. after spending a week with her there it was shown to be caused by general brain atrophy so adding anti-seizure meds to her routine was the only thing they could do. she used to be a very active wanderer, but due to the inactivity during the hospital stay and the risk of falls she is now in a wheelchair. her difficulty speaking also got a lot worse to the point where i very rarely was able to understand her anymore.   my mother sometimes thinks i am my father now and when i visited this weekend i showed her some old pictures. she started crying a bit and repeatedly asked me if i would do it now. it was one of the few whole sentences i had heard in a long time. i asked her what she meant and intimated that she wanted to end it, that she was done. she asked me to pray for her, and she hasn't been religious her whole life.   obviously i could never even consider that, but it makes me so sad to think that she is that unhappy and there is basically nothing i can do about it. i had thought she was too far gone to formulate thoughts like that, then she blindsided me with this.    i'm just trying to process this and wonder if anyone else has been through anything similar?"," funny, i was just thinking of a scenario for myself in the future. i can see my father going thru some bouts of confusion and imo the beginning stages of alzheimers. if i ever get like this, i no longer want to live and hope will be crystal clear to my family that if 2 doctors diagnose me with it, that i want it to be over.  iirc, oregon allows for one to kavorkian oneself, but i dont know the ins and outs of it.  maybe you have to be in more worse health issues, again, not sure.  but there is no way in hell that i want to live in any minor state of alzheimers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4dedaf/anyone_had_an_experience_like_this/,Anyone had an experience like this?

"hi everyone,i'm in my final year at university and currently waiting for my 60 year old father's diagnosis but according to most doctors it's some sort of dementia. i was wondering if other people around my age (25) had been or were facing the same challenges at the moment? i've lived abroad quite a lot these last few years and so did my siblings so no one is really around my mother to help out looking after my father and i get that this is incredibly hard on her especially as there have been some pretty brutal changes in the last few months (my father can no longer work and he can barely speak...), he's also become aggressive towards her saying some pretty nasty things. my other siblings don't really care about the whole situation and we're not in touch. i kind of carry the ""emotional"" burden of my mother, i'm the only one she'd talk to about this and for now that's all i can do.she would never ask me to move back in but i can't help wondering if that's what she wants. i've asked but she said no, that it would mean wasting what i have done these last few years.everytime i'm home she does say that he is calm and cheerful when i'm around and she feels less stressed out. the thing is i'm at a crossroads in my life too. i'm about to graduate in international relations and there is no way i can find a job in this area in my hometown and i hate myself for even thinking like this especially when i know what my mother is going through on her own but what did you guys do? how do you feel about your decision to go home or not?i'm also puzzled because money-wise things have been shit lately for my parents, i'm financially independent so i'm ok but they are not as they just lost my father's income and closing his business turned out to cost a lot of money... so i'm also thinking that if i got a good job after graduating that could be another way to help.i feel like i'm reacting like a child, i know what to do, where i'm expected and that moving home is the right thing to do but my very selfish side also dreads going home because that would mean no future perspective for me. anyway some advice or anything is welcome. i'm just rambling here as i guess i needed to write this down and get some outside opinions.thank you and good luck to all of you out there going through some shit."," my advice? if you can, your father should be placed in a home. that way, your and your mother's lives are not pretty much destroyed along with his as the dementia bites deeper and deeper into his memories, personality and functioning. you and your mom can then both be freed up not only to live a good life yourselves, but you will both be in the best position to, hopefully without guilt, secure a career and employment and therefore the fund to keep him as well and as happy as can be.source: been there done that :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4d123a/awaiting_diagnosis_decisionmaking/,Awaiting diagnosis.

"**tl;dr: is it elder abuse or illegal for my mom to just stop taking care of my elderly grandmother who legally is in charge of her own actions? does my mom need to turn her over to the authorities to take care of her or sometihng?**not sure this is the right place to post this, but i will give it a try.my ngrandma has been emotionally abusive to my mom for her whole life, and as a result my mom has basically been brainwashed into thinking that she is kind of worthless and that she has to keep taking care of her nmom. ngrandma only got diagnosed with dementia a year ago, but my mom has been helping her a lot for 15+ years, and the demands just get higher as the years go on. ngrandma refuses to accept that she has dementia, and says that my father (who she hates) told the doctors that she has dementia and that's why they said she did. she thinks they are all lying. she is physically in bad shape, she has had two knee replacements, she has really bad back problems and her legs are not the same lengths which causes her to walk hunched over and unevenly. she had her gallbladder removed in november so she is supposed to be on a low fat diet, but she doesn't like it, so she just gets diarrhea all the time, sometimes on the in her pants/on the floor. she has fallen a number of times and hasn't been able to get off the floor without both my mom and me picking her up. she was in the hospital at least three times last year because she fell and hallucinated and called the police. despite all of this, she refuses to go into a nursing home or get home care. she is *somewhat* open to home care, but i know she wants someone white, educated, and preferably jewish to take care of her. in the meantime, my mom is the only one who takes care of her, sometimes with my help. she is constantly abusing my mom by criticizing everything about her from her appearance to her life choices to her children's behavior. she calls my mom every day, gets in long arguments with her, asks her to come over and help her clean up all the stuff she has all over her bed, asks her to buy her food but then can't think of what she should eat, makes her take her to doctors appointments, etc. if my mom were to stop taking care of my grandma, would there be some kind of legal ramifications? does she need to like, tell the police that there's an elderly woman who can't take care of herself or something? my grandma legally has capacity which means she is legally in charge of herself, so i don't see how there could be any legal requirement for my mom to take care of her.also, is it elder abuse to tell an old person you wish they were dead? because i have said that to her, not because i am threatening to kill her or because i really want her to die, but because if she dies then she will go away. if we could just ship her off to siberia it would be just as good. anyway, she keeps threatening to call the police and implied that i will go to jail for saying that to her because it's elder abuse. i don't think we are abusive to her, and if we are ""technically"" abusive in some way, it's only because she is so abusive to us and we can't stand her, but my mom also pretty much fails to see any way to not be in this position despite other people explaining ways to get out of it."," are you in the us?  no one is bound by law to care for their elderly parents.  if she has capacity, then your grandmother's care is up to your grandmother.  even if she didn't have capacity, it has to go through court to be made legal.   i've been through the same thing with my narcissistic mother.  she has dementia and is the most vile, evil person i know. i tried to get her guardianship because she has dementia and can't take care of herself.  she got her cousins to fight me over it. i had her in a very nice assisted living home.  the cousins won, mostly because my mother was mad at us and didn't want us to have guardianship....and took her home. every single caregiver her cousin has hired quit, one stating my mother was the devil. now the cousin is sick of her and has gone to try to get her guardianship reversed.  we've called adult protective services because she was living alone and because they took her and had everything signed over to them.....house, money, car...  the combination of dementia and narcissism is a very volatile mixture. she has told every lie she can think of about us, to everyone she knows.  last week, we were all served with papers.  she's taking us to magistrate court over some of that crazy stuff. i haven't spoken to her in a year, and i will never speak to her again. my advise is to get your mother out of there. if she's a true narcissist, she will do everything in her power to control and manipulate both of you into caring for her until she dies.  my mother is 78 years old. has dementia, with paranoia and psychosis (tested by her psychiatrist).  she has been left alone in her home, can't cook for herself, can't take her meds the right way, can't use the machine to check her blood sugar, can't drive... but still able to wreck havoc in our lives.  i understand how you feel. when i was reading this, i thought you were my daughter.  then i read back over it and saw where your mother is still caring for your grandmother. we all despise my mother.  if you can convince your mother to stop caring for your grandmother, you can call adult protective services and file a report about this poor old woman who can't care for herself. you don't have to leave your name.  tell them you'reta neighbor or something. they have to go check on her if you call. your mother will not get in any trouble. if they call, just tell them the truth.....she's abusive and you and your mother can not be around her.  then get you and your mom into therapy. mental abuse is a terrible thing. good luck. feel free to private message me. i hate that you and your mother are going through this.

"hi everyone! i hope someone on here can help me, because this is eating me up inside and i feel i can't talk to anyone about it. this is about my mom. she's 58, turning 59 this year, and i am very worried she might be showing early signs of some form of dementia.now, my mom has always been a little forgetful. so am i in fact. we tend to laugh it off when she does stuff like forget the keys somewhere or why she enters the kitchen for seemingly no reason. but these last three or so years i feel she forgets more and more and i am increasingly getting worried. a big thing with my mom is repeating herself when it comes to talking about things that have happened to her recently. she might in a day say the same thing four or five times, albeit a little differently every time. when reminded that she's already mentioned this before, she often scoffs at it and doesn't seem to take the comment too seriously. i've confronted her about it, but she claims she is aware she is repeating herself but just wants to make sure we're hearing her out and not just nodding along and not paying attention. i find this explanation a little strange, especially so since her repeating herself is a big reason my dad tends to ""just nod along"" at her stories.another thing is that she seems to forget nouns and even what they mean much more frequently now than before. she will at times forget a word she needs in a sentence, look around for help or inspiration, and more often than not find a different word that means something similar or just neglect finding a word altogether, adding ""you know what i mean"". last night she even forgot the last part of a well known idiom, which is especially worrisome considering my mom has always, always been known to recite idioms perfectly. i learned another troubling bit two days ago, when she had told her new boyfriend i didn't like wine at all. now, not only do i like wine very much - my mom and i have shared many a bottle of wine over the years in fact, so i felt quite distressed that this had not only slipped her mind, but manifested itself as me not liking wine. when i told her this, she seemed surprised.i've also discovered she tends to forget what she has in the refrigerator. today she bought eggs despite the fact she has a full carton already, as well as salad and cheese she already had. now, i realize this is pretty common for many people, but she also neglects to throw out bad food very often and forgets she has it.do i have a reason to be worried? my mom is otherwise quite fine. she works as a nurse and has always done so (working with patients suffering from dementia, somewhat ironically), enjoys reading and cooking and is quite fine in managing her own life. the only thing she struggles with is understanding and using new technology, but that's always been a hard thing for her and not something recent. i've talked to this with my dad and my sister and both agree she's been more forgetful recently. she just doesn't want to admit this herself, and i don't know what to do if it happens to be dementia.does anyone have any advice for me? am i blowing this out of proportion? i realize i might worry too much, but i love my mom so much and just want to do the best thing for her."," your mother is a nurse and, as such, is at high risk for several treatable things that can cause memory loss. one treatable disorder common in older female health care professionals is [ hashimoto's thyroiditis](",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4ciiiu/worried_about_my_mom/,Worried about my mom
"hello,i am a college student living away from home. my parents both worked close to minimum wage jobs, but the area they live in allows them to live semi-comfortably. i am an only child. my mother recently lost her job due to increasing forgetfulness. with their income essentially halved, my father has to work every hour he can get to keep things afloat. i work a work-study job here at home and send as much as i can home monthly. they have other issues as well. my mother has constant doctors appointments that we have to find friends and relatives to go with her to, because my dad can't always take time off from work. her neurologist found that she has a cluster of ministroke activity in her frontal lobe, and general brain surface atrophy. they don't have an official cause yet, or type of dementia.  it's been a crazy downhill spiral since she lost her job. i can see the red flags in hindsight (getting lost on trips that should have been familiar, misplacing keys/credit cards).my mom and dad have worked with her neurologist to get the paperwork she needs to file for unemployment and then disability, but to be honest my parents are completely unfamiliar with any of this stuff. they applied for unemployment first and even though they haven't even gotten it yet they are getting letters constantly saying that if she doesn't go to the assistance office to show that she's been applying for jobs she won't get unemployment. i feel helpless here. although she still seems completely functional from the outside, if you have a 10 minute convo with her its very clear there's an issue. her cognitive testing has been dismal. she's like a mix of 10 second tom and drew barrymore from 50 first dates. she'll yell at my dad for not cleaning something, and then 10 minutes later forget that they've talked and come back in and yell at him again. does anyone have any resources or advice to offer? i'm particularly scared that she's home alone so often. even though we've sat her down and talked about how money is tight now, she's still doing stuff that costs quite a bit of money constantly, both with and without any actual money. i'm always trying to put out fires but can't do much from out of state. any advice/tips?"," call the local hospital or health & welfare department (county, state, etc) and ask if there are any social workers that will help them, and if there is a cost for that service.i'm sorry for all of this--i know it must be hard on you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4cfk4m/51_year_old_mother_has_dementia_advice/,"51 year old mother has dementia, advice appreciated.

"so i live with my 80 year old grandmother who has dementia but it is just starting to progress to the point where she can't completely take care of herself. she can do just about everything for herself, but gets confused with her medication. so i moved in just to help her deal with her pills, and help her take her blood sugar and insulin every day (shes diabetic as well).lately she's been getting more and more forgetful. stuff like what she had for lunch or breakfast that day, whether she had gotten her newspaper or not, if she had called any of her friends to chat that day. most of the time its not a big deal. if i ask her about something we had talked about before or she had told me her friend said, and she doesn't know what i'm talking about or is adamant she had never said something i just let it go and say never mind instead of arguing with her. i figure its better than her getting all worked up or confused because she can't remember something. but i'm not sure how to handle it when its something that i can't just let go, something that has to be confronted.today for example. trying not to go too into detail, she had had some issue with constipation recently. when she was talking to my mom earlier in the day, she told her that she had gone to the bathroom this morning and yesterday morning. so my mom told her not to take any of her constipation medicine. but when i got home in the evening (not knowing about the conversation she had with my mom), she said that her stomach was bothering her and she hadn't gone to the bathroom in days. she has stuff she is supposed to take when she gets blocked up like this so i told her i would get some for her. she told me, ""no, your mother said i'm not supposed to take that stuff."" not knowing anything about that i called my mom and heard about their previous conversation. i bring that up to my grandma and she's saying she never told my mom that and she hasn't gone in days. but still won't take the medicine ""because your mother told me not to"".""why would i lie?"" is usually what she falls back on at this point. and i don't think i should be blunt and say you aren't lying, you just can't really remember things anymore.so i just don't know what to do in these situations where her forgetfulness has to be confronted. i don't want to argue with her about it because it just gets her more and more upset. but there are times like this when i have to get the bottom of it, because i either need to give her medication or not. similar things have happened with eating and not knowing if she really needs an insulin shot or not."," sorry you are having to go through this and that you posted over a week ago with no answer.  you are correct to not argue - it does not help when the brain is misfiring. still, it's easier said than done. contact the local alzheimer's assn to see if they offer suggestions; there's also an 800 number, but look locally also.  try calling the council on aging and see what she may qualify for.  i am not a doctor, but i recommend researching all of her meds for side effects...what is the cause of the constipation? how's her health besides the diabetes and forgetfulness?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4bk10f/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_my/,Looking for advice on how to deal with my grandmother's increasing forgetfulness

"my grandma has dementia and i am more than done with all the shit i have to put up with day in and day out. i am literally pulling my hair out every single day just trying to move on with all the stress i have to deal with.let's just start with a few things i have to deal with:1. name calling: my grandma is very religious and i'm constantly being called a ""demon"" or i should go die because she doesn't like the way her food is prepared, she blames me for ""supposedly"" for going into her room, or just for something so menial and retarded i just can't.my grandma loves to believe that everything is mine mine mine: this one really irritates me and just overall makes me want to punch a wall, because no i'm sorry but not everything is hers. after she's done eating she likes to take the plate and silverware to her room because ""she bought it"" and it is supposedly hers, and once it is in her room it then is lost forever in the dark abyss of her luggages (she doesn't use a dresser despite one being in her room). you don't know how infuriating it is having to buy and waste money upon buying new plates, cups, you name it just because my grandma took it. not to mention, she believes every single one of my own nike shoes is hers, clothes of either my own or my moms are being stolen left and right, and just recently she stole my dogs fucking sweater. i don't know about anyone else, but when my own shit is taken i feel as though it is an attack on my own very existence, and best believe until whatever is stolen is returned i will not stand for such bullshit.2. too many questions: i feel as though i just tape a sign to my forehead that reads whatever question she's asking, and often times it's the same god damn question just asked over and over and over and over and over again. it'll really drive someone nuts. sometimes i get so tired of answering the same questions over and over again, so i just flat out ignore her and when i do that she gets mad that i don't answer her questions. i get so frustrated with this one because she asks questions such as ""where's my mother, father, or brother?"" and i of course for the millionth time in row have to break the news that they of course are all dead.3. she walks out the door: this one is truly my favorite as it requires me to waste my time and physically chase after her around the neighborhood. if my grandmother is truly upset, because of whatever reason it is she loves walking out the front door and going who knows where. you don't know how many times i've had to call the police because she wouldn't get into the car with me, and come back home and sometimes i feel so embarrassed having to call the police. not to mention, just recently when she walked out the house she started to throw rocks at my car and wanted to hit me with a stick.4. hygiene: this one is just really fucking gross and there's no easy way to put this. but once my grandmother is done taking a dump sometimes i notice she doesn't really wash her hands even though there's a huge sign in the bathroom mirror that reminds her. all she does after depositing her shit is splish splash a little water and a smidge of soap onto her hands and doesn't even properly scrub. not to mention, she hasn't taken a shower since like november and me and my mom try and try our best to urge her to take a shower but no as she thinks we are attacking her.these are the things that only just scratched the surface of what i have to deal with day in and day out, and i know what everyone is going to say, it's the disease don't take it seriously, just brush it off. no. i am done brushing it off and i am taking this shit seriously.i also just want everyone to know that i am only 21 years old. i am a full time college student. so on top of all the stress of my classes at school i have to deal with the stresses at home. also no, i don't have the means to go out and live on my own. i'm certainly not a trained professional and unfortunately i am only getting paid a measly $200 a month (under the table, i am not on the payroll).clearly my own mother does not see how stressed out i am as she does not have to deal with her as i do. sometimes when my grandmother comes home from her senior day care program i have to either use my own money to buy her food (which she doesn't even eat sometimes) because we are out of groceries. alternatively, i do not feed her at all and wait for my mother to come home from work which isn't until 5 to 7 at night and my mom is too tired from work that she doesn't prepare dinner until 9 or so and the diner isn't done until 10 or 11. all the while my grandmother goes to sleep around 8pm-ish and is thusly too tired to wait and eat the diner my mom has prepared. so it is really my fault that sometimes my grandma does not eat at night? in my own defense, no it is not.this is just a copy and paste from a post i made previously. but this is an update, as i truly feel as though i need to kill myself because i cannot take the stress any longer of living with my grandmother. i have already cut myself within the past week and bang my head against the wall several times. i cannot guarantee what will happen in the future. i live in the state of california, usa in sacramento and if someone could just pinpoint me to a website for an assistive care living or a lock down facility. this would truly be helpful to me."," i remember your previous post. did you look into state funded nursing homes. they can only charge the income the person has. your local alz. asso. or your counties council on aging should be able to help you (i mean your mother) find a facility. your grandma needs to be in a facility. you should not be taking care of your grandma. i realize your mom is tired and stressed also, but if she cannot get dinner fix before 9 pm when she has a mother with alz. waiting to be fed, she does not need to be taking care of your grandma either.first, your mother should be trying to get your grandma into a facility with a little help from you. not the other way around. second, if your mother makes excuses not to put your grandma into a facility, puts it off, or tries to put this responsibility totally on you....well i'm probably overstepping when i say this but, if i were you, i would flat out tell your mother that you would not be available anymore in the afternoon's to take care of your grandma. period. come up with a good excuse like i will be studying at the library or with friends or a study group or whatever you can come up with. i would stick to my guns no matter how guilty she tries to make you feel. i would make sure i was not at home during those hours anymore. this will force your mother to do something about your grandmother. right now she does not have to because she has you. the only other thing i can think of would be for you to get a part time job and move into an apartment with other roommates. i know you are young, and putting your foot down and sticking to your guns, no matter what (like guilt and religious jargon), and making big moves can be scary, but if your mother does not change this situation, you need to find a way out. you are to young for this. you need to get your education. one other thing, go talk to a counselor at school. pour your heart out. let the counselor see how stressed you are and how destructive this situation is for you. maybe they will be able to help you convenience your mother that this is a very bad situation for you to be in.i'm surprised the day care has not said something about your grandma's behavior and hygiene. i'm starting to believe the real problem is your mother, not your grandma.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/4a5e3n/someone_please_help_one_of_these_days_i_truly_am/,"Someone please help, one of these days I truly am gonna kill myself."

"hi there. i need some help. i've posted about my mom before, she is 70 and started showing signs if dementia about 4 years ago (forgetting/repeating things). its gotten a little worse every year, this winter we pushed her doctor to order an mri to try to get a diagnosis. in the mri we discovered a brain tumor (meningioma in the olfactory tract), after consulting with 4 neurosurgeons they recommended we remove it due to its size and proximity to eyes and other vital parts. my mom had issues with her sense of smell (we thought related to dementia/alzheimers) and her memory issues. no one knew for sure whether it would help with the memory issues though, so we decided to move forward and try.  surgery was a month ago. the recovery has been tough. she went from being able to live independently with mild cognitive issues to mid-late stage dementia overnight, needing 24 hr care by nurses. brain surgery is tough, she could barely stand up, needed help feeding herself, walking, bathing, etc. she didn't realize she was in recovery so having her just try to get up or fall off the bed/sofa/chair was a constant worry. since the operation  she has improved a ton physically, she walks pretty much on her own and feeds herself and can go to the bathroom on her own. great. the only serious issue now is her *mind*. it just hasn't come back. she has constant delusions, thinks she's someplace else, asks about deceased folks, etc. as she gets stronger she even has fits of paranoia and kicks her nurses out of her room and refuses to take meds. these episodes last about 1-2 hours only but it takes a pretty big toll on my dad, we never know when they might happen. she doesn't get physically violent, just stubborn in her reality. her neurosurgeon is perplexed, says her mind should be recovering by now and has tried different memory/antipsychotic/antischizo drugs but they haven't helped. he's reshuffling her meds to see if anything works. i honestly think this is beyond his scope at this point. i have no clue if this is a botched operation, extra long recovery or something entirely different. it all happened so suddenly, it was shocking. i still can't believe she will stay this way.  we are going to go see a geriatric doc next week and maybe do a cognitive study, her nurses recommend we see a psychiatrist as well. i've got no clue and taking it bit by bit. if anyone has any tips or recommendations i'm all ears. thanks!"," lewy body dementia? .as far as the decline, it's normal.  my elder went from mild to ""oh shit we've got to get them into assisted living like yesterday"" more or less overnight.  they got a respiratory illness, then they got complications on top of that.  we thought they were a goner health-wise, but they rebounded.  when physical health declines, it can amplify any dementia present.

"hey folks. not sure if this topic has ever been discussed on this sub but i'd like to share our experience. i'm 57, caregiver to my wife. she's 58 yoad diagnosed in 2008. we have 2 caregivers with her while i work a 40-hour work week. one quit a few months ago - lately my wife has fits of mania, totally uncooperative, aggressive, etc. the intensity of this has increased over the past few months and it cost us a caregiver. through it all i've been trying various meds prescribed by her neurologist. seroquel, lexapro, xanax, etc. nothing worked - seroquel makes her damn-near homicidal. neurologist say to up her dose. total idiot. so medical marijuana was legalized in massachusetts awhile back. i recall my daughter mentioning ""we should try that on mom"". i laughed it off. with all the recent turmoil though, my daughters devised a plan to conduct an experiment with some cannabis candy. long story short:  game changer. wife is calmer but not whacked-out stoned. her cognitive ability has improved - i shit you not. just little things but it's improved. easier to manage, pleasant and, most importantly, she's reasonably happy most of the time. yeah, we're all making the obvious jokes (grateful dead, tie dye shirts, yada, yada, yada) but the fact it this has eased both our burden and her burden. i've always rolled my eyes at the mention of ""medical"" marijuana - condemning it as just another way for stoners to legally get high. drastically revised that thinking as of late. this is not a commercial for marijuana law reform - i'm just sharing my experience with the hope that it might help someone else. also, please don't think i'm advocating some kind of fish-oil-like cure here. this is all about managing her care, nothing more. i would be very interested in hearing other folks experience with this. thanks for listening."," hey there, i just began searching for people's experiences with this in ma. my grandmother is in her 70's and is becoming increasingly difficult to manage. losing, misplacing belongings, repeated questions and forgetfulness isn't much more than a nuisance however she's very aggressive. my grandfather has been her rock and we're a very small family and so we're all involved in one another's daily lives and i can see how much his efforts in keeping her calm is taking a toll on him. most of the time i feel like this'll end up getting to him before her. she was always in tip top shape, health conscious, physically active and brighter than anyone i've known but this has definitely turned her into a different and angrier person. most medications that her doctor has prescribed haven't worked - she'll get nauseous, dizzy, and puts her even more out of her mind. i'm hoping marijuana can be somewhat of a solution since it's a natural substance (quite frankly, the lady was always opposed to even advils/tylenols so i'm not surprised the medicine hits her hard). have you begun the process of making marijuana part of her daily regimen? have you found it difficult to persuade her doctor? i'll make sure to talk to her doctor this week and ask about it but personal stories always give a better and well rounded scenario.

my mom has been living with dementia for three years.i have been unable to see her for two years now but ever since they put her on depakote she is having problems controlling her bowl movements and has been put in diapers.she is also sleeping half the day away and has become extremely skinny.does anyone have advice about dealing with this drug?i do not think it is working well for her...help...please," don't know if you can blame the drug (though depakote is very potent). the residents i took care of who were on this became pretty zombie-like. it did help aggression in the sense that they mostly just sat in a wheelchair drooling and crapping on themselves. however, if she is in/approaching the middle stages of alz, that would be about when many lose control of their bowls and forget to eat without lots of prompting and offering of snacks. their taste buds start to go, and they lose interest in food. i agree with the comment that you should talk to her doctor. a potential alternative medication that is known to have less side effects with old people is seroquel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/48mk8b/mom_on_depakotenow_she_seems_worse/,Mom on Depakote...now she seems worse

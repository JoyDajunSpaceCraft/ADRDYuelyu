"my grandfather was just hospitalized. he was very dehydrated and he wasn't talking once he got to the hospital. that is, until my aunt took off her mask. i think he completely did not realize people were speaking to him as he couldn't see their mouths moving, he could only hear voices but didn't make the connection. they were worried about him choking on his pills (because he wasn't speaking) so they wouldn't give him his alzheimer's meds. i just wanted to notify other people of this if you've experienced it - that they may not be talking because they can't see your mouth moving, and hearing your voice may not be enough. another note: they didn't feed him for 2 days. not even with a feeding tube, i'm actually infuriated that a hospital could forget to feed an 85y/o."," is it that they forgot to feed him or is there a living will on file that states no feeding tubes? my parents both had very specific conditions in the living will they had/have on file with the hospital that they did not want feeding tubes. after my dad's stroke, he changed his mind thinking he could recover, but when they found his gliioblastoma, he didn't want to be kept alive to slowly die and told hospital staff no more meals. as his poa, i had to push to make sure they didn't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hw6nwm/note_about_alzheimers_and_masks/,Note about Alzheimer's and masks
my mom got diagnosed early onset 5ish years ago. now she's at the stage where she sits down for 2 mins and then gets up and walks around. which doesn't sound like that big of a deal. but she's running into furniture getting bruises. and also sitting/stepping on pets. is there anything you would suggest to help her stay seating for any reasonable amount of time? not sure if there's a seatbelt for couches or something that would help. thank you.," i've heard of pet collars that have flashing led lights that vision/hearing impaired people use, to help them see the pet easier, so as not to step on them.  or at least fluorescent collar.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hw2ihv/anything_to_help_keep_them_sitting_down/,Anything to help keep them sitting down?
"hi all,thank you again in advance for your advice.i'm wondering if anyone has any experience with the crisis care list in ontario. the situation with my grandmother just keeps escalating and escalating and last night she accused my grandad of murdering my great-gran (who has been gone for 20 years and died at 97 in her sleep). this was while she was holding a knife, so the safety concern has gone from her running away to potential stabbing. my grandad spoke with the geriatric team we've been working with along with their gp and the consensus is she needs to go on a crisis care placement list.the problem here is that my grandad cannot drive due to poor vision, and our understanding of the crisis list is that she can be placed on a list 100km from where they live. they're up in simcoe-muskoka so that could be as far south as barrie and extend up to north bay. so we're worried about this for obvious reasons. we're also worried as all research has been shown that if we turn down the first bed the case file gets closed and we have to start again.does anyone have any advice on how to navigate this all?"," so, i had experience with this starting winter 2017 until spring 2018 when we got a bed. what happened with us is that yes, it was the crisis list, but we got to choose locations. first, we chose our top 8. we numbered them in order of favourite, to least favourite. after a month or two of no movement, they asked us to add more options. so we added a few more. then we did get the same push a few weeks later to add more. at the end of it all, from december til beginning of may, we probably had maybe 20-30 locations on our list. and got the one that was at the very top of our list.so while we had some local spots and some further out, we ended up getting lucky. it really just is the luck of the draw. also, related but not an answer to your question - do your research. the governments website has links to all reviews and audit inspections of homes and you want to know what you’re signing up for - and what homes to avoid.good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hvb334/crisis_care_list_ontario/,Crisis Care List Ontario

"hello! approx. 8 years ago my dad (65m) was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer’s at the age of 58 (when he started showing symptoms). he’s progressed steadily and recently (about 1 year) does not know how to go use the restroom or bath himself. whenever he finishes doing his business, my mom tries to help him change his diaper but he is extremely violent and punches/hits you and refuses to change his diaper. my mom has so many bruises as a result of his hitting despite me (17f) trying to help control him during those times. his strength overpowers us and when his anger spikes, his eyes get immensely big/dilated and the rims of his eyes are super red. when trying to bath/shower him he simply does the same and tries to hit you along with cursing at you, yelling things that don’t make sense, etc. it has been hard to care for him especially since now on the daily, he yells, curses, at literally nothing and hits himself and wanders which impairs our day to day lives as well. medications that the doctor prescribes do not seem to help the symptoms. we do not have the money to send him into a nursing home, neither do we qualify for medicaid so i was wondering if this is a common symptom for alzheimer’s and at what stage this is, how long he has left to live, etc.  sorry this was super long but i just had to get it all out there.", talk to an elder care lawyer. i’m sorry you have to deal with this,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hq1hkv/alzheimers_dad_violent/,Alzheimer’s Dad Violent

"my grandma lives alone with her sister in a house. they are both in their 90's, but everyone has been unable to make them consider a nursing home. they do okay on their own, surprisingly. no major incidents except some driving problems which helped us convince her not to drive anymore. unfortunately, the past year or so, we've all noticed a significant decline in her mental functions. her memory is bad. she misplaces things, forgets words, and oftentimes struggles to keep up with a conversation. she finally got a diagnosis of alzheimer's which was quite disheartening to all of us but at least confirmation of what we were seeing. the doctor has shared these findings with her, but she is by and large in denial of the problems. she thinks the diagnosis is part of a plot. she thinks she is fine, and refuses any kinds of medication. her sister has is not helping, claiming that she sees no issues and oftentimes just jumping into onto the side of my grandmother in even the most minor disagreements. i guess siblings really are for life!she is a remarkably intelligent woman and frankly one of my heroes. she is a true example of a strong woman. the flip-side of this is how stubborn and aggressive she is. i've seen how she fights them every time they try to make decisions for her. it oftentimes has felt to me that she will disagree with someone just to be the one making the decisions, arguing points that don't make sense just to win. alzheimer's has just made this that much worse, now becoming mixed into with a combination of paranoia, anger, and fear.lately, she's taken to calling me and telling me her conspiracy theories about my parents. some are quite sinister...that they want to kill her and take her money. others are somewhat benign...my dad comes over to mess with her plumbing so she'll be forced to move out. all of it is hard for me. i try to not say i believe her conspiracies but also just reassure her. ""i'm going to take care of you no matter what."" and ""don't worry, i'm looking out for you. whatever happens, you're going to be safe."" and so on. that being said, sometimes these answers do not satisfy her. she wants me to agree that these conspiracies are happening and i just try to change the subject but she's very forceful. a few times i've had to tell her that i think she's being cared for. it's easier if i agree with her, but i don't want to feed her delusions.i'm only 30 and work a lot. she calls me quite often these days just looking for reassurance. i've read many patients find themselves alone and not being listened to when they get alzheimer's because peopel just can't handle the pain of the discussion but i'm trying to just pick up no matter what unless i'm at work or asleep. i just love her so much and i don't want her to feel alone or scared. she is very religious and although i'm not in church much anymore i just try to pray with her whenever i can. it always makes her feel better and cry.i don't know why i'm writing this, maybe just wanting to share my story and hear i'm not alone. it's so tough to get her calls and see the woman i've known my whole life fall apart. i can't even imagine how my mom feels...anyways thanks for reading."," i recommend you contact your county aging office and local alzheimer's organization. meet with them and fill out their paperwork now to try to qualify your grandmother for free services. their goal is to keep people in their homes for as long as possible. the responsibilities/stress level of the caregiver is taken into account, so open up about what you are doing and how hard it is. my mom qualified for grants for 40 hours of aide help per week, a free monitoring bracelet registered with the police (reaearch ""wandering"" and ""sundowning""), and i have received tons of good information. your grandmother may not be ready to accept aides in the home right now but it won't be that way forever (especially if she gets properly medicated-she is going to need a geriatric psychiatrist  unless her neurologist will prescribe psych meds) and you will have help lined up for her. the medication that removed my mom's combativeness and paranoia is olanzapine.  it increases appetite. she won't eat unless she is on it.  she takes quetiapine for anxiety/fear.

"my grandmother is doing worse and worse. she doesn't believe she has dementia/alzheimers (i'm not sure what type she has, and doctors aren't sure either) and believes her late husband is still alive and walking around. it's heartbreaking. because she doesn't believe she is sick, she doesn't want to go to a care home. so my mother, an only child, is arranging the whole legal process to get her out of her house: it is simply not safe for her anymore.she told me about what my grandmother will experience: after having a judge's order to go to a care home (and finding a place in a care home) an ambulance will come and get her. my grandmother is very stubborn and can get aggressive; i believe she will not leave her house without a fight.the way my mother described the way they will forcefully get her, maybe even tie her up on the stretcher, sounds horrible and inhumane: but it will be the only way.&amp;#x200b;my question is: how do these kinds of traumatic experiences affect someone with dementia? &amp;#x200b;ps neither my mother nor i will be there when the ambulance gets her... is that bad?"," hello, i am a nursing student who has been displaced due to the covid-19 pandemic. i am not a doctor, so the things i write should not replace the advice given by your doctor/physician, but i hope that i can still be of some help. alzheimer’s disease is known to be a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative disease that affects 11% of people ages 65 and older (harding, kwong, roberts, hagler, & reinisch, 2020). although the exact cause of alzheimer’s disease is unknown, there are a combination of multiple factors that may lead to it. some of these factors include aging, family history, cardiovascular factors, and head trauma. the characteristic findings of alzheimer’s disease are often related to changes in the brain’s physical structure and function. these changes can relate to the loss of connections between neurons, neuron death, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (harding, kwong, roberts, hagler, & reinisch, 2020). due to aging, people naturally develop plaques in their brain tissue. in individuals with alzheimer’s, more plaques start to appear in different parts of the brain. there are different stages of alzheimer’s disease which include mild, moderate, and severe. there are also specific diagnostic criteria that doctors can use in order correctly diagnose the type of alzheimer’s your grandmother may be having. some of these criteria include, but are not limited to memory loss and confusion, issues with abstract thinking, short-term memory impairments, changes in personality, decreased judgment, and difficulty doing familiar tasks (harding, kwong, roberts, hagler, & reinisch, 2020). there are several diagnostic tests that can be performed during an assessment which include neuropsychologic testing, psychologic evaluation, mini-mental state examination, cbc, ecg, serum levels of vitamins b1, b6, and b12. although a traumatic experience like such may be difficult for patients with alzheimer’s/dementia, it will definitely be very short, and she will most likely forget that it happened. the important thing here is that she will get the proper care she needs at the care home. most people are often nervous because this will be a completely new setting for them, but once they become oriented to their new care providers and environment, they will eventually calm down and become more comfortable. it is also important and helpful for family members to be involved within the patient care. it is important to be aware of what alzheimer’s disease is and understand to be patient with someone who has it. staying in touch with the patient and care givers, receiving updates, and involving yourself in leisure activities are all great ways to cope with the disease.  best of luck!referenceharding, m., kwong, j., roberts, d., hagler, d., & reinisch, c.

this journal article was published on the 30th june 2020. following this case study a clinical trial is now underway.," first note - this is a case study on a single patient, with no controls or blinding.    secondly, the patient was also suffering from a c-diff infection, which is what the fecal transplant was actually given for.  since the c-diff infections cause a variety of secondary issues, it's no surprise that the patient overall had better function after the transplant.  you really can't take anything away from this in terms of alzheimer's, as the c-diff infection is too large a confounding factor.  all this to say, there is zero evidence right now that fecal microbiota transplants  can help with the symptoms of alzheimer's, more careful research is needed. please do not attempt this for yourself. since this is an new, unregulated field, there are case reports of patients receiving fecal transplants who have died because the transplants contained pathogenic bacteria that then infected the patient.  one more note - the above poster seems to be a ""fecal microbiota evangelist,"" and has posted nonstop about the topic in several subreddits, so it is not coming from an unbiased source.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hj6myr/rapid_improvement_in_alzheimers_disease_symptoms/,"""Rapid improvement in Alzheimer’s disease symptoms following fecal microbiota transplantation: a case report"""

"my father (72) has alzheimer’s and he is just a mess. my brother lives in california, i live in colorado, and our parents live in kansas. my dad began showing symptoms of cognitive decline about 8 years ago and has been on medication for about 3 years or so. my parents were out last weekend for a short visit. we hadn’t seen them for 7 months and while i keep up with my mom and the state of my dads health regularly, there’s been a major decline in his behavior. he is 100% dependent on her. if he doesn’t know where she is, he gets very agitated. she can’t work, go out with her friends, go to church choir, or really anything any more. my dad often doesn’t know where he is or even who she is sometimes. she tells me that he will pack up his room thinking he needs to go home but when she asks where home is, he doesn’t know. he’s getting paranoid. recently he woke up in the middle of the night thinking there were people outside and got all sorts of agitated. they live on a golf course and he spends his day near this pond right near the backyard gathering sticks and golf balls obsessively. apparently he finds golf balls and washes them and has managed to gather an entire tub full. when she tries to lock doors and keep him inside, he will pull and rattle the door so hard that he has ripped off the doorknob. she has tried to get him in adult daycare a couple times a week but that didn’t work. the caregivers couldn’t keep him busy enough and he was constantly disruptive and agitated because he didn’t know where he was or where my mom was. right now she has someone come to the house two mornings a week so she can run errands, but she can’t stay at home those days because he is constantly under foot. most concerning to me was when they were here last weekend. i took them with my kids up to the mountains to this park/trail and he spent the whole time gathering dead limbs and trying to push over dead trees and piling them up. this a public open space, so not ok. i tried to redirect him and get him to stop, but he won’t and got so mad at me for even attempting to cross him... just looked at me with such anger i thought he was going to snap. i worry that he could get violent. my brother and i don’t know what to do or how to advise or help her. he can still dress himself and take care of his bodily functions. so it’s like he’s not far gone enough to go to a home and even if she put him in one, it wouldn’t work. they would have to sedate him or something, which is just awful. 1) the meds he’s on don’t seem to be doing much and they are it’s just keeping him in this awful middle area where he functions just enough but i wonder is it crueler to both of them to keep him this way. should we council her to stop them? she had asked us this before. 2) what do you do with a patient like this? i want to urge her to start the process of putting him in a home but there is no way he will just watch tv and do crafts. they used to live on a farm and he is used to open spaces and wandering and working outside. i think that’s why he obsessively tries gather yard debris and chop down trees all the time. but he can’t do this where he lives now. sorry this is so long, but i thought someone here might have some insight."," i took my mom off prescription drugs, years ago. this is eighth year that i've been with her. five years ago at easter, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and ever since, i've had her on a single low dose of cannabis oil daily. she progressed through her cancer treatment with minimal need for pain medication, and the adverse behavior (anger, argumentative, etc.) from alzheimer's, is virtually gone. the disease is progressing, but she is happy, and we're still able to manage at home. i urge everyone to check with someone knowledgeable about this compassionate therapy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hgvm77/my_brother_and_i_want_to_urge_our_mom_to_take_our/,My brother and I want to urge our mom to take our father off his Alzheimer’s medication

"i did read that alzheimers could be contributed by a chemical that is released when our sleep is interrupted or not getting enough sleep. i have thought that for many years due to the fact that when i'm falling asleep and still slightly awake i start to feel my mind slipping and sometimes would hear voices, hallucinate stories in my head as if they were real, or think the song playing in the background is me singing. etc. and we've all experienced stuff like that and that's pretty normal i hear?"," if your concerned about your sleep, talk to the doctor about it. he may have you do a sleep study to figure out how your sleeping patterns are and if you are getting enough r.e.m sleep.there has been a few studies that find that a lack of r.e.m sleep can lead to an increased risk of stroke and development of brain disorders later in life.

"hi everyone,tl; dr - have questions about finding documents. is this an appropriate place? i'm glad i found a supportive community with so much experience and information at their disposal. i hope to be more frequent and provide any support/ideas i can :)i somehow just found this sub and have been reading some stories between searches. my apologies; i've been caring for my mother since i graduated with my b.a. in 2013. family fell apart, ptsd, etc etc. i can work much better if i deal with things ""clinically"" as a research project versus commiserating right now. i'm sure others here vacillate between being ok and the smallest thing prompting a breakdown into a pile of goo :) i'm afraid i've already rambled; i've got a complete and total poa/medical poa for her and her husband. i have some information, but mom has developed the habit of just throwing stuff away.mom was the one who ran the house and knew where everything was. they had a filing cabinet with everything - much of which was (probably?) lost in hurricane harvey. my step dad has somehow turned from decent to a legitimate impediment to me or anyone helping. my role has always (supposed to have) been to take care of paperwork, making decisions with doctors, etc. (quick: i'm the durable/medical poa sans restrictions for mother and step dad. also executor of inherited trust which names only me and brother)anyway, the whole story is quite long but i'm struggling with things which i know can be done without a lawyer in texas: * how to find **if** various things exist prior to her death (401ks not rolled over; life insurance, etc)* how to get a will done. they have no real assets (see harvey), but there are things in the house i want for my brother and i. i can't write the will because i'm poa and a beneficiary. i have no idea if she has a formal diagnosis of alzheimer's/dementia, but it's pretty clear if we took her to anyone that she's not in her right mind. * i've taken care of loads of things but i know there are things i'm missing. i've never coordinated end of life/funeral/estates, etc. i have a cursory knowledge of legal stuff but don't know what all goes into death and bequests, etc.i sincerely doubt ~~idiotic~~ stepdad will try to fight me on anything - beyond yelling and being a victim, naturally. he assumes that he'll lose, neither of us have money for attorneys, and the trust/estate/movable property aren't large enough to survive through a probate trial, i'd imagine. if you made it this far, thank you so much for your patience. &lt;3 i'm a grad student trying to finish my master's if only the ~~stepdad~~ family would stop making messes for me to clean ;) i'm certain i rambled; i'm exhausted all the time and other life demands, etc. i also apologize greatly if this isn't the proper forum. please delete me and, if possible, could the mods behind the curtain direct me to a more suitable subreddit :)thank y'all again &lt;3"," hey there! it’s really great that you’ve stepped up to care for your mom. it’s a hard job but we do it :). so in re: finding documents, life insurance: i don’t have any formal advice but i will say that i learned about a lot of my parents documents by digging through my parents things. my dad used to be super organized before his decline so i had somewhere good to start but even now that everything is a mess, i still find important docs by going through their things (file cabinets, closets, etc). in re: getting a will, poa, etc: i can really only speak for florida but i was able to get poa over my dad because he hasn’t completely declined but for my mom i had to petition the court for guardianship (going through that process now). the court must first declare her incapacitated, then after legal proceedings will be able to grant me guardianship and some of the powers that come with guardianship include being able to adjust her will (from what my attorney told me, but this could be wrong). john p google, esq. (lol) could possibly help you figure out how guardianship works in your state. i’ll warn you now, it was a bit costly (but that’s because we had a lawyer) but doing it on your own should only be filing fees and the like  i hope that helped a little bit and i wish you and your mom all the best :) and remember, you’re doing a great job!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/hcekjl/grateful_for_tips_for_mother_in_tx_on_downhill/,Grateful for Tips for Mother (in TX) on Downhill SlopeRe Paperwork/Will/etc

"good morning. my mother is moving in with us in her very early stages of alzheimer's. we are doing a home renovation which is leading us to add and replace the locks.  she is a smartphone user and very high functioning at this point, but i worry that with the move to my place she will regress a bit. i'm not sure that we will be leaving her at home but it probably will happen. i have been thinking of a wi-fi connected door knob, so that if she gets locked out we can let her back in. i would imagine that i will also install a smart doorbell so that if she forgets her phone as well, she can ring us to let her in.  oddly, mostly all that is available is wi-fi connected deadbolts. does anyone have any opinion on the basic use of how a deadbolt would work versus a doorknob? i'm not talking about technology, just the day to day of using one. i am kind of slightly worried about relying on a deadbolt automatically locking and how it would work. any advice would be great.  also i have kids ages 3 to 12, so that is also consideration as to making their access easier if needed."," i use the schlage connect deadbolt.  it would have been great to use with my mother. we also have ring and smartthings to connect everything together. the deadbolt is easy to use...it also has a key for back up. but it would be easy for everyone to use and also set up for automatically unlocking when a smartphone arrives. i also have it automatically lock after a few min, so there’s no worry of anyone forgetting to lock the front door. the only problem i would have had with my mother is that she would sneak out eventually.  then i had to take drastic measures and key the deadbolt from the inside. i hated doing that, but she was wandering down busy roads at all hours in various inappropriate clothing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/haqvec/looking_for_door_lock_advice/,Looking for door lock advice

"hello all,my father is 71 years old and has been fighting dementia and other such issues from the time he was about 65. he's a vietnam veteran and worked in construction his entire adult life. he retired at 64 and within a year was in two car accidents that clearly happened due to lack of reaction time and slowing mental capacity. the first accident was significant (the front axle of his truck fell out after he clipped the back right of a turning car when he didn't see its left turn signal until the last two seconds). the second he clipped another car in a parking lot while leaving. this is when we stopped letting him drive. brain scans after the accident did not indicate anything out of the ordinary.he really began to decline from 68 on and was diagnosed two years ago with pca (posterior cortical atrophy) which is considered an atypical form of alzheimer's and there is some debate on whether he has parkinson's disease or not. from what i have read, pca mostly affects visuals but anyway, he's clearly in the throes on dementia. he cannot be alone, he's losing his memory, asks the same questions over and over again, struggles with walking, etc. my mother makes too much money apparently to not receive any assistance through the va and he did not plan for his retirement and thus does not have long-term care insurance.my mother is in the midst of starting a divorce so that he can apply for medicaid without draining my mother of all of her assets so that we can put him in a suitable home. we have fought for two years about whether dad needs to be in a home but everyone has come to the conclusion that dad needs professional care full time.my sister and i watch him on our alternating days off. my mother is younger and still works full time. my other sister just had a baby and cannot assist. a family friend who is a professional caregiver takes the day-shifts two-three days a week. my two older half-brothers (one who is well off and the other who is not) live out of state and refuse to get involved despite my pleadings. my mother is a difficult woman to get along with and has too much ""pride"" to continuously ask for their assistance (trust me, i've tried).we do not want to put dad in a home currently if we can avoid it for the short term because of coronavirus. he survived lung tumor surgery at 50 and had 1/3 of a lung removed so that would definitely not go well.he can still feed himself, shower himself, go to the bathroom, brush his teeth, shave, etc. he cannot dress himself without assistance. as i said, he cannot be alone anymore, other than for an hour in the morning when he's waking up. after that, his anxiety is too high and he panics when he's alone for more than 5 to 10 minutes.he does experience sundowners during the day that is sometimes super hard to deal with. my sister has gotten medical marijuana for him and that does help somewhat.also, as i've heard with other dementia patients: the man will not sleep.he will sleep for an hour or two at the start of the night and then gets up every hour after in the night to go to urinate. he had his prostate ""steamed"" a year ago due to frequent urination (he was on flomax before that of course) and his lack of sleep was unbearable to everyone. but it has not helped. he cannot retain urine. he needs to urinate at least 7 or 8 times a day and all night like i said. when he urinates, it's rarely more than 50ml at a time.his neurologist says that it is completely dementia related and anything we try to do with a urologist is useless. melatonin has no effect.we finally had a geriatic doctor give him benzodiazepines a few months ago and it had absolutely no effect on his sleeping habits, he continues to get up every hour of the night.does anyone that has experienced a similar situation know of something that will help my father sleep through the urge to urinate? his lack of sleep is leading to premature deterioration and i refuse to believe that nothing out there will work. i hear that they will not prescribe dementia patients certain sedatives because of fall-risks but we need something to help him until this pandemic has subsided and he can get professional help without immediate risk of his life.anything we can ask the doctor about is greatly appreciated."," heres a few i've had patients on.1. melatonin; almost all of them take 5mg of melatonin before bed.2. antipsychotics have a sedative effect; so, risperidone; olanzapine.3. benzodiazepines 4. sleeping pills such as, zolpidem, zaleplon.5. antidepressants such as, nortriptyline.recently a lot of my patient are using 1;3 ratio cbd/thc oil. when used before bed, seems to make them more comfortable. usually .50mg.results vary from person to persons, and doctors may prefer one over the other depending on the situation. hope this helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/h94f8u/looking_for_advice_on_medications_to_ask_a_doctor/,Looking for advice on medications to ask a doctor about for my father who has dementia and refuses to sleep at night.

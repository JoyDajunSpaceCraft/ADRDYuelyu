"hello,i am a industrial design student from the hague university of applied science. my project group and i have to design something to improve the situation in elderly homes, specifically the triangle which is the elderly, caregiver and the family.due to the current situation with covid19 we are not able to use more effective research method such as interviewing or observing the elderly and their environment.therefore, we have to use digital ways to do our resarch and we chose to start with a survey. it would be great if you guys could fill it in, in order for us to better understand the caregiver point of view and basically deliver a better product. the survey only takes less than 5min and is anonymous.thanks in advance,here is the link to the survey:["," i’ll tell you what kind of objects i need right now.1 -a gps tracker that will work on a 3-4g system (since 2g is being phased out)- that has a refresh rate of at least once per minute - and has a battery that will hold a charge for at least 3 days, optimally 7, with a highly mobile person - that is inconspicuous and can be attached to a keychain i’ll give you $200 cad if you could actually make this by the summer.2 - a tv remote control that is simple enough for a senior or their psw to operate. 3 - a simple-to-use device that will stream only the shows the person with dementia wants to watch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fo9vzu/help_us_understand_how_it_is_to_deal_with/,help us understand how it is to deal with dementia as a caregiver/family
"my dad has vascular dementia, and has always been very active. he no longer can work or drive but loves to walk around the small country town my parents live in- this part isn't the issue. he goes to the supermarket several times a day, i think because he feels useful if he can go for his walk and do something like bring home some milk. usually these are things the family doesn't actually need, but that's a whole other issue.  right now, it isn't safe for him to be doing this. he is very bad at keeping up his hygiene, and gets very upset and angry when we try and enforce things like this for his own good. we have tried now telling him the shops are all shut because of the virus, but obviously on his walk he forgot this and ended up at the shops anyway. so i told my mum she will just need to enforce that any items be cleaned thoroughly, she supervises him washing hands etc. but he really becomes very angry when we do things like supervise or make sure he's doing something properly, because he wants his independence and he thinks he's doing things right and doesn't need somebody telling him what to do.he has other health issues too and we are really worried, but don't know what we can do. any suggestions?"," have you tried framing it as something he can do to help keep you/your mom healthy? as in, ""dad, we're scared about this virus. if you catch it, you might pass it on to us, and we could get sick or die."" a lot of men (especially men your dad's age) see themselves as the caretaker/protector of the family. especially for their wives and daughters. so this approach might work, if you can make him believe it's something he's doing to keep you safe, rather than the reverse!sorry you're going through this. it's just impossible to get people with dementia to use common sense about this stuff, and they can be *so* resistant if they feel they're being infantilized. it's just really rough. i hope you can figure something out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fo1mdu/dad_loves_walking_and_goes_to_the_shop_many_times/,Dad loves walking and goes to the shop many times a day

"posting here because i don't understand my own reaction to the helplessness of a family member who  has memory loss. my 81 year old relative has been on opioid pain killers for pain for years and has alway also been drinking at least one bottle of wine a day. when she lost her husband a few years ago, the combination of shock and drugs triggered memory loss/dementia. the psychologists have only diagnosed memory impairment, which seems ridiculous as my relative is essentially completely helpless and relies on a team of 3 people to stay alive. she's had numerous severe health issues which she barely survived and has to be reminded to eat or drink throughout the day. either way, she is safe but i cannot wrap my head around the situation. my relative has always relied on her husband for everything and was always kind of lazy. i am trying to understand if her complete refusal/incompetence to do anything is due to memory loss or laziness. she has memory loss and is probably in the beginning stages of the illness but basically does not do anything out of her own motivation safe for watching tv and reading. i am somewhere between frustration and worry because i love her but at the same time cannot ignore the mounting frustration that this person is just super lazy and lets herself be served by her team, which is often struggling to tend to her every need. (some in the team are paid professionals, other are friends). effectively, i struggle with my own emotions because i feel i am harsh by criticizing her for being ill, but she hasn't been diagnosed with dementia. i am repulsed that she lets herself go like that - and it doesn't help that she is in complete denial that she has essentially become completely incapacitated. she thinks she is perfectly fine and seems to ignore that it takes a huge effort just to keep her alive. any thoughts would be helpful. is this a normal progression of dementia? im i an inconsiderate asshole by thinking she is not helped if everyone tends to her like an 81 year old baby? thank you.", depending on the opioid it can take months to wean them off,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fjo6hv/can_anyone_relate/,Can anyone relate?

"so, i'm 19, only child of a single parent with no other family to speak to and my mom is likely going to be diagnosed with dementia with lewy bodies.i received a call while i was across the state at university that my mom had been committed because she was acting erratically, hallucinating and stopped taking care of herself. i drop everything and come back home to find that she had trashed her room and our housemates many videos of her running around screaming at nothing. when our housemates called the cops to get my mom to a hospital, the er said she hadn't eaten or slept in three days. she was severely dehydrated, malnourished and basically suffering full blown psychosis.she remembers none of this, and what she does barely recall, her memories have been rewritten to the housemate doing crazy things.i had noticed things here and there - forgetfulness, general slowness and trouble moving the way she used to - but both of us chalked this up to her just getting up there in age (she had me later in life and is in her mid-50s).the onset of the hallucinations/delusions seem to coincide right after i left from my winter break. we had an extreme fight that caused it and while i know there's a variety of factors in this, i can't help but feel at least partially to blame for adding to the large amounts of existing stress that weighs upon her.i'm only a sophomore in college. we have no savings, we only have medicare insurance and the house we live in isn't ours - us and the housemate are just renting rooms. i don't want to drop out to take care of her because the financial strains of me going to college would all be for naught and i doubt i can support both of us making minimum wage at a grocery store.

"if this is jumbled i’m sorry. please bear with me. when i was in high school, about 7-8 years ago, my grandpa went to see his aunt and uncle in mississippi, he had a heat stroke or heat exhaustion, can’t remember which. they had to restrain and sedate him because he was fighting the nurses so hard. my grandpa was probably around 140 pounds at the time, he’s always been lean because he’s very active. he basically raised me, more than my dad or my mom truthfully. he’s always called me squirt, and when we finally got to mississippi from tennessee, he was just waking up from the sedation and didn’t know he was restrained and i was the only person he recognized. he woke up and looked at me and said “hello squirt!” and asked me to scratch his beard and he seemed fine. now, he has either alzheimer’s or dementia and me and my mom go see him every weekend so my grandmother can go get her hair done because it’s her “one out away from him” i’ll get into that in a second. the last 3 weeks, he’s not known me or mom. a little over 2 months ago he knew who we were and he was repeating stories a lot, just standard stuff people with alzheimer’s or dementia do. he fractured his hips ages ago and it’s now gotten so bad that the head of his femur is basically gone, just a big bright spot on his x ray. he and my grandmother have been married for 55 years and my grandmother has always been kind of awful to him. for 54 years he has waited on her hand and foot, coming from across the house to give her something that’s not 5 feet from her. well the last year is when things have really started getting bad. my grandmother, who knows that we will fight for my grandpa tooth and nail, has told me and mom and just about anyone who will listen really, that he’s doing all this “just to spite her”. we finally get him an appointment to see the best specialist in the area to get him officially diagnosed and start a better treatment plan and possibly get him in studies and she schedules a fucking hip replacement surgery the week before the appointment. this is after she had put off making the appointment for the referral for 6+ months and making an ass of herself scheduling the appointment because they didn’t have an opening until april and she thought that was too long to wait. so his primary care got him on some memory meds which had been helping and then my grandmother cut his dosage without telling anyone or consulting the doctor. she screams at him, she argues with him, and if he pisses her off too much she wont feed him. she refused to cook him breakfast or supper the other day because he “threatened her with a knife” after he had cut up his shirts. my grandmother is also very dramatic so what we assumed happened is the same thing he does to me and mom occasionally where he’ll pull his pistol out of his pocket a little and say “do you see this? i take it with me everywhere” (spent casings are in the gun, no live bullets by the way, we’ve already thought about that). speaking of the gun, my grandmother also said she should just take that gun and go out in the backyard and shoot herself since he “hates her so much all of the sudden” and “she doesn’t understand what she did wrong”. we’ve tried to get her to take classes with us on how to care for people with these diseases and she says she doesn’t need anyone to tell her how to take care of her husband. i understand this is hard on her, it’s hard on him, it’s hard on all of us, but she’s not making this any easier by treating him like a child and talking to him and about him the way she does. i feel so guilty for not seeing my grandpa as much but i can’t stand to be around when my grandmother is there because i can’t tolerate the way she talks to him and how she talks about him like he’s not there and i can’t yell at her in front of him because then i’m acting like he’s not there too and i refuse to treat him any less than i ever have. all of that said, how do i stop being so upset about this all the time? if i stop being busy all the time, or work gets slow i start thinking about all of this and i start to cry and i can’t do that at work. i would love to do therapy but i work 60 hours a week and my schedule varies so bad i can’t really set appointments as far out as they usually require and i don’t have a ton of money to throw at it. i’m already on anti-depressants, i just don’t know what else to do. tl;dr- my grandfather has maybe dementia and mostly doesn’t know me anymore and his wife is terrible maybe abusive. how do i stop being upset?"," everyone is offering to help her, to take classes with her, to come and sit with him through the week so she can do whatever she needs to, but for some reason this is the only time she’s ever had trouble asking for help and then when we can’t sit with him for 8 hours on saturday when she threatens not to come home, she says that we don’t do a damn thing for her or him. they’re both early 80s, and she’s so stuck in her ways. therapy is a bad word, depression and anxiety are just cop outs and so on. we’re trying to help her, she just won’t take it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fh7jg8/how_do_i_stop_mourning_my_grandfather_when_he/,How do I stop mourning my grandfather when he isn’t gone yet?

"hi, i know only a doctor can judge fully correctly over this situation, but i’d like some insights to get a slight idea what to prepare for.my mom has always been an apathetic person. it has grown worse over the years, but seemed to be the only ‘noticeable’ thing. she’s also a bit slow intelectual wise, wich has also been something slowly changing through the years but not hard. since october last year however she started having incontinence problems, fast forward to now and the situation has escalated to not being able to drive her car anymore as she can’t concentrate well enough anymore and is a danger to others and herself, forgetting alot and asking a question altho she has witnessed the situation said question is about like 5 minutes before, asking something and just staring at you when you answer, or just randomly walking in a room and stare blankly. except for a basic routine she also doesn’t undertake anything. like if someone will point out she has food around her mouth i have to tell her to clean herself. for a while we all tought she just grew more apathetic, but last week while discussing with a doctor what we could do to arrange her home for the falling isue, he dropped that he has heavy suspision of early onset dementia. thinking about it now, we already discussed putting up reminders around her house too, and i now see that’s not something you normally have to do for a 50 year old you know? at the time it didn’t ring a bell, but seeing it in perspective it does seem odd. a few weeks before we started setting up a neurologist appointment and scan for falling  (idk how relevant this is: somewhere before october she started having balancing problems to the point she got to see doctors and they found an infection in her eyes that doesn’t give any problems and her falling down was shoved on poor balance from her ears (she has bad hearing too) so we have to wait until april to know for sure and so far she doesn’t know anything about it. we’re currently dealing with some personal stuff about investments too so we’ll probably meet up with a doctor before too tell her about the suspicions and arrange some caring stuff  before it becomes a state thing if she wants to get help with decisions but i just kind off want to ask here what you guys think maybe? i’m just feeling very lost as how i can help her when she gets told it might be this (even it doesn’t turn out to be, but all boxes fit so that seems like a small chance) as she has always counted on me very hard and doesn’t deal with emotions well as she barely has any. she also knows i know my fair share of medical info as i have health issues myself and i want to make sure she can count on me.. i know the best thing to do is tell her to await april for sure but she can’t let go of stuff that easily as she really pins on certain stuff. i’m sorry this got so long and a ramble and probably includes some misspelling as english isn’t my first language. i just have no clue what to expect as she’s apatic so i don’t feel like all ‘internet experiences’ fit and idk ugh, i just hope someone somewhere can relate a bit to the apatic + early onset dementia to sooth my mind, sorry.", i’m a nurse on a dementia unit. all i can say is good luck. stay strong. it’s a rough road for the family members but try and cherish her as much as possible and support her. i’m not too sure if there was a question in your post.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fg36ch/young_onset_dementia_in_an_apathetic_person/,Young onset dementia in an apathetic person.

"hello guys, i am hoping some of you may be able to help tell me if these are possible early signs of dementia. my mom has been displaying some behaviors that are beginning to conner me, but each time one of these happens she explains it as if it were normal.examples: 1. we were walking dogs with my mom and fiancee, my fiancee was about 25 feet in front of us the whole time. my mom decided that she wanted to walk down to a caul de sac instead of going straight down the road. again we were facing straightforward with my fiancee in front of us. my mother turned around the opposite direction yelling my fiancées name looking for her to tell her to make a left. when asked what the heck she turned around for, she said she just got mixed up cause she was looking to see if he cat was following us on the walk (which he does sometimes, but it really seemed like she thought my fiancee was behind us)2. she's been doing small things that could be dangerous such as leaving deck door open and unlocked, leaving water in bathtub, leaving candles lite when she leaves a room. all of these things she feels are normal and if questioned about them she thinks we are being nitpicks.3. she is about to have her first grand child and she has been counting down the weeks. there are about 5 week remaining. she told me that her ride to a surgery for next week was cancelled. i offered her a ride and she responded that she would ask my sister instead cause i would be busy with my son....i text her back that my son wasn't going to be born next week. she replied ""oh shit, you're right! i may need a ride."" 4. we saw her using her knife at dinner with the cutting side facing up. she said that she just grabbed it without looking and that it wasn't a big deal. 5. she cut a banana in half and left half on the kitchen counter all day cause she didn't want the whole thing. while this may be a thing others do, she has never ever done this before. when my dad was upset she left it out all day, she told him its his fault for not eating the other half in the morning. 6. we bought a timeshare last year for family vacations. this year she instead chose to book a bus tour during the same week. what concerns me more is she was saying how she was thinking about sitting on the swings near the lake with her soon to be grandson at the timeshare. i had to mention that she booked another trip and wouldn't be at the timeshare this year. she explained it away as it was just a daydream. 7. she asked me if i wanted a stroller from her friend 3 times. i said no each time. she took the stroller from her friend and a few times now has said ""i wish you would take your stroller to your house""...she did this with a rocking chair as well. so here's the thing.. she has a surgery booked next week with full anesthesia. ive heard anesthesia can really have negative affect on dementia and alzheimers ..... can anyone let me know if these seem like occurrences you may have seen in family members too? if she is at risk of it worsening with anesthesia, i'm not sure she should have surgery. she is planning to retire and take care of my child within a few months. fyi- she doesn't think she has an issue and will not seek medical help."," print this out and get it to her doctor/surgeon asap.  just a call and an email would probably do.   if she has an underlying neurological condition they need to know before surgery.  this will reduce harm to your mother, and they will definitely act on it because it would open them up to major liability.  so call that office, and send them this breakdown asap.best case: they call her in for an evaluation and find the underlying condition, treat it, and she's better or is in treatment at least.acceptable case: this is just her normal, surgery goes ahead as planned.worst case (very improbable if you talk to the office asap): surgery goes ahead as planned, anaesthesia makes her symptoms worse, she gets diagnosed and is in treatment for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fdwxr8/help_identifying_possible_early_signs/,Help Identifying possible early signs

"hello everyone,i'm writing this after i wrote the wall of text below. my dad is in his late 60's, he was diagnosed with dementia about 3/4 years ago. in the last half year i noticed things going south with my father fast. i felt the need to share my thoughts because i never do. sorry for the way to long and uncoordinated story, it could be way shorter. i tried to rationalize my thoughts and situation(i'd like to think i'm pragmatic and this brings peace to my mind) and just started writng my thoughts. it was kinda fun to do actually, the anonimity helps. english is not my first language so forgive any mistakes  :')growing up my father was always working, he would do anything for you when you needed him, but in day-to-day life we didn't see eachother much and a lot of the care for me and my siblings was done by my mother. when i was young my mother and i didn't get along well, this was mostly my fault for being a stubborn adolescent. i can now realize how much effort she put into helping me grow up but then i tried to put as much distance between us as possible. she can be very controlling and trying to manage things(she pretty much controlled everything in the familiy's affairs). i think a lot of that has to do with my father not taking this responsibility as much and she sorta grew in this position. i know that sounds negative towards her, though i'd like her to relax more i know see means the best, always. after high school i moved to a different city for school. this was around the time my father got the diagnosis. after around a year or so my father had to retire because they started noticing my father forgetting things which made him not suitable for work anymore. now he finally has time to relax, get a hobby etc but all the initiative left my father. he stopped doing anything by himself. expcept his daily routine. we live on a farmhouse and we have horses. it's the on thing he always made time for, it was his only past time activity. he takes care of the horses and does chores outside, while completely living in his own world and sorta 'zoning out'. he loses tools a lot and is probably searching for something he lost about 2/3 hours a day. checking the same spots over and over and looking lost. he reads the newspaper 4 times a day and eats his standard food. he almost never leaves the house and although my mother tries a lot to keep him socialized by inviting people etc, and i try to be there as much as possible. he has to few interractions with people. at this point my mother has to think for two people all the time, she takes control over everything that happens with my father. my father needs some guidance so it somewhat needed, but when my father does something wrong/forgot something she gets angry at him and pushes him a lot. i know she doesn't mean it, and a lot has to do with the fatigue/stress/negative state of mind she's in. i can see it puts my fathers brain in overdrive and it hurting him. lately he can react angrily back aswell, in my entire childhood i can maybe remember one time he got angry. i had to move back to my parents place for a few months because my lease ended and i didn't have anything lined up. this meant long commutes but at least i could spent more time with my parents. my mother had someone to talk to about things, which helped her a lot and i tried spending time with my father. i recently got a new place to live again and tbh i feel like shit for leaving those two alone. i know things will go south again and i hate seeing my parents being unhappy, but travelling 3,5 hours every day next to my internship and being there for other people all the time fuck'd me up. lost weight, slept awful which eats you up in combination with an office job and i seriously hated life all-around. i was in a bad mood and i noticed i sometimes would deflect that on my father... i know at that moment that it's wrong but i get this angry feeling and i gues someone with dementia is an easy target to deflect on. to give this thread some purpose instead of me being emo i'll end with a question.does anyone else experience this? due to fatigue/depresive thoughts getting irritated and putting pressure on the person with dementia when they do something wrong/lost something/forget something? e.g.: he/she loses the car keys. i fucking hate myself afterwards. i want my father to have the best remaining years he can have. much, much love to anyone dealing with this fucked up disease, in a way it spreads to the brains of closed ones of the dement person."," being in denial is a part of the disease too. i used to think of it like walking on a field, with your view straight ahead, you stumble and fall into a hole because you cannot see it. the same is for them. since your mom needs to be in control, help her approach the doctors and your aging and disabilities center to see what assistance they can give her. sometimes we, the care givers, feel like we are asking for help for things that we should just be able to do. this is our blind spot. whatever you do, know you aren't alone and grief has so many layers. you have the parent relationship that you are grieving, you are grieving for them as a person and you are grieving for your own self. you grieve the time you lost, the time you have left and for the future. perhaps you are grieving for the impact that it puts on your home life, those you interact with and your personal work life. this is a tough disease not for the faint hearted, and the kicker is, we didn't choose it. you aren't alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f9i4tp/dementia_my_dad/,Dementia & my dad

"over the past few months my problem with anxiety seems to be getting above me, i have suffering with excessive anxiety and panic attacks since the age of 14, this is just a bit of background.over the past 12 month i have definitely noticed changes in my behaviour. i have become a hell of a lot more forgetful, things such as forgetting what i went to the shop for happens quite often, also i have noticed that i will be finding things i've been looking for in weird places like, my phone in the refrigerator or a pair of scissors in my trouser pocket (i actually wrote a post about this in a different sub a while back)for some reason i get the feeling that i know where something is but its like my mind ignores it, i know, it may sound weird but it's very hard to describe.it really got to me the other week though, when someone asked me what my second eldest childs birthday is, and i didn't know... i couldn't even remotely remember, i could only remember the year.what kind of father forgets his child's birthday? i know that once in a while people do forget things like this but i've checked the calander and reminded myself multiple times and still fail to remember. at the time of writing this, i don't know my daughters birthday and i don't know why.my gp showed me a website of different online quizzes and questionnaires to try out, i know that ""online diagnosis"" is criticised, but i got asked to do these to help narrow down my problems with anxiety. alas, i saw one for young-set dementia and curiosity took over and i took the 2 minute test and the reading came as a strong indication of the illness.now, under no circumstance am i using this test as a diagnosis but even the symptoms linked directly exaggerated anxiety and panic. and yes, i answered questions with honesty. do my symptoms resemble anything that anybody or anybodies relatives suffered with before being diagnosed with dementia. i'm 23, i feel stupid for even thinking it may be a possibility but there's plenty of reports out there of people developing dementia at young ages and it's just playing on my mind a bit. thanks in advance for taking your time to read this and any advice would be much appreciated."," i've been medically diagnosed by competent doctors with gad (general anxiety disorder) and suffered from frequent panic attacks. at the height of it (where i started disassociating for weeks on end due to ptsd induced by my work activities), my short term memory was totally shot. i'm 100% sure if i had taken a mci (mild cognitive impairment) test back then, i would have tested positive. in other words, i want to reassure you might 'only' suffer from anxiety, not dementia. i know it sounds patronising - i was the first one to fight all the doctors who initially diagnosed me ('no, it's not that, i must have brain cancer', 'anxiety doesn't feel like that') - but trust me, please give it at least a chance that you might be suffering from gad. it's not 'just anxiety' , it's paralysing and can destroy your life, just like dementia. it's no laughing matter and you should take it seriously and have it diagnosed and treated (if that's what it is) as soon as possible.good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f8umtf/dont_know_where_to_start_im_only_23_long_read/,Don't know where to start.

"how often do folks succeed in getting durable power of attorney with immediate effect for a loved-one/family member?we don't have a diagnosis yet but i'm sure mom is firmly in the late-beginning stage of dementia of some progressive kind. i live with her. a brother who is the current primary on a ""springing"" poa/advance directive on file with the hospital has told me that he doesn't want to be updated on mom's symptoms.* he thinks i'm playing internet doctor, and isn't really hearing the quality of feedback i'm getting (here, but also in an [alz.org]( lecture/class series, and a peer-support group facilitated by the director of a local dementia ward).* mom has told me for the past three years that the reason this brother is #1 on the forms is that he was the only one living in the area when they were drawn up ten years ago.* i've lived with mom again the past three years. i know her behaviors, and have seen them changing.she is amenable to re-filing the directives in a ""springing"" form with me as the primary. (i don't know if she has to do anything formal other than just giving a new notarized version to the hospital/doctors.) what i worry about is the **period between doing that and having her doctor declare her** incompetent to make medical decisions. because she is already really annoyed by but misunderstanding the things the medics do because of insurance practices (e.g. that so much of the work is done by mail/phone calls and by assistants rather than the md himself) i worry that she will increasingly dismiss their directives.she is convinced that everything is going to be ok, she's ""just old!"" (she's 88 this week). i'm convinced that she already needs me at least as the communications channel between her and her providers. the whole thing seems like a catch-22: who, while they are competent, wants to give medical decision-making power to somebody else \*at that time\*?  but if i manage to get the doctors to perform the tests and give her a diagnosis, so she can realize that this is really important to do now, is she by default at that time incompetent to actually complete that task?(the financial stuff is a whole 'nother kettle of fish, not covered here.)thanks."," even though there will probably be some expense involved, i think it's really, really important to discuss options with an elder care attorney. you also need to worry about the financial side as well because if she becomes incompetent to make her own medical decisions, the same will be true with financial decisions and in that case, you wouldn't have any legal authority to spend her money on her behalf.> the whole thing seems like a catch-22: who, while they are competent, wants to give medical decision-making power to somebody else \*at that time\*? but if i manage to get the doctors to perform the tests and give her a diagnosis, so she can realize that this is really important to do now, is she by default at that time incompetent to actually complete that task? in my own case, my sister refused to give a medical poa except for things like making and managing appointments.  we eventually went to court which assigned me as her legal guardian and a financial professional as her conservator.  this was after extensive testing and a medical determination that she was unable to handle her own affairs (even though she still thought she was perfectly fine).i would at least get poa to authorize you to get medical information and make and manage her appointments.  her doctor's office should have a simple form to make that possible. you can then get started on getting her the appropriate tests and providing first-hand information to her doctor.i would then have a conversation between you, your mom and her doctor about an advanced directive and more comprehensive poa.  her doctor will almost certainly advocate for this.  many people respond much better when this comes from a trusted medical professional and not just a family member and a good doctor will be able to explain to her all the reasons why it's a wise course of action.  the side benefit, which is also very important, is that she can express her wishes in a formal document regarding medical interventions.and definitely consult with an elder care attorney for advice so that you know all your options and won't accidentally step on a legal landmine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f8rafy/poa_with_immediate_effect_how_common/,POA with Immediate Effect -- how common?

"hi all,looking to learn more about other’s experiences with dementia, in particular with detection. my grandparents have different kinds of dementia and we didn’t find out what was going on until there was significant impairment. i realize there is a huge diversity of experience so am reaching out to this community to learn more. for anyone living with dementia or who has a loved one living with dementia - 1. how did you find out? how far along were things, early or late? 2. if you could’ve found out early, how would things be different now, better/worse? interested in hearing from anyone willing to share ❤️ feel really to dm as well."," my dad wash showing sign of mild cognitive impairment in 2016, diagnosed 'alzheimer type' dementia in 2018.2016: my dad hides it so well, no one knows any better.2017: he develops sarcoidosis, a fibrosis of the lungs, and (sadly) uses this as a means of justifying why he 'can't speak'. when he does speak, he often repeats the last word spoken to him. i knew there and then something was wrong but no one wanted to admit , especially not him, that he might have the ""a"" word.2018: words are jumbled up together. official diagnosisso, to answer your question directly:1. imho, we found out 'later' than we could have, but quite frankly it might have been a case of 'not wanting to know' - 'refusing to face reality on both ends since there's no cure and my dad saw it as a 'death sentence'.2. two things:    1.  access to medication early on in order to \*possibly\* 'slow down' the progression of the disease . memantine is sometimes prescribed as 'preventive' in some countries.   2. possibly, better communication with my dad to organize paper work etc, but i doubt we could have done it even if given the time. its not something i would have been confortable doing while he was still 'himself'.other than that, not much really. that's why i'm a bit dubious about early detection in general which is currently a great starter money maker but not much else imho .i'd love to be proven wrong and hear about many other advantages of early detection,  mind you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f8knac/early_detection_ideal_vs_reality/,Early Detection - Ideal vs. Reality

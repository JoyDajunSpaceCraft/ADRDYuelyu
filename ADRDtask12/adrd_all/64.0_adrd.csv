"ok folks, i don't think i've seen a funny friday post lately, where we share the funny, or outlandish stories about our loved ones with dementia. so, let's try to end this year with a smile. i'll go first: my alzheimer's mother is in assisted living. when i visit her her every week, i absolutely must restock her little freezer with only haagen dazs vanilla ice cream. she says, with complete sincerity, that it's ""medicinal"" for her sore throat caused by her ""terrible"" allergies. she has no allergies.  ü§£ü§£", i had a story but forgot what it is.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rsvjfr/funny_friday/,Funny Friday

"my dad has this beautiful cat who dotes on him and used to get 2-3 hours of cuddles from him every day. a few months ago we fostered a cat who didnt get along with his. they started disputing the house as territory and that means peeing. ok. obviously problematic so we placed the new cat somewhere else and went forward. the problem is that my dad is mad at his cat now because she was involved in marking in the house and is shunning her. for 2 months now every time she tries to greet him he kicks at her and every time she tries to get in his lap he shoves her off. he says it's because she was peeing like that explains it. his cat is now horribly stressed out, losing her fur and has started peeing on my dads stuff (either to drive him off or to get his attention, i dont speak cat). so he is even more angry and explosive around her. it makes it worse that she will sneak onto his lap and he will cuddle her for a while before he remembers and shoves her away.   he used to talk all the time about how much she made him happy. i am now prepared to rehome her but i'm faced with trying to explain to my dad why this is happening. i want him to remember that animal care takes patience and selflessness but i remember a few weeks ago when i asked if he wanted to wrap presents for my mom and he told me it was stupid and he never wanted to wrap anything again. i'm so worried that i will say hurtful things to him. it sucks so much you guys"," developing schizophrenia has made me judge the misbehavior of our cats more harshly. my thinking on this: why should bad behavior be rewarded? i have a cat that pees more, now, also, and i view this cat as profoundly spiteful, so i tend to avoid them, due to this. however, sometimes, like your father, i forget this, and give the spiteful cat the sort of attention a well-behaved cat deserves.does this also happen more with people that have dementia?there are similarities between the two disorders, and i am curious to see how many there are.(it is important to note that the crazy cat lady trope exists for a reason, and there is no crazy dog lady trope.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rspbjd/dementia_and_pets/,Dementia and pets
"i barely even know how or where to begin this post, but i feel like some of you in this community may be able to help, so here goes...i apologize for the essay to follow!my mom (71f) and i (28f) have been growing increasingly concerned about my dad (74m) over the past year or two. we're at the point where we're essentially pretty certain he's developing dementia, but we're not sure what the next steps should be. to give a bit of the backstory: my dad has always been really active, fit, and youthful - he was always the ""fun"" and funny dad, and we've always been super close (i'm an only child). in 2018, he was diagnosed with a mild and very treatable form of bladder cancer. the cancer was successfully treated, although he still undergoes preventative treatments every few months. however, shortly following the cancer diagnosis, he became extremely anxious about the cancer. now, it's completely natural to panic and feel anxious when you have cancer, but it became pretty clear that he wasn't interpreting the information the doctors were telling him correctly. he was totally convinced he was going to have to have his bladder removed, even though he/we were told there was only like a 5% chance of that happening. he also was sometimes confused about the reasons for his treatments, but nothing too wild. he was a little depressed, too, which is absolutely normal and common as a reaction to a cancer diagnosis.now this is where it started to get kind of crazy. in january 2020, i took my dad to have a routine preventative bladder treatment. these treatments can be painful and unpleasant, so he was given some lorazepam (ativan) to ease his nerves. well, the lorazepam caused him to spend about 30 hours completely hallucinating and being confused as hell...he was constantly talking to/seeing people that weren't there, sleepwalking, trying to pee in the closet, all this weird stuff. i was beyond freaked out. i should add that my dad has always had sleep disturbances/acted out dreams, but he's started to do so with way greater frequency starting around january 2020. since then, he's had a few more similar experiences when taking lorazepam; needless to say, he's been advised by his doctor not to take it anymore. throughout 2020, i saw him less because of covid, but i definitely observed some odd behaviours.beginning around january 2021, things started to get way worse. he's become quite frail - he's lost a lot of muscle mass and walks with a pretty stooped-over posture. he seems to have lost his sense of time - he'll say something happened ""years ago"" when it happened 2 weeks ago. he very frequently has trouble finding words or mixes up his words, and often uses incorrect pronouns and doesn't notice (referring to my mom or i as ""he,"" for example). his driving has become really bad. his executive/adaptive functioning and life skills are really bad, too; he gets lost when he's walking in the neighbourhood sometimes. he also has a ton of trouble doing basic motor tasks like zipping up his jacket. his filter is reduced, and he'll make inappropriate comments sometimes. he also seems to have a really reduced stamina for social activities - recently, my in-laws stayed for a few days, and he could only stay at the dinner table with all of us for like 15 minutes max, and he couldn't really participate fully and coherently in conversations.all of this to say...my mom, other family members, and i are very concerned. so is my dad's doctor. however, when his doctor referred him to a geriatric psychiatrist (who i assume would do a dementia assessment) a few months ago, my dad refused to go, saying he ""already has enough problems"". my mom and i are at a complete loss. since my dad is still a somewhat competent adult, i don't think she/we can force him to go, right? unless he's somehow provably a danger to himself? i want to respect his dignity and adult autonomy, but i'm also really concerned and, honestly, already grieving his loss in some ways - as horrible as that sounds, he has really changed so much.thanks in advance for any help you can provide!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rsnmcq/dad_doesnt_want_to_be_evaluated_but_were_really/,[deleted by user]

"hello! this is my first post - i live with my mom and stepfather and my mother and i care for him 24/7 -   due to my relationship with my mother i am at my wits end, feeling like i need to have my own place but i feel a lot of guilt for essentially leaving my mother to care for him on her own day to day. a little bit of background - i am an rn, have worked in long term care since 2003 and my specialization is dementia care and palliative care. my mom and stepdad married in 2002 - everything was good for them until about 4 years ago - that is when he began developing dementia - we were able to get him assessed and diagnosed within a year. i moved in with my mom and stepdad (r) 3 years ago to act as a support system for both - his care has been minimal until the last 6 months-  he was taking aricept and his dementia was mild but of course it has been progressing. the last 6 months have been increasingly difficult as he has begun sundowning, he has insomnia (had it for years before diagnosis) he becomes agitated when he is confused (we have tried low doses of ativan for anxiety and seroquel and trazodone for sleep with adverse effects). he also becomes anxious when my mother leaves the house or even the room for more than 15 minutes at a time - he will start calling for her and wanting to look for her. he is easy to settle and to redirect and he is still lucid 70% of the time . the issues i am having are primarily with my mother - she is a very impatient person and can be very quick to snap at someone/quick to anger. this is part of her personality and has been most of her life but it has been getting worse as r is requiring more care. as i have the hands on and theory experience and knowledge i have been guiding the care in conjunction with our geriatrician - however, my mother constantly snaps at him and i, yells at him if he is confused and especially if he is waking her up at night. she will contradict things that i say, will ask me a question about dementia and/or medications and will then argue with me when i respond. yet she has refused to read the books i have asked her to and she refuses to take any kind of class (alzheimer society offers the gentle persuasive approach which is excellent for caregivers). she will instead google anything she wants to know instead of asking me or another medical professional. we have always had issues in communication, but with the added stress of 24/7 care i am feeling very burned out.  i have talked with her countless times about his care and we have talked about options and she is adamant that he stay at home and be cared for by us - i have agreed for a combination of reasons, some of which because i feel guilty that i was not able to care for my biological father and he died in a nursing home. i know that i cannot do something out of guilt because it is eating me alive, but r has been more of a father than my bio dad was. he has 3 children, one does not speak to him, 1 lives on the other side of the country and is very irresponsible and uninterested in anything but himself and the third lives a few hours away, calls 3 times a month and hasn't seen him in 3 years. i feel like i have to be here because there is no one else to care for him. my mother cannot do it on her own, particularly because i am the only one who has been able to get him settled and especially at night.  my mother is very private about telling any neighbours or friends/family that r has dementia (which i do understand) but there are 3 neighbours in our row (we live in townhouse complex) that we are close with - and two of them are shall we say, very involved with the neighbourhood (nosy.) a few days ago my mom went out for groceries and i stayed home with r - she told him she was coming home at 10:30 which i have asked her not to do because she is never on time and he will literally wait at the door for her. this time he put on his snow gear (so he could help her with the unloading) and wanted to wait on the porch - i stayed at the window just to make sure he did not wander off. he then came in and told me he was going to walk to the end of the driveway to wait for her, again i stayed at the window so i had him in my line of vision. he was outside for about 10 minutes and i saw him start to go down the street, so i put on my coat/boots and went outside to ensure he did not lose his footing and fall or become disoriented. i could tell he was becoming confused and did not know where he was, so i went down the block to get him and he was happy and bubbly and walked with me back home. as we came into the complex my mother pulled in and asked me why he was outside etc.. i explained it to her, he helped her with the groceries and all was fine. a few hours later my mother comes into my room and tells me that i embarrassed her in front of the neighbour. apparently one of her friends on our row was ""just glancing"" out her window and saw r and i walking back and told my mother that him and i were so worried about her being gone for an hour that we were wandering. instead of disclosing to the neighbour my mother told her that i apparently got very worried that she wasn't home by 11am and i was out looking for her. then as i said had the audacity to tell me that i was embarrassing her - i got very upset to be honest because that is obviously not the truth and i feel like i am being taken advantage of. i also do not appreciate her telling people lies about me.  i just feel so overwhelmed in general that i don't know what to do - i feel very alone and like i have no real options. i know that no one can tell me what the right answer is but i am hoping that someone has had similar experiences and can relate and can offer some suggestions as how to navigate caring for r while keeping the issues with my mother to a minimum. if you made it this far thank you so much for reading this - i just wanted to add that i do have a therapist that i speak to 2x a week - any suggestions as to how to mitigate conflict with my mom is much appreciated."," i'm sorry that you're having a hard time ‚Äî it sounds like you are carrying a lot for your family! it must be so frustrating that your mom won't listen. is there someone else you can enlist to give both of you a break?i want to say, it wouldn't be a failure to find another home for him, an assisted-living facility of some kind. it might be good for all of you to have a structured environment with more people pitching in. you and your mom could visit frequently ‚Äî every day if possible. for a couple of years my grandpa was in a home and my grandma was still living independently, and she went to hang out with him every day to hang out, have lunch, etc. you get to know all the nurses and the other people in the home so there's even a sense of community, all being in the trenches of old age together.whatever ends up working for your family, god bless <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rsjje0/at_the_end_of_my_rope_so_overwhelmed_rantvent_and/,[deleted by user]
"i take care of my grandma who has alzheimer's / dementia by myself 24/7 with no breaks and with little to no help from my mom aunt and uncles. she doesn't listen and gets violent refusing to go to bed stating up till 5am sometimes just piling up junk in her room thinking she's packing to go somewhere, and keeps refusing to stay seated in her chair in the living room. lately she has been wobbly and falling more and even fell without me knowing one night and i didn't know until i saw a big lump on her head. her new trick is she pretends to go to bed but gets up later when i'm sleeping. my grandma took care of my great grandma when i was little because she had alzheimer's, and she used restraints on her.thing is i don't know if i should. what do y'all think? i'm kinda afraid i'll rely on it too much or even fall asleep while she's restrained.", maybe try cameras. my family would use them to check on my grandma. they might have some that you can speak through too. or you can get pagers to talk to her.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rsgqx3/should_i_get_restraints/,Should I get restraints?
"my mom is 70 and we are in the process of getting a diagnosis for her. thanks in advance for reading / any insight is appreciated. i‚Äôve detailed her symptoms below, many of the personality / behavioral symptoms have been ongoing for 2-3 years (maybe longer), while the physical symptoms have been ongoing for the last year or so. november 2021: at our first appt the neurologist said ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs definitely not alzheimer‚Äôs‚Äù, he noted some physical issues (her eyes not tracking properly, her hands couldn‚Äôt mirror his movement, etc.) he thought off the bat that she would have ftd or dementia with lewy-bodies. he ordered an mri. the mri results show significant degeneration of the cerebellum, but apparently dr. interpretation is that it‚Äôs not dementia and also no sign of stroke. december 2021: she is referred to a ‚Äúmovement specialist‚Äù neurologist, he runs a series of movement exams on her and declares that he believes it is ftd, alternatively could be spinocerebellar ataxia but unlikely because she doesn‚Äôt show gait issues. he also notes that her cerebellum is degenerated well beyond her age and that this could be linked to ftd. he recommends genetic testing which we will do for her, and she is meeting with a neuropsychologist in january. i‚Äôll try to breakdown what we know / her symptoms in the most concise way possible. symptoms:constant ‚Äúdrunk feeling‚Äù (her words)falling (no attempt to catch her fall)slow motor function - example, bringing a fork to her mouth at a snails pace, slow chewing / slow eating in general coughing while eating loss of social skills (rude, inappropriate  comments) inability to keep up / contribute to conversation inability to relate to others  lack of interest in hobbies confused with technology she has used before declares she is depressed and anxious (no diagnosis) in general, i‚Äôm confused. how does the mri lead one doctor to say there‚Äôs no signs of dementia, when another doctor spends an hour evaluating both her and the same mri and says it‚Äôs ftd. the possible ftd diagnosis is fitting, but i‚Äôm confused how the only significant mri finding is in the cerebellum- not frontal or temporal lobes. im also wondering if we should be doing a pet scan? or any other testing. any opinions / perspective / experience from this community is greatly appreciated. thank you"," i would have to agree with nebb1. i‚Äôm nad but the lack of coordination, coughing when eating, falls, and other things you listed sound a lot like parkinson‚Äôs that i‚Äôve seen in extended family.   the trick with dementia‚Äôs and neurological diseases is that they can present with so many different symptoms, that you can‚Äôt compare one to another exactly.  unfortunately, the road to diagnosis for a lot of bvftd families is years and not months or weeks.  i would do like i, bayare and many of us that have been in your position did and start researching like you said you were going to.  look up all you can about ftd in general.  it will help you to advocate for your mom and knowing what to expect goes a long way in a journey on a road that you can‚Äôt predict, if that is indeed the diagnosis.  it does sound like several ftd traits, but it can co mingle with other things too.  it took us years to get a bvftd diagnosis for my husband, and come to find out, he was also dealing with vascular dementia symptoms years before that.  what helped us was to go to people that specialize  in dementias, rather than a ‚Äúregular‚Äù neurologist that would see everyone with a neurological problem like migraines, etc.  the specialists were able to really get things moving toward the correct diagnosis.  the pet scan helped a lot to be able to get to the bottom of it all because the brain atrophy was clearly present.    wishing luck to you all for a speedy diagnosis! take care of all of you during this difficult journey!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rsgmj8/the_confusing_road_to_diagnosis_ftd_maybe_advice/,The confusing road to diagnosis (FTD? maybe?) - advice appreciated

"hey, so i am a 24 f. my mother(57f) has been recently diagnosed with dementia, probably 6 months back or so. she is not too bad, in her early stages, just forgets a lot of things, but most times is a able to follow conversations. we have been trying to help her through things.so i live abroad with my friends, and i have noticed a few things about myself that is starting to concern me. i have always been a bit absent minded, i dont forget as such, but lately a lot of things don't strike me. i have been using the phrase ' it dint strike me' a lot, which scares me as it is something my mother used to do. ( i am not sure if i am noticing it now after my mother has been diagnosed)also, i learned to play cards recently, and found myself getting very confused. so all my friends know playing cards really well and are able to follow fast, at what cards get over soon, which player doesn't have which cards and those kind of stuff. but i keep getting confused a lot. i came abroad to do my master's and i came here on a scholarship, which is one of the hardest ones to get. so i know i am not dumb. the cards one is honestly very concerning as i can see all my friends following so easily, and myself struggling makes me scared, that it might be an early sign."," i don't want to scare you. you symptoms are 99.9% not dementia. having a parent diagnosed with dementia at such a young age is a good reason to become anxious, depressed etc. but. it is uncommon for a person in their 50s to be diagnosed with dementia. it may, may, be genetic. my mom started showing some early and unrecognized signs of dementia in her early to mid 70s. she is 81 now and on stage 4 to 5 and has rapidly regressed over the last 3 years. doctors said, is she had beer regularly and properly assessed  in her late 60s, she would have been probably diagnosed then. my mom's mother and her sister (mom's aunt) had similar senile paranoid delusions like my mom has, but not the memory loss. they both died in their mid 80's.  but unlike them, my mom had suffered from hypertension and diabetes for decades. i think some senile paranoid disorder may be genetic (scary!), while mom's memory loss is explained by her own conditions. if such tests are available locally, check yourself for a rare gene responsible for the early onset of alzheimer's. i am sure you will be relieved. anyway, make sure you adhere to a healthy lifestyle. sleep, exercise and eat well. control your blood pressure and blood sugar levels. deal with your mental problems, best with non- pharmaceutical means, but if needed, follow your doc's advice but try to go off meds in the shortest possible time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rs0ht7/am_i_exhibiting_early_symptoms_of_dementia/,Am I exhibiting early symptoms of dementia?
"minor tw, someone gets hurt and i mention x-rays.i‚Äôve talked about my grandmother a little on this sub, but i needed to share what happened over the holidays. it was‚Ä¶rough.recently my family has celebrated christmas with my grandmother with dementia and it's been extremely hard this year. this year we decided to attend the party her side of the family throws a week before actual christmas, so she can spend some time with not only her siblings, but their families as well. i was planning on trying to talk with some of my family and not end up just watching her like on thanksgiving. however, the moment she walked in and her younger brother started talking to her, i knew that wouldn‚Äôt be the case. her dementia has gotten so bad she has started to forget them, and the heartbreak of watching her brothers and sisters realize their sister is forgetting them is an image i can never unsee. they ended up keeping a distance, i ended up sitting with her and keeping her focused on her food. the entire time she kept introducing herself, making the same joke about one of my cousins ‚Äústealing her shirt‚Äù because she had a similar one at home, and also keeping an eye on the youngest of the grandkids running around because his mom expressed that he‚Äôs allergic to eggs and i know grandma would either give him something without realizing it or leave something where he can reach it, he‚Äôs only 2. i could see on the faces of my family, the painful pity they were giving. i wish i could give them answers about how she‚Äôs doing that they would be ok with, but the sad truth is she‚Äôs not. it‚Äôs getting a lot worse and they are starting to finally see it. now i‚Äôm not going to say her family isn‚Äôt forgetting things, the brother i mentioned earlier (she has 4 brothers and 3 sisters, but one sister passed early this year, and one brother passed many years ago) confused my mother and my mother‚Äôs cousin, who unfortunately passed mid october, and her younger sister is starting to forget things as well, and her boyfriend has been on a ‚Äútrip‚Äù so my aunt has been keeping an eye on them. but my great aunt and great uncle‚Äôs memory gaps are more because of the fact they‚Äôre in their late 60s early 70s.during the party my grandmother had on some nice dress shoes but my aunt packed a pair of tennis shoes because we knew she would want them eventually. and she did‚Ä¶after taking them off while we were eating. after dinner we started white elephant, and my mom and aunt let me play for my grandma, who i told throughout the game we‚Äôre a team. it was just easier that way. one of the younger kids ended up picking up an electric foot bath, which i knew would be perfect for my grandma. when i picked out her gift and saw it was a starbucks mini gift bag, i knew i struck gold. the kiddo with the footbath was a teenager, a teenage girl for that matter. so it was a win win. and at the end of the night, we managed to not get it taken, so i‚Äôm glad we ended that on a good note. a week later we did our christmas celebrations. it‚Äôs supposed to be low key, since we get so tired after thanksgiving my dad just wants to grill steaks and make mashed potatoes. my aunt goes a little overboard with christmas candies and whatnot but it‚Äôs fine. well‚Ä¶something not great happened. i coaxed my grandmother out of her room (she was going through clothes or something, her bed was off the box spring and a mess) so she could come talk to us for a little while, and luckily her younger sister showed up by then. well, we have two doggy gates set up for her dogs to stay out of the living room, but the side closest to the door was more of a barrier made with plastic panels and a side table. i was right behind grandma, keeping an eye on her because she‚Äôs been walking with a wobble and i wanted to keep her steady. she reached over the barrier to hug her sister, and collapsed onto the table. i screamed ‚Äúgrandma!‚Äù and tried to get the debris away from her. my scream alerted my mother and aunt, who were standing on the porch 10 feet away. we quickly got her up and onto the couch, and swept up the broken decorative bowl. as i was putting the broom away, i hid in the laundry room and had a mini panic attack. for the majority of the night i ended up blaming myself for her falling. my mother has since helped me get out of that mind frame, but it‚Äôs still scary to think about. she was in such pain for the rest of the night. when we got the food ready, she sat at the table with a pillow on her lap to help. she‚Äôs in this habit where she‚Äôll eat a little bit of her food and pick pieces off for her dogs to eat, which wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if it wasn‚Äôt almost every time she took a bite.during dinner she started talking and mentioned my brother‚Äôs name. she said it‚Äôs been a while since she‚Äôs seen him, and she hopes he‚Äôs ok. he was sitting a foot away from her. my brother, who normally kept his emotions about grandma forgetting him away, broke down. he made an excuse of having a rough day and just went to the living room. at that moment i felt like an asshole, because before we left our house i had asked him to talk to her a bit more, to see if that would help her remember him more. we quickly finished our dinners and headed to the living room for gift exchanges. my grandmother was still in a lot of pain though. we tried to get her comfortable and gave her the presents we got her. she did like them, but she ended up falling asleep on the couch. my aunt ended up taking her to urgent care on monday, and they didn‚Äôt see a break but gave the x-ray to a radiologist because their equipment isn‚Äôt great. they did say she landed on or around her kidney, and to keep an eye on that. i was over at her house again that night to help my aunt clean a little, and it broke my heart seeing her in such pain. she tried to sit up and walk, but every movement hurt her so bad, even with the pain medicine they gave her. we ended up just getting her to rest on the bed on ‚Äúdoctors orders,‚Äù which is kinda right. the holidays have been hard, especially since we just passed the 10 year anniversary of her late husband‚Äôs passing. she cried during thanksgiving every time she saw his picture, which was a lot because she hangs pictures of the family everywhere. and even while crying she wouldn‚Äôt remember what she was crying for. she would be sad one minute, then think she‚Äôs just having a reaction to her faulty tear ducts, which is something that‚Äôs been a part of her life since she was little. i remember our past christmas and thanksgiving experiences, my brother and i excitedly watching parades on tv, putting our favorite ornaments on the tree, shaking boxes to see what‚Äôs inside. back then it *felt* like a holiday. now? now it‚Äôs not as festive. i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just because of the pandemic taking away my holiday moods or the fact i want to cry every time i see my grandma, but things don‚Äôt feel the same. and i doubt it ever will again."," i didn't catch how old you are, but i think there's a certain amount of dimming-of-full-on-excitement for/with the holidays that comes with adulthood and growing older. especially in those middle years when you don't have any kids of your own yet.  if this is anything close to the stage of life you are in, i think it would be doubly/triply hard to deal with in tandem with the sadness of seeing a beloved elder suffer with dementia.  it's a lot and i send you hugs and hand

"hey. im 19 and im drunk and on mobile (sorry) right now following the reveal that my grandma, henceforth referred to as memere, is in the hospital with sepsis. the prognosis isnt great. she will probably end up passing.when i was a kid i would stay at her trailer and she still worked. she drove me to school. when i was probably between the ages of 9-10, she moved in with my dad because she wasnt quite right ‚Äî but i had never known another memere.she would wash and freeze the garbage. she hoarded toilet paper and reeses cups in her room. she was confused and brought home a bag of potatoes when my dad asked for one potato for dinner. thats the event that has always been brought up as the beginning of ‚Äúeveryone knowing‚Äù that something wasnt right anymore. and then, when we moved into my stepmoms house, she came with. she and i shared a bathroom and she would come into the bathroom any time i had to pee in the middle of the night. every single time! i started locking the door and i would hear her jiggling the knob. it was like i activated her. any time she tried to use the bathroom she would end up smearing poo all over the place, somehow. i couldnt even dry my hands with the towel because it smelled horrible and was covered in poo. it would be on the walls.finally when i was in my freshman year of high school i hadnt been to my dads house in about a month because i was so busy with marching band. when i finally saw my dad and stepmom again, i was informed she was in a home now because she had stayed up about 48 hours or so during a hurricane. they had to barricade her in her bedroom so they could finally get some sleep.after that, we would visit her every once in a while. she was really funny during that time. all we could do was laugh along with her when she would speak gibberish. it sounds so horrible when i tell people who have never been through dementia but all you can do is laugh sometimes. we brought her a calendar of elvis pictures because she loved elvis when she was ‚Äúalive‚Äù and she would look over and see the picture of him and do a little seductive growl. she was a funny lady! she had 8 husbands through her life‚Ä¶anyway, i havent seen her since a while before the pandemic. i sent her a letter for christmas in 2019 during therapy to assuage some guilt. i was told she loved it and kept it sitting in her room. but last time i saw her in person, she didnt know who me, my dad, or my stepmom were. she thought my dad was one of her husbands or her dad or something. the last i heard, my dad went to see her and she was completely nonverbal. except for one word. ‚Äúelmira‚Äù. the place where my dad was born. she was milky-eyed, and then looked at him and registered something, and said that. it breaks my heart to think about.i came out to my dad as a trans man just before christmas because ive been on testosterone for ~7 months and my voice is too deep to pass off as ‚Äúi lost my voice at a concert‚Äù‚Ä¶ which, funny story, before i came out to anyone in my family we went to see memere and she said ‚Äúwho is this young man‚Äù when she saw me! unknowing trans ally queen. all i had done was cut my hair short. it was a painful process, coming out to my dad, but it ended up working out after a few days. (side note, i know my dad uses reddit and would very easily know who this is, hi dad if you see this!) i went to see him yesterday and i heard about how memere had a problem with her bank account being too high to stay in the home. at this point i honestly wouldnt have been surprised if she had passed and i hadnt heard, but i guess she was still kicking. she just turned 80. now, the day after, shes in crisis in the hospital. i feel nothing. im waiting for it to hit me. if anything, i feel relief that she will be freed soon from this prison. i suffered two losses already this past year that hit me a) immediately screaming and crying, spending a week straight sleeping and going back to sleep the second i wake up and b) feeling nothing until my boyfriend asked me whats up, and the same happened. but i dont even feel the anticipation of the latter. my memere hasnt been here for over 6 years. i feel relief and not much else.ugh. anyway, i just wanted to vent and get a little advice from people who know what its like. now im gonna go watch adventure time with my boyfriend. have a good night yall."," waaaa, what a ride!  yeh, poor memere, and you all - did good for a long time.  fly high memere,  dancing with elvis in heaven, god speed!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rqzwxl/what_am_i_supposed_to_feel/,what am i supposed to feel?

"i‚Äôm taking my dad (85)  to his gp on thursday morning. i do not know if his general confusion has, or is, developing into dementia. most likely vascular dementia on account if he has has 2 strokes.

( i don‚Äôt believe he would be physically aggressive- yet ) also he can still do things like connect his ipad to the printer.  it‚Äôs difficult as the strokes left him with some aphasia  so he can‚Äôt do things with dates or numbers anyway.  he forgets recent things like he had his covid booster ( which we could all do i guess at 85- but i think it‚Äôs  more) i‚Äôm an only child and getting him to the doctor on thursday is really stressing me incase he decides not to go. i‚Äôve explained all this to the dr who knows he has to ask my dad about his alcohol intake ( way too much) and stop him driving ‚Ä¶. my dad is going to know i‚Äôve told the gp this.  i‚Äôve told my dad i need to get him checked out and his bloods tested to see if we can understand ‚Äòhis unsteadiness‚Äô and brain ‚Äòfog‚Äô he has, that is making him forget things. i am focussing on the physical issues to get him there but as soon as the gp starts asking him questions like ‚Äò who is the prime minister‚Äô he‚Äôll know ‚Ä¶.. he‚Äôs forgotten twice the appointment is made! he‚Äôs not happy about it. any advice anyone? üò¢"," i feel for you. you're a nurse, which he likely knows gives you some expertise and say-so. perhaps you could make the doc who's seeing him the ""villain""? as in ""because the doctor said so, if it were up to me we might delay, but he called me personally to make absolutely sure you keep this appointment‚Ä¶""? docs with any bedside manner will understand they have to be cast in that role sometimes. worked with my dad (who was unduly impressed by ""doc says so,"" didn't get a 2nd opinion, and ended up having a perfectly good kidney removed, eventual dialysis, blah, blah, blah.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rqre9r/confusion_or_dementia/,Confusion or Dementia ?

"my grandmother has lewy body dementia, and is cared for by my mother, her sister (my aunt) and their children (me, my sister, and my cousins). she lives with my grandfather (no dementia) in her life long home next door to my mother. we have a large family and it is not irregular for us to be regularly in touch with all of my grandmothers extended family including in laws, great aunts and the such, and we regularly meet as a big family.unfortunately, my uncle‚Äôs (grandmother‚Äôs son) mother in law recently passed away. she was about the same age as my grandmother but had parkinson‚Äôs. before his mil‚Äôs later stage, my grandmother often spoke to her, but in the past few years, despite seeing her often, it had been difficult for them to communicate. it‚Äôs clear that my grandmother has always cared for her as a family member, as have we all. we all mourn her loss.when discussing the funeral, my uncle and his wife would like my grandmother to attend. this means my mother and i will have to bring her and tend to her, in case anything happens. this poses a problem because 1.) we can never be sure if this will be a good day or a bad day for her memory2.) we don‚Äôt want to cause a scene and upset everyone who is also mourning 3.) we don‚Äôt know how upset this will make my grandmother.some facts for reference. my grandmother is still capable of most motor function, so mobility is not an issue, and she can still function almost as normally as before in social situations outside of conversation. she also doesn‚Äôt have any medical needs relevant to attending the funeral. basically saying, we could go in and make our appearance to support the family, lay low, and leave if necessary should anything happen. the ceremony is just mass, and will be closed casket. our biggest concern is her saying something, or seeing something, that might upset her or the family. we want to support the family and allow my grandmother to mourn with us, but desperately need advice. thank you for any advice you could give!"," when you care for someone with dementia, you kind of have to elevate their needs when you weigh these options. is it really best for her to go, or is there another way she could honor the family they would be less stressful to her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rqohuy/looking_for_advice_on_attending_funerals_with/,Looking for Advice on Attending Funerals with Dementia

"hey, all.  this is my first post and it's because my mom has dementia.  she's in her late 70s, worked up until a few years ago and was always active.  after selling our business she was essentially forced in to retirement.  up until recently, she was completely self-sufficient with short term memory being the only issue.  however, since getting covid over the summer and having a rough time with it her dementia has worsened significantly.  i'd describe it as the blinders have come closer together.  short term memory is shot, introverted due to fear.  has forgotten her usual routine.  has anyone delved into therapies?  since noticing her memory decline in 2018, i did my best to lower her carb intake.  she never drove so i do the grocery shopping so that's easy.  she started taking mct oil for the ketones and benfotamine because of the thiamine deficiency that may have something to do with it.  she was steady for 3 plus years, then she got sick.  i know inflammation and/or low oxygen saturation are big culprits.  she was dealing with both so that may have exacerbated the problem.  i'm going to start high potency cbd for her along with epa/dha through supplements.  i'm fortunate enough to have her living with my family and my work gives me the time to experiment and observe.  i'm a proponent of quality of life and stubborn as a mofo so i won't give up on her.  i was thinking if anyone else is keen, we could pool ideas and theories.  you never know.  i was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in my late teens.  i went from an athletic 170lbs at 6'1 to 130lb.  i was hospitalized for months and had to take steroids and transplant meds to keep my immune system from murdering my colon.  after 6 months i eventually recovered.  i was put on maintenance meds and thought that was the end of it.  a year later the blood in my stool showed up and the same cycle began.  this cycle happened 3 times over 4 years.  my bullheaded father took me to mayo clinic, cleveland clinic and northwestern in chicago to specialists.  all said i'd have to live with it unless i want to cut my colon out and live with a colostomy bag.  maintenance drugs was the best they could offer.  i was 24, couldn't go to the bathroom without dreading to see blood in the toilet.  i had a moon shaped face due to the steroids, weird stretch marks due to rapid weight fluctuation and a host of other issues.  one which was remedied by viagra if you get what i mean.  i was despondent to say the least.  there's little joy in convalescing knowing that the same thing will happen inevitably.  you can't have a life or at least a semi long term plan.   i was sitting in my gi's office one day waiting for my appointment time and watched the person across from me drink a mountain dew.  i was feeling decent but suddenly remembered my last flare up was the day after i had a milkshake.  i had asked every specialist i saw what i should eat and none said diet had anything to do with it.  i took them at their word.  but for some reason after watching that dude drink his dew, i started to plan elimination diets.  i also started to read about gut health and the gut biome.  the last time i ever got sick from ulcerative colitis was 15 years ago.  i eat clean, have eliminated processed and fast food (one in the same?) and eat a lot of quality greek yogurt.  i've also minimized sugar.  so far so good!i went on this tangent because i'm sure most understand the medical establishment is far from perfect.  i cured myself.  this does happen.  i know most people are too busy to worry about solving the problems of a relative or friend with dementia but hey,  might as well give it a shot.  if not a cure at least may calm their minds and everyone around them.  improve their quality of life.  it's such an awful disease.  maybe we can develop a reddit hive mind for therapies to help some people out.  let the internet do it's thing so to speak..",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rq9d56/hive_mind_answers_for_this/,Hive Mind Answers for this

(we are his children.) he even has accused my sister-in-law, who is deceased, of having an affair on my brother and my aunt of having an affair on her husband. he also gets hyper focused on my mom stealing money from him. ugh!! we are all so frustrated. he is wearing us all out! he says the most inappropriate sexual things to my mom and it makes her furious! is this dementia? alzheimer‚Äôs?  could it be a uti? i have called the doctor‚Äôs office and we are waiting on them to call back. any helpful comments or insight would be greatly appreciated.", there are many possible causes for these behaviors. i suggest consulting with a neurologist that specializes in dementia.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rpx5g8/could_my_father_have_dementia/,[deleted by user]

"hi all, been lurking this subreddit for a while now as i've been worried about my mother's seemingly declining mental health. she's been on disability for chronic depression/bipolar disorder for many years now but has kept herself busy doing things around the house, running errands and to her religious gatherings (pre-covid).. now however after the lockdown and trying to return to normal i've noticed her personality change some and constant forgetting of what day it is and small things that were just done she'll forget that they have been done. friends and family have been calling and she's been becoming withdrawn. she just turned 66 this year and has a very good mood in her up stage with her bipolar disorder. she's been having issues with finding the right words sometimes, if it feels like i'm playing charades trying to have a simple conversation, and it's frustrating to understand and i think even more so because i have asd. i'm fearing her mental disorders are taking my mom away. and i have tried to speak to her doctors if her medications (specifically seroquel, which i suspect is causing her memory gaps, and she may be abusing it just to sleep more) and she also has diabetes and digestive issues which are treated with medication and anti acids.. as well she hasn't been eating too well, and frequently has suffered utis. last one has been cleared, and she's using the restroom fine, so she says. the psychiatrist has lowered the prescription to 400mg tablets, which she instructed her to snap in half (i don't get why, because there is a 200mg version out.. i've attempted to take over the medications and give them to her myself in case she is doubledosing, etc (i have my strong suspicions) but my mother refuses. she is mostly functioning at night but has horrible episodes in the early morning/daytime some days where she won't know the time of day or even what day it is. she got up, got dressed and went to the corner store at 5:30am when it opens at 7 the other day. that was the biggest red flag for me. i wouldn't have known she had done that if i didn't have life360 on her phone (i was at work)this is very stressing. i really don't wanna have her wither away mentally. i don't know if supplements will help as she's such a picky eater and many things will upset her stomach along with a change in medication."," as someone else advised, checking with a physician who is a geriatric expert  would be very useful. as you age medications can have worse side effects, and may need to be adjusted further or changed. it's best to work with someone who routinely deals with these issues. this physician could also begin to evaluate other potential explanations for the new problems you are observing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/roiqh2/is_this_the_beginning_of_dementia_or/,Is this the beginning of dementia or over-medication/not eating well related?
"hello all,just some background:i (32m) have been caring for my mom (70, early to mid alz/dementia) and my father (74, cancer) for over a year. unfortunately my father's battle with cancer was lost earlier this month (rip, he went peacefully). here's where i seek advice. i'm picking up the pieces at the moment between financials, caring for my mother, etc, and i know one of the cardinal rules for caring for a loved one with dementia is not to break routine and structure, but my father was her rock and kept her grounded in life so that's already a big challenge. unfortunately his passing comes with quick changes around the house, reorganizing, etc. i have to think both emotionally and practically. long story short...we need to clear the house, and her inability to cope with losing things is rooted so far in her past that it would be an issue even without the mental conditions. i obviously have my own personal concerns but i'll leave those out.what would be the best methods to ease her into a change mindset? she was gifted a new purse today and the stress of moving things from the old broken and ratty bag to the new one caused her to snap at my sister. if this is a indicator of what is to come with the house as a whole, i don't know if we will be able to plan rationally. i want her to be as involved as possible and am willing to compromise.i love my mother but taking control of the family at 32 while trying to regain a lost 1+ of my own life plans is daunting. i know i will have to be the one to compromise and adapt, but it's still a bit depressing. any advice from veteran caretakers?"," speaking as a person living with dementia symptoms, losing my locations for things is a huge complication.  if i cannot see it, it does not exist; signs on kitchen cupboards or drawers are mostly useless, because my mind's eye is looking for something of this shape and color, and that sign is not it.  ... and i check a drawer, check another drawer, and then -- oooo did i check that drawer?  so i am back to the drawers again.  can consume hours.  if my clothes are not in sight, they do not exist.  so my wardrobe doors are left open, wish open drawers stair-stepped to see the contents.  we have no doors on kitchen cabinets, so not everything must stay on the countertop.  etc.  clear containers are the only containers of use in this house.big change like loss of spouse will almost always bring further cognitive decline to person living with dementia.  big change like moving location very often brings further cognitive decline to person living with dementia.  the body sees change of any kind as stress (even wonderful changes) ... and stress has terrible affects on dementia brain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rohv89/help_with_reorganizing/,Help with reorganizing?

"my dad (early stages of dementia) and mum are coming to visit us for christmas.dad has a daily routine that he likes to stick to. christmas day will not follow his normal routine and he won't be at home.would writing out the schedule for the day and giving it to them when they arrive help him?i fear he would then spend the day clock watching for the next ""event"" on the schedule rather than enjoying the current one.but i know he'll become confused/irritable by not eating until later than usual. we will be ensuring there's snacks available and encouraging him to eat them at his normal meal time. another concern i have is they are staying over for the first time ever (to give mum a bit more of a break and not have to drive home in the dark at night). dad usually wakes early and follows his morning routine. that won't be possible at our house  and i suspect he'll wake up several hours before everyone else.i'm probably just overly worrying but i want him (and mum) to enjoy their christmas."," people with dementia crave routine and can become disoriented when they are taken out of their usual surroundings.  please don't expect him to read and understand and follow your written schedule, it is bound to confuse him more than you think. do not place any expectations on how things ""should"" go, allow for him not to follow your schedule.  be generous in accomodating him and do not try to expect that he will handle this change of surroundings. i know my husband does not do well being around a lot of people or te energy from a larger group especially if he doesn't know everyone.  just roll with whatever he needs as he needs it and accept it may not go smoothly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rn6zfy/christmas_day_printed_schedule_good_idea_or/,Christmas day printed schedule - good idea?

so as my grandma has progressed she has started to really dislike a few of my family members including my sisters. my sisters are all in the health field and all understand this isn‚Äôt grandma anymore it‚Äôs someone who is going through a terrible disease. so every time one of my sisters says how grandma got snippy i told them to reference her as ag (alzheimer‚Äôs grandma) since the grandma we grew up with loved us (and i know still does) soooo much. my sisters got a kick out of it and ag has stuck. we keep that inside the house obviously but it helps add some humor / lightness as it‚Äôs difficult to see a love on forget who you are or get angry at simple things. sorry if this was too dark but thought i‚Äôd share since humor is my way of coping through bad shit.," i love it, think it's great!   i mean, folk sometimes change their name don't they, and/or get nicknames - after or for some huge incident in their life, people who transition change their name, and how about prince, changed his name to the artist formerly known as prince - if it's not rude, why not refer to formerly known as grandma by a different name?   ag sounds way cool!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rn63c4/my_dark_sense_of_humor/,My dark sense of humor

"my granny who has dementia is morbidly obese and can no longer walk. not even to use the toilet. despite my dad's warning that it wouldn't end well, she somehow got approved to receive knee replacement surgery. she thought this would have her walking again but her mental state had her feeling hostile to the physical therapist that would come over. she refused to do the exercises and can't communicate in a cognizant enough way to get prescribed adequate pain meds, even. while she was in rehab right after the surgery, she would not cooperate with them and kept accusing grandpa of leaving her there to rot so he could cheat on her. (he loves her dearly and doesn't have it in him to do anything of that sort.) her delusions are almost psychotic in nature and it's hard not to be angered by her logic. on thanksgiving, she called him a ""dirty rat"" because he briefly came to visit my parents' house without her, for example. my grandpa got her a brace for one of her legs in hopes it would make it easier for her to get in and out of her wheelchair again but she hates it. she yells at him when he tries to get her used to wearing it. she doesn't even remember that the surgery was her idea. she's blaming my poor stressed grandpa for all this! last time i was over, she yelled at him something along the lines of, ""was it your idea to get me carved up and make me a cripple? i bet it will be real fun for you when i die soon."" he has to change her briefs and wait on her constantly even though he has cancer. seems hardly fair to him. i'm guessing she'll have to be moved to some sort of care facility soon. like hospice? she doesn't make much sense and can't do the things she ought to be doing. since she can't get up, i told him to look into a doctor that would make house visits or something. i'm not sure where i'm going with this but seeing her lose her dignity and independence scares me. i'm scared i will be like her someday except without a loving partner and no way to end the misery. it seems like what she's experiencing is worse than being dead. i'm sorry, that's... dark but i am frustrated someone i love is being consumed by this affliction. i highly value independence and already deal with my own mental issues and physical pain. when i see her, i just feel like my life is going to get worse. i feel like she's foreshadowing what i might experience someday and i've already been through a lot.  she hurts my feelings sometimes too. for instance, i was on the phone with the pharmacy the other day to get my vraylar filled and had to go in the other room because she kept going off on tangents that might get me flagged if they overheard her plus i needed to charge my phone. prior to this, we were having a perfectly normal, pleasant conversation. well i ended up leaving with grandpa to run a quick errand and when i got back, she had completely turned on me. she seemed to be having some sort of religious delusion. i forget exactly what she thought but i do remember being accused of ""being mean and talking to devils."" she then let me know she was ""giving up"" on me. whatever that means. she later apologized but i'm still upset with her even though who she really is in her heart would never treat me poorly. i don't want to ever require the level of care that she does. i don't want to be hollering disturbing nonsense or to be a bigger burden than i already am. if i ever can't wash myself or use the toilet on my own, i hope it won't be illegal for someone to assist me in terminating what's left of my life. this isn't about me, though. i mainly wonder how to support my grandpa. he deserves some sort of assistance to take stress off him. if he gets sick of changing briefs and sends her to hospice because she just keeps declining, i don't want him to feel guilty like he did something wrong. i know it's a hard choice to make because these places are hell on earth from what i can tell. i don't think he is able to care for her much longer, though. he needs care himself. i guess that's all for now. üòì"," first of all no one can ""send her to hospice"".  hospice is an in home care service and they do not come in full time.  it seems as though it is time for your grandfather to start looking for care homes for her.  she is becoming more than he can handle and he has to think about his own health.  i would push this idea with him.  you have many issues and all of them are valid.  this is such a hard disease for the person suffering and those who love them.  i think you would benefit from a support group or individual counseling.  you have a lot going on and you need to take care of you.  good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rmqz8q/seeing_my_granny_decline_is_triggering_me/,Seeing my granny decline is triggering me.

"alzheimer's/dementia runs in my father's side of the family. my grandfather died from it, albeit, gradually over 20 years. he was docile and kind the entire span of his life. so when my father, then 71, was diagnosed with mild cognitive decline 3 years ago, we very much expected him to take a similar course. that is absolutely not what has happened.he declined so rapidly we could barely keep up. 5 months ago we finally chose (after touring dozens) a specialty alzheimer's care center for him to go and live. he moved in and his memory and behavioral issues advanced. he began to become aggressive when his diaper was being changed or he needed to be washed, or put in new clothes. soon after this began, his aggression became more and more frequent, until he had an incident in which he struck out at a nurse.the care center put him in an ambulance and sent him to the hospital, who called us to inform us that my dad was in the er. they submitted him to the psychiatrics ward in order to try and balance his meds and find a proper combination of antipsychotics that would allow him to continue living life in a comfortable manner. i should note, he was physically healthy. big guy, just slightly overweight, had worked outside his entire life. the doctors said he might be there for a week, and due to covid, no visitors were allowed.a week passed and the doctors were very transparent about informing us of all the different drug cocktails they were trying. none were working. he was still aggressive while nurses were performing cares and it often took 3-4 people to restrain him. one week turned into two, and eventually five. at the end of the 5th week, they suddenly permitted my mom and older sister to visit him for one hour. we were puzzled. the next day they asked for a meeting and explained to us that there was nothing they had tried that worked, and no care center would take him back in this state. they explained that over the last five weeks he had fallen very deep into the dementia, and insisted that the best option was to begin heavy sedation, rendering the body unable to eat or drink until it shuts down. my mother, as power of attorney, agreed to this. they gave us each one hour to visit and say goodbye while he was still alert and began the sedation the next day. this was approx one week ago.he has not eaten or drank for at least five whole days and we have been by his bedside for almost 48 hours. there have been so many moments where we just question, over and over again, how this is legal, and this is the only solution. aren't we literally killing him by sedating him to death? has anyone else had this experience? please shed some light on this for me.", i would seek a second opinion.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rmhp8n/my_father_is_on_his_deathbed_due_to_his_body/,My father is on his deathbed due to his body shutting down from sedation and I have questions

"i (17f) have a mom (56f) with early onset alzheimer's disease. it's almost christmas and i want to give her a good gift, especially when i know that the others in our family almost have no gifts for her (it was really hard to get her gifts even before she got sick).looking at how her illness have progressed, i am assuming that this is the last christmas we will spend together with her understanding that it actually is christmas.this last year has been hard on everyone in the family. i am her primary caregiver currently, but still not sure how to handle the situation. my dad and siblings lack patience, and mom has sadly just become an uncomfortable obstacle in our daily life (not that i love her any less, but since she has gotten sick the arguments and complications and daily workload has been heavy for everyone, and as the emotionally constipated family we are, can't always handle it all).my mom is in a state where she have a hard time doing the most basic things. for example, he cannot handle a stove or a microwave, she cannot use her phone, read books, put on shoes. she can not find her way around where we live anymore, she cannot really be part of conversations and have a terribly hard time communicating. she struggles with understanding visual impressions, like differentiating our cat from the couch pillows, or see other people in the same room.she believes, however, that she is able to do these things, and sometimes ends up creating troublesome or dangerous situations for herself. this is where i have found myself struggling. often when i (or anyone else) offer to help, she gets mad and thinks were viewing her as stupid, or like a child (something i try my best not to). she is battling the depression and anger that can come with this illness, so she is very negatively set towards basically everything. every activity i suggest is always simply bad or offending. she has virtually no interests anymore, and spends most days doing nothing. even audiobooks make her upset, and my guess is that she has a hard time understanding them, which turns into frustrations that she takes out on us, saying that we are ridiculing her. i have gotten her a pair of fluffy slippers, but besides that, what could i give her for christmas? something that she will actually have use for/be happy about, but won't feel offended/confused/sad getting? when i've gotten her gifts before, the only thing she really appreciated was candy, but it's the only thing she ever gets nowadays, because no one knows what else to give. does anyone have any suggestions? it would be greatly appreciated.this christmas will undoubtedly be awkward and uncomfortable, but i want to make it as worthwhile as possible for her, and show her that i really do care."," in a very similar place to you but with the ages turned up 30 years.  due to some recent hospital visits we are no where near ready for christmas and i too want to get that gift that might be the last they truly appreciate.  so far what we‚Äôve been able to get hands on are her favourite chocolates, some cute mugs (she‚Äôs english so will always be excited by tea time) , going to find her a union jack or england flag fleece throw as she sleeps by the window and gets chilly.    she has always been incredibly hard to buy for as she has hasn‚Äôt  really had hobbies for a number of years.  good luck to you all around",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/rm8ax9/christmas_presents_for_mom/,Christmas presents for mom.

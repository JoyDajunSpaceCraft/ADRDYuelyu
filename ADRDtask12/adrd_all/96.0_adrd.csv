"hello, new to this sub and this issue. my husband was just diagnosed with mild dementia a few days ago. on the tests with the neurologist, he struggled with remembering the five words, and repeating back sentences. the doctor told him he could drive, but not to do so alone, and prescribed some medication to help with his cognition. the advice that confused me was that he needs to socialize more. my husband has never been very social. he had a few friends at work, but retired last may and none of them have tried to keep up with contact with him. my daughter and son in law live with us, along with their five year old son, and my husband has regular contact with my daughter's in-laws. the doctor said that was not enough, he has to talk to others outside the family. while that would be great (though hard with covid), why doesn't conversation and contact with family count?"," yes, it's true that socialisation outside of the home is important otherwise lack of stimulation does lead to worsening of condition.  during the time my partner lived with me, there were times when i had to leave him at home by himself for short periods and i found he got worse.  can your husband go for a walk at all?  even walking outside will help and you can talk about what's going on around you or talk to people in the street.  go to the local park.  visit your neighbours. it doesn't have to be too challenging.good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k6mn9f/why_doesnt_family_contacts_count_as_socialzation/,Why doesn't family contacts count as socialzation?
"hello,first time posting here.  my dad is 81 and has light/moderate dementia.  he is okay as far as long term memories, and still knows me, my brother and my mom, who all live with him.  he can take care of himself with most things and is fairly independent as far as showering, using the restroom, etc. though he doesn't cook for himself, drive, etc.we live in safe neighborhood with minimal traffic and our street goes in a loop.  my dad often gets bored and goes on walks.  our house has 6 sliding doors and a front door so he will leave without us noticing or sometimes he will be in the backyard and then he will decide to go on a walk. we aren't necessarily worried about him getting lost as of now, however, **the issue is he never lets us know that he is going for a walk.** we know as his condition worsens, this will be more of an issue.  locking all the doors or constant monitoring will likely be what we need to do down the line.. but for now, we just want a way to be notified when he leaves the house so we can know when he left and stop him if needed, accompany him, etc.  he has a verizon care smart watch[but it really doesn't do a good job of sending notices. more over, even though verizon is by far the best cellular network for where we live, on a device this small the signal is very weak and drops out often.  anyone have any suggestions or thoughts on these products?[[one more note: i realize there a some tracking devices that are not watches but still wearable.  unfortunately, anything that isn't wristband or watch is unlikely to stay on him.  especially if he wakes up early, dresses himself and leaves the house. thank you"," sorry friend you need a locksmith. my grandma walked out the door, dragged her feet until bloody through rocks, then across the road and hugged a frightened neighbor. we all had to quarantine because of it. if he can't remember to tell you he's leaving, can he remember to socially distance and mask up when walking past a pedestrian? not a risk i'm willing to take. i had to get every door and window locked. now she threatens to smash the windows but hasn't gotten that far.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k6hqbi/dad_with_moderate_dementia_perimeter_system_gps/,"Dad with moderate dementia - perimeter system, GPS Tracker or Alarm System?"

"hello all,  i am 36 and am the sole care taker for my grandmother (80).  i was raised by her since i was 3 months old and have always called her mom.  she has 10 children that can not be bothered to help with her care.  i feel like i owe it to her to take care of her and try and keep her in her home.  this is getting to be progressively more difficult.  i have tried to talk to some of my family members but we are not close and they have resentment because i was spoiled growing up having much older parents supporting me.  i have been taking care of both of my parents (grandparents) since i was 13.  i only left home as an adult to get an education and returned after 1 year of college because it was to much on my mom as dad had passed.  i got a job and worked full time and went back to school at night while still being here to take care of her.  now that we are getting into the later years of her life she is saying such hurtful things and has outbursts over things i have no control over.  she keeps trying to have a realation ship with her children which is fine.  the problem is no mater what she does, sends gifts, gives money, ect‚Ä¶ they treat her terribly and always talk down to her.  this drives me insane because everything they do or have done in the past umpteen years i'm the one that catches the brunt of it.  she directs her frustration at me.  i'm finally to the point that i just don't have the patience to digest it any more.  since i have stated that i can't handle hearing about these things now she accuses me of being jealous of her kids. i'm the only one that has stayed with her and tried to work my life around her care.  i built my home close to hers so i would only be a phone call away and can help out with her needs and property.  she recently had a pacemaker put in and went to a care facility for 1 week.  that was the hardest thing i've ever done not being able to see her and know that she was taken care of for that amount of time.  now that she's been home for a few months i'm wondering if i made the right decision to have her at home.  she's still with it mostly as i have cameras to watch her and see what she does through out the day since i have to work during the day.  it's the sundowners that i notice that makes this much more difficult at night.  she orders things through her phone and if it doesn't show up the next day then she's furious that the company is scamming her and when i try to help and explain she just says the most hurtful things.  i'm very sorry for the long rant but i had to get my thoughts out as they are wearing on my  sole.  i guess now that you know my life story i should get to the real questions...1. what can i do with the phone situation.  i have call blocker and the likes but she's crafty and will order things from the tv or her fliers in the mail.  this always turns into an argument.  also the spam calls set her off because she thinks her ss has been breached and that she has a problem with her bank account.2. how do you emotionally cope with her saying hurtful things and now show shock and that your upset?  i know it's not her but the stress she's dealing with knowing that she's slipping.3. how would you handle the family situation.  there are 2 family members that live close but both are in the medical field.  i don't feel comfortable with them being around with covid.  do i just say oh well we will take our chances or do i just keep plowing ahead? 4. i started to read the 36 hour day and it helped but i'm a busy person with not much personal time.  i have a hard time sitting down and getting to read more than 30 minutes a week.  any ideas on that?thanks for any response and your time for those that read this far into my book..."," she's paranoid and sundowning.  these never get better, only worse.  she needs meds.  contact her doctor to start down the road finding the right meds to counter her aggressive/suspicious/paranoid behaviours.  and if you're amenable, let the doc know that you're looking into cbd, to see if there's any meds she's currently on that would have bad interactions.  cbd can help calm her down at night, just one drop of the remedy really helps with my elder.  i wrote a post about it if you want to read more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k5vtvs/thankful_i_found_this_and_im_not_alone_need_some/,"Thankful I found this and I'm not alone.

"tl:dr grandma with dementia is coming to live with me for a few months. i have no caregiving experience. any suggestions for resources? she's also very physically active and i'd love any any tips on keeping her occupied. hi all! so, my grandma is a 78 y/o, fairly active lady. she's been showing evidence of cognitive decline for the past few years, but things progressed very, very quickly with the combination of lack of stimulation from covid isolation and my grandfather passing away a few months ago. for the past 30 or she years she's gone to the bahamas to escape the winters. but, obviously, with the combination of the pandemic and her dementia getting worse (she's often confused, mixes up night and day, asks the same questions over and over again, etc) it's not a good idea for her to travel abroad alone. unfortunately, she's extremely stubborn, and the only way we got her to agree to stay in the us, is if she could stay with me instead (she lives in new england, and i live in a very warm part of the west coast). i don't mind hosting her for a few months, especially because my family back home are obviously experiencing caregiver burnout. but, apart from multiple sclerosis and tourettes, i have no experience caring for someone with a neurological disorder. could anyone recommend any resources for me to read? any websites or books? she's also still very physically able. and she tends to get bored staying at the house all day. she loves volunteering, going to casinos, eating out, and knitting. i know with the pandemic going on it will be tougher to keep her occupied, but any ideas of what might be good?thanks everyone!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k5rffz/grandma_coming_to_live_with_me_resources_advice/,[deleted by user]

"my grandmother is 83 years old, and over the past month or two, she's been developing issues with her short-term memory. a few weeks ago, she developed a false memory of a recent telephone conversation that never happened in which my sister told her that she doesn't love her. then there was another instance from a couple days ago, relayed to me from my mom, in which she asked the date towards the beginning of the conversation, and then asked for it again towards the end. my mother believes that it is the beginning of dementia, and there's no getting better for my grandmother. i personally don't think we should lose hope so quickly.first of all, my grandmother recently had a minor stroke. although it was caught early on, a stroke is a stroke, and even the mildest ones can shake things up in the brain - sometimes temporarily, sometimes not. it seems as though her memory issues really began around the time that she got it, so i think it's a real possibility that her memory issues might be related.the other thing that gives me a bit of hope is the fact that over the past month, my grandmother's cognitive state seems to have improved slightly. she's not 100% back to the way she was before, but from what i gather, she's not confabulating false memories anymore either. when i interact with her on the phone, she's the same as she's ever been. i think we need to see how things progress, and if her memory issues don't go away within the next few months, then she should probably see a specialist to determine where her short-term memory loss may be coming from.however, my mother is adamant that my grandmother is developing dementia, and that there's no getting better for her. i've done research on memory loss in old age online, its causes, and what can be done to slow its progression (if not reverse it outright). when i sent my mother some links, her response was like this: ""uau, your grandmother is getting dementia. her mind is failing because she's old. you need to stop denying it and just accept the reality of it. she's not getting any better."" i told her that even in cases of dementia, there are treatment options that can help slow its progression. she shot me down: ""no. her memory is going and there's nothing any of us can do about it. you're really grasping at straws here. it's okay to be optimistic, but you need to live in the real world."" when i suggested that she should go see a specialist sometime to assess her memory issues and determine what their cause might be, my mom shot down the idea: ""uau, bringing her to a specialist isn't going to do anything! it's not gonna make her better! you need to stop living in denial and just accept it, your grandmother is getting old!"" even though my mom might be right, these conversations really depress me. i'm trying to keep hope alive, and she's doing everything she possibly can to extinguish it. and look, i'm not saying that my grandmother *isn't* developing dementia - she may be. she's 83 years old, and she's going to be 84 next year. memory loss is a normal part of getting old, alzheimer's or no. but i also don't want to throw up my arms and give in until we're absolutely certain, beyond any semblance of a doubt, that her condition can neither be treated nor go away on its own.is my optimistic outlook reasonable, or am i in denial? i don't think it's wrong to hope for a best-case scenario even with my grandmother's advanced age being taken into consideration."," jesus christ on a cracker!if your grandmother does have dementia (and that's a big if, because nothing has been confirmed), your mother cannot just shrug her shoulders and go, ""she's just losing her memory, so there's nothing that can be done."" your grandmother has to be treated, because there's more to dementia than loss of memory. a lot more.i don't want to scare you, but does your mother have any idea what dementia entails? it is not just memory loss. when it gets worse, the person becomes certifiable, to the point of being unbearable to live with on some days. i am talking full blown cuckoo/nuts, where you will have days when you think, ""i have to call the psych ward; she's blown a fuse."" the fact that your grandmother is having the type of false memories where she's imagining that people said something upsetting to her is a very ominous sign *if* she has dementia, because this type of thing is par for the course. because dementia can get that bad, it's very important to have the person treated as early as possible--not just in terms of medication, but coping strategies (like making sure the person gets plenty of rest, is engaged in activities, isn't triggered by anything that might set them off). just assuming that dementia all boils down to ""memory loss"" is the worst thing anybody can do because it can be absolutely hell on wheels without treatment or preparation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k46fin/my_grandmother_is_developing_memory_problems_i/,"My grandmother is developing memory problems.

"hi, my mother has alzheimer's/vascular dementia and i feel like i've been grieving her for years already, even though she's still alive. we've recently moved in because she doesn't want to go to a home (and with covid ravaging care facilities where i live, i'm finally on the same page with her about that). i struggle with interacting with her; i can't bring myself to engage openly/directly because that feels too vulnerable - i don't want too much direct evidence that most of the person she was, and all of the mother that she was, is gone. i can talk with her about whether she wants tea, or whether she will water the plants today, but i just can't make myself try to have meaningful conversations. i have heard that people with dementia pick up on emotions, and i hope my struggling emotions don't show too much; i don't want to make her feel bad. she'll ask questions about my childhood and i can answer them, but it's like i've put up a mental plexiglass wall or something.basically i'd like to know whether/how any of you determined for yourselves at which point the person you knew was gone? to be clear, *i don't mean at all that people with dementia aren't people. i believe they deserve full respect and to have their rights protected.* i'm just feeling this weird pre-grief or something; i can't confide in my mum about stuff because a) i don't want her to feel she's causing me distress, since she can't do anything about it and b) her level of lucidity varies from day to day, even within a day. any advice please.for info, my dad died 20+ years ago when i was a teenager, and i have one estranged sister, so it's basically all on me. and i have two kids under 8."," i've posted a couple of times due to my father being diagnosed with mixed dementia about 2 weeks ago. he's nowhere near  the stage your mother is at, but hear me out ...my mil just recently passed away from dementia on sept 12.  i found through my experiences with her that when she had her good days, i would talk to her in a more simplified way.  i wouldn't necessarily ask her open ended questions, i would ask her simple questions related to the daily tasks of the day whether it be about what meal she wanted, what shows she wanted to watch, what clothes she wanted to wear.   i found that when i kept it simple, i would notice that she was ""there"".   if i complicated things, like asking her things without showing her, i would ""lose"" her in her mind.    i found that as my mother in law progressed over the 6 year period of her dementia journey, i found that the sundowning was the more challenging times to communicate.  but once i got to know how she responded to certain things, i went with it.    when i would notice that she was not ""there"" and she started talking about things that perhaps didn't make sense, or she started talking about a person or place that either didn't exist or if she started to act combative with my requests, i knew that i couldn't falter.   i kept an even keel, and over time as i learned the patterns and learned her new ""personality"" it also taught me how to roll with it.    i had also learned to redirect.   i also found what helped is when you want to try to interact with your mom and there's lots going on around her like the tv on, people around, or being in a public place, it can tend to be very overstimulating for a person with dementia which adds to their confusion.  so the less stimuli around when you want to try to interact with her, the better.  eventually though, you will get to a point where you become conditioned to it.   you become used to not trying to figure her out and your way of communicating with her on a moment's notice will become second nature.  i found as painful as it was to see my mil deteriorate, and watching my husbands heartache over watching it happen to her and not really knowing what to do, you get to a point where you put up a mental wall as some comments on here suggest.   it actually builds gradually.communicating with someone who has dementia is extremely challenging at the worst of times, but it can also have little opportunities of joy at the best of times.   it has its highs and lows.   sometimes it seems as if they meld together.  i also find that trying to figure them out too much causes frustration on your part and then they tend to feed off of that and therein lies the cause of their frustration.   i found with trial and error, if i kept pining at my mil to remember something or to do something and i got a less than favorable reaction from her, it would hurt me and get me upset.  i found however that if i avoided doing those things and practiced redirecting, i found things to be a bit easier.  dementia by far is no walk in the park, and i understand that we want to seek out the times that our loved one is ""there"" and we constantly search for it.  i also found however that when i searched and *could not find* it was discouraging.   so instead i stopped searching for when she was there and just let things happen naturally and let those moments surprise me instead rather than me looking for those moments.   i know i may have rambled but i hope i helped.  wishing you love and light in your darkest hours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k3z41o/how_to_determine_whether_the_person_you_knew_is/,how to determine whether the person you knew is still there or not?
"hello, im a new member whose grandmother has been recently showing signs of mci which seems to have been progressing rapidly in the last few weeks. we suspect she is either in the early stages of ad or will eventually develop it. she was recently prescribed medicine from a neurologist to help with her cognition.  my grandmother is very kind hearted but also quite proud. not that she is boastful or pompous (in fact she is very humble) but she does not like depending on others or having people worry about her. she is very reluctant to rely on people even as her health is beginning to go very quickly. she suffered a severe stroke 25-30 years ago and has had mild hemiparesis since. so my whole life i've known her as a physically fragile person but never to the point where i worried about her going about her daily life.but these days she can hardly walk without clinging to someone nearby. she slipped on a step outside her door earlier this week and almost fell but luckily my uncle was there to catch her. she forgets things minutes after she's said them and my grandfather gets frustrated when she begins to get upset at him because she insists that he did not say something he's said many times before. she is luckily very early in her stages, she is still able to cook (albeit slowly), hold simple conversations, and use the toilet alone. however given the rapidity of her recent cognitive decline i want to start preparing to become a caretaker for her when the time comes.just a little background, i'm her daughter's daughter, my mother works long hours and doesn't have time to see her mother. i'm about to graduate college this semester and will be staying home for a gap year or two saving up for grad school applications, so i'll have time to visit my grandmother often. i was hoping i could gather some advice on how to go about being an effective caretaker. what kind of attitude/disposition should i show her so that she won't feel too reluctant about receiving help from her granddaughter? what are effective ways i can help her walk and increase muscle strength in her legs? what kinds of things should i talk to her about that will help keep her mind active? sorry for rambling! any tips would be so very appreciated. thank you."," she sounds very much like my mother. i assume she has been under her doctors and neurologists care. my experience is from helping my dad 94yo. as we age we become less mobile and physical. our bodies weaken etc and its easier to just do less. what we do tho should be safe. if you can get her on a workout regimen that will help some. there are some good exercises for seniors on youtube and/or her neurologist can provide that info. several things...and i dont know if she will want to change her behaviour. no sharp movements like sudden turns or spinning around. everything should be deliberate and a bit slower. when sitting up or/and standing count to 30 until stepping. there's a sensor in the brain and compensates for blood draining down from the brain when we stand. this can cause dizziness and feinting and falls. counting to 30 lets it catch up. keep an eye on her doing her tasks during the day and watch for things she may have trouble with. as in taking her meds. is it organised and separated from everything else. does she have a day to day organiser. my dad at times will try and take his hearing aids. does she have hearing aids and are they working properly, clean, and plenty of batteries. check the house for trip and fall hazards. not only what may cause it but what she may fall on. make the house safe. look at where she may go, like the front steps. are there broken steps or bricks. is the patio in good shape, can she reasonable go out back. sometimes the little thing taken for granted or not seen make a big difference. my dad's shower has a lip of several inches and then a stepdown. this is very dangerous and keeps him from using the shower. is the shower and bathtub safe. if she needs it you can get handles installed in the bathroom and shower and a showerseat. you can also look to see if you can organize the house in a way that makes it easier for her to use the things she uses alot. like, i hang my dad's clothes in the closet so what he wears daily is at the front. things may go unnoticed even though they are right there. just because they see it doesnt mean they recognise it. i can write my dad a big note and tape it to his bathroom mirror and he won't see it. mentally. hopefully she doesn't just veg in front of tv. find out what hobbies etc she likes and do it with her. keep her engaged and lead her mind to think and reason. there are books of mind puzzles on amazon. i've read that videgames are good also if she may like that. gardening is good if she can get up and down. if not then maybe a table to do the work and some tiers for potted plants or planting boxes. one thing with the mind is puzzles and touch and sound and working thru 3d and extended puzzles. we tend to do the same things the same way as we age. our brains wire it in and it gets old and musty. doing new things in new ways and the more senses used the better. so if she's solving puzzles or games that involve color and space etc it will prompt her brain. working and solving in new ways is very good. the goal in it all is not the end result, the win...but the effort. the struggle, the reasoning is what helps the brain.music. music is the second best thing that reaches my dad. music enlivens brain and emotions and is somewhat magical. for fun find her favorite band or singer and get her a tshirt. stories. if you are so inclined. sit down with her and record her talking about her life and the family history. you could take these stories along with some old pics if she has them and make a short story album. she won't think anyone will care to hear it but tell her you do. and the family does. and the family to come will treasure it. sorry for the long dishevelled post, trying to run fix dinner. bless you for the love and attention you're giving her. i wish you the best of luck in your grad school and career. take good care of yourself and give grandma a hug for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k3tzu6/caretaking_tips/,caretaking tips?

"my father has been going downhill for a while now. my partner and i mentioned dementia for the first time about a year and a half ago. we lived in a different country for a while, so i didn‚Äôt really have an influence on seeking help back then. we moved back here in february and i‚Äôve been trying to work towards a diagnosis since then. tomorrow it‚Äôs finally happening. i don‚Äôt know how to feel."," my father was just diagnosed with mixed dementia 2 weeks ago.  i won't lie, it turned my world inside out and upside down.  i felt like my life became unhinged.    i didn't cry so much at first because of the shock of it all.  but i started crying at random times and all i could think about is what the future held.   not how he was now, but how he would be when he was in the final stages.  i have spent the last 6 years helping my husband take care of his mother who passed away from dementia on sept 12.   maybe i became numb or more or less conditioned as to what to expect.  but dementia is different for everyone who suffers.  when you get the diagnosis and it's dementia, ensure that you've taken all the tests that will make this diagnosis conclusive.   my dad scored 15/30 on his cognitive and his brain scan showed several kinds of deterioration in different areas.    this confirmed dementia once and for all. it felt like someone punched me in the stomach.   it was real this time.  no other test could tell me different and no 2nd diagnosis would produce a different result. it was dementia and i had to work on accepting it sooner than later because if i prolonged the denial stage, i would be doing my dad a huge disservice by prolonging treatment.  so i decided i was going to take the stance of *living in the moment for now*.  just *for now*.   enjoying my  father while he still has most of his faculties,  and not consuming myself with what the future holds.   how do i do this you ask?  easier than you think.   i engaged in a little gentle self talk with myself on my own time.   i promised myself that would enjoy him at his best right now because if i consume myself with doom and gloom i will have become too preoccupied with what lies ahead and will have missed out on who *he still is right now*.   if you can keep that as your personal mantra, and remind yourself of that every day, i hope that helps you cope.   you will have time to worry about the future when your dad reaches the stage where you know it's progressing to a point where those discussions need to be had.   i wish you love and light.  hearing a diagnosis like this almost seems worse than a cancer diagnosis in my opinion, and i don't mean any disrespect to anyone who has lost someone to cancer.   losing your mind feels worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k3f67v/tomorrow_my_father_gets_a_diagnosis/,Tomorrow my father gets a diagnosis

"i'm looking for some advice regarding my mom. she is 65 and was diagnosed with dementia almost a couple years ago now. i can't remember the type but she basically had the migraine that ended all migraines. she lives at home with my dad who is 70. at this point her day consists of waking up around 9, watching tv for pretty much the whole day, the same show, eating the same thing everyday which is not a lot, showering and now going to bed by 6. she uses to walk everyday but it's now pretty cold where we live so she doesn't want to go outside. before all this, she worked, was very active, exercised everyday and ate what she considered to be very healthy. she was fairly social through work and fitness people. how do you help someone like her find meaningful things to do throughout the day? it's been really difficult to get her to do things. i've gone to a therapist with her earlier on and she didn't want to keep going. i've made a lot of suggestions in the past of things to try and she won't do them because she says she doesnt know how. my dad makes suggestions and if he is too firm with getting her to do things she cries so he feels bad. it's so difficult because i feel like there are so many  things we could be doing with her but she is stubborn and emotional so we just let it go. for some of you dealing with this, any suggestions or resources? thank you in advance."," hi there! i'm so sorry to hear your family is struggling but i'm glad you're reaching out for help. she is likely depressed and withdrawing, as they tend to do. what you can do is continue to be patient but understand therapy can't do much for her at this point. i highly recommend you read the book still alice to help understand what it's like for her. there are medications that can help, but nothing can really slow the disease. absolutely keep in touch with her dementia doctor and keep a journal of her behaviors and day to day stuff.   when you spend time together, make her feel useful. ask her for her advice (even if you're not going to use it or it doesn't make sense), talk about the weather, have her participate when you cook by mixing a sauce or help set the table, have her help you fold laundry, etc. maybe even have family game time where you all sit down and put together a puzzle. never tell her when she repeats herself or argue with her - reason has no place here. and if you have pets, especially work on that. get her to spend time with them. animals are easier for them to relate to often because animals don't quiz you on your knowledge or remind you that you're not getting better. check out [alz.org]( they have a lot of resources and a hotline to call and ask questions!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jzasfo/looking_for_some_advice/,Looking for some advice

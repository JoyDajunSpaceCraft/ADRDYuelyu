"disclaimer up front. i have no pecuniary interest in greenlight. i’m sharing this story because i’ve read the struggles of others here with oddball purchases dementia has prompted folks to make. i only mention greenlight because it’s the company i used. there may be others. probably are. do you homework. ymmv.so, just after covid started and dad was in lockdown, he spent way too much time in email. he gets 300 to 400 a day. all manner of grift and junk email.in under 10 days, he forwarded me emails for three different scams. the third was the final straw. it was an advertisement for a book about cancer cure secrets hilter’s doctors discovered during world war 2. he told me he read all the words on the website and did not see anything about a subscription and clicked through all the other pages until he got to the one where he’d have to enter his credit card information. a few before this he placed an order for memory pills - 14 day trail sample, no obligation. except the fine print subscribed him to a monthly subscription for about $60 a month. he refused to pay, contested charges, racked up interest, late fees, etc. i ended up having to cancel the credit card he used and paid off the $400 bill he racked up. he claims to this day it only cost about $80.so, back to the hilter book. the only card he had was a debit card linked directly to his checking account. it’s a trust account. i’m listed as manager. i consulted his attorney. then, i shut off the card, informed dad the card was turned off and i’d be making other arrangements for him. few hours later he was in my driveway claiming i’d be arrested for attempted murder because he couldn’t but groceries and i’d be starving him to death.i ended up getting him a greenlight debit card. it’s marketed toward parents who want to give their children an allowance and have some control over spending. i set the card to automatically refund $300 every time the balance got low. i received a text with every purchase. we’d talk and he’d tell me he’d gone to walmart, the gas station, etc. but i already knew. i felt this could be handy if he ever went missing. i’d have electronic breadcrumbs to start the search. i could also disable transactions at certain stores. for a while, he’d buy any and all angel statues at thrift shops. once i disabled the individual thrift shops, that ended.it worked well until he entered nursing care and no longer needs a card.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uamyxd/oddball_spending_and_greenlight_debit_card/,Oddball spending and Greenlight Debit Card
"hi, i have had cognitive and physical decline for now more than 2.5 years, i'm at the end of my 30's.. my mris have been normal until august 2021. i had a neuropsychological evaluation that showed some memory loss with a none specific pattern. i had a lumbar puncture this year because i wanted to make sure it's nothing treatable. i wouldn't want to miss an autoimmune disease for which there could be treatments. the doctor who prescribed the test never got back to me but the test turns positive for protein 14 3 3. although it says prion disease is unlikely because of a negative quic test. of course i can google and see what 14 3 3 is associated to, but when looking further ive read that the protein is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. the test said 'indirect marker for a neurodegenerative disease'. i was wondering if any of you heard that the protein can be linked with a treatable kind of dementia, because it's hard for me to work and i'm not sure i want to pay another neurologist for interpretation (the doctor who prescribed won't return my calls). also i'm getting less curious about what's not treatable because i know something is wrong anyways.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uam3z6/is_it_worth_getting_a_neurologist_interpretation/,[deleted by user]

"that's the sound i'm currently hearing after an exhausting weekend.  she finished it yelling at me for washing/grooming her dogs while she watched forest gump. i did it too late but i didn't want to be stuck here doing the laundry tomorrow on no sleep. it's harder to walk early in the day. after she finished the movie , she told me how terrible it was . that's been the theme and it's getting to me. i went to find something else when she told me she was going to sleep . that was 2 hours ago while i waited to wash the fur off me . she's eating candy  in the dark. anyway, i finally got some weekend help. my uncle agreed to have someone come in on saturday so i can go home and sleep a few hours . between my own serious pain issues , the temperature, the dogs and her ups and downs it's impossible to sleep here . i don't mind but i couldn't do 3 days of no sleep anymore without a break . my brother came to visit. i showered and even put on a little makeup. i sat a few feet from her making jewelry with my niece while she proceeded to bash my weight , my lack of life , my appearance , just everything . i am disabled. i have adhesive arachnoiditis and it's advancing  . after pain management poked and prodded me for 6 years , they decided to reduce my limited pain meds . i know i'm not the average 33 year old. it's been a horrible few months. i spend 3 days here and the rest of the time going to appointments, trying to recover . i know i have no life , but this side of things is hard . i have no business trying to groom her dogs either but i don't control the money. i'm tired of trying to do things with one hand behind my back.  i hope tomorrow is a good day. i just  needed to vent and in that way , i can understand her unhappiness. i just wish i mattered as much as a dog every once in a while.", sending you hugs and the knowledge that you are heard,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ualkxg/clink_goes_the_candy_dish/,Clink Goes the Candy Dish
"i am in the early days of dealing with the possibility of dementia with my mom.  i feel at times there is something off with her. something not quite right.  it's different every single day.  some days are good and then other days are not so good. the main behaviours have been mood changes and easily angered, some silliness, some ocd. mood changes - some days she talkative and other days there's nothing but silence from hereasily angered - there were incidents where she blows up at me easily and over nonsensical things. like i was preparing a parcel for sending away before and she went into a range at me. another time i was looking for a pan from the cupboard and that was another episode from her. another time i reached for a clean kitchen towel. small incidents that would anger her. another time she blew up at me over the laptop when i was setting it up. she has no knowledge of computers or internet and i was setting up my laptop to sit down together with her and she blew up at me shouting - 'i will do it's. silliness - getting me to do online shopping for her and getting me to buy her more shoes even though she has loads of shoes.  last year during lockdown she wanted more 'going out' or 'fancy' shoes for wearing to am event.  she has a wardrobe of shoes for such events but she wanted more even though we had no events to go to.  we were in lockdown.  i think in her mind she thought the whole country was going to break out and go dancing at each crossroads the minute the pandemic ended and she was buying to party. i don't know. she was never ocd when i was small. she is still not very particular ocd but she is spending a lot of her time cleaning and needlessly cleaning more and more. there's a lot of time and effort spent of cleaning.  it's almost as if she wants to maintain control. i know a lot of the time forgetfulness and confusion presents with dementia so this is very difficult for me..  i think there is some forgetfulness but it's very, very mild and hardly noticable. this wasn't the first thing for me to raise alarm bells. it was earlier this year after yet another silent episode from her that i started piecing together bits and pieces over the past 2 to 4 years with when i started thinking on the lines of dementia. i think she is going senile. every day is different from her. i am in a place where i don't know how to move forward with my suspicions. i am apprehensive about emailing or writing to our gp practice. we attend the same practice.  i would feel more comfortable speaking face to face with my gp to see if they could put a note on my mom's medical file to explore dementia for when my mom goes next. today i found something new with my mom.  she had a rack of clothes drying and there amongst some of her undies was a bra that looked familiar to me. i had a closer look and it was one of my bras for sure. we would be different sizes and we would shop in different places. i looked at the tage and it was my size.  i am plus size so my band size would be larger than hers.   my mom never does laundry for me so there's no way she picked up this up and put it into a load of her own laundry. there's no way this bra was lying around the home for her to pick up.  another thing is that i have my clothes and undies divided up into good wear and every day wear.  this bra would be a bra for good wear.  it was a good bra.  i remember last year when going to an event, i thought i had more bras but i couldn't find them.  i even checked my laundry basket and definitely a lot of my good bras were gone. i didn't think anything more of this. i thought maybe it's in a bag somewhere. and here today i found my mom with one of my bras. i am completely shocked that she has a bra from me.  so she robbed my bra and possibly even more as if it was hers. there's no excuse in the world to rob my bra though.   i know if i asked her she would give me an excuse of buying it in a second hand shop. i found her with other things before that looked familiar and she told me that she bought it before. it's just a new incident to add to the list of doubts that i have.", sounds like frontal temporal dementia behaviors. my mom did lots of weird things up until diagnosis. see if you can get her in to a neurologist.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uah76h/i_found_my_mother_with_some_of_my_undies/,I found my mother with some of my undies

"i haven't seen my grandma in years, and she's staying with family on the other side of the world. she's impossibly healthly for her age, she has a full head of thick hair better than today's teens (although grey) and all her teeth are shiny and look like they came out of a toothbrush commercial. she has zero, and i mean zero, health issues. she lives on a farm with the rest of my family, and never has unhealthy food. a couple years back when my dad visited her, she forgot small things, like she'd remind him to eat lunch repeatedly even though he just ate lunch in front of her half an hour ago. nowadays, my dad talks to her frequently, but apparently she doesn't recognize him 20 minutes after he's just introduced himself again and he has been talking about life. when asked to identify people, she pointed at her grandson (my brother) as being the son of ""this lady beside you"" (my mom) rather than referring to him as her grandson, and as my mom as her daughter in law. i thought this was absolutely crazy; my grandmother was a pharmacist and has the most knowledge i know, so forgetting seems very out of the picture. i think that our extended huge family living with her helps her with tasks, but i'm not sure if she can manage by herself. my father has said that she has alzheimer's, but he doesn't say it definitely, he just says it like ""she's old and she's forgetting things, like dementia, like alzheimer's"" saying the whole spectrum and he doesn't seem sure, but he might be about alzheimer's, i'm not sure if he's saying she has normal memory loss for her age or if she has the brain degeneration illness of alzheimer's. i was really scared and sad because i heard alzheimer's has no cure, and my grandma used to give people medication as a pharmacist, so to think that she cannot remember a thing while her brain degenerates is scary while she depends on others for medication. i don't know if she takes medication either. does this sound like someone with normal age-related memory loss, or actual dementia/alzheimer's? what have you noticed early on in your relatives with alzheimer's?i know i'll figure out whether she has normal memory loss or alzheimer's by asking my family; but i don't want them to worry and they'd probably gloss over the severity for me so i wouldn't worry. i actually asked my mom and she said my dad was overreacting and it was just normal memory loss that she has seen plenty of times in older people. now i'm pretty confused whether i should be worrying about my dad now or not, and about myself. i heard this was genetic, does that mean in the future my dad (grandma's son) and i (along with my siblings) will get alzheimer's? none of my grandma's siblings (older and younger than her) have it. i now feel like someone who has been told their dad has 6 months left to live, or that i have 1 month left to live. i'm super terrified for my grandma, my dad and my siblings."," when memory loss impacts someone’s ability to make it through the day independently, you are beyond “normal” aging",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ua8x28/how_do_i_know_if_my_grandma_has_alzheimers_or/,How do I know if my grandma has Alzheimer's or normal memory loss?

"so, yesterday my mom and i spent some time with my grandma and her mood was very erratic. happy/okay then angry/aggressive and snappy. i noticed when she was angry her eyes would change. like, they would go dark almost black in the irises. and when she was back in a normal mood, her eyes would be their normal brown. has anyone else noticed this? oh! and her face changes—like it goes slack. it’s the oddest thing.

"thanks for reading my post. my mother has been living in independent living now for about 4 months. she no longer drives, we took this away since she was getting lost. we took away her credit card,  frivolous spending. she is no longer cooking, we are afraid she will leave stove on.she can get meals at her facility . she has now turned to her neighbor to manipulate and coerce her into 'buying' her things. toilet paper, shampoo, cheerios, frozen meals, soap.mom had plenty of this. no need to buy extra and hoard. we didn't know this was happening. this patterns are not new to us. we have known for many years she was manipulate. that is why she is living now where she is. also to find out she was taking food off neighbors plate during meals. and putting it away for later, possible to eat or hoard. no idea. mom will not be truthful on this fact. she has been diagnosed with dementia alzheimers.  we have literally taken pretty much everything away. we cannot let her go to the store anymore, and walmart. now we have to reimburse the neighbors for all the extras she bought her. this is more than dementia. how would you go about dealing with such acts. i'm at a loss."," any chance she genuinely thought she was out of those things? my husband is constantly telling me we need to buy things when we don’t. we will be at the store and he’ll say i don’t have any blueberries and i’ll remind him of the giant bag in the fridge. we’ve had many rough shopping trips because even though i reassure him we are not out of..whatever it is…he is very insistent that we are out and need it. i end up having to buy things i know i don’t need just to prevent a melt down. when i show him the pantry stocked he just says “that’s because we got it today at the store.” in my experience, for what that’s worth, lol, people with dementia don’t have the brain power at a certain point to be deliberately manipulative or plan things. it’s more like in that moment they genuinely think they need that food..soap…sock..whatever…and react without filters to try to get it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ua7f19/manipulative_and_coercive/,Manipulative and Coercive
"in the past i've noticed every now and then, that my father is a little forgetful here and there. nothing that was ever worrying (though his mother had dementia that degraded very rapidly).today i was talking to my father about the bike that he and i had bought secondhand a month ago from a bike store. he remembered us together being there to buy the bike. he did not remember the bikes brakes being oiled that i had asked them to do. while it was being oiled my dad and i were there looking and he asked a handful of questions about it being done.today, roughly a month later, he could not remember it happening. it was after i pried for a while and gave more details about the moment that he slowly started to remember.he is currently 65, his mother developed dementia at around 75 i believe. any worries i should have?i intended for this message to be shorter and more to the point, sorry."," i am in the same situation as you. i am suspecting that my mom might be going senile.   it's early days. this is hard for me because the forgetfulness/confusion that is typical of dementia is limited with my mom.  it's very mild and hardly noticable.  what caught me off guard earlier this year was her moods and anger issues where she was easily angered. the moods are different every day. some days she's trying to be my best friend and then other days she won't talk to me.  just today i found one of my bras hanging up drying amongst her laundry.  she never ever does my laundry.  last year i was getting ready for an event and i had a selection of good bras but that selection ran low. i found it bizarre. to loose my bras.  there was my mom with a bra that was mine.  we are different sizes by the way.  this is disgusting, the idea that she's wearing my underwear.it's only now that i can pick apart incidents over the past number of years and join the dots. i think she is going senile. i hope i am wrong. i think it's only a matter of time before other symptoms that closely relates to dementia might develop like forgetfulness and confusion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u9p513/could_my_father_be_suffering_from_early_dementia/,Could my father be suffering from early dementia?
"not sure if this is the right group, but i really want to seek some opinions or thoughts about the situation. my grandma is 89, and has dementia. her memory is really not perfect, she remembers the key details, but oftentimes she forgets what she did during the week. she is under constant care by me and my mum.    moving to the main point, she is very obese. at first, we were really puzzled how she managed to gain such a big amount at this quick rate, since she does not cook, and only eat when we serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  what we found out, was when we are gone, she goes through all the cabinets, pantry, in search for food. i have busted her a few times, and she always says, that either she is hungry or acts like there is no food in her mouth, that she is obviously chewing. so, me and my mum started hiding food.  but it is really frustrating, and hiding a fridge can be a challenge. it is just crazy how she never feels that she had enough, and she can easily eat everything she finds non-stop. the cherry on top is, that when the guests come over, she always says that she hasn’t got anything to eat all day, even though she already had breakfast and lunch. i see how it is taking a toll on my mother, when she really sacrifices a majority of her time to take care of her, and grandma doesn’t even remember. maybe someone had a similar experience or can share any ideas? thanks a lot in advance.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u9ol71/grandma_does_not_remember_that_she_has_already/,[deleted by user]
"sorry for the long story. there is a summary of my question and a tldr at the bottom.  i want to give some backstory. my mom got early onset alzheimer's/dementia and over the course of 8years i watched her completely forget who she was, who i was. near the end before we put her in a care home i was changing her diapers. she would talk to her reflection in the mirror like it was her friend. i'd come out in the middle of the night sometimes to find her just standing there staring into darkness or facing a corner. it was really unnerving. she started getting symptoms when i was about 16 or so and she died when i was 23, my younger brother only 18.  her dad died of alzheimer's but his didn't set in until he was around 80years old. her symptoms started when she was about 40. she always said she wouldn't die of that disease and technically, she didn't. she progressed really rapidly in the care home and in her last few days she became violent, attacking other residents in their sleep. so she was sent to a psych and they prescribed her some medication. well this medication made her really dizzy and a couple days later she fell and hit her head. she died of brain trauma/internal bleeding. so her statement did stand true in the end, she didn't let that horrible disease be the thing to take her out.. although i believe she died long before her physical body did anyways.. now none of that is really the point of this post. since she had early onset that means she carried a specific gene that caused it. this is hereditary so me and my younger brother have a 50/50 chance of carrying it. this gene can be found in a dna/gene test.  if i carry this specific early onset gene it is pretty much 100% that i will get early onset alzheimer's. if i don't carry it there's still always the chance i can get it later in life but it's not a certain thing.tldr:  if i don't carry the early onset gene id get some bit of peace of mind. but if i do carry it there are 2 cons and 2pros that come to mind. con #1- it will most certainly effect  health or life insurance right? con #2- i feel like i'd psych myself out and think about it all the time, worry if any small thing i forget is symptoms setting in etc. pro #1) i could likely start trying tests studies treatments &amp; prevention methods early on and pro #2) i would try harder than i have been to live my life to the absolute fullest knowing that i could die in my 40s. i already live by this to an extent as i know every day isn't guaranteed but i'd definitely spend a lot more time doing the things i love in the next 10years or so. i know in the end it comes down to what i want to do but my question for you is, would you want to know?"," i would want to know mine. idk if i would want to know my brothers’ though. i’m pretty sure one is schizophrenic, and the other two of us are fairly certain that if we have kids we will pass it on to at least one, whether it of course be my dads schizophrenia or my moms early onset. if i found out it was me, i think i’d be okay with that. i’d know the timeline i have to provide a good life for my future family, and i could give that information to my wife when deciding whether to have kids or not. if i found out my brother(s) had it though…..i’m tearing up just thinking about watching them go through this too. it’s bad enough watching my mom go through it at 52, but we’re all so young (i’m 27, my bros 25). if it was them and not me, that would break me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u9j9o7/lost_my_mom_at_24_question_about_gene_test/,Lost my mom at 24.

"its been 3 years since my father's diagnose. he is 65 only. i am so sorry he never had the chance to live his 60's he went from 60 to 80 years old.its been downhill since then, he is on some medications to chill him a bit and get better sleep. i have been noticing he is beginning to have some kind of mild hallucinations. last night he woke up in the middle of the night asking my mom why there was a person there and why they were in the kitchen while such person is just a frame above the bed of leaves and they have been sleeping in my room as they are staying this week in my place and i will return with them to their home for some weeks.he is quiet most of the time, interactions have decreased significantly in the past months. i mean, he is not able to make a coherent phrase anymore. he stutters some words and its difficult to understand what he is saying, when he does sometimes comes from a weird observation, like trying to relate the tv controller with a little monkey there. nonsense.its clear he is losing his consciousness day by day. at least here he is not wandering that much anymore, he sits or lays in the couch and stays there. his eyes...his eyes are lost in space. he doesn't hear or understand clearly when someone is addressing to him and he needs help to conduct him where he needs to go. he is totally dependent in everything, even baths he can't do it properly in his own. this wasn't happening when i last saw him in january. sometimes i wonder if he is becoming blind because he cant see the most obvious things. my apartment is small, like 570 sq feet, two rooms and a bathroom between, he always misses the bathroom. he goes all the way to the laundry area or one of the rooms to pee. obviously the bathroom is damn small, and he is still not sure where to pee and even aimed with his hands to be sure pointing it to the side of the toilette. how is that possible...its depressing...very depressing. i feel some guilty for choosing to stay in the city while my parents and my brother (27, i am 28) lives 1 hour drive (i don't own vehicles so i cant visit them that often, i intend to do so soon  as long as i find some way or even save to buy a motorbike). i mean, wfh since the pandemic hit and living by myself for 5 years now, i have choose this life before his disease so i could gain some independence and find my own way and to be not a burden for them, i have a girlfriend i want to marry soon so i need to build my life and not worry my mom, i guess its the right thing? if she needed my help she might ask, and  i am glad my brother lives there to help them out. as i see them every 2 months, this means i only see frames of my fathers illness and its always getting  worse. my mom and brother are not that shocked as i am because they are there. my mom has been dealing better now, she has accepted that correcting him will not help, just comply and chill him when asking about going home or seeing his wife or dead relatives.he is not able to recognize any of us. i wonder what goes through his head...i needed to offmychest this because as much as i try to accept this as life the way it is and this is just one way to die, when i stop to think about it i just want to cry and i do sometimes, a little, because we need to keep going. i feel bad because we werent really close all of our lives. i mean, he was always there and provided us all, he did a wonderful job as father, we just didnt click when we grew up so our relation were just ok enough, i wish we had way more father-son moments as i see others doing. now its too late. however, i am glad i see a lot of in me from him, i am a fraction of the men he was and i am glad for that.as if the disease is not enough to burden us all we need to mind and deal with the judicial matters and battle for the right to not pay irs anymore. so sorry...we are no that religious but i know he had faith in god as i do, and i am glad i once asked him if he believed in god ans jesus christ as his savior and he does. so i know he is going to be saved and go to heaven peacefully. i don't pray a lot...once in a while but when i do i always ask him to relief my father's pain and give peace in his heart, the same for us and strength to deal with all that, i feel better afterwards and thats the way he have been living.i wish you all the best dealing with this. you are not alone", i'm so sorry that you and your family is going thru this. my mother passed in march 2020 from complications from dementia. i do have to say that i had the chance to visit her a few times a week because of her living in a assisted living home only 15 minutes from my house. she recognized me and knew my name until the day she passed. i miss her so much. any questions just pm me. good luck and peace.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u9hv71/hallucinations_and_venting/,Hallucinations and venting
"i’m posting this to get some advice on what i should do.should i try and get my wife to the doctor or neurologist?she is having very bad short term memory loss, loss of balance, and tremors.she is also experiencing muscle/joint stiffness/pain/weaknessshe gets these very bad intense headaches, which in her own words ""makes her feel out of it"" they last for a couple minutes then go away.when she laughs the left and right side at the base of her skull starts hurting really bad, she says it burns almost or that someone is pushing super hard on her skull and squeezing.she has lost weight without trying.she barely eats because she feels full fast.for a while we thought her memory loss was due to anxiety and depression, but she has been on medication, and it has been controlled and getting a lot better. her memory did not improve.she had high liver enzymes one time, so us and her doctor chalked up her memory loss and tremors to her liver. it’s not because of her liver, all her bloodwork came back and it’s all normal.tested her thyroid, normal.last bloodwork showed no vitamin deficiencies. she is a smoker, vape throughout the day and marijuana at night.normal sleephistory of concussions when she was a teenagershe has had memory problems, but now it’s getting much worse and more noticeable.her memory loss consists of:asking a question then a few minutes later she asks the same question with no recollection of asking it the first time.she will be talking and then can’t think of the word she was trying to say and she gets frustrated. she cries sometimes because of it and sometimes she will hurt herself (she smacks her forehead a lot when she can’t remember)she gets words mixed up and puts two different words together.she came out once asking where the sceeezers were. then she says scissors, then she lets out a loud fu\*\* and yelled tweezersshe has little cups where she holds her makeup everything has a place. specifically, her mascara, it has its own cup. one day she was wandering around looking for her mascara and she just couldn’t find it. she put it in a drawer, not the cup. she had no recollection of putting it there. another time she’s looking for her mascara again. it ended being in the toothbrush and toothpaste holder.she forgets appointments and important dates.she had an appointment the other day at 11:15. she put it in her phone, work calendar, it was on her paper for the doctor, on her paper calendar, and on her doctors portal. everything said 11:15. well she forgets, and she goes at 11:45. she said she read 11:15 as 11:45 and she even questioned the front desk lady and didn’t believe her that her appt was at 11:15.she’s having a hard time following recipes, she’s just very slow at it now.she will be talking, and she tries to say a word and it starts out as mumbo jumbo she can’t grasp on to saying it correctly and she ends up stuttering trying to get the word out. she lets out a big ugh and i have to say the word for her then she can say it.whenever she gets up to go get something, she stops, looks confused and forgets what she was doing and must ask me what she was doing/getting.she walks all around the house just to grab one thing. she forgets what she’s getting.she once forgot that she let our dogs outside, until she woke up to barking and scratching at 2am.mid-sentence she will just stop and pause. she forgets what she was talking about, and she must ask me what we were just talking about.she barely remembers to take her medication, we are close to getting her a pill box because when she does remember to take her medication on her own, later in the day she’ll forget if she took it or not and then is at risk for double dosing.the majority of the time she doesn’t know what day it is, she will say it’s friday but really it’s like wednesday.she repeats her stories about her day at least like 3 times a day after getting home.she doesn’t remember the day before; she has a hard time thinking about what we had for dinner the day before.she barely remembers what she does the day before.she is a math wizard, but lately she’s having trouble calculating simple numbers like single digit numbers.she has expressed to me that she can’t remember her schedule. she has a time sheet to fill out and she can never remember what time she got to work and what time she left. she also forgets to write down what time she gets to work once she gets there.she has had tremors for a year or so, but they are very noticeable now. her hand shakes uncontrollably and it spreads to her whole arm sometimes. her leg will also have a big tremor. these tremors happen at rest.her balance is not great.she’ll be standing up straight and just randomly loses her balance.she runs into the corners of walls because she just doesn’t move out of the way quick enough? or she thinks she’s moved enough out of the way, but she ends up just ramming her shoulder into the wall.we are talking about getting a bar for the shower, because she has said when she closes her eyes to wash her face, she gets very dizzy and loses her balance.it’s not safe. she has had some close calls of almost falling out of the shower because she just randomly loses her balance.what should i do? should i be worried?"," this sounds very worrisome and i'm sorry you're both going thru this!  if she is 25, you should get her to see a movement disorder specialist and read up on functional neurological disorder.  a general neurologist lacks the training to diagnose her correctly.  this will probably end up being the diagnosis once they hopefully rule out other bad stuff.from what you've said this seems pretty significant.  does she have a psychiatrist?  are your aware of any severe trauma or stress in her life? there tends to be triggers for this but can have occurred at any time in life.please look into finding a movement disorder specialist though as this is the best way to figure out what's going on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u9gcbn/is_my_wife_showing_signs_im_not_sure_what_to_do/,Is my wife showing signs?

"my mom lives with us. she’s only 67 but after losing her job 3 years ago she has rapidly declined. she seems much slower to speak with, it’s almost frustrating listening to her talk .. searching for the words.. sometimes decides she doesn’t even know what she’s saying and says never mindrecently (1 month ago) she started chatting through facebook with a scammer / catfish that had convinced her he was a well known professional athlete (i’m leaving his name out) just let it be known he is exceptionally famous and 28 years old . she began a romantic relationship with this person believing it was the athlete.. after coaxing her to deposit a couple of fake checks (she didn’t know of course) and sending portions of money back to the tune of over $10,000 she finally realized and listened to her family and admitted it was not the athlete and was a scammer. she felt embarrassed and very sad/ upset. her bank wanted tons of money and she just scraped by on social security. days later she starts another romantic relationship with a person pretending to be a semi famous musician. she talks about it at first then begins to hide it from everyone. her finances are absolute chaos so i have the small few hundred dollars she has left to her name. she asks for $100 to open a new bank account because the old ones all closed on her. she then proceeded to go buy gift cards and send them to this new scammer. she talks to him as if they are in love and will be married soon.. after two weeks of chatting and of course he’s wanting money from her and asks several times and tells her to ask me for it. clearly i anyone thinking rationally he is pressuring her for money and manipulating her blatantly.she claims she knows this is wrong but she also will lash out and scream at anyone who tries to confront her about this issue. it’s strange to see someone that was considered highly intelligent and successful so far gone from reality she believes these scammers ridiculous stories for needing money and will harm her own financial well being, lie to her family and even lash out in anger when confronted.i don’t know if this is psychological or cognitive or what! i need to get her some help. any advice??"," thanks for responding, i appreciate it all. i assumed online scams are pretty common this just seemed next level considering she is nearly 70 and had been convinced she was in an online relationship with an nba superstar who suddenly had “bank issues” and needed her to send money for him and his charity. then once it all fell apart to jump right into another identical situation with what she believed is a famous musician that she’s convinced is suddenly in love with her over the internet and he also has bank problems and needs her to send money. this all starters a month ago and she went from one scammer to the next within days of having her bank account go negative $13,000. i just couldn’t ever imagine her to be someone like this, very successful in the corporate world for 30 years, home owner etc.. it’s the most bizarre situation i’ve been in for a long time",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u9ddvs/help_is_this_dementia/,"Help, is this dementia?"

i’m unable to sleep at night right now. but i am no longer capable of taking care of my mother any longer. she is hallucinating and wondering. sad and then frightened. every minute of every day she needs me. but i am becoming sick from no sleep and the constant panic and facade i have to keep to keep her calm. she’s unaware she is entering a facility in two weeks. if we told her she would completely unravel. is anyone else been or going through this? will she be ok? im so sick to my stomach over this.," she will be ok.  she might fight it at first - my mom called every week for like 3 months to tell me what a horrible person i was and what a horrible place i ""put her in"".  i didn't ""put her there"" - she put herself there - she ended up in the hospital after a wandering incident, and they said she could go back to her apartment.  my advice is to hang in there - everything will work out - like someone else who commented here, my mom now has some of her dignity back.  she's clean, her clothes are clean, she's eating well & socializing.  i'd also wait to tell her until a few days before - tell her you are moving into a new place.  my neighbor used to tell his mother that they all moved to the facility and his apartment is just down the hall.  hopefully the facility has a wonderful staff like the one my mom is in has - they really know how to work with dementia patients & their families.  they've been great to me as well - so incredibly helpful - they've answered any questions i've had & have given me advice.  i'm just happy to know that she'll be living out the rest of her life well-cared-for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u95z0a/what_was_your_loved_ones_experience_like_entering/,[deleted by user]

"hello, i’m hoping to get some insight on how my girlfriend and her family can get financial assistance with getting her grandmother (patient) and her grandfather into a long term care facility. her grandma is in her 80’s and has severe dementia. at this point she remembers nothing, and is verbally and physically abusive. last summer she fell and broke her hip, that lead to a horrible few months of recovery. in the last 2 months she’s fallen 3 times and hurts herself constantly. since she’s in pain it only makes her attitude much much much worse. she is absolutely unable to care for herself of course, and my gf’s family cannot care for her by themselves. they’re not equipped to deal with her at all. her grandpa is in his 90’s and constantly is the target of her anger and abuse and when gf and her mom try to intervene, they then get the brunt of it. his health is also starting to slip further and further as this goes on. gf’s mom is a single mother and a teacher and gf is an admin assistant at a school so their funds are very very limited. i offer to help in anyway i can, house work, yard work anything, but i can’t help much financially either. at this point they don’t know what to do and believe there are absolutely no options out there. even the thought of splitting up the grandparents scares them for her grandpa’s sake. what options are there for helping pay for a memory care facility. insurance, non-profits, is something like go-fundme or anything like that the best bet?any advice can make a big difference for them so i welcome anything y’all can think of. thank you", go to the nearest adrc in your area.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u9266t/dementia_caregivers/,Dementia Caregivers

"hi there! new to this community, and in a bit of a hurry here- sorry if i miss any rules! i am looking for recommendation on tracking systems for my grandfather. he’s started wondering, and it’s very worrisome. does anyone have any that they recommend? thank you in advanced!"," here’s what i found when i looked into this.most active trackers have the problem that they need charging.  you first need to decide if your grandfather would remember to charge or wear the tracker.second, if not then look at something like tile tags or air tags.  airtags are the model i’m most familiar with of these types.  it’s a passive tracker that uses nearby apple devices (anyone’s, but just yours) to do the active tracking. so their battery lasts around a year.  it’s also very easy to remove the speaker since it’ll try beeping when too far from your iphone as an anti-stalker system.at this point, it comes down to hiding it in something your grandfather will take with him when wandering.  shoes, wallet, etc.there are flaws with airtags for this.  they need to be pinged by an iphone.  if he books it into a forest you would maybe get a ping from the parking lot or near the road, but not how far in he went.  until your phones gets close enough to him.it also doesn’t update in real time.  sometimes up to 20 minutes.  normally it’s faster than that when i’ve legit misplaced something, but i noticed when i and my friends were messing around the time went up.  possibly more anti-stalking as the arrow pointing in the tags’ direction also doesn’t work if you are close but the tag is moving.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u8x4lg/tracking_systems/,Tracking systems?

"my mom has dementia - alzheimer's according to the neurologist.  she had lived with my father, until about a year before he passed away, and he needed to go to a skilled nursing facility.  since then, she's gradually gotten worse;  somewhere in 2020 about the time dad died, we realized she wasn't thinking straight, and have wanted to move her into a retirement community of some kind ever since.  but she was resistant, and wanted to live at home alone.  so we indulged her, until she started having a lot of trouble taking her medications and dealing with pretty much anything other than immediate daily living- no sort of hired help could do right for more than a few months- the yard guys always ran afoul of her, and so did housekeepers.    eventually she started complaining about being lonely and not having anything to do, as well as having increased issues with stuff because she couldn't maintain her medication schedule herself. so we talked her into moving into a retirement community where she can live, people will give her her meds on time, keep an eye on her, and generally remove all the hard-to-do stuff from her. she's been there since january.  most of the time she's ok and things are good- she's made friends, she does stuff, etc...  but every now and again, she goes on the warpath and decides that she doesn't like it there, wants to move back home, everyone's stealing from her, all her neighbors at home were so close and wonderful (she rarely saw them at all), and so on.    how do i talk to her when she's like this?  i know that i can't argue with her- it won't work, but she's dogged and determined, and i have a hard time changing the subject.  and of course, she doesn't remember any of the bad stuff at the old place, or good stuff at the new place.    so far, i just try to affirm her emotions, not argue with her as little as i can manage, and try to redirect her onto other subjects.  &amp;#x200b;any other advice/suggestions?"," hi, op! i know it must be hard for you to go through this. dementia is a horrible disease and unfortunately, there isn't really much you can do. does she get the proper support at her current retirement home? some [retirement communities]( offer memory care for those living with dementia. if her current home does not offer that program, i highly suggest you transfer her to a new one that has the right resources that she needs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u86xko/how_to_talk_to_mother_to_stay_in_retirement/,How to talk to mother to stay in retirement community?

"hi all,&amp;#x200b;my mom and i both live with my grandpa (her dad) to help take care of him and he's diagnosed with vascular dementia. essentially, he copies my mom's sleep routine during the week and it very obviously doesn't work for him. additionally, on days when my mom doesn't have to work, if he wasn't told beforehand and still gets up early, he is angry and will stay that way all day about the fact no one told him, frequently resulting in fighting. we try to tell him beforehand when we know she doesn't have work, but we can't always do that. the only reason my grandpa needs to get up during the week is for his pills, which he can get up for right before my mom leaves.my mom gets up around 4:45-5 am and showers around 5:30-6. my grandpa gets up around 4 am and goes into the bathroom before her. he also goes to bed around when she does at 9 pm. hypothetically 9pm-4am isn't the worst sleep, but when he does this he can't fall asleep, tosses and turns, and gets up to go to the bathroom frequently, so he isn't getting much sleep. he also refuses to nap, purposefully getting up to walk around, sit in uncomfortable chairs, or doing something to wake himself up. as the week goes on he gets more anxious, angry, and out of it from the lack of sleep. on the weekends though he'll go to bed around 10 pm, wake up around 6-7 am, only get up once for the bathroom, and nap frequently throughout the day. when my mom has breaks from work that's the same sleep schedule he does. so 9pm-4am is obviously not working for him and is causing problems.we've tried to tell him he doesn't need to get up with her, but he refuses to listen. he'll argue he isn't getting up with her and that's just when he gets up, that he needs to get up because he has things to do, or he'll just get angry and say that's how he's always slept, it's never been a problem before, and that he's fine on less sleep. the longer this is going on the more angry he gets if he isn't told about my mom staying home before the morning. even on days when we do tell him, sometimes he forgets and accuses us of not telling him and is angry. sometimes when he's upset about it he'll say things like ""oh so i could've slept in,"" which shows he doesn't like getting up this early. we have a few guesses as to why he gets up this early 1) he wants to use the bathroom before my mom is up so he doesn't worry about holding it or not being able to hold it, but if this was the problem than it wouldn't change on the weekend and he would still need to go to the bathroom, and he doesn't on the weekends/breaks 2) he's trying to have a schedule/routine for himself but he isn't like this with anything else and on the weekends/breaks this schedule doesn't happen 3) he thinks he needs to make sure my mom is up for work and it's his responsibility to do this.due to other sleeping problems he's currently taking 3 mg of melatonin, and it's helped the other issues but it hasn't helped this.is there something we could do to help this? has anyone else ever experienced this?"," i'm wondering if you could let his doctor know about this with emphasis on his lack of sleep. because he is already taking a sleep aid they may adjust it to help with this. my mom did a similar thing early in her dementia. i ended up giving her an herbal type sleep aid (midnight, got it at the grocery store) after discussing it with her doctor. early on i would ""go to bed early"" so she would go to sleep,i got a lot of reading done lol. she eventually got in  a sleep routine separate  from mine and as her dementia has grown she hasn't had to take it anymore. i encourage you to speak or send a letter/email to his doctor though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u6knby/grandpa_copying_sleep_schedule_that_leaves_him/,Grandpa Copying Sleep Schedule That Leaves Him Tired and Irritated
"i'm the main caretaker of my mom (my parents are separated) who i suspect has dementia but due to financial constraints, we haven't been able to get a diagnosis yet. i'm 19 years old and graduated high school last year. i deferred my admission to university so that i could help figure out what to do with my mom.i've experienced depression since i was 12 and have recently developed what i think is anxiety. this whole situation and all these responsibilities took a huge toll on my mental health. my mom has become slightly verbally abusive too. when i'm in a depressive episode, i think about just not existing anymore and i've started to self harm a few times. i know that this environment is very toxic to me and leaving would save my mentality. it sounds immature, but i want to be like my other friends who've started their college journeys and are learning and experiencing new things. i'm supposedly due to leave in september but i'm not sure if i'll make it there since it depends on a lot of different factors. my dad has agreed to take care of my mom if i have to leave, and we are currently working together to think of a good arrangement.every time i think of going to uni, i get excited to finally leave and meet people (i haven't met any friends face to face since the pandemic began in 2020) and just have a life for my own. but at the same time, my heart breaks when i think of leaving my mom. during one of our arguments, she got the impression that i didn't like her anymore and i was going to leave her right away which sent her into a big meltdown of crying and sobbing and screaming. that scene repeats in my head over and over whenever i think of leaving, and the guilt and frustration is eating me from inside.what should i do? any advice on coping? i don't even know what to tell her when i leave :(tl;dr being the main caretaker for my mom is killing my spirit and i need to leave to save myself, but thinking of leaving her breaks my heart", leave as soon as possible because you need to feel safe.  my daughter committed suicide last week and i recommend that you go to a doctor for help and a therapist as well.   suicide is never the answer.   we all feel sad at times but things will get better.  i am heartbroken and can't describe what i feel.  please don't hurt yourself and please call the suicidal hotline 800-273-8255 immediately.  it is so important to tell someone you love and try to be around people that love you.  do not be alone because that is exactly what happened with my daughter.    you can write to me and i will help you.   please don't do it.  pray a lot and god will help you.  you have all your life ahead of you and you can be happy.  do not put your family through this.   you are a good person and you need to be strong and get help.  i recommend for you to see a doctor and have them do blood work to ensure check your hormone levels or chemical imbalances that can easily be corrected.  you have to reach out immediately  because depression might get stronger with time.  you need to act now.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u6j0tv/leaving_home_while_mom_has_dementia_cw_suicidal/,leaving home while mom has dementia (cw// suicidal thoughts and self harm)

"my bride of 50 years has been having memory problems for a number of years. we started her on memantine (namenda) 7 or 8 years ago, and progression had been slow-ish until recently.  we were across the country visiting our son &amp; family for the holidays when she experienced an event of some sort that left her unusually confused, but absent any stroke signs.  she seemed to bounce back quite a bit in the next few days, and we were able to fly home.  however since then her dementia has accelerated and she began to become delusional at times.  we have consulted with a neurologist who seems to think she has cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which is consistent with a diagnosis her sister received at a similar age.  we got an initial prescription from her pcp for mirtazapine, an antidepressant.  when that failed to provide much help we started her on small doses of quetiapine, an antipsychotic.  this seems to help quite a bit, although there’s still a fair amount of “going home” talk.my guess is that she’s currently somewhere in the stage 5 or 6 area.  the neurologist recommended transition to a facility.  my sense (based on very little actual information) is that the professional class seems to favor early placement rather than later.the reality is that our only son and his family live across the country.  up until now we’ve been able to go visit them several times each year.  naturally they would like us to move near them.  one problem is that there is no way i could manage a move while continuing as full time caregiver.  but if the long term plan is to move, is it realistic to think i could place her in a facility here and then move her across the country in, say, a year?", my sister placed my mom in a facility in their town so that she and i could move mom's stuff out and sell the house with mom in a safe place with the stuff she was going to keep. it worked out for us this way.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u56ip3/changing_facilities/,Changing Facilities?

(that whole hindsight thing y'all, it's really a hard hitter with dementia decline, isn't it?) is this something any of y'all have seen? about a year ago, my mom started telling me that she was worried about my *stepdad*, that his mind was going, and she was scared for the future because of it. this was before i'd cued in that *she* was starting down the path at all, and it didn't really strike me as much to worry about, as my stepdad is 83 to my mom's 72, so it wasn't something that sounded all that left field to think that his memory might be going. but i wish now that i'd talked to my stepdad in some way about that; that was an early sign that her mind was slipping that i missed. the main reason i wish i'd said something to him then is for **him**. i've spent a lot of time with him in the last month now and he's as sharp as he ever was, save repeating himself a bit. (and to that: he's also handling a lot since my mom fell and has been in rehab that he's not used to handling, and i've been doing the same thing honestly just trying to keep everything straight in helping him - my husband has said ""yep, you told me that already"" at least a dozen times in the last week.)but he's still very sharp. he just hadn't realized what was happening with her; he was too close to it. one of the conversations i've had with him since her fall (that escalated everything) is how he actually thought he *had* been doing things wrong and he just thought he was doing dumb things that made her mad so when she would get super agitated with him he just felt bad. it broke me when he said that and he teared up trying to tell me that; for at least a year now he's been struggling thinking he was screwing things up, when really, it's been her. i feel so rotten than he's had to endure that - they've been together for almost 40 years and he loves her so much and to think that he'd been facing that alone and not knowing it wasn't his fault just hurts my soul.   i know there's not a lot of good wallowing in what i could have done or said, but that one's gonna stick with me i think. i guess i'm partially saying this as a ""here's something you might see"" sort of thing too. apologies if it's well known -- i'm learning a lot right now but i haven't mastered it all yet. thanks so much y'all for hearing me out, and for being here. this sub is partially responsible for my ability to hold my shit together right now; i thank all of you strangers for being kind folks silently all the time.", i am in ur walls,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u4fs5w/early_warning_sign_that_i_missed/,Early warning sign that I missed...

"my parents live on a large piece of land that slopes down. lots of vegetation. it gets slippery. dad enjoys moving rocks from one spot to another. he can do this for hours. it would probably be ok if the ground was flat. it would probably be ok if he was steady on his feet. but a month ago it looked like he wrestled with some thorny branches and the wounds on his legs got infected. i’m talking green puss infection surrounded by bright red skin. a visiting nurse was sent because we couldn’t get him to the doctor. he refused to get in the car. he also wouldn’t stay out of the back area of the house. there’s a gate halfway. my brother and i bought locks and chains. he was able to break the gate hinge  off the fence. we fixed it again made it more secure and hid anything that he could potentially use to break through.this morning he began a tirade directed towards my brother. then he grabbed my brother by the front of his shirt and began screaming in his face. he has threatened to slash the tires on the car. the other day i caught him just before he swung a metal pipe at the windshield of my rental car. he regularly tells me to go to hell. said he doesn’t have a daughter anymore, says i’m the devil.and here is the heartbreaking part…he has started to force himself on my mom. she even bought him his own bed and set it up in the main living room area. i know he has dementia but this is abuse. i don’t know what to do. i leave next week and the guilt of leaving is tearing me up. i’ve been here 3 weeks. he needs more care than what he’s getting. in february he fell 3 times in the span of a week. i can’t keep flying here - this is my 3rd trip in a year. just venting really.", seroquel stops this,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u3lyl4/dad_is_becoming_combative_and_abusive/,Dad is becoming combative and abusive
"looking to vent but also see if anyone has been in this situation. my dad (68) is adamant that he is healthy and doing just fine, but obviously that's not true. he is barely functioning from day to day and is just scraping by in life while living alone. i often hear all about how my siblings and i keep on visiting and abandoning him (not true, we live across the country but have local family members we rely on), people are always ""in and out"" of his house, and he has been talking about those who have passed like they are here. he thinks i live down the street, and has reverted to talking about ""his wife"" who he divorced over 20 years ago and previously hated. all this is to say that he is often confused, talking about things that never happened.dad is simply done with doctors. this was an attitude he had before we noticed the signs of dementia. i contacted his doctor a year ago to explain what we were seeing. he found out and thought i was incredibly out of line and lying. this was the nail in the coffin for him getting medical help. it is listed in his records that he does not want to pursue any help with his cognition (i have access to his account). the mri is showing large dead spots, including a big chunk of his cerebrum. he is suffering from vascular dementia, but smokes a pack a day, doesn't eat, and is no longer taking his meds. but he is fine and everything is good and he is just so busy all the time living his life! he doesn't want help, doesn't need it, and will get incredibly nasty if you overstep and make it impossible to help. we have been noticing a decline for almost 5 years.we are now at the point where it is completely unsafe for him to be driving and living alone. the other night he thought his phone was broken and went out looking for a pay phone, which he didn't find obviously. we're very lucky he ""found"" a convenience store he frequents, and the owner helped him contact us. he is going to start a fire with his cigarettes. he is unsteady on his feet and is falling; refuses to even entertain the idea of a cane. i have no idea if he is still on blood thinners, but he is still bleeding everywhere with the smallest cut. we are in a precarious situation where something is going to happen, and god forbid it affects anyone else. any ideas on how we can navigate this? if we send a caregiver over, he will turn them away. he will not sign any poa papers. he will not give up his license, and i'm not sure he would even respond to a notice to come in and get tested at the dmv. he will not move to an assisted home. he is answering his phone less and less. and if any of us kids take him in or move in, he will not listen to rules like ""you cannot chain smoke in the house"" because he believes he is justified to do what he wants, when he wants. he will not allow family members to check on him. couldn't even get him to go to the doctor with a trusted friend. many family members have talked to him nicely, i've cried to him, brothers have yelled at him. can't kill him with kindness, but also can't force him to do what's necessary.", maybe try calling the alz association. they're very kind and might offer more resources/ideas. or honestly just a genuine listening ear. because he's potentially a danger to himself/others they might lead you in the right direction,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u3l3tx/dad_resistant_to_any_help_and_in_denial/,Dad resistant to any help and in denial
"my 68yo dad was diagnosed with parkinson's disease around 8 years ago. he had to retire from his main job but i think he is still quite active. i live quite far away from him. he has issues with short-term memory and comprehending things. he lives alone but has a girlfriend who lives in a neighboring town. their relationship is awful and they seem to fight whenever they have contact. she's a pretty horrible person and i don't know why they have stayed ""together"". he has always been quite narcissistic and psychologically abusive to his girlfriend and also previously towards my mother (physically and psychologically). we have never had a close relationship and he was not really involved in my upbringing, except when i used to visit him as a child for school holidays.during the past couple of years he has been through some periods of really dementia-ish behavior but probably more delerium, like night-time anxiety and calling at crazy hours like after midnight, freaking out because he is having normal (?worsening) parkinson's symptoms. he hadn't been taking his melatonin and wasn't sleeping well. that seems to have settled down. he frequently fails to take his parkinson's medications on-time. it's probably partly forgetfulness and partly denial / not thinking he needs to. he will often wait until his symptoms get bad which is then too late. he says he sees a different doctor each time he visits the medical practice but i still think he would have been advised about the importance of taking the meds regularly and on time regardless of current symptom severity. he has dyskinesia now (involuntary movements). he won't allow anyone to accompany him to the doctor.he has generally refused home help even though he does not cook - his kitchen doesn't even have an oven and his girlfriend says he won't even microwave himself something. he just eats out for every meal, basically, or goes to his girlfriend's house. he does not use the pill boxes we bought for him to carry his meds so that he has some pills handy in all the places he goes such as the car, his home, his girlfriend's home, and previously his work briefcase. back in around 2018 i had to write to his doctor about his driving as people from his church noticed him driving home late at night, weaving all over the road ""as if he was drunk"". he passed his driving test anyway. for years his teeth have looked terrible and he clearly wasn't brushing. when i visited him i saw a very old, mangled-looking toothbrush in the bathroom when i had recently ordered groceries for him which included a new toothbrush. when i asked him where it was he said he had already used it up and thrown it away (clearly not true as the one he had there looked ancient). years ago i ordered him some assistive aids for parkinson's such as buttoning loops/hooks to help with doing up buttons, key and tap turners, a liftware spoon which compensates for tremor movements, etc. he has stashed all these things under the bed and they have never been opened.my sibling and i have really tried to help in many ways over the years, like trying to help him fix issues with his home that for some reason he hasn't been able to organise himself, and arrange an assessment for in-home services but it didn't really go well and his doctors don't seem interested in assessing his cognitive function. if you call or write to them they regard you as a controlling family member and nobody has any power to make him get assessed, so nothing happens. everyone gives lip service to ""early diagnosis"" being important but nobody ever actually seems to want to assess for or diagnose it. i have also found this in my work life (i work in health). we have kind of given up. when we have tried to make suggestions and help him in the past he's become combative and mean and we have never really had a close relationship anyway. i feel a bit guilty for not picking up every time he calls but i cannot for my own sanity. he has been calling me quite often, not every night but sometimes consecutive nights in a row depending on what's going on at the time. for the past year-and-a-half, i would guess that his calls to me are averaging once every 2 days but he will often call me multiple times in one day. i have a child to look after and i don't like talking to him. he always expects me to stroke his ego and repeats the same things, wants to talk about his time in the army and asks me about my life which i don't really want to share because he then blabs things to my other abusive family members. in the past we have never really had frequent phone calls and it just feels inappropriate and weird now. it's just awkward and unpleasant for me and a chore, and he will go on and on and not understand that my child needs me. talking to him is draining and he still treats me like i am a child (i'm 38). he always wants to bitch about other family members, evaluate everyone's life-choices and talk about himself. i still feel like i have to do what he wants because of how authoritarian he was when i was a kid (and still is). i understand that in his situation he's isolated and trying to hold on to his dignity ad self-respect and wants to feel heard and relevant like his opinions matter, and i do do that for him sometimes. often he will call under the pretense of ""seeing how i am going"" and put on this excessive fake concern about me when he has never really asked or cared in the past because he has had better things to do and i find it really uncomfortable.i don't really know what i want with this post, maybe just support? i just needed to vent about how frustrating the situation is and how sometimes you can't really do anything. he has lots of acquaintances, goes to church, has always been very extroverted, even forcefully so with people. he kind of pressures people to be his friend and talk to him. he is a skilled manipulator and good at appearing to be a ""great guy"" who everyone likes but deep-down he is very self-centred and does not feel remorse when he is abusive towards others. he will never apologise for his actions and is now more prone to emotional outbursts if you try to hold him accountable for things he says or does.just wondering if anyone else has a similar situation and anything that's been helpful? basically i understand he's lost many outlets including his work and a significant amount of function (eg., he doesn't drive much now), and expects me to fill in the blanks for him. he is involved with the local returned serviceman's club and has reconnected with his old army mates. i think that at times he just gets ""the fear"" and wants/needs to be talked down, but i can't do that for him every time he wants it. it does seem like a bit of a transition into him being more childlike."," is your dad taking a dopamine agonist? mirapex, requip, or neupro patch?  a lot of what you said sounds like side effects of these parkinson's

"my mom (67) has been showing signs of dementia for the past 5 years and ever since her mom died july 2021 the deterioration has been rapid. i don't feel like i can take care of her. for my mental health i am planning on moving out sometime with all the right measures in place so she is safe but boy do i feel like a shitty daughter. she's been in denial of these issues for the entirety of showing symptoms and has never been checked out properly. before the dementia she was also extremely emotionally abusive and neglectful (narcissist). i lose my cool so easily over small things because it all just feels so unfair. why should i now have to fill in this caregiver role when she was never a caregiver to me as a young child? why is it that i say something she doesn't like i start receiving endless hurtful ultimatums, name calling, etc. i could go on of course but there really isn't any point. on top of that i'm not working so i don't feel like i have much going for me, fear resenting her for having to take a large pause on my life, and face her deteriorated decision making skills, long-term &amp; short-term memory, inability to do simple tasks, etc. it's all just so fucking sad. i love her and hate to see her like this. she can't help it and i know it's only going to get worse. i know that this will be the hardest thing i have to face and it's also hard not knowing anyone my age who has gone through something similar. i feel so envious of my peers lives. i wish i could just focus on myself and not worry so much or have so much responsibility. the day to day interactions with her are the hardest. my patience has run so so thin and i snap so much and she doesn't deserve that! none of this is fair for anyone, and i am so tired. grieving sucks and i wonder if it will get any easier."," hey, 22 yr old here with 64 yr old dad with mid stage dementia. me and my mom care for him but he's definitely a handful at times, i completely understand what you're going through. it's definitely tough, wish i could say it gets better but you're definitely not alone in this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u3c8qw/anyone_else_in_their_youngmid_20s_as_a_caregiver/,Anyone else in their young-mid 20's as a caregiver for their parent?

"i'm not even sure how to ask about this. short-ish version:i want to know if it's ok to have my mom over to *her own house* for holidays. my only experience with this sort of thing is with my spouse's family situation. with their family, they do not let the grandma go to her old house any more. she gets upset and doesn't want to leave. i was told by my wife not to bring my mom back to her old home, as it would cause trouble or upset her like how her grandma got upset. both my wife's grandma and my mom have to go back to their nursing homes each day, so they can't stay at their old homes. they both have alzheimer's, but it hasn't progressed so far for them not to remember their old houses. long version: my mother is in skilled nursing / memory care. i sometimes take her out to places for lunch, ice cream, or go shopping. i have to make sure to get her back to the nursing home every time, because it's important for her to always take her scheduled medicine (and have nurses available around the clock). she still owns her house, and i've been taking care of it for years.since she hasn't been there in a long time, most of her possessions are gone, things have been fixed up, some rooms have been repainted, there are new appliances, and the yard looks different. i basically tried fixing it up, just in case we had to sell it to pay for my mom's care. well, medicaid took care of things, and they said that we can keep the house. so then we had this nice house, all fixed up. we have been wanting to do more things there. we did halloween there, and we want to do easter over there. my wife and i have been looking into selling our house for a while (since before my mom went into memory care), so it actually works out well for us to stay at my mom's house. i talked to my mom about this already,and she thought it would be a good idea for me to stay there to make sure it was taken care of. i was thinking about getting my mom for easter and having her join us, but i don't know if that is a good idea. i don't want to make her upset. i would also feel real guilty about doing stuff with family but not have my mom there at her own house. but i'm afraid that she might see her old house and not want to leave. or maybe she will see her old house, realize how much of it has changed and get really upset. it's also possible that she won't remember the house at all. has anyone else been in a situation like this?"," if you host a gathering, at her house, i suggest you not invite her. make alternate plans, e.g., going out the night before to a restaurant or your home.my experience is my own. we had our grandfather in a nursing home, but kept his rental apartment, the controlled rent was cheaper than a storage locker. he was in his 90s, but my mom was reluctant to liquidate his belongings for some reason. likely out of respect for grandpa.we kept the unit basically the same, with some well needed cleaning. over the 20+ years he lived there with his deceased wife, the apartment was adapted to accommodate a wheel chair, with grab bars, ramp, etc.. however, when grandpa came to visit he was distraught it wasn’t as he remembered it. who knows what period in his long-term memory he was referencing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u3aiaa/is_it_ok_to_visit_her_old_house/,Is it OK to visit her old house?

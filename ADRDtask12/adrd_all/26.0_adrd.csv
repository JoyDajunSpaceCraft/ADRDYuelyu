"greetings,&amp;#x200b;my grandma who has been showing symptoms for the past 10 years or so (getting progressively worse) always feels the need to apologize for her actions/rambling/symptoms/forgetfulness.&amp;#x200b;it really breaks my heart, because i always let her know it doesn't bother me and i always try to brighten her mood by making some jokes about it (i've always had a joking relationship with her).&amp;#x200b;i'm kind of at a loss, because she has always been the type of person who is apologetic and feels like she is always a burden, even before her symptoms. i've never really had experience being around a family member with alzheimer's, outside of my great grandmother (her mother), albeit i was never really around for it.&amp;#x200b;i feel helpless, and i just want to communicate that her symptoms don't bother or annoy me. she's always been a sweet and caring person and i hate to see her have to apologize for something she has no control over.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;regards,&amp;#x200b;a grandma's boy", redirection. anything positive you can share about your life? a new baby? a wedding you attended? pictures and stories about little kids or pets. even a funny or cute youtube video of animals. my dad had alzheimer's. we kept him at home for about 10 years before it got to be too much. the nursing home he was in during the final few months allowed me to bring our dogs in to come visit. walking onto the dementia ward with a dog or child was always like being on parade. i had to stop and talk to every single person i encountered before finding my dad and some of them would hover around our visit once i did. i know the personal annecdote might seem irrelevant to some. but i guess the point was that sometimes the thing that makes people most happy or reduces anxiety is having something other than themselves to focus on. also if she's still at home i agree with u/tre-x about jobs you can thank her for and that will keep her busy especially if she's a wanderer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ejgx8t/what_to_tell_grandmother_who_is_apologetic_for/,What to tell grandmother who is apologetic for her illness

"hi everyone. we lost my grandma to alzheimer’s last december and now my grandpa is progressing into mid/late stage alzheimer’s as well. he is extremely bored all the time and i want to find things for him to do. right now he pretty much just watches tv. the problem is we have gotten him word searches (his favorite pre-alz), easy puzzles, simple games, etc but he refuses to use them. he is very stubborn and still lucid a lot of the time, so things that are too “childish” like busy boxes offend him. he is also still struggling a lot with not being able to drive. i feel helpless because every time we talk he brings up the fact that he is so bored and can’t do anything. does anyone have any ideas how i can help? i live on the other side of the country so just visiting more isn’t currently an option.

"our specific details are below, but tl,dr: i would love to hear from others about ways that you’ve gotten your stubborn loved ones to accept in-home &amp; companion care services. what worked well? what totally failed? what recommendations do you have for getting them to accept the new normal?our mom is entering middle stage alzheimers. she’s still highly mobile and that’s our biggest concern. she has gotten lost on walks, lost her keys on walks, got in a car with strangers that stopped (and asked her to buy them groceries…), and neighbors told us they witnessed her nearly cause an accident jay-walking across the busy road a block from her house. my brother lives nearby, but they have three young kids, his wife is in school, and he’s got a demanding job – they help out as much as they can, but coming by daily to go on long walks simply isn’t an option.we want to get her companion care to accompany her on walks and errands. as rapidly as we can, we want to also add homemaker care: she needs help/supervision in the kitchen, her never-stellar housekeeping skills are vastly diminished, and she’s quit doing laundry because she doesn’t want to waste water. i suspect she’ll be needing personal care within a year or so – she’s showing signs that incontinence is approaching. it is important to get her acclimated as quickly as possible.she has so far been very resistant to outside help. for example, she lost her license a year ago &amp; we arranged for a family friend that she’s known for 20yrs, who works as a lyft driver to be her on-call ride. she only uses him for one ride a week and the rest of the time she expects someone to offer to pick her up, she’ll sometimes ask for a ride, or she just won’t go. she rejects any assistance that feels “outside” of family or church – the church folks really only give her rides to church activities.we have so far erred on the side of trying to respect her desire for independence even though that’s resulted in a lot of wasted time and money on services she’s rejected. but we are past the point where she’s able to make good decisions for herself, so this one isn’t optional. we anticipate she’ll resist this too &amp; we’re trying to think of ways to help her accept that this is the new normal without resorting to command and control tactics. suggestions on how to play it?", we also erred and waited too long to move stubborn mom to an alf.  she had much the same reaction you describe.  eventually my sister and i picked a place and started bringing her for lunch and pointing out the benefits which were huge.  she finally agreed to try it.   we did all the packing (do not ever try to let alz patient help) and only took what would fit easily.  but we kept everything else and brought it if she kept asking for it.  part of the downsizing is if they can’t see it they forget about it... very obvious when we packed up her old apartment.  she did try to back out on day 1 and we told her she needed to give it a month.  then we said let’s wait till spring...then just change the subject.  alz is a horrible insidious disease that robs us of our loved ones. they are not the same as they were and it is hard to separate.  and they are not children - i always resisted that description.   i have an uncle with a major brain injury from a mv accident 35 years ago - that is what it is.  when my mom asked to go home or said she was unhappy or when she lashed out at us we recognized it was because her brain was dying.   “fuck alzheimer’s” became our go to phrase.   good luck and god bless!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ehffgd/how_do_we_introduce_inhome_care/,How do we introduce in-home care?

"my mother is 70 and has recently been forgetting things (recent memories mainly) for the mast year and a half and it’s getting worse. here’s a little bit of context :-she has diabetes type 2 (since she was 50-55yo), that is treated with metformin. her diabetes acts up sometimes but it never got too bad. although recently (last month) she had to start taking metformin in the evening too. -she had half of her thyroid removed 10 or 15 years ago. she’s been taking levothyroxine since then. it’s quite stable now even though she had some troubles with the new formula for a while. she still has mild hypothyroidism sometimes but never anything serious.-she had breast cancer in 2012 but it has been successfully removed with surgery. she then had to go through radiotherapy and take meds (don’t know what) for 5 years. -she’s also treated for osteoporosis with prolia every 6 months and vitamin d. **-she’s been having bad insomnia for a year and a half now. memory loss and anxiety started at the same time.** she will basically sleep quite late, around midnight and she’ll wake up between 2 and 4 am. she then usually manages to sleep some more between 7 and 10am. so yeah, she now forget a lot of things. mainly content of conversations that happened recently. any new information is quite hard to remember. or at least the details of that information, for example she’ll remember that my sister who lives far is coming for the holidays but she’ll forget when exactly and will ask over and over again. she also find things confusing. things that she would understand before, like some settings on the tv etc. it generally takes way more time to explain things and we actually have to explain things over and over again. the weirdest thing happened recently. she’s muslim and prays 5 times a day. she always has and she’s always used the same calendar to know at what time she has to pray as there are no muezzins where we live. she’s never had any problem with that but recently after coming back from a trip to visit her family in algeria (where there are muezzins and where she didn’t have to use a calendar), she started doubting the calendar. she now thinks it’s inaccurate and she’s really anxious about it. she asked me and my sister to check several times that it was ok and prayed accordingly. she then asked almost everyone around her who told her the same thing. and last week she asked me and my sisters again but she still doubts for some reason and feel bad about it. or yesterday she said that « from now on until march the days will keep getting shorter ». i had to explain several times that the winter solstice was december 21 and that it was the opposite until june 21. she knows that she’s forgetting more and more things. she notices all those changes and is frustrated and when i ask her for example why she feels that way about the calendar she’ll tell me something she always says now : « i don’t know, i don’t feel right, there’s something wrong with me ». she of course told all this to her doctors but so far she’s got no answers at all and is still waiting for an appointment with a specialist. my question is : could it be something else than dementia/alzheimers? could it be the lack of sleep?could it be just a symptom of her other conditions or a side effect of her medicines? (sorry if it’s not clear/concise. it’s super stressful...)"," one thing that is super important to check for in elderly people, particularly those with alz, is uti.  these can seriously affect memory as well as other serious health issues and can happen very fast. travel and interruption to her normal routine might also affect her behavior if it is alz, as well as sleep. i imagine this is what her doctor will tell you. have you asked her what her concern about the calendar is? is there something plaguing her about it? maybe it would help to talk it over or if you could identify some key phrases to remind her that it’s okay based on what she says is bothering her about it. good luck to you guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ege7bw/could_it_be_something_else_than_early_signs_of/,Could it be something else than early signs of Alzheimer’s?

"my grandma has been dealing with alzheimer's disease for about 5 years. for the last year shes been in stage 5, she still had full sphincter control, she knew when to go to the toilet. but two nights ago she woke up wet.  i'm assuming she's stage 6 now she's pretty far down , she's completely dependent on my grandfather. they're both 79 and i can see how it's consuming him.  she still eats and talks a lot , but lately  none of it makes any sort of sense. i'm afraid of having to put her in a place to help my grandfather take a break for once , because she'll feel abandoned  and will probably be angry at my grandfather"," at 79, i suspect he doesn't have the physical strength to lift her and do diaper changes, especially if she's uncooperative. and what we found with my mother was that once she was at the point where she needed adult diapers, she was in denial about needing them and noncompliant, or if i demanded she wear them (like before i allowed her in my car), she was confused about how to put the on, putting them over her underwear, for example. that was the point where she needed assisted living - and to be honest we waited a little too long to force that issue due to distance and legalities of forcing her to move against her will. but the some of the tipping points regarding toilet issues are when cleaning and compliance becomes enough of a hassle that your grandma ends up staying in wet pants or bedding or not showering after wetting herself because your 79 year old grandpa can't lift her, can't get up at 3am to get her into the shower, launder the bedding, etc. it's just easier for them both to sleep in urine soaked sheets and mattresses and hide it from the rest of the family. and the furniture or floors end up with urine or feces soaked into them for hours/days or longer for the same reason. it becomes a health issue and a risk for infections, and of course is unsanitary for him as well. the family dynamics played into this all too for us. my mother viewed herself as the matriarch even as she was unable to handle her own most basic hygiene tasks. so she wouldn't take orders from the rest of us. i got lots of angry reminders that i am her daughter, i need to learn my place, blah blah blah, as i was insisting she had to shower after shitting her pants. :)the assisted living place mercifully took that part of the equation out of our relationship. the aides there are saints. if my mom has to shower, or change clothes, they have that argument with her. and now my visits aren't focused on battles, we just visit. you might think about a cover story for her eventual move, if you are worried about her being angry. is there a reason she could be moving there ""temporarily"" for some sort of ""physical therapy rehab"" without telling her it's permanent? or some other reason like she could be going there now while your grandfather stays behind to ""get their house ready to sell and once it sells then he'll be moving in with her""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/eg9u2l/when_do_you_think_is_definitely_time_to_put_an/,When do you think is definitely time to put an Alzheimer patient in a residence ?

""you all are crazy, there is nothing wrong""anyway. i am not sure if it's so necessary to get a diagnosis but i worry because she is with dad all the time.", both my parents were diagnosed last year. they both deny and refuse to accept the is a problem. we had to 'take dad's car to the garage to be fixed'. was the only way to get the car keys from him as he wasn't far off being a danger to drive. he occasionally mentions the car we say it's being fixed. sadly you can't make them understand they are ill. you need to get support from the doctors and dementia team as they are used to dealing with the denial and have ways of getting things done with upsetting the patient. you also have to be firm at times if they keep up with dangerous actions wandering etc and find a way to divert attention etc. get as much official support from the dementia teams. having both my parents with it is a nightmare as you are dealing with two different needs but they think they are capable and well. the top priority is to keep them safe.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/eeh02j/how_to_get_a_diagnosis_when_they_are_dead_set/,How to get a diagnosis when they are dead set that nothing is wrong.
"she had alzheimer’s for the past 5ish years and the decline has been fast and heartbreaking to watch. she lost so much weight. there was a time where she would scream in agony all day. she couldn’t do anything for herself and towards the end she even forgot how to eat, drink water, walk.even though it has been five years, it feels like it all happened so fast. i remember one day she was telling my dad how she had been driving her car and somehow ended up in the middle of nowhere. and at the time, no one thought anything of it really. but after that, things subtly and gradually got worse. she would forget how to use a tv remote, forget where things were. and eventually she got diagnosed and i still didn’t really take it seriously. all old people forget stuff. but it just got worse and worse. she started to forget who my grandad was and would be aggressive towards him, she started having seizures...it’s like my grandma was 3 different people. there’s the grandma i grew up with who was an intelligent, streetwise, quick witted lady who was the centre of our family, the glue that held us all together. then there is her as the alzheimer’s was in the early stage, the goofy, adorable, silly grandma who always thought our front step was a huge drop when it was actually tiny and giggled at silly nursery rhymes. then there was her at the late stage, an unrecognisable shell. she spent the last year of her life sat in a chair, a far off glassy look in her eye, being completely reliant on other people. i had started university by then and so i wasn’t around much. but if i’m being honest, i didn’t visit her enough. my grandad and my aunt and my cousins all had a role in taking care of her and when i was there, i felt like a spare part, useless. i was only close to my grandma, i wasn’t close to any of them and i’m a quiet person by nature, so i wouldn’t ever really have much to say. when i was there i felt so out of place...it’s so odd to feel that way when surrounded by family. as if the situation wasn’t depressing enough. not to mention it simply caused me so much pain to watch her suffer the way she did, to see her dignity taken away as people helped her use the bathroom, to see her slipping away. sometimes she would sit and just sob in agony. and that broke me completely. i think i mourned her death long before it happened. she’d been gone a long time, her physical body just had to catch up. i’m angry that this disease exists and there are so many scumbags who will continue to roam the earth in perfect health while my beautiful grandma won’t. i am trying to hold onto the precious memories i have with her before this disease got her. i never want to forget the songs she would sing to me, the sound of her laugh, the way she would always tell me my eyes are bigger than my belly when i couldn’t finish my dinner, her beautiful smile, the way she smelt when she would hug me, the way she could fix anything, the stories she told me, the way she would always say “goodnight, god bless and remember those three little words: i love you” as she tucked me into bed. no one will ever be able to fathom how much i loved her and how much i still do. i would give anything to hug my grandma one last time. i hope that one day i will get to do just that. goodnight god bless grandma, remember those three little words: i love you.", my sweet brother passed away tonight. he was 76.we had an awful time dealing with how alzheimer’s affected him the past four months. i’m so happy he’s at peace now. i pray no other families have to deal with combative loved ones. there’s no magic answer to dealing with that aspect of the disease. he would never have hurt anyone in his right mind. pray for a cure.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ee6wfh/my_grandma_just_passed_away/,my grandma just passed away

"hi all,i want to preface by saying i realize there is a faq and that a lot of the problems i might depict in this post are common, but i want to tell a little of my family's story in hopes to get feedback and connect with anyone who has dealt with a similar situation.my father developed dementia and later alzheimers about 5 years ago after i took him to the hospital to be detoxed from alcohol. his alcoholism had gotten so out of hand it was my last resort to try and save him. this unfortunately set off a chain of events that lead to his dementia and alzheimers. he was about 64 years old when this happened and recently retired (forced to due to the alcoholism). my mother is 11 years his junior and is his primary care taker. i live a few hours away, my only other sibling is my brother who lives in the same city as them with his wife and children. my mother has alcoholic tendencies as well and uses it as a crutch to de stress, along with smoking cigarettes. she has anxiety and depression, and sees a therapist (irregularly) to try and alleviate. she takes an anti depressant and i believe that is all. i am extremely concerned about my mothers well being. she is under a great amount of stress dealing with my father, who is fairly far along in his alzheimers progression. we are surprised when he forms a complete sentence or thought, wears diapers that he uses, and my mother helps him bathe. unfortunately, he stays at home alone for the 5 hours in the morning / afternoon that my mother is at work. he is able to feed himself with whats in the kitchen and watches tv/naps while she is away. she has a camera installed on her phone that she uses to watch him while shes at work because its difficult getting him to answer the phone.as you all are aware, in care home or elderly care homes are all very expensive. we are not wealthy, but firmly lower middle class. i don't make a lot of money, my brother and his wife make decent money but have a child and one on the way. they live near by and help when needed but we are all a bit at a loss of what to do and how to help my mom. she is so stressed out constantly, understandbly so since she has to work part time and take care of my father when shes home, rarely getting time for herself. at the moment, we don't really have the funds to put my father in a care facility or anything like that. we may be able to afford it by some way of a small inheritance me and my brother will receive from my father's mother who recently passed, though i fear it is not quite enough to sustain him for the long term there.essentially, my mother is forced to watch my father deteriorate slowly as she sacrifices her life and happiness for him. i have guilt about living far away from them but i had been living in the same city as them for several years and felt stuck and depressed. i moved away for myself and to start my own life (i am 28), as i feel my father and mother wouldn't have wanted me to sacrifice my life to take care of them, though i do second guess this decision all the time and wish i could do more for them. me and my family have reached a plateau the past couple of years where my mother takes care of him, but i feel she is close to a breaking point mentally. she is so anxious, stressed, depressed, talks about how she is lonely, isolated, wants to date, etc. she is committed to caring for my father however and is steadfast in that. she gets frustrated and isn't perfect but she believes it is her duty to help him.partly i just wanted to tell our story, but i also would accept any advice in way of programs or financial aid or anything that could help me and our family out. my father gets worse everyday, it would break my heart to put him somewhere but i do feel sometimes that it would help my mom immensely to be relieved from that duty and stress. thank you for reading, and god speed to anybody out there dealing with this condition. it is the darkest part of my life, has changed who i am as a person, and in some ways helps me appreciate life for what it is - a temporary experience. love and peace to you all."," did you dad ever serve in the military during wartime?  if so, there's veterans' assistance for in-house care or assisted living.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ed1tl1/fathers_alzheimers_weighing_down_on_my_mother_and/,Father's Alzheimers weighing down on my mother and family

"5 years ago my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia, and roughly 2 years ago, alzheimer's was tacked on. it's been quite the journey to get to where we are now with her. there's been multiple home moves, many doctors/specialists appointments, and a lot of family meetings with my mum and her siblings. my mum is currently off work, and has spent the most time making sure my grandma is well taken care of. none of her 3 siblings make the effort as, and i quote, ""what do you want me to do about it?? i have my own life to think about"" my mum goes multiple times a week with my grandpa, and knows how to effectively redirect my grandma when she's on a ""thr nurses are hitting me/my husband's sleeping with other women/he's beating me too"" line of thought. these nurses are an absolute god send, and my grandpa has never laid a hand on her, nor would he ever. they don't even live together, as my grandma is in a wonderful ltc facility and grandpa is on the wait list to get in the same place. anyways, my issue is this.. my aunts and uncles all want to take my grandma out of the home for a big family get together (where grandma will recognize maybe 4 people) and i believe this to be a horrid idea. not only because of how big (and confusing) our family is, but how badly she will lose her marbles when they have to take her back in. she has fought nurses screaming ""help me [my mum]!!""when my mum has taken my grandpa to see her, and they were leaving to bring grandpa home. my grandma thought she was going with them, and it was heartbreaking just to hear about. i think it's selfish of my aunt, and detrimental to my grandma's mental health to bring her out for a few hours. i have made it known how i feel, and that i won't be a part of it. my mum is disappointed that i won't be coming, but i have nothing nice to say to a lot of my extended family, and i refuse to watch my aunt try to guilt my mum into bringing my grandma back (which my mum has already said no to. but who respects no, right?) am i the bad guy for refusing to go, and making it known that i think they're selfish ? i'm sorry this is long and all jumbled up, i'm overwhelmed and don't have anyone to talk to about any of this."," definitely ask. i know when my mom's memory care housing holds holiday parties for families and friends, my mom flips out. she finds the noise of more than a few people to be alarming. i've sat with her through far too many anxiety attacks to do that to her anymore. our new plan is to whisk her away to a smaller gathering outside of the memory care building where she knows the handful that are there and isn't subjected to all that noise. she will fight us going back in, but the staff are great about coming out and helping us if we need it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ecul6c/am_i_the_bad_guy_for_my_decisionthinking/,[deleted by user]

"in reading these threads, i always wonder about the timeline of events leading up to a person’s diagnosis. for instance, my mother’s journey would look like this:2014: father gets leukemia, mom has trouble visiting him in the city. later, my nephew is born and she seems somewhat apathetic. he’s born in the city as well, and she gets lost trying to visit. we chalk it up to her being a nervous driver. she is 64. 2015: gets lost going to mcdonalds in the dark... a drive she’s made dozens of times before in an area she’s lived in for 30 years. we chalk it up to cataracts, which she has removed later in early 2016.2016: my aunt is placed in assisted living with advanced alzheimer’s in august. i knew she wasn’t quite right, but i had no clue it had gotten so bad because mom had never indicated as much. driving back from the hospital alone, mom ends up on the wrong side of the road and enters an army base. she’s pulled over by a half dozen cops. at this point i’m in denial, but i urge her to get a mental health exam. she gets a referral from the doctor, but between my aunt and life, nothing ever comes of it.2017: mom continues to slip. she’s still independent but she no longer understands how to gas up a car, she refuses to cook, and she’s been escorted home several times in the dark from church. i tell her she can’t go out at night anymore. in october, she can’t remember when her next drs appointment is, so instead of calling, she drives there and ends up lost. the dr drops her off, leaving me to find her car, which she can’t remember where she left.2018: i start receiving late notices in the beginning of the year. she’s writing the checks but the written amounts don’t match the numerical amounts. when leaving to go to target she’s gone for hours at a time. target is 2 minutes away. when questioned about why she’s been gone so long, she gets defensive. i have a panic attack every time she leaves. i ask her to let me know where she’s going but she rarely does. i force her to go to the drs for another referral, where the dr clearly states that she has dementia. i’m stunned that he didn’t think it was important to tell her family that. in april we have our first neurologist appointment. in june, she’s officially diagnosed with alzheimer’s at the age of 67. in july, my brother and i make the decision that it’s no longer safe for her to drive. in late august, she gets angry with me for not sharing a personal pizza with her. this aggression happens a couple times a month. in december, my aunt passes at 73. mom won’t let me help her pick out an outfit; she decides on the same black jeans she always wears and a sweatshirt. from this point on, her aggression and paranoia have a marked increase. in january 2019, her sense of taste change, and she starts throwing out food i make her unless it’s sweet or bland. over the next several months, her behavior worsens, including tantrums and physical aggression. her hygiene begins to suffer, and she aggressively cuts her own hair, leaving both sides patchy but the top long. she refuses to let me take her to get a cut. in may, my brother and i place her in an assisted living community. she still speaks poorly of me, despite not having seen me since june. she turned 69 in december.that’s about it for me. what does your timeline look like?", my mom went pretty quick.. there were some odd things in 2013-2014and she couldn’t find a job for a few years before this.  she had applied for ss and i helped her move to subsidized apartment in 2012. she had trouble holding a job for several years we realized much later that may have been related. she was also a heavy smoker and huge carb addict.  rail thin always but ate sweets like crazy.  2016- she was ill with pneumonia in may and unable to care for herself - ended up in hospital for a week.  she got lost every time she tried to come to my house which was odd as she had at one time been a realtor and very comfortable driving anywhere. then july 2016 she fell and broke wrist at our sons graduation party trying to climb a rock retaining wall.  she didn’t understand this was a poor decision on her part to follow the grandkids.  she also tells doctor she’s never had any other broken bones (not true).  she is finally dx with mci in september 2016. tried cognitive and speech therapy but she won’t do it - calls it stupid. 2017. my sister or i began providing meals she could microwave.  she didn’t stop at a stop sign a block from her apartment and caused another elderly driver to swerve and roll over to avoid t-boning her.  we reluctantly fixed the car but a week later she said it stopped working.  the oil pan was torn off the bottom but she insisted she didn’t hit anything.  we told her it was totaled and she couldn’t afford a new car...az meds caused hallucinations but telling her she has alz and copd is heartbreaking - every time we have to tell her.  late 2017 she developed shingles on her face and we realize she couldn’t manage meds on her own.  all this time she is not ack any problems and getting angrier with me and siblings.  she insists she is smoking only 4 cigarettes a day but is gong thru more than a pack a day.  apartment warns her again that smoking is not allowed. 2018 - she was always an avid reader and shingled resulted in eye doc visit and dx cataracts.  after discussion with primary doc we schedule surgery.  first surgery she is a mess after and says the doc was mean and hurt her on purpose. a month later 2nd surgery is better but she is childlike - sitting in waiting room that morning with her winter coat on backwards and hood over her face because we wouldn’t let her smoke cigarettes since the night before.     it is clear she needs more help so we apply for ma and find assisted living.  she refuses.  we finally just tell her it’s temporary.. then that she was kicked out of her old apartment for the smoking.   she moved in assisted living november 26 2018. she was too far gone with alz to get to know anyone there though staff said she was pleasant when i wasn’t around.  she was always angry at me for putting her there.  it wasn’t until this time that my brothers acknowledged she was getting bad.  she wanted to go with us always but as soon as we took her anywhere she wanted to go home.  september 2019 - the doctors and staff said she needed memory care soon but our dad (her ex) died suddenly of a heart condition and we put it off.  she became ill overnight the day before thanksgiving and we took her to emergency department.  she couldn’t articulate what hurt but reacted to stomach probe.  mri revealed acute appendicitis.  my sister and i talked to doc about her alz and copd & asked that we try to treat with antibiotics as there was no way surgery would be understandable for her and the copd made it dangerous too.  she seemed to bounce back after two days but my sister or i had to be there 24-7 as mom didn’t know where she was or why and just kept asking to go  home.   we scheduled surgery for saturday morning but friday evening her heart went haywire and eventually we moved her to hospice after learning the appendix had also burst.  surgery would result in stomach and anal tubes -

"my fil put my mil in memory care last week. since then, he has been sending messages in a group text with his sons and their wives detailing what she is going through during her adjustment. things like... she's refusing to change her underwear and it took 5 caregivers to do it because she was fighting it. now, i do understand that this is an immeasurably painful experience for him. but it is for my husband too, and getting these intimate and really upsetting messages is completely wrecking him. my fil sends these messages all day, throughout the day, and i don't feel like it's healthy. it's like he doesn't acknowledge that this is traumatic for his sons, too.am i being too high maintenance here? is it wrong for me to think that sharing this information this way isn't doing anyone any good, and should be communicated a about in a healthier way? or am i pushing him away because it makes us uncomfortable? has anyone experienced this? i don't want my fil to be alone in this, i just don't know what to do.", can your husband mute the alerts on the group text so he can check it only when he's mentally prepared to read them (maybe once per day)? that might help enough to keep it feeling manageable while still allowing fil the outlet during this tough adjustment period.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ebyvwu/fil_sending_upsetting_updates_need_guidance/,"FIL sending upsetting updates, need guidance"
"so, my grandmother is possibly showing signs of alzheimers/dementia.  for quite a while, probably a year at least, she has made small comments about people doing things around her home.about 6 months ago, she got into an argument with my mother, saying that people were coming and going from her home, and said that my stepdad was doing weird things in her home and that she didn't want him there any more (he is never there and is not doing any of the things she is saying).  about a month ago, that happened again, where she was gone for awhile and when my mom brought her home, she thought someone had been there.my mother has told me about this things, but i had never seen it firsthand.  last week, grandma had a surgery, so yesterday i stayed with her for the day.  everything was fine all day, she seemed to be herself.  at some point in the evening, all of the sudden she was at her front door, then basically running from window to window looking outside.  when she finally sat back down, she got upset and told me that her outside light had blinked and everyone thinks she's crazy, but she's not crazy, and someone is messing with her electrical systems and she doesn't know who it is but is she could catch them she'd kill them.  earlier in the day, she had been telling me how mush she loves her house and will never move.long story short, she is widowed and lives alone and we don't have a clue how to go about getting her help.  she obviously doesn't think she needs it, and i'm at a loss.  my mother is the one who is with her the most and is dealing with it the most.  my uncle, who lives in another state, thinks we just have to wait for something to actually happen that will force her to get help.  i'm going to look into support groups, and maybe even counseling for myself.  how did all of you go about getting the diagnosis?", i hope you understand you guys are in for a possible lengthy process.  i’ve been caregiver for five years.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ebvh7i/how_to_get_a_diagnosis/,How to get a diagnosis?

"my grandad (82) has early onset dementia. he’s had a few falls that have hospitalised him, leaving him weak, with swollen feet (his heart isn’t pumping so fluid doesn’t move) and with delirium due to infections. he came out of hospital after the first fall in august and he was home for a little while but then he had a really bad infection, which caused another fall 3 weeks ago and he went back into hospital, a week ago he was transferred to the rehab hospital so he can get better with physio as he is incredibly weak. when he was in the big hospital, he had such bad delirium and he could barely even feed himself. he went through a really dark period where he was saying he didn’t want to go on and everything is so much effort. now he’s in the physio hospital and it’s a lot closer to home so we can visit him more but he seems to have just *given up*. i mean - he doesn’t seem to do a thing in the hospital, just sit and stare at this tiny tv. he keeps saying he is gonna just home for a few days because he gets confused about where he is. he gets angry when we try to help him... like i mentioned that his new electric chair arrived and that if he works really hard in physio then he’ll get home to it soon. he snapped at me which he’s never done. anyway - my point. i’m scared that being in hospital is going to hasten his dementia to deteriorate faster. **and**i’m scared he isn’t going to ever come out and he won’t be here for much longer. he’s... *really* lost. :("," well... i don't know about anybody else, but every time my dad was hospitalized for whatever reason (usually like stomach ulcers or something) his dementia did get acutely worse while in there, and he'd sorta recover when he came out, but never back to how he was when he went in. so yes, i think hospital stays make dementia worse. for the other worry... i dunno man.. each person will have their own level of quality of life they want.. so its sad but to some extent, i sometimes don't see it as something to fight them on.. on the other hand, dementia does come with mood and personality changes.. and hey, maybe he will feel better about it over time. its hard to predict the future and tell whats really going on sometimes. im sorry you are going through this. i know after awhile it will seem like all you have left are bad or worse choices, and sometimes no choice at all. it sucks but i hope you don't feel too alone. this subreddit has bunches of people who have been through similar. take care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/e9f1yy/i_dont_know_who_else_i_can_talk_to_about_this/,I don’t know who else I can talk to about this...

three generations of us can’t figure out how to convince my 86 year old great nana (late stage) to take a bath. she needs one in the worse way. she’s lived with us for months and has yet to take one. she’s getting smelly but either can’t smell anything or doesn’t care or doesn’t know that it’s her. she gets so upset whenever we bring it up. it’s not like we can force her. please... how can any of us convince her? any ideas at all?, this was a big issue with my dad. i finally went over there and said he was going to take a bath before i left and either i was going to wash him or he was going to wash himself. he ended up doing it himself but he wasn't happy and i had to stand outside of the shower to make sure it happened.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dya95j/bath/,Bath?
"my partner and i have been discussing marriage for awhile, thinking it may be best to plan it sooner rather than later because his mom is deteriorating fast. fast forward to yesterday when we took mil out for pancakes for ""sunday funday"" and she made a joke about how we're not married yet and that i should just toss him back and find another fish that's less trouble. so we mentioned that we were actually thinking about getting married in a few months. she asked us ""what church?""  neither of us are religious, we said no church, we're having an outdoor ceremony. she starts in on how i'm leading bf down a wrong path towards hell because she'd never raise her son like that. we're like ""okayyyyyy"" and change the subject. she then starts wanting to know who will be the moh &amp; bestman, so bf says his best friend of 20+ years, and i say, my brother, which is true, i've already asked him and he said yes"" she then gets upset that i didn't pick her to be my moh.... she's decided she doesn't want to be ""mother of the groom"" because bf sucks. she wants to be moh, so she can plan the party!i think we may have missed our window for a wedding with zero behavior issues, i think we'll just have to elope!", weddings are overrated anyway. elope and then throw yourselves a party,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dy9ezc/i_think_im_going_to_need_to_elope/,I think I'm going to need to elope!
"my father is 72 years old and just successfully finished chemotherapy for throat cancer and was officially declared cancer free. due to other health difficulties (balance issues, anxiety, etc.), he's been in a rehab facility for the better part of the last year.we've noticed of late that he's also concurrently started to display symptoms of confusion as to where he is, what he's eaten, etc. he had a colonoscopy a few weeks ago and after that it seems things have gone south. he's been in and out of reality - thinking he was in a bakery baking cakes a few weeks ago and then over the last 24 hours he's been confused and thinking he's in chicago on business. it just seems to be a complete break with reality.my question for this community - i've read that at times anesthesia can exacerbate alzheimer's/dementia symptoms, but it being a few weeks post-anesthesia, would that still be the case? have folks had loved ones who just take weeks to bounce back? i've had doctors tell me he has exhibited early signs of dementia, but the rate at which this happened (1-2 months at most) has me confused and questioning if there's something else up. he's had utis before and i know that can cause those kind of reality breaks, but it doesn't seem he has one now based on what his home is saying.i appreciate any insights that folks have."," i've always believed that alzheimer's is ""sparked"" by some intense situation. it was true enough for my dad. he broke his leg & shortly after that was showing many symptoms of alzheimer's. i took him to a neurologist & he was diagnosed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dy93i4/father_starting_to_exhibit_signs_of/,Father starting to exhibit signs of dementia/alzheimers post-chemotherapy treatment...

i lost my dad do alzheimer’s in 2018. he was pretty young as he was in his mid 50s and was diagnosed around 5-6 years ago. i honestly have trouble remembering the times when he wasn’t sick and we could go on family vacations and stuff as they feel so distant. on nights like these i really miss him being shuffling around and eating random snacks or just messing around the house. i miss when he would wake me up because he couldn’t figure out how to change the chanel and get help. i miss him making me late for work because he wouldn’t let me leave because he wanted to be with me. i just miss having him around even if it wasn’t him 100%. it just sucks because when you’re taking care of them you just want things to be normal but then when they pass you realize that normal now is never seeing them again :(. i love you dad miss you every day ❤️," lost my mom 3 weeks ago. she was only 58 and diagnosed t years ago. it wasn’t her anymore, she didn’t know who i was anymore, but i learned to love her the way she has become. and i miss her terribly every second now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dxvr40/anyone_just_want_to_help_out_again/,Anyone just want to help out again?

"firstly i want to say that it’s been comforting reading about everyone’s experiences knowing that we are not alone alongside our loved ones during this all.earlier this year my mil was diagnosed with early onset at the age of 63. she had been showing some symptoms for a while before (mostly memory, repeating conversations etc) but since her diagnosis it seems to be progressing much quicker than we thought. from initial research, it seemed the average life expectancy would be 5-10 years. we are now at the point maybe 8 months later where she isn’t able to take care of herself (dressing, remembering to eat, completing daily tasks) and as of this week can no longer contain her bowel movements at times. i’m interested to hear from those who are ahead of us in this journey - from your experience, how long did you have / or are having with your loved one while they were losing themselves but still with us? (and i do know every person is different... i guess i just feel that it seems this is going rather quickly and couldn’t imagine her losing more of herself just as fast as we have this year.)"," my understanding and i could be wrong, is that early onset alzheimer's seems to progress faster than when diagnosed later. my dad is in his 80's and his is pretty slow progressing. he also took part in a clinical trial which may or may not have helped a little plus we have him on all sorts of supplements. i do agree that she should be seen by her doctor to rule out other issues as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dxjvm8/progression_of_alzheimers_your_experience/,Progression of Alzheimer’s- Your Experience

man i’m crying writing this. my grandfather’s gum disease has come back to bite him and is contributing to his alzheimer’s. i’m wondering whether giving him lsd or psilocybin would help him retrieve memories. he really wants to remember first person memories with his wife. but he reaches a mental impasse. he’s 92.," i’ve not heard of psychedelics helping with memory retrieval. honestly, i can’t think of why you’d want to give them to someone who struggles with comprehending reality, to begin with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dxg6h2/my_grandfather_wants_to_remember_kissing_his_late/,My grandfather wants to remember kissing his late wife.
"hey all, yesterday i got a call from my sister saying my dad wasn't acting normal and for me to come check it out. she showed me texts between her and my dad and he was repeating himself constantly. he would say he had a bad dream, ask if she took the dogs out, and ask if everything was ok and he kept on doing this. i got there and talked to him and he told me he forgot to go to work and that he had to deal with his boss. then i noticed him repeating himself again. it was terrible. he kept on talking about the bad dream, how he forgot about work,  and other things but each time he would forget something about one of the stories he just said and try to remember but he couldn't. he said he was scared and didn't know what was going on. he also said he couldn't tell what happened in his dreams versus what actually happened in real life. he could recall stuff from many years ago though. i put on a movie we used to always watch and got some food, and the next day he was fine. he remembered not being able to recall stuff and said it was bad. but he also believes it was just a one time thing and that he will be ok. he's only 52. i'm bringing him to the doctor for recommendations on a specialist monday, but i'm asking any of you for some advice. my dad lives alone unless myself or my sister are staying with him.what did you guys do when someone close to you started showing symptoms? what happened to their job and income to support themselves?how long did it take before alzheimers seriously took over for the people close to you? my dad seemed pretty bad the one night, but the next day he's fine so i'm not sure how long we have.it seems early in, is there anything to do to help it?and any other advice would be amazing, i can't think of anything at the moment but i may come back and ask more.going to a specialist and google would obviously help with these questions but i want to know firsthand from people who have experienced it so i know what i'm really dealing with. thank you.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dxczgr/advice/,Advice
"my mother, 82, was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's, though has been showing increasing memory problems for several years and has been on a steeper downhill slide the last four months. she's currently living in the ""independent living"" area in an excellent retirement community where the residents and staff know her and care about her. later this week we are moving her to a new facility where she will be in assisted living, with memory care available when she needs it.i'm her son, 64, and i am her agent under her power of attorney, which was authorized by the written opinion of her doctor. my mom has a very controlling personality. for the most part, she has used her powers for good, planning carefully for her future. she has long term care insurance and enough money in her investments to last her for many, many years. but now, of course, she's resisting my taking control of her finances (she has forgotten many times to pay bills, her rent, etc) and is absolutely against moving. her current facility has been doing what they can within their legal power (we are in washington, where there are strict laws governing what the differences are between independent and assisted living) to keep her safe while we find new housing, but there is really no choice now that we have a new home for her. she has to move. we've talked about it many times over the past few weeks. as expected, every conversation about her moving is the same conversation, because she can't remember what we've talked about in the past. she continually surprised by the fact that she can't stay where she is (they can't provide the level of care she needs). she asks over and over about the new rent, and where the money is coming from, why she has to move when she's happy where she is. her arguments and questions are always the same. it's almost like a script, and have no idea how to get ahead of it, if i even can. i tell her over and over -- sometimes several times in the same conversation -- where the money is coming from, that it's hers, and it's being used exclusively for her (though, to be honest, i've been a co-signer on her bank accounts for over a decade, long before dementia was an issue for her...so i could legally use it for anything i want, but morally...no, it's hers). as much as i am able i keep my patience, answer her questions and explain the circumstances as if it's the first time i'm hearing her questions and giving her the answers.i dread the next week, as we pack and move, and the weeks after as she gets used to her new home (or doesn't, as the case may be). i love my mom, and i hate having to defy her. i'm afraid of her taking a walk in the next few days and getting lost, as she has a couple times lately (not seriously lost...not yet). since she's in independent living at the moment, the staff can't legally stop her from leaving. but i'm afraid she'll get it into her head to walk away as a deliberate act against the control i've had to take over her life. or she could write me a letter revoking the power of attorney, which is one of the provisions of the poa. i doubt she'll remember she can do that (though i've reminded her of it a couple of times), or won't be able to think through the decision and the act to do it. and if somehow she does, with the new lease having been signed and move-out notices given, i have no idea what i would need to do next. i know this is probably an old story. everyone's alzheimer's journey is different, they tell me, but the broad strokes are much the same. and i know in my head what i'm doing is right for her. but she also makes me doubt it. i'm a pretty empathetic person, but i have a hard time empathizing with her, seeing things through her eyes, because her memory problems are foreign to me, especially since she's been so logical and thought so correctly for my whole life.i wish i could *feel* i'm doing things right. i know i'm doing the best i can. no one among her friends or family is opposing my decisions except my mom, but i'm also the only one making decisions.so i had to vent."," i was so scared that my mom would hate me for moving her, but she doesn't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dx3dc5/handling_a_big_move_venting_worrying/,"Handling a big move -- venting, worrying"

"i moved away from my family for college and ended staying thousands of miles away to start my career. my family called to inform me that my 83 year old grandmother who i'm very close with had a sudden change in her mental state. she's has been getting slightly forgetful in the last few years, but she's recently called the police 4+ times claiming there was a break in and things were stolen. all the items were found in odd places in her house, so now she's convinced someone broke in and moved them. i dropped everything and flew to her to make sure she was safe and assess the situation. she's normal most of the time, but gets bouts of paranoia and delusions. i took her to her primary to check for a possible uti and to address her oxybutinyn perscriptions (side effects can be hallucinations and delusions). doctor wrote off my concerns about the meds, claiming he also takes them and they are fine. i had to fight to get the urine testing for a possible uti, which was supposedly negative. he excused himself quickly to see other patients. i discreetly spoke to the ma's (i hate to belittle my sweet grandmother) about her delusions, they seemed concerned and wrote down my concerns and said the doctor would call me later. he indeed called and told me that those were reasons to be concerned, but followed up with ""i understand your concern, but not sure how i'm supposed to fit in here?"" im not a doctor! i assumed these were things her doctor should be aware of and perhaps would like to monitor or even refer me to a neurologist. he offered no advice other than ""put her in a home"". please tell me there are more constructive, helpful doctor's out there! i have no idea if she has dementia, alzheimer's, or some other issue causing this. i have put my day to day life on hold to help my grandma (which i am very happy to do if she needs me) but i can't come to a solution if i don't even know what exactly or roughly what i'm dealing with. this is the hardest thing i have ever dealt with. i cry every time i talk about her symptoms to anyone, it breaks my heart to know my grandma is scared and confused. any advice is greatly appreciated.", sorry to read about these experiences. you may want to check out dr. dale bredesen's work: [,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dwnfes/finding_a_doctor_for_my_grandma/,Finding a doctor for my Grandma

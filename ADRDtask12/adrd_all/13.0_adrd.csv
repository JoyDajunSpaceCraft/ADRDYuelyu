[removed]," my mother had a ltc plan with calpers and we used it for more than 5 years when she was diagnosed with memory issues.  calpers ltc was excellent; and it was much easier to deal with than i thought it would be.  in order to make a long-term healthcare claim with calpers, your mother will need to be in a condition where she requires assistance with a certain number activities of daily living (i don't remember how many).  things like cooking, bathing, getting dressed, etc.  the plan paid for all of her room and board at the memory care facility which was between $5.5 and $7.5k/mo. over the last few years - more $ as she required more assistance.  medical/dental care and supplies, and other expenses were handled via medicare or paid out of pocket. go to the [calpers ltc website]( to get the information and help you need.  (forget about the web account. just call the toll-free number and ask questions about how you can file a claim for your mom.)  there will be paperwork that her mds will have to complete.   they are not accepting new members, but your mom is already a member and has been paying into the plan for years, so she should be good to go.  i can only speak for myself, but the calpers ltc plan was a godsend, and not hard to deal with at all.  they seemed genuinely helpful and knowledgable.  the hardest part was getting the memory care facility to submit the correct paperwork each month - which usually wasn't hard at all (except for one particular admin...).  don't worry about the class-action. it will take care of itself.  good luck and bless you for taking such good care of your mother.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/o9meas/calpers_longterm_care_anyone/,"CalPERS Longterm care, anyone?"

"my father (70) has been having memory issues for probably a year at this point.  doctors kept telling him it was just a part of aging until he went to a neurologist where he eventually was diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs.  i just heard the news last night and am devastated.right now, he is his normal self but has some memory issues and occasional agitation.  i‚Äôm not sure how fast the disease will progress since that‚Äôs for the specialists to estimate.i need some advice on caring for an alzheimer‚Äôs patient as they decline.  since he is fully aware and in early stages, i am going to do as much with him as i can while he still has his mind intact.how do you cope with watching your own parent slowly decline mentally?", this website may help you  being patient is the leading online community for alzheimer's & dementia patients & caregivers.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/nzkj0z/father_diagnosed_with_alzheimers_advice/,Father Diagnosed With Alzheimers.

[removed]," my daughter is struggling with the same thing regarding my husband's mother, except they didn't have a bad relationship. she just told me today, however, that she's already had to watch my parents and grandparents die, and she would rather remember her last grandparent vibrant and fun and always on the go, and not go and be confused for whatever random family member of neighbor is the flavor of the moment. i told her i won't force her to visit, but that if she's going to, she should do it now while her grandmother does have memories left and can remember her at all. it's hard, though! especially if the relationship was always tenuous.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/nyrg7q/visit_grandpa_before_passing/,Visit grandpa before passing

[removed]," not a monster at all. i've had the exact same thoughts about my mother. she lost her husband of 50 years (my father) a few months back and she has rapidly declined. between the depression and the mind degeneration she wanes back and forth between sad, anguished crying and hateful, vitriolic outbursts-mostly directed at me and my sister. we try not to take it personal or respond, but it's hard. my mom is miserable 97% of the time and it's heartbreaking to see. the only redeeming thing i have right now is that i know she doesn't remember the awful things she says to us, and the fleeting moments where she is neither crying nor lashing out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/nxwhtw/i_feel_like_a_monster/,I feel like a monster

[removed]," my mom definitely took a turn for the worse after a hospitalization, so it is possible that whatever put her in the hospital triggered a decline in her mental condition as well.mom isn't on those exact drugs, but she is on a pretty potent cocktail of very strong meds that you generally wouldn't want someone on. and here's the thing- in a normal brain we wouldn't want her on such strong meds, but she needs them. there are no drugs or treatments for alzheimers disease; all you can do is try to treat the symptoms and make the person as comfortable as possible as they progress through the stages of the disease. the truth is that some of the symptoms of middle-late stage alzheimers are really awful, and sometimes powerful antipsychotics are the only thing that help.for us, mom was having frequent seizures and horrible hallucinations causing her to become angry, violent, and paranoid. those powerful drugs with nasty side effects are lessening her suffering and making it so she can get through the day without thinking her caretakers are trying to murder her and kidnap her children. and we are looking at getting her on hospice care soon. not yet, but soon. because while she does have good moments and good days, she's also suffering horribly, and more often than not now, she's checked out and gone, or crying and afraid, and in those moments even the things she used to love don't bring her back.to an outside observer, it probably does look like we're trying to drug her up and shorten her life, but to us, that are seeing the day-to-day caregiving needs and how much she suffers, the choices we are making are absolutely the most compassionate decisions we can make for her. i can't tell from your post- are you involved in day-to-day care for your mom, or taking on more of a supervisory role? if you aren't seeing her day-to-day, it might be worth talking with her caretaker to get a better picture of why they believe the drugs are necessary, and what they're experiencing in caring for her",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ntanx8/why_is_my_mother_not_on_any_medications_for_ad/,Why is my mother not on any medications for AD?

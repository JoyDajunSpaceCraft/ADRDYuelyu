"i have had two parents with dementia of two different types. my father died of complications of dementia last month and my mother is in the final stages.both had normal mris to the end, both were highly educated and very successful people. one early (60) onset &amp; one late onset.i am curious if in y'all experience how often this might occur. thanks for the resourse."," mris do not necessarily show up abnormalitirs in the brain.  my 71 year old wife underwent 2 nuclear medicine tests, spect and pet as well. both measure brain activity. one measures the brain's consumption of glucose which shows which parts of the brain are not functioning as normal.the wife's alzheimer's is not too bad, forgetful but functioning. taking aricept now. she is also taking shark cartiledge, which contains chondroitin 6, which according to an oxford univeristy study improves neural plasticity. we are also taking gingko biloba which improves blood flow.we will try anything that helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qg6p0h/mri_dementia/,MRI & Dementia
"my mother has dementia she was diagnosed about 5 years ago, showed symptoms for the last 10 maybe. i have 2 sisters, one lives near by, one far away and a brother. we are all in our 40s -50s. she is currently under care at home with my stepfather and hospice. he has full poa and is her medical proxy. she is stage six and has other debilitating conditions which makes her pretty much unable to do anything by herself.very long story short, my stepfather is extremely verbally abusive. he fights with her constantly about things that happened earlier in the day and she doesn't remember and he just badgers her about it on and on and on calls her a f****** b****, tells her he hates her, says she's ruining his life.anytime we try to confront him he just blocks us from everything. she cannot dial a phone, she also can't answer a phone. he is my only lifeline to her.we had a bit of a disagreement earlier today and he has blocked me again, tonight she fell and his on her way to the hospital. i asked him to unblock me, he said call the hospital and get updates and hung up on me. he is power of attorney and medical practice so they won't tell me anything. this has been an ongoing issue. hospice is slowly recognizing that there might be an issue. biggest issue of all is that if he decides that he no longer wants  hospice to speak to my sister and i, they have to oblige and  then we will not know anything. i called adult protective services a few months back and they cleared him and said that he was taking care of her needs.i need help. what do i do?","  if he puts on a show for protective services you will need proof of what he is doing.  is there anyway to get a recording device in the house?  seems like that is the only way to get proof of what he is doing. your only recourse is adult protect  services and somehow they need to be convinced of what he is doing. i would keep calling them.  is there anyway he would agree to you taking over her care?i am so sorry for your mom, what torture to be trapped in the world of dementia and then be tortured daily by the man who should be protecting you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qfxvi2/i_need_advice_and_help_for_my_mom/,I need advice and help for my mom

"my father and i were struggling to get my mom (72, ftd) to shower regularly. i tried just about everything, even purchasing nice shower gels to get her excited about bathing again. she'd get angry and insist she already showered, then say we're hurting her feelings.one night during my recent visit, i decided to try something different.  my mom was very confused that day but in a good mood.  i pulled out her pjs and clean underwear then announced i would run a shower for her so she could relax at the end of the day.  she obliged.  the next night, i did it again and it worked.  if my mom sees the act of gently laying out her nightclothes as a loving gesture by my father and me, she complies.  new shower gels, reasoning, or outright begging don't seem to cut it.  i'm actually stunned this simple approach works after all the techniques we've tried in the past."," i’m so glad you and your dad found something that works for all of you. good for you for trying something new; it’s often hard to get past feeling frustrated because a parent isn’t doing something that would be good for them. i like reading about successes experienced by others when dealing with a loved who has dementia. sometimes the successes are small, but it’s still satisfying. i’ll pass your idea along to my friend, who is facing a similar struggle with her mom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qfrvh1/finally_got_mom_to_shower_regularly_heres_how/,Finally got mom to shower regularly!

"my mom had a sudden change in vision and needed surgery in september. there were no beds at our local hospital so they lifeflighted her to a city about 300 miles away. the surgery was done through her nose (her pitiuary gland was pressing on her optic nerve). my mom came through the surgery fine, she was her ""normal"" self on facetime, andf the doctors said she would be home in 2 days. i got transportation arranged (they don't tell you when there are no beds due to covid they pay to take to you another hospital but they do not pay to tke you back). this was my first time having to really use my financial poa, and a great learning lesson. then nothing from the hospital for 4 days. i paniced and had to file compliants to get answers. it was scary being so far away and my mom's cell phone was disabled! she had developed mengitsis after the surgery. the hospital said she was safe, they had her in a small covid safe room (no windows) and she was getting iv's. i talked to her and she did not know who i was or our family was. it was hard. her baseline before the surgery was forgetting where she was going in the car or why she walked into a room or if she took her meds, but she knew who i was still and her family was and she was very sharp still on long term finances. the doctors signed papers saying she was not aware and i needed to take over all medical and finacial decisions so i was called for every med change and procedure and had to give permission. her blood cell counts got better and the medical staff said the meningitsis was getting better. she did get more peppy in her speech. she was not as sleepy sounding but still so confused about where she was what day it was and who people were. she would claim she was being held prisioner or in a drug rehab facility (she was in a neurology floor icu i confirmed no drug rehab in the building) she would claim she was outside all night (i know she was not i was in constant contact with the nurses). the doctor said she developed post operative  delirium.  they said this would get better when she got home. they finally got a bed a nursing home back at home and she was transferred. she has been a a facility close to me for almost 3 weeks and she still has this post operative  delirium ?, she is so confused as to what medical staff have come in, what time of day it is, she will claim she has not been showered for 2 weeks (not true) or that i have not visited for days (when i have been there every day . many times 3-4 times a day, and there is covid sign in so it is on the sheet i was there for hours).  she will say that kids were at her door screaming at night (no kids allowed, doubled checked, thr nurse says it is  delirium halliculations). the nursiing home staff is super nice but way understaffed and it is hard to get answers. one staff memeber (someone high up in an office) said iif my mom still has this post operative delirium a month later, it is likely her new norm? it is such a huge decline from pre surgery plus she is so angry. she will yell you have not visited me, and say bad words and i an exhustated and have visited her 2 times that day but she yells and she flashes her diaper(the surgery left her incontinent which is been very hard) and says crude things. this again is a shocking 1 month change. i have looked up post operative delirium and had no idea how common it was in patients over 75. &amp;#x200b;now i have to make decisions and i have sat with the lawyer and i have the power to make almost every choice i can think of. she is going to be released soon. she wants to go home, to her home. no way she can go home alone. the other factor is when she got sick i was in the process of moving out of state. like i had sold my house and my spouse had a new job in another state and we had offered on a home. our plans at the time were for her to live at her home with help and then we had located long term facilities in the area we were moving to that my mom was familiar with (she used to live in the state we are moving to) that she agreed to.  now this level of help she needs is so much higher then 1 month ago so what i had lined up will not work. now my spouse and one child are  cross country and myself and my son are renting part of a home trying to stay nearby my mom. i have not got a good nights sleep in a month, i have lost almost 20lbs (and i was not overweight), i just want to have my own space and some quiet (the retirement city my mom is so hard to find a rental, hotel room, it is booming and i am lucky to have the small noisy sapce i have but i just want to cry some nights, it is so loud and i am used to quiet) and sleep but i cant leave my mom yet. she says i do not want to move (yet she does not know where she is right now). she is angry and just so hard to spend time with. i have the legal paperwork and i can write a check for her to move, i can put an addition on my new house for her to stay there, i can pay for a nursing home or assisted living, i have the control but she is so angry(before the surgery, she was fiesty and opinionated  but not angry like this). her wish is to go home locally and have caregivers (which she can afford) but i , her only family will be over 2,000 miles away.  her pcp says while she might be able to go home, with her many issues, she likely will be back iin a hospital or care center in 6 months to a year and i will be far away. the pcp says take her with me, the nursing home says take her with me, she has almost no friends left in the area, sadly most have died or some have moved back to be with family. the local medical care is very hard to come by, the city boomed and doctors did not come to meet the demand. do i just force her to come with me? or do i let her stay and most likely fail and come back for her. i worry about people taking advantage of her in her if i am not close. it scary to see the lack of workforce. stores are closed, restuarants are closed. one of the reasons i am losing weght is at 8pm i leave the nursing home and the city is already closed due to no workers. i cant find a grocery store or fast food place open after 8pm. previously i was easily able to find a nice stay at home mom to come help with housework or errands who was happy to make some extra money, but that is gone. ther rates for in home care were $15 an hour and now are $40+ if you can find someone and with my mom's anger she is not going to be a patient someone wants if they have a choice. &amp;#x200b;if yoiu read my whole long story, thank you so much. so my main concerns are is this post poerative  delirium her new norm?  since she already had memory loss, did this surgery and the complications just send her downhill faster? should i move her or leave her ? i want to respect her wishes. i have been very careful with every medical choice and financial choice to answer as if i were my healthy 50 year old mom not what i want. she does not want to move so i dont want to go against her wishes but her wishes are no really the best medical choice for her and not the best choice for support."," thank you for taking the time to type all of it out. it sounds like it’s been a lot of big changes and some crises situations that have been so stressful. as my grandmother’s live-in caregiver i also lost weight, felt i adopted horrid eating patterns, and succumbed to my inability to sleep. but i was determined to make sure my granny was well cared for and relate as well as understand where you’re coming from. ❤️‍🩹 i did some quick research and noticed that several websites shared that pituitary gland surgery can take up to 6 weeks for full recovery. it is so important to remember that because dementia causes some anosognosia ((lack of awareness of symptoms)) she may not be able to express that she’s still experiencing some internal pain or discomfort, or might not be aware/recall that the pain is due to a recent surgery. *adults with dementia sometimes become agitated, irritable, and in my past experience, downright mean/cruel/violent/aggressive when they are enduring “invisible” pains*. give it a little bit of time as she continues to heal from the surgery. as for arranging care, try contacting the adult protective services (aps) of the county of the state in which she is staying/will be staying. they may be able to provide a county social worker who can better outline her options for care and residence for you to make those decisions with her best interest in mind. you’re not alone, and there are caregiver support groups out there. perhaps contact your own local county’s mental health services and see what they can offer to better support you in this. it is hard work and that isn’t diminished despite the willingness and dedication we may have to help our loved ones. try reminding yourself that she’s not being mean on purpose, and if she is still showing signs of delirium after another 2-3 weeks try talking to her doctors about potential medication to ease her anxiety or potentially treat psychosis. i don’t feel medication should be a first-resort but it is sometimes necessary when our loved ones can no longer exercise self-awareness or self-control. feel free to reach out any time you need to vent and i’ll try to respond 💕 best of luck, and kudos to you for your dedication to ensuring she is not only well-cared for but also happy. if she had the wherewithal to tell you herself how much she appreciates it, she would; but know that she does.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qf0sr8/post_operative_deliriummenigitsis_will_it_get/,Post Operative Delirium/Menigitsis Will it get better or is this new baseline...stressed out!

"long post, tldr at the end. i didn't know my grandpa growing up. he was estranged from the family for decades. by coincidence, i moved to a town close to him a few years ago, and decided i would try and strike up a relationship with him. as it turned out, he is a kind, quiet soul. i knew he had mild dementia when i looked him up, but he knew who i was, and we bonded really quickly. now, looking back, i realize how lucky i am that i got to form a relationship with him before his dementia got really bad. i feel like i got in there just in time, he has already forgotten who by brother, and his other grandchildren are.the last year was the hardest, he lost the ability to keep track of time. he'd go to bed at weird hours, and wake up just thinking it was morning all the time. i would pop by for a visit at 8pm, and here's grandpa at his kitchen table, having a cuppa coffee, saying ""what brings you here so early?"". he would go for short walks at all hours of the night, which was very worrisome, as he lives in kind of a crummy area. i became that one person he could trust if he needed help. since he never knew what time it was, he would make phone calls at all hours to ask about groceries, mail, and other little things. eventually, i had to take his phone book away because people were getting mad at him about the 3am calls (including one of his ex wives - i always joked that maybe i would just leave her number there!). i left my number by the phone, and said ""you can call me any time, and i will never be angry."" true to my word, whenever he called at weird hours, i was as nice as pie and patient. it was usually a short, 2 min conversation, just to reassure him that things are taken care of and he doesn't have to worry. recently, someone started to target him for money, ""some babe"", he called her. she would come to him and say she's taking him out for a drive, then get him to pay for a bunch of stuff at walmart. she sent her kids to his house to beg for money. he'd call me after to tell me ""i've done something i shouldn't have"". by the time i got talking to him the memories of it would fade. we never got a proper description, or figured out who was targeting him. not that the targeting was a good thing, but it was the catalyst that got him into long term care finally. my family has been begging the local health authority to approve his long term care application, because he got way past the point where he could manage on his own, or with my help. we had people coming in to help 4 times a day, but it wasn't enough. we sent the health authority an email with the subject line ""instances of elder abuse"", and bam, three days later he had a placement! his ltc facility is about an hour's drive from me, i wish it was closer, but i'm glad he got into it. it's one of the nicer places around here. he has his own room, and the facility and staff seem amazing. i was so worried about his confusion, because he did not want to go into care. but when he arrived, and saw all his stuff set up in his new room, he said ""all this is for me? what did i do to deserve this? this is great!"" phew! he's doing great, and i'm finally sleeping through the night without the phone calls. i miss him, even though it's only been a few days. i'm going to give it a couple weeks before i visit, because i really want him to get into the routine there. sorry for the long post, just new to reddit and this community, and so happy i've found a place where i can talk about it anonymously with people who are going through something similar. tl;dr - newly formed relationship with my estranged grandpa with dementia turns heartwarming, then difficult. after being essentially robbed by someone, gets long term care placement. couldn't be happier, except if he was a bit closer."," this warms my heart. i see someone posted the same thing, but i don’t care to be original. heart warming indeed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qdd6n9/my_grandpas_story_from_estrangement_to_best/,"My Grandpa's story - From Estrangement, to best friends, to long term care."

burger or salad?his pcp *will not* screen him for dementia or alzheimer's. will not refer to a specialist. he says it's not worth it because my dad is depressed so the screening won't be accurate anyways. how do you have a man in his late 70s with these symptoms and not even look into it? he won't test for vitamin deficiency or anything. blames everything on depression and says the severe episode last year was because of the ambian.well now my dad is having another episode. he won't talk. i got him to say hello to me over the phone but he couldn't answer when i asked how he was feeling or what's going on with him. asked him if he knew where he was and he didn't answer. asked him if he remembered he and mom are supposed to come visit me soon and he was quiet for a long time and then said yeah. ask them if he still wanted to come visit me and he didn't answer.he's terrified to go to the er because he thinks they'll section him again. i need his shitty doctor to take this seriously or get him in asap with a doctor who will. how do i force this terrible medical system to screen and diagnose my father so we can know whatever is going on with him and start looking into treatments?? how can i stop them from putting him in a horrible place like they did before?"," i don't know what you mean by ""they sectioned him"". you need a specialist managing his symptoms, not a pcp, whether dementia is involved or not. are your parents open to seeing a geriatric psychiatrist? a geriatric psychiatrist will be specialized in dementia which is very different than regular psychiatry. same goes for psychiatric hospitals - if someone is suffering from psychosis or a mental illness and they also have dementia, they really need a geriatric psych ward and not a regular psych ward.  if you can schedule an appointment with one, do it even if there's a long wait time.  have you looked at his medical records?  they usually do a full panel of bloodwork and other tests during diagnostics at a hospital. this may contain some of the answers you are looking for. he should bring all the records from the er and the psych hospital with him to the geriatric psychiatrist.   i would also look up if there is a geriatric psych ward in your area. if he needs to go to an er again before getting to a new doctor, request he be brought there. i assume they changed his medications while in the psych hospital?  does your mom insure he takes the meds as directed each day?  this doesn't sound like obvious dementia to me. these symptoms are definitely consistent with bad reactions to medication, such as ambien, and mental illness. however, these things can co-occur with dementia so you need a specialist to cover all the bases.  treatment and management of mental illness is different when dementia is involved.  does your dad have a history of mental illness, depression, alcoholism, strokes, head injury? my dad's regular pcp would not consider dementia either and it caused a big delay in diagnosis and other problems.  a geriatric psychiatrist and a geriatric nurse practitioner for regular health issues ended up being the perfect combination for him.

"i'm not sure if anyone is wanting an update, but i think writing one might help me...?so, i went and picked holly up (the dog) last friday after work. papa had given consent to give her to me ""for the weekend"" while they moved the big pieces of furniture and such into the new place. additionally, i had been under the impression that a vet checkup was necessary in order for holly to move in and that hadn't been scheduled yet.well, papa never forgot that i had holly. he kept calling my mom and asking about holly. my mom kept telling him i had her and that he'd get her back on sunday night. i started recognizing that this whole situation was stressing papa out more than anything and kind of accepted that a permanent acquisition of the dog likely wasn't in the cards. there are a lot of things that i would have done differently had i been more involved in the planning process of this whole thing. i don't like how my mother handled it. but in any case, papa was supposed to come with my mom on sunday evening to pick holly up. but instead, he drove himself to my house by some miracle to get her sunday morning. alone. yes, he's still driving which is another thing that needs addressing but my mom isn't listening to me on that front either. so, i guess the bottom line is...we tried to take the dog and this attempt failed.", you can disconnect the battery. or substitute a key that doesn't work. everybody acts perplexed including the mechanic (who you've clued in).,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qbkbym/update_dog_papa/,Update: Dog & Papa
"grandmother is slowly slipping into-- possibly dementia? she still knows who everyone is, even if she does have to list off 3 people before she gets there, and she's not ""gone"" by any means-- but almost every day she reports people messing with her outside her house at night. my mother is practically her caretaker at this point, and it's exhausting her physically and mentally trying to sort this one out, so i'm posting for advice.details:   \- these things occur only at night  \- she isn't afraid, more annoyedoccurrences include:  \- somebody parking in her driveway and shining a light inside her house  \- a man walking with boots stomping up and down her gravel driveway  \- a man breaking into and living in her (locked with a chain) shed  \- making bird call noises outside her window  \- just various other similar things  \* they are never in the housewe believe this to be some sort of night-based delusions, because a lot of these can be explained by moonlight, frogs, birds, and so on. it does keep her up, it does frustrate her (she's reported yelling out the window for them to go away), and it frustrates her when she tries to tell my mother about it.we have:  \- set up cameras that catch nothing (but she believes they ""hide"" from the cameras)  \- tried modifying living space to change the triggers (lights / sounds) but she won't have any of it  \- stayed up all night and watched to see if anyone or anything shows up  \- various other things to ""prove"" nothing is there, but obviously as she believes it's happening there's no convincing her.so what's advice here? normally dementia advice is ""let them live in their fantasy world"" where their family is still alive or something, but here reaffirming ""yes there are men messing with you outside at night"" is not helpful. proving they're not there hasn't been helpful. trying to remove (what we believe to be) triggers either doesn't work or isn't physically possible. we attempted adjusting her medications, but it did not improve this particular issue and made the things she is taking medication for worse.we just want her to feel safe and my mom to have peace of mind. any help is appreciated! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"," same happened to my grandma in the early phases when she was living alone. she had recurring utis that greatly exacerbated her hallucinations and false perceptions. if y’all can get her in for a checkup in that regard, that would be my first piece of advice. eventually these episodes were constant, but when things came to a head in those early phases, 99% of the time she had a uti and getting treatment stopped the delusions (for a while). another thing that may be going on is sundowning. i was told that can be caused by low stimulation during the day that had the brain overreacting to shadows, sounds, etc.  filling up the day with engaging activities my help her sleep at night. in my grandma’s case, i ended up opting for memory care because she could be herself there. she was also closely monitored and checked for infection when she exhibited a rapid change in behavior. they also had tons of activity, and even if she didn’t participate, i believe it was good for her to have a lot of activity around her. and if she ended up pacing the floors with anxiety all night, she was in a safe place to do it. sorry you are dealing with this. it is so scary. :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qbfbl5/grandmother_thinks_people_are_messing_with_her/,Grandmother thinks people are messing with her outside at night - what do?

"hello. my grandmother has dementia, i recently found out. although i kind of knew that she was showing symptoms of it, now i realize how bad it actually is. my mother doesn't really have a strong relationship with my grandmother, they normally see each other once or maybe twice a year, they also live pretty far away from one another. i think when we visited my grandmother in 2018, she was already being a bit forgetful: occasionally repeating words and phrases in sentences. in 2019/begin 2020 we visited her again, she did not seem to recognize me at first when she opened the door. she went upstairs, and showed us cabinets and wardrobes full off unnecessary stuff, which she compulsively bought. rows and rows of the same cleaning product, toilet paper, et cetera. i don't think that we really visited her after that. (until recently)just a few weeks ago, my grandmother (she is usually very cold and blunt) called my mother in a deeply emotional state, begging her to come by once. my mother asked if it was okay to see her that same day, which my grandmother initially accepted.however, just 30 minutes or so before the appointment she said she wasn't 'feeling well' so my mother shouldn't come. she didn't, but a couple of days later she did. when my mother arrived, she found her own mother lost in dementia. my grandmother has formed this narrative which she says every single time when she's talking to someone: ""oh, did you know i got fired from my job? the business closed down."" this was 15 years ago.""hey, i renovated my kitchen."" 10 years ago. yesterday, i went with my mother to see my grandmother. she did not recognize both of us. we brought some food, because she is terribly skinny and keeps forgetting to eat. my mother had to explain that she was her daughter, i think she understood that. she kept asking for my age, and awkwardly asked me what my name was, and where we lived. care: she can not live by herself without help anymore. we can't go there every day to take care of her, but, there is a friendly neighbour at the other end of the street who helps her and chats with her occassionally. he is truly a kind man, but it is also very strenuous for him. he is getting literal physical pain because of the intensity of taking care of my grandmother, poor soul. we have contacted my grandmother's doctor (she has not been officially diagnosed yet) who is very, lazy i would call it. he refused to get help for my grandmother and was overall just lacking. after some pushing, we have managed to get a caretaker to take care of my grandmother, but onfortunately, it starts in januari! my grandmother still has a driving license and is still driving, which should be taken from her. i don't know what stage she is in, however, i would guess stage 5 of alzheimer's. damn, i just realized how much i wrote. if anyone actually read all of that: thank you. i don't know what we can do at this point.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qa9jux/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,I don't know what to do.

"# antioxidants to prevent alzheimer's diseasea balanced intake of antioxidants could prevent the development of alzheimer's disease.[&amp;#x200b; this study was in individuals with the apoe4 gene(s), which increases oxidative and nitrostative stress, but it is true for all cases of alzheimer's disease. directly or indirectly, oxidation and nitration leads to a shortage of neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, stymies the regeneration of neurons, synpases, and axons, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, and contributes to the death of neurons.the decline in internal antioxidant defenses (such as glutathione) and the increase in oxidative stress exactly parallels the progression of alzheimer's disease:""the hippocampi – the brain centres for learning and memory – are one of the earliest regions to be sabotaged by alzheimer’s pathology. our data revealed that gsh \[glutathione\] levels plummet in the hippocampi of patients with alzheimer’s as well as those with mci \[mild cognitive impairment\]. the frontal cortices – brain ceos responsible for a variety of executive functions – are chronologically affected later in alzheimer’s. gsh levels mimic this chronology with no changes in the cortices of mci patients, but significant reduction in those of alzheimer’s patients. interestingly, gsh remains unaffected in the cerebellum – a brain region unaffected by alzheimer’s till late stages. it appears gsh decline is not ubiquitous but rather a region-specific phenomenon that appears to precisely map the progression of alzheimer’s in our brains.""[another study from years ago found that peroxynitrite-mediated damage was widespread in alzheimer's disease.all the causes of alzheimer's disease and all the features of alzheimer's diseases are tied to oxidative and nitrostative stress. the few treatments which nearly stabilize alzheimer's disease for two years or more partially reduce oxidation and nitration.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qa0flb/oxidative_stress_as_a_the_cause_of_alzheimers/,Oxidative stress as a (the) cause of Alzheimer's disease

"my mum may have dementia (or severe chronic fatigue, but either way it certainly looks like early stage dementia) and she lives alone. at the moment she has a carer visit every day for an hour to make her lunch and make sure she has something for dinner and such. now, my mum has a fair bit of savings so she doesn't qualify for government care. when we were setting up the carer, every step of the way we were clear it was paid for and she was very happy about that. cut to yesterday, about 3 weeks with the carer, and she has to pay her first payment. mum was very upset and said she didn't realise she had to pay. now she isn't sure she wants a carer at all. the issue here is if she refuses the carer, i will have to move back in with her. i also have chronic fatigue syndrome so it would be an awful strain on me. it's also a 3 hour journey (minimum) from the place i've built my life. the only positive is that i don't work, due to my illness, so i don't have to worry about that. i do have a brother who cared for her before he started university, but i don't want him to have to give up his education so it would definitely be me moving back in. anyone got any advice? i'm trying to convince her the carer is worth it and she absolutely can pay for it no problem but it's very difficult when i have no idea what she's actually going to remember."," first thing i would do is find out asap if your mum has the early onset of dementia and what type.if she has,the sooner the better and treatment can begin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q9y8r7/im_worried_about_my_mum_refusing_care_because_she/,I'm worried about my mum refusing care because she has to pay for it

"my nana (77f) has rapidly progressive mixed dementia, she developed it very suddenly in march 2020 and has rapidly gotten worse since. the memory symptoms aren’t honestly the worst part. it’s the depression, anxiety, delusions, mood swing, hallucinations, and anger that have made it difficult. we had to place her in a memory care facility 8 days ago after she had some scary delusions and ran away from home (she had a bladder infection, made everything way worse). she is even more depressed than she was already, anxiety is not under control and is angry. they keep trying to get her engaged but she won’t stay at the activities and just goes back to her room. she is trying to guilt trip us and tell us how mean and horrible we are for putting her in “prison” (she is in a very nice facility that looks like a home setting not a prison or hospital), and thinks she’s been there a really long time not just a week. we keep telling her that the hospital sent her to a rehab to get stronger per the facilities recommendation. me, my mom, and my grandad (her husband) all feel awful as she is so depressed and miserable but there’s just no way for us to keep her safe at home. it doesn’t help that the facility doesn’t answer the damn phone so we can’t even see how she’s doing today, and she hasn’t been answering her phone. how have you guys worked past the feeling of guilt and regret? we know she’s in the safest place possible but it doesn’t make it any easier."," i don't think it is ever easy when you have to place someone you love.  as care givers sometimes you just don't have a way to keep them safe from their own behaviors. this disease takes over and sometimes there is no way to combat the way it ravages our loved ones.  i assume her doctor would be trying to add medication or adjust what she is taking now to help with the depression and delusions. it is so hard when they want to come home or blame you for locking them up, but it is being done for the right reasons and you just have to hang on to that.  when my mil was in a home she never answered the phone, cell or land line, and there was nothing we could do.  either her cell wasn't charged or the phone wasn't within easy reach. is anyone in the family able to get in to see her?  if it's a good facility then you know she is being cared for. her response to all of this is out of your hands, you all just have to remember you are doing the best you can for her. good luck,",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q9oet4/dementia_is_so_much_more_than_just_memory_loss/,[deleted by user]

"the gal helping has abandoned the directive to maximize self agency and has taken over the kitchen, where the un lo still manages to cook and eat. he is already 6 feet tal and weighs 135 lbs. but didn't eat yet today (it's 1 pm here) because he couldn't find things. he keeps everything on the counter where he can see it, because he's unable to think well enough to search. she's been unnecessarily cleaning out cupboards, which contain things he never uses, and now that stuff is mixed in with the right-now things. can't find the sieve he uses daily. can't even find the garbage bin that goes under the sink. with my daughter helping him find things he was able at last to make oatmeal, but now the sink is full of stuff, dishwasher full of ""clean"" things with baked-on food, counters are crowded with stuff so the water dispenser/filter (which went through the dw) doesn't fit and its lid is missing. he won't drink water if it's not set up there. poor daughter can't see how to unsnarl this. she wasn't going to spend the damned day there. i'm struck by how someone who says she's worked with vascular dementia can be so thoughtless. he is unable think very well, executive functions are almost gone entirely,  so he relies on physical memory to accomplish tasks.  like, the oatmeal in the water starts to boil so he reaches left for the spoon. but if she put the spoon somewhere else, he does not know what to do. stands there, flummoxed.she is actually reducing his ability to function, while creating more work for the rest of us. and we pay her. really, if she would just cook something for him for supper, make sure he takes his meds, and do a little surface-type cleaning that doesn't mean moving things around, i'd be glad to pay. but this is just crazy. no wonder he's resentful. and it took me 3 months to find her. she's got a good heart, good energy, wants to be helpful, the schedule works, she's honest and smart. but good heavens this isn't working, and we're going to have to make it work anyway til we can get a placement for him. there's a shortage of caregivers. and she seems to want to do *for* him instead of doing things that support him doing *for himself*. it would be easier to do it myself, only i can't bear him, so there's that. i guess i should keep in mind, however bad this is, it's better than me doing it. what a lousy standard."," oh and get this: she told me the other day his knives are dangerous because they are dull. today my daughter found, soaking in the sink, the blades from the blender; she used it and left it soaking. he could have put his hand in there.

"dad passed recently and im cleaning his den today. im realising that his dementia was much worse than i ever imagined. there were times when he looked like he was thinking intensely and solving the world's problems. maybe that should have been a sign for help. like alot of old guys he had to always be tough and never admit he had a problem. in fact sometimes he would get really ticked if i tried to help too much. used to be he got ticked if i tried to help at all. but watching him try to stand with his pd and look like he was about to fall i couldnt help it. he tried his best to act like nothing was wrong but of course it was pretty obvious.  later he would let me help him up and help him balance. its not about ego or saving face its about being safe.it's hard to talk about one issue and not the whole package but will try. my dad had things he forgot he had. and things stuck in drawers. he would say he didnt want to do something. if i tried to get him to listen to audible he would just say maybe later. i think he was embarrased that he couldnt remember how. and thats not a problem. i never minded showing him every day.so, to keep from rambling.take what they say with a grain of salt. try and peek inside and make it as easy as possible. always be willing to do it for them. make up a good excuse to get tat audible started, show em that book they like. start it and then check on em and make sure all is ok. understad that theyre probaby not going to tell you the entire truth so look for signs. like my dad they dont want you to know theres a problem. put yourself in their shoes and think about what they face, what are the challenges and frustrations? most of us just think of ourselves as us. we dont always notice how we degrade or our issues. maybe the changes are so gentle until say you cant button a button w/out alot of trouble. theres a feeling of losing yourself and losing self sufficiency. you dont want to let on and hpe no one notices.what i sincerely wish is to find a way to touch their hearts and say 'its ok, im here to help you'. they dont have to hide it, or worry or feel bad. maybe i assume too much based on my experience.  if someone who loves you is caring for you, let them in and let them help. to me the important thing is to enjoy life as uch as you can. if you're taking care of someone youlove then the thing is making them as happy and confortable as lossible and enjoy your tie with them. too many of us learn thru experience. maybe its out there already but a book about how to care for a loved one when you're a family member.my folks are gone now. i will always miss them. i learned by experience and wish with all my heart that i had known certain things in the beginning. if you think you understand it all, trust me, you dont. read, find someone to talk with, watch videos. get involved, get your elder involved. my mom made me promise to never put her or dad in a home. that never happened. mom passed in the doctors office and i held her hand. i wasnt there when dad passed in the hospital. but earlier in the day i held his hand and told him i loved him.  he passed peacefully. for better or worse my watch and duty is done. for those still going may god bless and keep you."," i hear you! it's hard for me, the sole caregiver 24/7 to really step back and see how bad my elder has gotten. if you don't drive, your never gonna get lost. if you can't walk well, your not gonna wander off. so i know i am fooling myself about how far gone they really are. and if that is the case, how can i expect my siblings to understand it. he looks the same, he is sitting in his usual chair, he is holding the newspaper as usual, so they would never really know he can't put a shirt on any more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q8ytcl/dad_thoughts/,Dad thoughts
"hi everyone, my dad had vp shunt surgery last june due to hydrocephalus. he had history with lung cancer on 2018 but the doctors managed to take the cancer out and he did chemo until 2019. his last pet scan was clear. he did mri and ct scan multiple times before and after the surgery and everything went well until 2 weeks after. he started to have problems with his short term memory, like asking the same question twice in 10 mins, he cant find things that should be familiar to him, and he had the urges to pee (5-8 times) every night.when i asked about this to the doctor (because i suspected that my dad got vascular dementia but im not sure since i just read it on the internet), he said its too soon to diagnose. the doctor said it could be the side effect of having brain surgery. im studying abroad, and bcs my semester break was over, i had to leave my family on the end of june. since then, my dad’s conditions keep declining. he struggles to walk, he couldn’t remember the lyrics of his favorite song, and sometimes he said things that doesnt make sense. we didnt know then that the cancer is back. so i made my dad go to physiotherapy, hoping he‘ll get better soon. fast forward to august, my mom told me that my dad didnt get any better. his memory got worse, and he didn’t want to eat. so i decided to take a semester break and go back home. it broke my heart to see my dad got a lot skinnier and his memory deteriorated.so my mom and i decided to brought him back to the hospital because he didn’t eat much. at this stage, my dad was still communicating but he got aggressive and angry towards everyone, and he seemed like he didn’t understand whats happening around him. he only wanted to go home. so the doctor gave the order to get my dad mri scan. it turns out that the lung cancer is back and it already spread to his brain. the doctor said it is stage 4 and there is no chance for my dad to get better. the doctor only recommended my dad to get chemo radiation to slow the dementia down. after the 8th radiation, he got a lot weaker and he got a seizure (this was his 3rd seizure since april 2021) then my mom, my brother and i decided to bring my dad home and to try give him the best care we can. his dementia progressed really fast to the point of he cant even get out of bed and he have trouble swallowing. he use tube to eat and take medications. in just one month, my dad, that was still able to joke around with me even it didn’t make any sense, is now bedbound and talks only when he feel disturbed. i dont know how to cope with this. i talked to my bf and my friends, but i dont feel like they understand. its like saying goodbye to my dad in pieces and it’s really hard. my dad is physically still here but he’s actually not. my dad that i adore is not here anymore and it hurts. the doctor said he would probably have two to six months left. and it feels like a ticking bomb and it drives me crazy everytime i think about it. sorry this post is super long, i feel like this community would understand me better.  i hope everyone is doing well. thankyou", i see this post is 6 months old. i just want to give you a big virtual hug. you are not alone. i hope you're doing as well as can be expected in your journey with your father.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q8nm86/my_dad_diagnosed_with_cancer_and_dementia/,My dad diagnosed with cancer and dementia

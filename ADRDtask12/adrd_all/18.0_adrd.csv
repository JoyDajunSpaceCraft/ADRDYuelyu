she was his entire support network. when they divorced a few moths after he was diagnosed he spent 2 years driving around the southeast meeting up with old fiends. a few times he got lost and was out of communication with me and my brothers. i was eventually able to convince him to move into a semi assisted living facility.  he‚Äôs been in this place for 6 months but has not been able to connect with anyone.   i‚Äôm thinking about starting a dating profile for him. is it possible to date with alzheimer‚Äôs?, i look into day programs. thank you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/km26s2/my_dad_was_diagnosed_and_his_wife_left_him/,My dad was diagnosed and his wife left him

"mum is 77, her formal diagnosis is recent but i‚Äôve known for years. ever since dad died ten years ago, i‚Äôve not let her go more than a couple of days without seeing me, and whenever i‚Äôd go i would spend the night. i feel that this whole post should be about her but as an aside this has meant personal and professional sacrifice to me, i am jealous of the family and life my sister has made for herself some distance away, but hey, its my mum - i regret nothing. she‚Äôs got gradually worse with time as you‚Äôd expect and has now reached the stage where i don‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs safe unless i (or more recently and rarely my sister) is there to keep an eye on her. nevermind the lack of stimulus without a carer around, she won‚Äôt (can‚Äôt) go out nor coordinate her own recreation or meals, nothing to fill her day unless we fill it for her. this escalation in what she needs has been accompanied by decreased awareness of her surroundings, she is always desperate to go out, recognises her home to a degree but not that it is hers, and will stay up all night wanting to ‚Äúgo home‚Äù, there is an element of sundowning here. on multiple occasions she‚Äôs hopped out windows to escape and i have been fortunate that she was found by kindly strangers - there is now technology in place to address this happening again. all the same i‚Äôm not comfortable leaving her and so.....i don‚Äôt. i think she still recognises me but i see how she is with strangers and it‚Äôs the same as she is with me. ‚Äúdo you know who i am?‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my friend‚Äù üòûabout a month ago i arranged for her to go into a care home and ultimately wasted everyone‚Äôs time as the moment came and i sat in the car with her for hours but could not do it. i decided to put it off until after her birthday (done) then after christmas and maybe when covid restrictions change. right now at point of admission she will have to self isolate for 14 days. i reached my limit again in recent days and booked her in again, she‚Äôs set to start her 14 days on december 29th. but as i write this she‚Äôs happy as larry, sitting watching the telly whilst we have our dinner, and i am afraid again i can‚Äôt do it. i feel like i am trading my own misery for hers and conspiring behind her back to toss her in this place so i don‚Äôt have to do it any longer. i feel like the best thing for her is for me to move in here and care for her until she dies, i feel like that is better for her what‚Äôs on offer at any care home, not least because of the 14 days she‚Äôll have to spend in her cell before she is allowed into the general population. i don‚Äôt want to be the person who declares when is the last night my mum spends in her own home. at the same time i know i can‚Äôt keep this up and i know she wouldn‚Äôt want me to. i‚Äôm fortunate to have understanding bosses but i know i am not doing my usual 100% and there are limits.please somebody, i just don‚Äôt know what to do üò¢"," one of my mother's wishes was to stay in her home and i promised i would do that.  until i couldn't.  until her home wasn't safe for her.  until her home was just a cage, really.  she was lost and alone except for me and some family and confused and struggling.  we found an amazing assisted living facility that is like a home.  comfortable with living areas and a kitchen that is like a home, not a 'facility"".  they decorate for all the holidays and have parties and entertainment and events (pre-covid).  there are people there doing things and she has friends and the care of skilled staff/nurses/care givers who know how her medicines interact, how to handle illnesses and the decline that has happened, how to navigate the healthcare system, how to now bathe and dress and take care of her every need.  she is treated like a princess and is given three beautiful meals a day surrounded by friends in a calm and comfortable environment.  and, i have my mother/daughter relationship back, which was the greatest part of all.  at first i was over there almost every day.  visiting, joining in the crafts and entertainment.  but slowly, over time, i realized she was just fine without me.  she was happy and well cared for.  and once the covid restrictions set it and we could only visit through a pane of glass it was beyond reassuring that she was safe and well cared for.  it was the best choice i ever made and i know it has enhanced my mom's life as well as my own.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kicgue/i_feel_like_its_not_okay_to_put_mum_in_care/,I feel like it‚Äôs not okay to put mum in care

"**tl;dr** dealing with immense drama from my difficult fil, mil and a gmil with alzheimer's in the span of three years has taken an incredible toll on my mental health. feeling incredibly guilty.hi everyone - i just joined this community! currently, my husband (35/m) and i (35/f) are taking care of his grandmother (gmil), who lives with us full time. we think she is entering the last stages of her disease, but we're not sure. there are things that she does that still surprise us. for instance, she will shuffle around and seems like she can't move around when we need her to (like changing diapers and taking a bath - she hates baths), but when the cat is merely just sitting in her room, she has no problem getting up and chasing it out of the room. i just chalked it up to alzheimer's. i know that motor skills comes and goes.i'm feeling really lost, guilty, and scared. the backstory is kind of long, as i can't talk about my gmil without going into a little bit about my mil.just for context, my gmil has a hx of schizophrenia, bipolar, congestive heart failure, strokes and alzheimer's.i have no context of what my gmil was like *before* her disease. according to my husband, she was really ""ghetto"", like chasing men out of her homes with a cast iron pan and she would get really nasty with her language. she grew up in chicago, went to a mental institution when she was 14. her mom decided it was not the right fit and pulled her out, but then she got married shortly after with a gentleman that was at least 10 years her senior. he was a really good man, but because of her abusive behavior, she drove him out of the home. she has several children, all from separate men, all with significant mental health issues because gmil severely abused them when they were young. she would lock them up in the closet or shut them in a clothes drawer for hours while she goes out and parties and does drugs. (as a result, my mil has bpd, her other kids are alcoholics, drug addicts or are institutionalized or in prison).she somehow made it out to california, where we are. at this point, gmil and my mil had not been in contact, and she was being taken care of by my husband's cousin. she had just begun entering dementia (parkinson's, i think), and was extremely volatile and violent, and she continued to abuse and manipulate my husband's cousin. she would rile him up, call the cops or aps on him and get him in trouble. eventually my mil took over, which was a disaster as she has a lot of unmanaged, out of control mental health issues herself. put the abuser and the abusee together and it is not a good situation. mil would claim she is taking care of gmil, but gmil's apartment was always a mess and smelled. we noticed that she wasn't being taken care of the way she needed to because mil was dealing with her own issues. being with her abuser constantly triggered her, rendering her useless. but this was the situation she was willing to be in because mil wanted live rent-free on gmil's section 8 housing without having to do the work. she couldn't be on ihss payroll because she has a workers comp case, and would lose that if she started working again. this was illegal, as she was claiming to be gmil's live-in attendant. but that wasn't the reason why we moved them. we moved gmil and mil out of their unit because mil was stirring shit with the neighbors and the neighbors had threatened her. we were worried about the safety of gmil especially because she isn't able to take care of herself.about a year into taking care of her, my mil forced my husband to quit his job and take care of his grandmother so she wouldn't have to do it anymore because she's always exhausted (they have a codependent relationship that he's working on breaking away from, as his mom has bpd and he was gaslighted, manipulated and abused his entire life to be her servant).which is how we ended up living full time with gmil. our wedding was almost ruined because of mil, we didn't get to go on our honeymoon, go on any dates or do anything for ourselves because we spent all of time taking care of gmil and mitigating the situation with my bpd mil and npd fil (which is another story, but can happily say we are at a point where we're nc with them...for the most part. we're working on it.).i had a good relationship with his gmil, and i was responsible for cooking her meals and feeding her while my husband takes on the more difficult task of changing her diapers, showers and cleaning her up. basically, the dirty work. gmil always referred to me as ""barbara"", her sil. in the beginning i would correct her but gave up because it was harmless - or so i thought. little did i know that she was building a case about me in her head because she was comparing me to her equally as volatile sil. apart from that, we never really had a close relationship, but we got along well and was hugging each other and spending lots of time together.however, things are changing again and it's difficult to tell whether it's the alzheimer's or if it's her personality because there are times where she will purposely rile things up. for example, one of the things that she does on purpose (because she's done this type of stuff even before she had alzheimer's), if we don't take her to the bathroom right away after she demands it, she will reach into her diaper, scoop out her poop and throw it/wipe it/smear it on stuff. (my gmil and mil usually, according to my husband, the types who will do whatever it takes so the attention is on them at all times).for some reason, she only listens to my husband. he's the only one that's been able to calm her down. she doesn't listen to me at all, and will get in my face if i ask her to do something as simple as laying down and relaxing. this makes it incredibly difficult for my husband, as he cannot be there all the time to give her instructions.i can pinpoint the time where i started to lose empathy for her (i hate saying this so much. i have felt like i have lost the ability to empathize because i had to deal with mil, fil and gmil in a short span of three years, and i hate that i let them take that ability away from me). i remember going up to her and giving her a hug because she was feeling agitated - something i always did and it worked. however, she got really close to my face, accusing me of having the worst breath, then started posturing toward me as if she was going to hit me. i backed up. i tried to find out what was upsetting her, but the more i responded to her, the more she postured. according to my husband, this is the type of drama she likes and she will do everything the can to rile you up.this was successful, i'm ashamed to admit. after that, she accused me of sneaking into her room and pulling down her diapers, laughing at her and abusing her. i started to distance myself, and i'm sure she's picked up on it so she amps up her behavior. several times, she would cry hysterically to my husband that he was not to leave her alone with me and that she's rather die than be taken care of by me. because of covid, my husband and i seldom to go out together, but especially because someone needs to be with gmil. he has left me with her on several occasions, all of which she crawled over the babygate in her room as a desperate attempt to escape (installed for her safety, because she wanders and is a fall risk), all of which surprised us because she had difficulty walking. she continues to be confident that i physically abuse her.i lost it and yelled at her after the umptheeth time she tried crawling over the babygate, and of course, checking for injuries after she tumbled backwards. i told her to shutup and listen for once. i told her that there are absolutely reasons for me to be upset (my gmil and mil are the type who won't take responsibility for their actions, and won't understand *why* people get mad at them after they've repeatedly poked the bear). i told her the reason my husband is exhausted is because she won't listen and if she cared about him at all, she would just listen and not create a mess. i don't feed her anymore, i don't interact with her other than to say ""hi"" and ""good morning."" i let my husband take up the majority of the work, and i still cook her meals. i'm having difficulty sleeping now because of all of this stress but also, we've unofficially fell into this sleeping routine. the reason i wake up around 2 or 3 now and can't go back to sleep is because my husband is not able to sleep until very late just from the utter exhaustion from taking care of his grandma. so when he sleeps, i started to stay up to mitigate situations (she'll get up and yell for my husband and slam things for attention) so that my husband can get some sleep.i realize that my actions are very, very wrong and my anger is misplaced, but i can't get back to being close with my gmil again after she tried to manipulate the situation. i don't want to get involved with the police or aps, especially because i know i haven't done anything - plus that would be wasting their time and money (i used to work with aps, so i know how the system works).what i'm really mad at is my mil for dumping gmil into our lives. we just got married last september and we spent out first year dealing with insane drama on top of covid. i'm thankful that my husband always defends me, and that he isn't guilting me or forcing me to be close to his grandma again because he understands her behaviors. but we are missing out on a lot of milestones because of this.i don't know if we're nearing the end and we have to transition her. i feel incredibly guilty if we transition her because my husband made a promise to her that he would take care of her until the end (dude, my husband has a heart of gold, i am so lucky)...but i don't know how much longer i can take this. i'm going to my parents' for the weekend to take a break, but i feel guilty because i'm leaving my husband behind to deal with his grandma.we've tried finding friends or another caregiver so we can go out for dates, but they all resulted in her being wildly combative. that, and we don't have the money. i got laid off this year and the only income we're relying on is my ever-dwindling unemployment and my husband's job.i don't know what to do anymore. i feel incredibly guilty, but i feel angry. i don't know if i'll ever be close to gmil again. i also have a difficult time not taking things personally. i'm a social worker and setting boundaries at work when i was working was easy because most of the boundaries were already set for us, but this doesn't mean i'm well-equipped for life or well-adjusted. i'm still a hot mess.if you made it this far, i commend you. this was really long, but it was three years worth of shit bottled up inside of me. thank you for taking the time to read it, and i apologize if i am all over the place."," to add, caregivers need help, time off and care as well. it takes so much out of a regular caregiver and adding all of that on top makes it even more work. yes your dh has a heart of pure gold! but as newlyweds you also have to have time to establish this new life together. it's so important for your future. is there any other family member that you can trade off with? maybe 2 weeks to a month here or there? i can't express how important it is for you both to have breaks or you risk burnout (i'm experiencing some of it as well). keep your communication as open as you can, keep supporting each other as best you can. you've got this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kfmod9/feeling_guilty/,Feeling guilty/

my grandad (74m) has had early signs of dementia for as long as i (27f) can remember.what began as general forgetfulness has progressed into something a lot more serious. he is now regressing a lot into the past and is unable to remember if he has eaten or washed etc on his bad days.on his more lucid days he is aware that he is unwell and he often gets upset which is heartbreaking. his mother and father both died of dementia in their mid 70's so he has seen the decline first hand.my nan has told him that she must take his car keys away and he has begged her not to.he says that driving is the last bit of independence he has left.ofcourse he should not be on the road and we have made that very clear to my nan but my grandad sobs and begs her not to take his keys.this causes my nan a lot of distress.  has anyone else had to deal with this? what is the best way forward? ofcourse we will not be letting him drive anywhere (and he hasn't driven for months and months) but can we just take his car &amp; keys and just not say anything?, i have heard families say that they asked the doctor to deliver the news.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kbxljk/he_shouldnt_be_driving_but_its_all_he_has/,He shouldn't be driving but it's all he has

"hi.  i really don't know where to post this so i'm hoping maybe someone on this forum may have some thoughts as to whether there is anything we can do about what's going on with my father right now.  he has undiagnosed but very obvious dementia that has progressed over the past two years.  he has good days and bad days, is still mostly able to have conversations, knows his family, remembers his phone number, but on his bad days he won't bathe, won't remember why he has to go to the doctor if we're trying to get him up and out and will keep asking -- that kind of thing.  anyway, he came down with both covid and pneumonia and we had no choice but to have him hospitalized.  he's been there since sunday and it's been pretty awful trying to keep updated and keep him reassured.  he doesn't really understand what's going on or where he is.yesterday we learned that the hospital has physically restrained his hands because they say he keeps pulling out his nasal oxygen canula.  he claims it keeps falling out.  i do tend to believe the nurse but he is becoming more and more agitated and distressed at having his hands restrained and after finally speaking with someone last night, we learned that he will most likely be on oxygen and thus have the restraints for possibly a week or longer.  it's obviously hard for them to say how long it will take to get him back to normal oxygen levels.  from what i'm reading online, it does seem they've made the correct choice between this and chemical sedation.  when they first moved him up to the room from the er they did have someone in the room with him ""watching"" him to ensure he wouldn't get out of the bed (he had tried several times) but now that they have him restrained she's not there anymore.  we asked if the watcher could handle the issue instead of the restraints but were told it's no longer possible.  we really didn't get a straight answer as to why - first we were just told no, she's not available, then we were told it's a covid risk (why wasn't it a covid risk before).  has anyone ever had experience with anything like this?  do we just let it be and hope that it doesn't cause my father to devolve into delirium and or otherwise have a negative impact on his recovery or mental state?  does anyone have any suggestions about how we should proceed if we want to try to push for the watcher to be put back in the room instead or seek another alternative?  of course, one of my biggest concerns is not being seen as too pushy or aggressive with the health care workers who are caring for him, as we are not allowed to be there and i don't want anyone to take anything out on him because they don't like what we do or say.  any advice would be very greatly appreciated.  thank you."," i would take your father home, if some kind of home care is possible. you can have him on oxygen at home, if you have the funds. rent a hospital bed, rent a tank. just weigh the risks of anyone else getting sick. if that's not a viable option, try to volunteer at the hospital to be at his side.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kae9wb/dad_with_dementia_in_hospital_with_covid/,Dad with Dementia in Hospital with Covid

"tldr:trying to live life while taking care of a parent with dementia feels like too much sometimes. a little over a year ago my mother was diagnosed with ""mild cognitive impairment"" and ""likely alzheimer's"". i'm her primary caretaker while working 40 hours a week, training a few nights a week, and trying to have a little bit of a social life. (i have two other people that help me but most of the weight is on me since she live with me) since daylight savings it's been getting darker earlier, my mother has been sundowning real intensely and it's a metric fuck ton of work to keep her okay. i'm exhausted and just want a break from this awful disease. in the past year decline has been evident. long before dr appointments for it, she wasn't the same person i've always known. i don't want children and it feels like i'm stuck with a child i never asked for. i harbor feelings of resentment and the feeling of being stuck in my life and held back because i have this huge responsibility dragging me down. i see her every day but that woman is not my mother. she's just not really there anymore. there are glimpses here and there, but that's it. lost my father just a few years ago and i'm sick of losing my family, at least when my dad died he was still 100% mentally there. but i feel like i lose my mother little by little every day and it's been that way for years now. i'm tired, angry, sad, depressed, anxious, and just fucking spent right now as i type this. i don't really know what i'm looking for in this post, if it should be in a different sub let me know and i'll remove it. the holidays suck and i miss the warmth of my family during these times."," you're not alone, and the job you are doing is a blessing and a gift to your mom, but is a herculean task that is probably close to impossible in the current world without help.  ultimately, you are hurting yourself and you will eventually become unable to help your mom, or yourself.my mother knew she would get the disease some day and she fought it for years.  (she literally signed up for a long-term care insurance policy in her 40's for that reason!)  we talked about it a lot.  it terrified her to be put into a memory care facility, but eventually i put her in one.  (i was super scared to do it, but felt i had no option.)  it was the absolute best decision i ever made both for her and for us.  it radically improved the quality of her life, and the care she received.  the people there were patient and caring, and they understood all the things we have to learn thru hard experience.  i believe they extended her life by years. (on a side note, my mom was in a senior care home before that with my dad, and after he died, she was warehoused by the staff.  it was disgusting and criminal, and i'll never forgive them.  the moment i finally realized what they were doing, we moved her to a dedicated memory care facility.)i visited her once or twice a week; and we always had a great time.  i'd take her to her doctor visits and we'd hang out at the beach together.  i'd visit the home when they would hold parties and activities.  it was awesome.  i know i visited my mom more than most families visited their loved ones, and sadly for them, i believe it made a huge difference.  there is no way you can provide the kind of care and attention she needs at home while working a full-time job.  it's past time for you to get some help.  the resources have already been mentioned, but here's a [power point]( from an amazing seminar that i attended early on.  it helped me a lot in understanding the disease and how i could help my mom.  i wish only the best for you and your mother.  don't isolate yourself because of this disease.  i know how private the struggle can feel.  get the care you need.  share your feelings with others who have been there.  the alzheimers community is a huge family of impacted adults with a lot of experience and helpful advice - and assistance too.  the disease is our bond.  take advantage of it because you'll be amazed at how not-alone you are.  love and blessings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ka77nz/advice_shared_experience_i_feel_alone_in_this/,Advice?

"my husband and i are planning a ""sponsored walk"" to raise funds for alzheimer's research uk. we've set up the justgiving page and shared the link with friends and family. are there any tips you can share to encourage ppl to donate without coming across as harassing them?!"," sharing the link in twitter or facebook, where it's available for people to see, doesn't strike me as harassing. when people email or message me directly for fundraising stuff, on the other hand, it makes me want to block them. that's more like walking up to someone face to face and asking for their money. it's confrontational and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, like they view me more as a wallet for their causes than a friend.it's an awkward situation because this is a cause that's important to you, and it's valid. but everyone's got their own budget for charities and their own causes that are personal to them, and those aren't likely to change because you're doing a walk. but if they see the link on your social media they may donate because you're important to them.  you may have to just accept though that you will be the ones donating to this cause and they will donate to others; they aren't obligated to give to your causes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/k79iev/advice_on_fundraising_please/,Advice on fundraising please

"let me start off with saying, i am incredibly thankful that i managed to meet my great grandmother. i'm 20 years old and not many people can say that. i haven't really confirmed with anyone, but i'm more than certain that she's nearing or already at the end stage of alzheimer's. she can't speak anymore, doesn't recognize anyone, she has a full time caretaker and has trouble with eating and drinking. she was recently hospitalized because of severe dehydration and has been sleeping longer (17 hours). i know she's nearing the end, she's 95, it's to be expected but i want to make her smile and have at least one good day, even if she won't remember. so i have some questions; and they'll probably come off a bit ignorant so i'm sorry in advance. &amp;#x200b;1. what's the thought process for people with alzheimer's? i know that they can't remember anything or anyone past a certain stage, but i want to see a light in her eyes and i want to make her laugh( by doing something funny, not a joke but maybe a funny dance, or something christmas related because of the pretty lights)2. i've been sleuthing this subreddit a bit and there's a bit of a 'disagreement' of sorts when it comes to people with alzheimer's refusal to eat, some say they don't force them since the body knows what it needs nearing the end of life, and others suggest ensure and other high calorie drinks. i just want to know if it hurts, like maybe not hunger pangs or being thirsty since she doesn't drink or eat unless given food and even then she stops when she doesn't want anymore, but i don't know, is there some kind of pain?3. this is one i don't think there's an answer for but, does she know she's gonna go?  like, while she's laying in her bed, eyes closed, not really sleeping yet, does she know? i don't want her to feel alone or scared. i know she's 95 and well it's kind of expected, but if she didn't have alzheimer's then i think she'd come to peace with it, but there's this feeling in my chest every time i think that she doesn't know and she feels herself fading and is scared and can't really tell anyone. 4. does anyone else feel guilty? i think about all the times when i was in high school that my mom would tell me to go visit, which i did like once, but she lived in her house all alone for years, we gave her puzzles and crosswords and bought her these i guess knitting things she really liked? but as i'm reading the causes of alzheimer's and that engagement with people helps prevent it, as well as physical mobility. i can't help but think of her just sitting at home, all alone watching tv and i feel like i could have prevented it. and i'm just so sorry, i want to apologize to her, and rationally i know it's not all on my shoulders, i was a 17 year old kid, where were my parents, her kids (my uncle and aunts), my grandma interacted with her a lot. i know that, but i still feel very guilty. &amp;#x200b;i guess that sums it up, i might edit this again if i have any more questions, but any response is appreciated!"," i‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs in hospice but they usually supply you with oxygen, morphine, and other drugs that are to help ensure she‚Äôs comfy without a doubt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/k5f9s6/great_grandma/,[deleted by user]

"i live with my grandmother and she's 81.  she's okay throughout most of the day and some nights (not all) she comes out of her room around 1:00 am and she's very insistent that she's just getting up because she chose to.  i don't believe this and even if i did, it's not normal considering she's usually in bed around 8:30.  sometimes she wont even sleep 3 hours before she's up and wandering. she doesn't try to leave the house, but paces aimlessly around the house or makes coffee and sits and drinks.  she is an early riser... at the earliest 0400am because that's the time the newspaper arrives, but i like to  believe her normal rising time is around 0545.just now she came out talking about the ""mexicans"" and it seemed like she was trying to describe to me a mariachi troop. she said she spoke with them on the 2nd floor and we live in the one story. i reminded her that he live in a one-story and was telling her that these episodes are precisely why the family is worried.  she told me to not make a big deal out of it and immediately went to bed. very dismissively and clearly agitated. it's as though she's aware, but unable to distinguish her dreams from reality.  now she's done this before, but sometimes she'll claim i stole her stuff or just come sit and chat at such a late hour about very random scenarios and stories... or like she's continuing a conversation we never had.  i'm not sure what to do honestly. she's fine throughout the day-- completely lucid but occasionally we have these nights and i do my best to accommodate since i typically work late, but my presumption is early signs of alzheimer's. i do believe she is genetically disposed to get it.  i am by no means an expert, but this behavior is startling and worries me. i'd like to do something if anything to help.  i know about keeping her active throughout the day so that she sleeps heavily and soundly and it works somedays, but should i tell her doctor? it's so bizarre that sundowning is phenomenon because throughout the day, she seems completely normal-- sharp even.  at night, it's often different."," outside of meds and what other people suggested you can try a weighted blanket, cbd oil and music therapy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/k54n09/sundowning/,Sundowning?

"my grandfather, popi as he is known to all his grandkids, was diagnosed with alzheimers almost 2 years ago. i was very sad when i found out, he has been a huge part of my life.  he was put on some meds that help for a while but they no longer are working (which we knew would eventually happen). know he often doesn't recognize me or other family members, but he does know us when we tell him who we are.  the hardest part for me has been watching him lose his confidence.  he use to be very confident and very handy. he fixed everything around the house for his wife, except for the cooking and gardening that was her domain! now for that last year or so he can't do anything, its really hard to watch, and i can see it frustrates him.  i just want to talk about him though, and the person he was, cause he was and still is an amazing person.  he was always very loving. he had two daughters and loved them more than anything.  he also worked for almost 30 years as a firefighter working tirelessly to help his community and support his family.  he was the type of guy were if you knew him your life was instantly better for it, and if you proved to him you were a good person he would do almost anything for you. but he wouldn't put up with bullshit either, and he would call you out on your bullshit.  he was a lieutenant in the fire dept and was one of the most well respected lieutenants because of his character.  but the most important thing to him was family.  he loved his family, and would do anything for us. growing up he loved being with me and his other grandkids, we always had a good time with him and he always knew how to make us laugh. he also some how managed to attend almost every academic, athletic, and other extracurricular event all of his six grandkids participated in. i'm pretty sure he learned how to clone himself and his wife! he also taught me so much! he taught me how to paint a room, how to swim, how to fix almost anything in the house. but he also taught me through just being him how to be the man i wanted to be, how to treat other people with respect, and how to enjoy life.  he use to always say ""what a country huh"" when we were just sitting around enjoying a day by his pool.  i always loved that saying of his, because it showed how much he appreciated life and didn't take anything for granted. he knew there were problems in this country (usa, for clarification) but that fact that he could just sit around his pool on a beautiful summer day with his family made him happier than anything.  one of my other fond memories was from when i was in college. during my second year in college i had a pretty significant mental breakdown.  i realized what i was studying was not what i wanted to do and i got very anxious, i was sure what to do. i got very stressed out and was keeping it all to myself. i finally talked to my parents and went home for about a week to figure everything out.  during that week i had talked to lots of friends and family and they all asked me about what was going on. when i saw my grandfather i told him that i was switching majors and started talking about it a little more and he stopped me and asked are you happy now. i told him i was and he said well thats all that matters, and then we just talked about other things. and i loved that, it showed he cared because if i had said no he would have sat there with me and helped me any way he could, but i said i was so he knew i probably didn't want to keep talking about what was making me unhappy before, so instead we just talked like we always did. the same thing happened a few years later when i finally came out as gay to my family. i was a little worried about telling him because i just didn't know how he would react, but again he just said are you happy. and when i left later that day after telling him he told me he loved me, like he always did. as the alzheimers progresses i just try to remember all the great memories i have had with him. i see him as much as i can and cherish the time i get to spend with him.  and if you read all of this thanks for that!"," sending you hugs. hang onto all those memories, he sounds like a wonderful man.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/k4xhdx/post_about_my_grandfather/,Post about my grandfather.
"my mom finally saw a doctor about memory concerns after a couple years of reluctance. tomorrow is the post-testing/post-mri consultation, where we may (or may not) get a diagnosis.i'm concerned that, because a combination of not remembering/not recognizing her symptoms and denial, my mom would take a diagnosis really hard. she's been a little paranoid about family noticing potential symptoms for a while, so she might not have anyone she'll feel comfortable talking to.are there any support groups of alzheimer's patients that she'd be able to join? i found a couple message boards, but i think meetings where she can talk to people (via video chat or in-person) would be better for her."," if you're looking for alzheimer's association support groups, the best way to go about it is to call the 24/7 helpline at 800-272-3900. live clinicians answer the calls (they are also great to talk to about any and all concerns of dementia, like behaviors or any other resource help!). you tell them where you're located and they get you in contact with your local chapter. all of their support groups across the country are virtual right now through zoom. tell the clinician you're looking for early stage programming or early stage support groups/social engagement in your local chapter! you can also explain any other issues that you're concerned about with your mom even without the proper diagnosis. &#x200b;you can also find it by going to [alz.org]( \> your chapter/find your local chapter > and put in where you are by zip code. once you do that, navigate to the ""your chapter"" tab on the home page > helping you > support groups. i always say though that the 24/7 helpline is best because some local chapters may not update their pages consistently, so that is the straightest way to get in touch with a staff person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/k4vas4/looking_for_patient_support_groups/,Looking for patient support groups

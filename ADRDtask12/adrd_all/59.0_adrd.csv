"i don’t think this sub is appropriate to share my full story, but i am 43/f and have two parents who are physically and mentally ill, and a disabled brother a couple years older than me. my extended family has suspected my mom has been in early stages of dementia for several years now, but she avoids doctors so hasn’t been diagnosed. even if she does have it, i’m guessing it’s still early stages as any stories i could tell about her aren’t nearly to the degree of severity many of you have shared.all that being said, i visited my parents and brother after a somewhat long absence yesterday and it’s apparent that their entire living situation is declining and somewhat rapidly. i just need general help talking through their specific situation to prepare myself for what is still to come. since i believe my mom’s dementia is still rather mild, i feel like i should discuss in more detail on another sub. i tried finding “elderly/elder care” subs but they don’t appear to be active. are there any other subs you have found helpful? if not subs, what agency could i contact via phone to get some support and advice? i don’t want to tie up dementia/alzheimer’s advocates as i know there are others in much greater need than me. tia for any leads. i am in the pacific nw, usa if that makes a difference.", the county she resides in has aging services. they are a wealth of information,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sxbnfh/i_just_need_help_emotionally_overwhelmed/,I just need help.

hello i'm gonna get right to it i've been a live in caregiver for my grandmother with dementia for 6 years i had poa when i moved in and my aunt demanded she have it because i was too young (i am 27 now) so she took over but my aunt and grandmother would get into arguments and kick my aunt out so i would be stuck doing the bills until they made up. my grandmothers condition has worsened to the point where my aunt wanted to get hospice involved (she wishes to die at home) but a couple days after we talked about it my aunt had 2 mini strokes and 2 massive ones and has now passed away. my grandmother has pretty much disowned everyone in the family except me. my question is should i pursue trying to get poa again or is it possible with her condition? or should i try to take guardianship of her and her estate? or should i just leave it all alone and ride it out?," have just been through this in the worst possible way. i had poa for my mother but my brother was her executor. i did it all - i paid for everything, my partner and i sold our home and moved countries to look after mum. we paid for all her fees, medical, legal bills (we took her separated husband to court), clothes shoes, everything you can think of for 9 years. my brother, niece and nephew and even my son paid nothing, did nothing, were happy to let us do it all. the second mum died it was all on! i dared to ask for a little bit back from her estate and i got hammered. the grandchildren were mums recipients from her will and we got nothing so i asked to reach a settlement. nothing could repay us the loss of our home or the mortgage we now have late in life just to be here to look after her but my partner gave up so much i thought we would ask for a little something. we were accused of bank fraud, theft and medical coercion. we couldn't afford a lawyer whereas they could use mums entire estate to fight us. i proved it was my brother who took the money from the bank and i showed receipts for everything for the nine years so no theft and i had to get medical councils involved but i could prove no medical coercion. but i couldn't afford to fight and we lost everything. my take from all this? get advice but personally i will never again take on poa. never. it has a huge responsibility and you know if there is even a dollar involved that people are going to walk all over you to get it. seek good legal advice but i seriously don't believe that poa should ever be thrust onto anyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sx8jlj/poa_or_guardianship/,POA or Guardianship
"my mom’s memory decline started slowly and has been accelerating more noticeably recently. complications: i live several states away, so i am not able to be present in any daily kind of way. everyone in the immediate family circle won’t touch it with a ten foot pole (there was one convo with dad in which he said he wants to “wait and see” what happens).  my siblings and i decided something has to change, so i agreed to press my dad on it (with sensitivity, of course). that will be later today. ugh.through some research i have found articles about addressing dementia with the actual parent who has it, but i can’t seem to find any advice about dealing with the *healthy* parent who is in denial, and how to sensitively tell them they need to get things going. living far away makes me feel pretty powerless, and yet also guilty for not being vocal sooner. thank for reading.", my dad refuses to see my mom's mental issues too so i know what you're going through. but at some point it will become undeniable and your dad will have to accept the situation. in the mean time maybe you can get together with likeminded family members and start coming up with a care plan for her when the time comes that she needs outside help. having a plan ready to go can ease the stress. having a clear path forward may also help your dad accept that your mom has memory problems. sometimes denial comes from not knowing what the   next step should be.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sx4s8r/when_the_healthy_parent_is_in_denial_about_the/,When the healthy parent is in denial about the one with dementia
"my grandmother is 87 years old and has had dementia since she was in her late 70s.  its progressively gotten worse over the last three years, and i am now her care giver.  my mother and i do all the work for her, including all meals, bathing, dressing, bathroom assistance.  some main struggles we have is that she never washes her hands, does not like to shower, and will eat constantly if there's any food around, shes also diabetic.  she doesnt treat my mother well at all, and calls my dad awful names some days. my mother experienced neglect and from what i understand, abuse from her as a child, and i never developed a strong relationship with her growing up partly because of that, and also i never felt a strong connection with her because she was scary and mean when i was a child (20yrs ago).   we have tried to put these life experiences behind us and focus on the present, and most days feel like we give everything we have.   i never expected living with my parents in my 30s helping with my grandmother, but this is the only option at the moment, and my parents never expected caring for her either in there late 60s and still not retired/ working full time.   the family has been making plans to move into a more affordable state.  we are currently living in ca and looking into tennesse, north carolina, florida etc.  grandma has no assets whatso ever, and receives medicaid.   what is the best state for living assistance homes that deal with dementia care for people with no money? at some point grandma will need 24hr care that i wont be able to provide. at this point, im afraid i'll be working and sending money to support my grandmother instead of having kids and family of my own."," i'm not positive, but i believe nj medicaid programs will cover assisted living after living in a facility for a set amount of time. i believe it's 2 years for most facilities, but this time frame is set by the facility.but the cost of living in nj is probably not any better than ca.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/swx9te/help_where_is_the_the_best_state_for_dementia/,Help.

"my father was diagnosed with dementia about 6 years ago, and the decline has been rapid. over the past few months, things have gotten much worse... he's losing his balance, pacing around the house nonstop for 10 hours a day, compulsively talking in gibberish... and worst of all, he now has a habit of going to the bathroom whenever and *wherever* he wants. until recently he was able to communicate that he needed to go, but that's no longer the case.i've been trying to convince my mom that it's time for onesies and diapers, but she disagrees, apparently wanting to spare him some dignity. he doesn't soil *himself*, but he soils every square inch of the floor in our home. at this point, she's mopping up after him multiple times a day, and wet-vaccuming the carpet in their room every morning. i wouldn't be surprised if she devotes 10-15 hours a week cleaning up his ""accidents,"" and when *she's* not home, the job falls onto my siblings and i to clean up the mess. at this point, i think it's fair to say that our patience is wearing thin with the situation. i tried talking to her about it today, but she's drawing the ""diaper line"" at him defecating in his pants. until then, she's not interested in going that route. i understand that cleaning up someone with a diaper is equally as difficult as mopping floors on a constant basis, but i feel like his current situation is even *less* dignified than wearing one. am i wrong in my logic? are there other steps or fixes to the situation aside from diapers? i moved back in with my parents (as did my siblings) specifically to help with my dad, but we're all hitting a breaking point now due to this."," i don’t think the want for continence aides is unreasonable. and it will definitely be needed sooner rather than later. you can also get discreet styles. i’ve worked in age care with dementia for years and the saying holds true, if there is a will there’s a way, a onesie isn’t going to stop access, he will find a way to it trust me. i’d suggest a 3-4hrly toileting schedule first. if he is regularly toileted then it should reduce accidents around the house. best of luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/swstn1/oh_boy_the_bathroom_problem_should_my_family/,Oh boy...

"the following quote is probably the key to treating alzheimer's disease:""the inflammatory mediator peroxynitrite, when generated in excess, may damage cells by oxidizing and nitrating cellular components. defense against this reactive species may be at the level of prevention of the formation of peroxynitrite, at the level of interception, or at the level of repair of damage caused by peroxynitrite.""nearly all the approved and prospective treatments for alzheimer's disease limit the production of peroxynitrite.  it is like turning down the faucet on a sink with a stopper, you are only slowing the sink from filling up.  on the other hand, if your turn down the faucet and partially lift up the stopper, you stabilize the amount of water in the sink.  in alzheimer's disease it is the difference between slowing down the progression of the disease and largely stabilizing it.if you combine conventional treatments for alzheimer's disease (such as aricept and namenda) that only slow down the formation of peroxynitrite with certain herbs that also scavenge and reverse part of the damage caused by peroxynitrite, the results are always better.[[there are currently two drug candidates for alzheimer's disease that inhibit, scavenge, and partially reverse the damage done by peroxynitrite.  one is trappsol cyclo which is now in a phase two clinical trial.  the other is anavex 2-73 which is in a phase 3 clinical trial.  the initial results are limited (especially for trappsol cyclo), but suggest that this approach to treating alzheimer's disease is very promising.

"hi everyone,me (21) and my parents (47 &amp; 49) have recently moved in with my grandpa (82) who has dementia, he is my dads dad and we made this decision due to the fact he could no longer live independently and would make frequent phone calls to us, a lot of the time at 3am demanding a ‘hot meal’ despite the time.i am not quite sure what stage he is at and i am wondering if anyone could help give a rough estimate, by using the symptoms i will list below:- appears to have little sense of danger anymore, in december he was wandering a busy road where cars were swerving to avoid hitting him and nobody stopped until one guy did and brought him home (we were not living with grandpa at the time, this was the catalyst)- some level of incontinence, he does not always pee himself, he has awareness of going to the toilet still but he is not perfect in this aspect and will sometimes pee his pants and pee the bed. to my knowledge he has not poo’d himself. - ^ carrying on the above point, one day recently he had poo’d and pee’d all over the bathroom floor and left it there, until my mum discovered it and cleaned it up. this has not happened since.- he has frequent hallucinations and seems to hallucinate the younger version of me a lot, and will make me and my ‘friend’ some food and will be angry at why i do not reply to him - this is not me, this is the hallucination not responding.- he will randomly ask when his dad’s funeral is, or when his wife’s funeral is (his wife passed away 4 years ago, and his dad even longer ago)- has hallucinated seeing my grandma dead in his bed (this was the very first hallucination i believe)- recently forgot where his bedroom was, i had to guide him and show him- has forgotten who my dad was once recently, asking him where he comes from- refers to my dad as his brother sometimes- says sentences that don’t really make sense, ranging from ‘gibberish’ i.e random words in a sentence like randomly referring to someone as a snake or he will say things like ‘i wanna go home’ despite him being at homethat is all of the things i can recall right now, i hope that is enough to give some guidance of what stage he could be at? he was officially diagnosed with dementia in 2021 i believe, however obvious symptoms were showing since 2019. we don’t know how long he could’ve been living with it but concealing, as we only got back in touch with him in 2017 after my grandma passed away. we have supported him ever since."," i'm assuming these symptoms are typically worse in the late afternoon, evening, middle of the night? search for information on ""sundowning"" and ""sundowners"" there are some things you can do ahead of time, so that he doesn't get as bad hallucinations at that time of day. like add more lighting to the room and turn them all on like 3pm, long before it actually gets dark outside. herbal tea, melatonin, calming music (especially from his era) helps too. so that he can fall asleep early in the evening and ideally just sleep instead of sundowning. if it hasnt already been done, your parents need to establish durable poa asap. by the time you seriously need it, grandpa will no longer be of ""sound mind"" even on good days. legal stuff must be done long before an emergency. does grandpa have any assets? it is time to work on working with a lawyer to spend that down appropriately, so he can qualify for medicaid. even living in his home, you will need some support so that you don't go crazy. get him on a medicaid waiver for home care. and get documentation that the adult caregiver moving into his house *prevented grandpa from moving into a medicaid nursing home even earlier* ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sw7q1r/moved_in_with_grandpa_with_dementia_not_sure_what/,[deleted by user]

"my 93 year old grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimers nearly a year ago but the last 3 months or so she has been rapidly deteriorating. for a few weeks, she had become very aggressive and was having trouble sleeping. because of this, her doctor prescribed her antipsychotics. when my mother told me this i was immediately put off. i’m not a doctor, but i work in pharmaceuticals, and i have my own mental health issues as well as friends with psychotic disorders, so i have done extensive research in the field and like to think i know a good amount. these drugs are designed to block dopamine receptors in patients who have overactive or irregular dopamine production in their brain. alzheimers and dementia have nothing to do with overactive dopamine production, they just prescribe this to sedate aggressive or unpredictable patients. my grandma stopped being aggressive, but it is clear she is experiencing all of the negative side effects of the drug. she is constantly confused and almost never knows who is around her or whats happening, she is always tired and sleeping, and can barely speak anymore. my mother seems to think every time she remembers something, thats the antipsychotics working. i’ve explained to her that the drugs mechanism of action simply cannot make her memory better, and if her memory is getting better it is despite the antipsychotics, not due to them. she wont listen to me and refuses to hear anything i have to say, because “doctors are always right.” im at my wits end and im afraid my grandmother is going to die sooner because of these drugs. ive even considered calling the doctor and speaking to him directly. what can i do? i would rather have a slightly aggressive grandmother with most of her memories in tact, than a zombified sedated confused grandmother."," no she isn't getting worse - she is progressing through this awful disease. antipsychotics are an appropriate response- truly. aggression is just one of the awful components and it is hell to deal with so yes this medication helps. dementia patients don't gain memory back, they don't get better, they will progress through at their own speed. you may not like it and if you want her off antipsychotics i suggest you become her full time carer and take her off them but please make sure you wean her off slowly!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/srs5mf/best_geriatric_doctor_in_town_prescribed_my/,"“Best geriatric doctor in town” prescribed my grandma antipsychotics, and shes getting worse"

"my father's cognition has been deteriorating steadily over the past few years, but when (and after) he was in the hospital last summer, i noticed a sharp decline. the last seven months have been a particular living hell. his care team and i had been trying to persuade him to accept some form of home support so that he could be wait-listed for assisted living, all to no avail. whenever the subject came up, it was always ""i'll think about it."" he said much the same thing when i suggested he get a tv, or a microwave... i'm not sure if it has been the dementia, natural stubbornness, or him trying to cling to the little control he has left.... sometimes i even wonder if his refusal to eat adequately (he's skin and bones and claims to have no appetite) is a part of trying to control something.a couple of weeks ago, though... everything accelerated.. as you may have surmised, he has been living alone, and to date, he was, more or less, coping... kind of... maybe. i wish i could have him live with me, but, for various reasons, that simply isn't an option... in addition to seeing him once a week, i was phoning him every day... on january 29, he didn't pick up the phone. since he was sill going out to do his own shopping, i wasn't *too* worried at first, but i after trying to call again a couple of times, i knew something was very wrong, so i called a cab to his place, and let myself in. i found my father, bruised, and bleeding in places, on the floor of his bedroom, semi-conscious.... immediately i called 911, and he has been in the hospital since. apparently he suffered an nstemi ... we're not sure if his fall caused the heart attack, or if the attack caused the fall... until this evening, when he called me from the hospital, he thought he was on a boat after having been on some kind of a trip... this time, though, it was a lot worse... he accused me of locking him up ""on the boat,"" along with a lot of really hurtful stuff... and i just couldn't reach him.... couldn't make him understand i'd found him on the floor... last week, i met with his care team, and they have determined, after observing him in hospital that he has reached another lower baseline of cognition... they feel (and i concur) that it is no longer safe for him to be alone, so when he is released, he'll be getting live-in support, which means i need to acquire a bed for the homecare worker and place it in his living room/dining area, and make it relatively private.. all things considered... i'm *extremely* worried at how this is going to go... my father is stubborn, fiercely independent... also, when he was young.. he climbed mountains as a hobby... and being a marine engineer gave him considerable freedom of movement, not just in his profession, but also because he could pick and choose where he lived (we moved around a lot...)just...seeing him like this....it's.... the worst thing i have ever experienced, and it's tearing me apart at every level... i'm a pretty secular person, but... honestly, if there is such a thing as hell.. this is it. i doubt i need to tell anyone here that, though..."," instead of editing my op, it might be easier to just comment quickly... i want to say, you are all wonderful, and later on, when things have eased a little, i want to write out some proper replies.just one thing i should note, since many of you reference this... where i live, somebody has to be receiving some form of home support ***before*** they can be wait-listed for a facility... i understand some of the reasoning, but... given my father's current condition, i feel this logic may be more than a little flawed.... i agree with everyone who says it would be better for him to go directly to a care home from the hospital, but, sadly, that isn't possible... \*sigh\*again.... thank you.... thank you all so much..",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/srbdmb/im_new_but_joined_some_time_ago_im_not_normally/,"I'm new... but joined some time ago...

"i've watched like an hour of these videos and my main takeaway is ""be sweet, gentle, don't rush, don't get cross, try to figure out why she's upset, slowly guide her....""  it doesn't matter how gently and sweetly we try redirect or to massage her into the correct choice to alleviate her discomfort (like accepting pain medicine or letting us change her diaper). we can spend 2 hours sweetly and gently meandering our way to the action point. she directly goes to ""no"" and as soon as we take any actual action no matter how gently, she still goes straight to calling us liars, screaming take me home, call the cops, they're poisoning me, stiffening her muscles, ""kicking"", scratching. and this was around noon today, when we're supposed to get her awake to avoid oversleep and then sundowning. i'm so tired."," (never heard of teepa snow.  sounds like i should give it a miss.)sorry for your situation.i have learned so much... humility, or something.  i would now never presume to tell anyone else how to care for their dementia relative.  lots of times, **nothing works.**  and telling caregivers to be sweet, be gentle, try to figure out why she's upset etc then makes the caregivers feel awful when it doesn't work, as if it's their fault -- when, in fact, there was no winning move.we each have to do our best and be decent, and recognize that we can't always succeed (in fact, at some point, by definition, we won't succeed).hang in there.  i will if you will. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sq63pf/teepa_snow_never_met_my_grandma/,Teepa Snow never met my grandma.

"a bit of background - i'm 28m, working as a surgical trainee about 300miles from my parents. my brother 32m (only sibling) lives a similar distance and is finishing a phd, he is lovely, but has a history of severe depression and struggles to deal with negative emotions. my dad has early dementia, just about holding onto a part time job but is in complete denial.my mum and i have been trying to help dad and gently suggest he should get the last scan. my brother is aware and we don't hide anything but also we don't actively talk to him about it. the vague plan is once i get a reg job (same training region for 5 years) my parents will move to be near me (i can't afford to live where they do). just had phone call with my mum - she was saying how dad's getting worse etc. i asked her how she is doing, she broke down in tears. i try to come home minimum once a month for a weekend (i work 1/4), we call every weekend and i try to call midweek to say hi. i'm planning on asking mum about possible depression this week (exam so i'm down there). is there anything else i can do? i'm trying to organise a trip for us to go to kew gardens as we both enjoy plants but that won't be for months. i just feel somewhat useless - i barely see my new gf anyway due to where we live. but i feel like i need to be home more to help my parents. any advice? tldr what can i do to help my mum deal with dad's early dementia (on denial)."," hire a caretaker to help your mom help your dad. this is basically a choice between family and money. if you can't be with your family for the sake of money, use that money to help your family. if you can be the one to help them you don't need money to hire someone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/spwqxj/any_advice/,Any advice?

"i know this group is good for learning of other experiences. so i'd love to know what this might mean. and what your experiences are. my grandma's health history are of what follows:my grandma, has macular degeneration in her eyes. she has been getting treatment for it, which is a needle in the eye full of whatever medication and it's kept her sight going years longer, she would of been completely blind by now.she hit her head on a tile floor 3 years back causing a skull fracture where she went through delirium afterwards due to a massive sodium imbalance. a normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (meq/l). she hit 111 at one point where 110 you will go into a coma (it was a battle, a tough one that really made things difficult at home, she lives with us and we take care of her). she had dementia before this for many years but after this injury it definitely has sped up in progress. and she has to have sodium medications to keep her levels up for the rest of her life.she also was 91 when she found out she has ciliac disease. which is handled quite well-------now done with all this medical background, and moving forward.my grandma who is 95 now, was rushed to the hospital on  sunday feb 6th with stroke like symptoms. slurred speach, couldn't form a conversation, started talking about herself in third person i think allowed her to talk a bit better. called the ambulance, and one of the police trained medical professionals showed up did some tests, checking the blood levels/etc. what indicated its not a mini stroke (which that's what appeared to be what she was having) is my grandma's automated response to any doctor where she sounds 100% normal, so that means she's still aware of some things going on. (she's like a kid, too afraid to tell the doctor she's not ok, almost like she's scared to be scolded) basically the conversation was this:paramedic: ""how are you feeling?"" gram: ""oh great, i'm just fine, 100%!"" ""no problems?"" ""no, don't know why youre here, i feel wonderful!""""do you know what year it is?""""..... yeah...... um........... september?""""how old are you?""""um..... its a big number................. i don't know....""few minutes later we have now 3 paramedics, two of which are from the ambulance that arrived, so they start conversing about the situation my grandma then want to talk to them, as she's sitting on the couch:gram: ""hey doctor?""paramedic: ""yes?""""i'd like, um, when, like, um, uh, when? ok is it? um..""she couldn't respond to questions that weren't related to how she felt, and she couldn't make sentences on the spot. they took her in, where she did make a recovery at the hospital.they found nothing in cat scans, or anything unusual, sugar levels were somehow normal (she can go through a small bag of sugar in less than a week) her sodium level did drop to 131 (where she can go into a very mild state of delirium however, during delirium episodes she can still form sentences even when it hit a level of 116 so that wasn't it)no sign of a blood clot on the brain etc... she was fine to go home at around 4am. now visiting the eye clinic to get her shots a couple days later, the doctor there said it sounded like she has vesicular dementia. as this did affect her eyesight a bit when it happened(at least i think it did, she wasn't clear and we couldn't understand her). and he told us a lot of patients that are being treated like she is, have had this happen.he explained that this could have been a clot (on the way to the brain) that might of limited the flow of blood to the brain. which in turn leads to the symptoms she had. it can affect various parts the brain, eyes, etc. leading to sentences not being formed, blindness, and made her incapable of making decisions.were still not 100% sure at home what may of happened here, but it does sound like a clot that blocked the passage of blood for a time frame, and she wasn't getting enough to the brain. i know i wrote a lot, but it's for a little bit of an understanding and i'd rather not get things wrong. we are talking to doctors next week about this incident, and from the sounds of things this does happen to people who have vesicular dementia. her conginative ability is i'm estimating a range of 40-30% (doc said 30 last time but i think it's higher at home) right now, it was a drop from 60% in a four month period, but it hasn't decreased or increased from what i can tell so far. at least prior to this happening. has anyone had this happen, where someone with vescular dementia suddenly loses cognitive ability in a small period of time. i know id mention this more to a doctor and will be talking to them about it this week, but really i'd like to know more about this by the experiences of others. like has this happened to a family member? and were they able to come back from it? when this happens could it become permanent? or is it like a cycle of vescular dementia? what have the later stages been like? and what symptoms have you seen towards the end?my family doesn't want surprises, its been very very difficult, if its a cycle, its not like we're not going to call an ambulance based on responses of reddit. but i don't really know what the worst can be. what do we really expect towards the end of her life? so we can kind of mentally prepare too. thanks for any response"," i believe the theories that in dementia, they have dreams, that are little disturbed be inputs from real world soghts, smells, or sounds.  accept their reality, and respond within it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/spiqw8/vascular_dementia_recently_found_my_grandma/,"Vascular dementia, recently found my grandma actually might have this.

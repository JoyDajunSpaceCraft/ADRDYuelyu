[removed]," not sure i can really give advice more than a life lesson. my dad was like your mom. no moving to a memory care community or even independent living for him with on-site assisted living to help with my mom. he wouldn't hear of it. he hid a lot of her symptoms from us at the same time. we knew she had alzheimer's, but he was helping her enough that we couldn't  tell how bad it had gotten.then he had a seizure one night and she couldn't even remember how to call 911. thankfully, my nephew happened to be there. doctors found nothing concerning and sent him home. a few days later, he had a stroke in the bathroom. again, she had no idea how to call 911. during all the tests for a stroke, doctors found a large tumor in the back of his head.  he didn't survive. suddenly, my mom was alone in the house, with no way to care for herself, and memory care communities here all have a waitlist. we were lucky to get that wait cut to a few months, but it was a few months of me getting up, driving my husband to work so that i could have the car, bringing my laptop to her house, trying to work from her home while also care for her, and then waiting for my brother to get out of work so that i could go pick up my husband, get dinner started, and try to catch up on all the work i couldn't do while she was jumping up every two seconds and running outside again to ""go home.""it was exhausting. having her in memory care made a big difference. she made friends, she had around-the-clock care for her wandering habit, and we had the help of experts who see all aspects of this disease and could prepare us for what is next. it still hasn't been easy as we had to move her when she ran out of money and then the place that took her dumped her off in the er when they couldn't handle her aggression, but we've had social workers by our side during these times, which has been helpful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/n1h5o1/helpless_daughter_needs_advice_for_dad/,Helpless Daughter Needs Advice for Dad.

[removed]," i also care for an assholish, demented mother. it has turned out that the typical meds to treat the aggressive, nasty behaviors, did the opposite or her. after a hospitalization where even haldol didn’t touch her crazy, her neurologist did a dna test that is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of medications. she is now on one med. it is an anticonvulsant, used for mood stabilization. it works better. additionally my son came home when she was in a full blown rage. he gave her thc in the form of a gel candy. within an hour she was giggling and dancing. i called her neurologist and his comment was “thank goodness you found something that works”. i now give her a liquid form twice a day. finding what works is a challenge. you also need to trust your observations. doctors can’t spend the time with them that you do. trust your gut.one last thought, as it sounds like our situations are similar. my mother was/is a type 1 personality and even with severe dementia, believes she is capable and doesn’t need my help. the best way to inflame her is to try to help her or do a project she use to be capable of. everything is complicated by her aphasia. it all seems impossible. i now do what i need and want to do and ignore her nastiness. i do my best to remain calm. i am working to create an environment that soothes both of us. lockdown has made it all more complicated since her daycare closed march 18, 2020. she won’t wear a mask as required to attend when they reopen next week......sigh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/mzsqls/how_do_you_deal_with_the_abuse_how_do_you_deal/,"How do you deal with the abuse?

[removed]," one thing to consider, which does vary from state to state, where i live, there were no memory care communities with secure wings that also accept extreme aggression. my mom attacked a nurse and was left at the er check-in where she was admitted into the psychiatric wing. insurance wouldn't pay for anything beyond her time with the doctors, which ended up with a $15k bill.be very careful asking communities if they handle extreme aggression and get it in writing. not all do and we learned the hard way through elder care lawyers that if a community that can't handle aggression decides the person is a risk to themselves or others, they are legally entitled to deposit them at the hospital without warning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/mwxmpm/yesterday_my_grandmother_had_a_seizure_and_her_az/,"Yesterday, my grandmother had a seizure and her AZ has taken a turn for the worse.

[removed]," i was you back in 2018. i'm 39 also so about the same stage in life.even when i was relatively happy or in a good mood i still had that bubble of anxiety in my head, like a cloud. my mom was late stage at that point and non vocal for years. i think the last coherent conversation i had with her was maybe late 2015? i saw no end and was seriously considering breaking up with my now wife because i felt like i was dragging her down with me. i had basically given up at that point and the only thing keeping myself and my family together was our ridiculously sick sense of humour thanks to entirely too much monty python over the years.my mom passed in late 2018 and not a day goes by i don't think about her. she used to love playing nintendo and was into animal crossing. my sister and i just got into it for the switch and both remarked how mom would've liked it.sorry, i think this reply is more me venting/bragging, but i'm now married to my amazing wife and we just had our first daughter in january. because of what we went through covid has been a breeze. i'm proud of what we went through and frankly i could end up homeless in a gutter but can still be proud of what we did. we're now the go-to couple when our friends need help or support. we're both still dealing with mental health issues of course, and i'm on a baby dose of an anti depressant, but it feels like the last stages of physiotherapy after major surgery.i guess what i'm trying to say is there is light at the end of the tunnel. no one who hasn't been through this will really understand the constant anxiety, self doubt, fear, anger, shame, overall shitiness, the fucking crying in your car, lack of sleep, horrible thoughts, etc.you will get through this. you are a stronger person because you were there for your mother. nobody can take that from you. you will have your child, even if it means shooting down a stork mid-flight./end rant",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/mr29w6/how_am_i_suppose_to_ever_be_happy_again/,How am I suppose to ever be happy again

[removed], my grandma has the jitter bug. it’s essentially a dumb smart phone. she is starting to forget how to use it and cannot always recognize names when she gets calls but overall it’s fairly easy. it also has an emergency line that if she presses (on purpose or by accident) she will immediately be connected with someone that can help her get medical attention if needed; the best part is that my mom and my aunt (her 2 primary care takers) get notified as well. i do know it has speaker phone but not sure if that’s an automatic feature of not.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/mibcoq/best_phones_for_people_with_dementia/,Best Phones for people with dementia?

[removed]," it seems to me you have two options.  1. confront her and meet her every criticism head on.  2. avoid her and try to let the criticisms roll off your back.if energy exists to do so, probably asserting yourselves as in choice 1 will be most beneficial at changing aunt's behavior.  this involves saying things like ""yes, i hear you think things should be arranged differently, but you are not next of kin so unfortunately you have to go along with our rules,"" or ""you said some despicable things about father to the executive director.  if you continue acting like this, you will see less and less of mother.""you and your dad might be conflict-avoidant people, and that's okay.  so if you don't want to go with option 1, use option 2, which you pretty much have been doing.  whatever your choice, it's  up to you and don't feel guilty or bad about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/m5yj4w/boundaries_with_los_siblings/,Boundaries with LO's Siblings

[removed]," i'm in the opposition position. my parents and i have been taking care of my grandmother, 85 and late-stage, for two years and are preparing to put her in a facility. it was worth it to keep her at home in the beginning because she was still herself but the decline has been rapid and she isn't safe anymore. i will tell you that if you move her home, expect for it to be the only thing you do. it's almost like having a toddler, where you can't do anything without checking on them and making sure they are away from kitchen knives, scissors, the stove and oven, going up and down stairs they cannot handle, or going out the door and up the street. i work a part time job, my father works full time, and my mother stays home with her when we can't. we have a woman who helps 2 days a week for 6 hours but we are still all frazzled. try to figure out if 2 hours a day is all you and your brother will need for yourself and all the errands you need to run.maybe look for other solutions that would make her more comfortable in her current facility. some plants to water, her own tv if she doesn't have one, more books or magazines.i know it's a hard decision. best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/m5cp66/mom_is_in_memory_care_facility_but_we_want_to/,Mom is in memory care facility but we want to bring her home

[removed]," my mom wanders so alarms on doors and windows. she figured out how to turn the gas back on by pulling out the bottom drawer and reaching the valve back against the wall when we'd shut off the stove/oven so that became an issue. she also figured out how to relight the boiler when we turned it off for the summer. if you have gas for heating and cooking, be prepared for that. we came home to the furnace running with the thermostat as high as it would go one summer day and the ac in the window on at the same time. had to put in thermostat locks after that.my mom cannot do stairs, so eventually those may become an issue if he becomes prone to falls. she's entering stage 7 and can still stand and shower on her own. that may or may not be an issue you run into.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/m3vmor/home_modifications_to_keep_him_here/,Home modifications to keep him here

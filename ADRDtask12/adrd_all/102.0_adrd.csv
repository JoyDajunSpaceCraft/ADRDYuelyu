"my mil is in a memory care unit, hospital level. this is not about her though. i have a a friend that i have known for 15 years. we were good friends, intimate at times. this person liked to drink and before i lost contact had moved to a more  remote part of the country and had a couple of falls, broken an ankle badly. i run into this person every time i go with my partner to visit mil  the first time i ask if they knew who i was, yes was the reply. the conversation is very limited. it turns me inside out every time. i feel like i'm being punished, not guilt. perhaps that's why i don't understand guilt, because i'm so cynical i think it's just deserved. i can't ask about this persons medical status because i'm not family. i believe them to be heavily medicated.  it just feels like hell. i hate what my life has become. all the good years have passed and when i examine them, much of those times were terrible, just that i lived with extreme highs and extreme lows. now it's flat, and miserable. i don't know what i want from this, not sympathy. maybe acknowledgement just by someone reading it."," thanks for visiting your mother in law. the staff always pays more attention to residents who are frequently visited by family members. you are doing a really good thing when you visit. the more you come around and the more time you spend chatting with the staff the better care she will receive. the same is true for your friend you saw. even if this person isn‚Äôt responsive, you caring about them and spending time with them reminds the busy staff that this individual is human. remember: time together doesn‚Äôt have to be talking. you could always bring in ice cream, with staff permission, and sit and eat milk shakes together.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/id0884/every_time_i_visit_the_memory_care_unit/,Every time I visit the memory care unit

"hi everyone. i‚Äôm new here and just need someone to talk to. my father (62) has had a really complicated past, but mainly came to a head in january when he was admitted to the hospital, mental health ward for being in psychosis (he was having auditory hallucinations). at the time he did see a neurologist, he did a mri (or ct scan i‚Äôm not a doctor) and he wasn‚Äôt concerned about any type of dementia. after a million types of medication, and 18 ects, he was discharged in march. post discharge he is completely disinterested, lethargic, delayed speech and confused. psychiatrist wanted him to see the neurologist again due to less than expected improvement, which he did and now they are mentioning frontal lobe dementia. mri requisition is to be expected soon but things are extremely backed up due to covid. does anyone else have a similar experience of onset symptoms, where it was a complicated diagnosis? any help would be appreciated- i just feel so gutted right now."," i‚Äôm really really sorry you are going through this.to have your dad in the hospital that long without knowing the diagnosis must have been so hard.i know it‚Äôs not exactly what you were asking but  my mom‚Äôs frontotemperal dementia diagnosis was a actually pretty quick. it was just a day of testing and a couple months later they gave us the diagnosis. however, it came after years of wondering what was wrong with her- depression? mid life crisis? menopause? a few different factors enabled her to live her life a long time without getting a diagnosis- no kids at home, no job outside the home to hold her to some standard. so by the time doctors were trying to figure out what was wrong, thru some cognitive tests and i think a pet scan, they could determine ftd.ftd is hard, but i think uncertainty is harder. i hope your family gets some answers soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/icyscj/feeling_helpless/,Feeling helpless...

"hey all! my grandfather has alzheimer‚Äôs and lives at home with my 85 year old grandmother who does not. they have a traditional dynamic where he took care of her their entire lives, and she does not seem interested (or able?) to take care of him now. she expects that he will go to the grocery store even though they live in arizona who is struggling with covid, and says that he likes going and that it gives him exercise. he‚Äôs supposed to pay all of the bills (luckily they‚Äôre mostly on auto pay) but last time i was there in march i spent 5 hours cleaning his avalanche of mail on his desk. he got stung by a swarm of bees and attacked by a feral cat in the past month and we learned about this secondhand. my grandpa has an infusion nurse who has been going above and beyond (organizes his pill box, has taken him to a doctors appt, writes reminders for him, etc) for free but it‚Äôs not her job and she has a busy life.i‚Äôm a medical provider and this whole situation sets off red alarm bells in my brain because i know that these are all little things but things are building up and getting worse. he can‚Äôt remember to take his meds and my grandma is no help. my dad and his brothers are afraid to get them home health because they‚Äôve tried before for my grandma after a hip replacement, and my grandma shot them down and made us fire them because ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt need help‚Äù.in my opinion, there should be no option here. my dad has access to their bank account. i feel someone should be there at least once a week and my dad agrees, but he is extremely reluctant to force them to do anything. he wants me to come up with a list of things to say that home health can offer them to persuade them. do you all have experience with home health and the things you have them do for your family member? are you going through an agency or private person?nursing home is the ideal world, but with covid, it‚Äôs just not going to happen."," thank you, kind internet stranger! the little things that make one‚Äôs day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ich8nw/advice_post/,Advice post!

"i've been debating making this post for a while, but its gotten to the point where i am not sure what to do anymore. this is a long one folks, i apologize for the novel i am about to write in advance...over the last couple of years myself (m28), my sister and my mom have noticed a change in my dad since he lost his job about 3 years ago (he got fired for fighting with his boss, and knowing him he probably said a bunch of things he should not have said). when it is brought up he says he wasn't fired, that he ""manufactured getting let go"" to maximize getting severance until he reached his retirement age. since then, we have noticed him changing for the worse and after doing research, the things we are noticing with him are pointing towards some form of dementia.most of the changes we have noticed have been personality and attitude changes and include examples such as:* his filter has pretty much completely gone, to the point where he is making comments he would not have made in the past. (ex: during the george floyd incident, he has made comments like ""black people they do it to themselves"" which is something he never would have said in years past.)* his mood changes from one minute to the next. he could be having a calm discussion one minute, then someone could say something and he immediately blows up and starts swearing up a storm.* he argues with everyone constantly, whether it be with my sister for wanting to get a hammock in the backyard and him not thinking it will fit in her small car, or on facebook with people who have differing opinions than him.* when he has a argument with someone in the house, he shuts them out and ignores them for long periods of time. (he ignored my mom for 3 months barely saying anything more than mean, snarky remarks because she said something that went against what he thought)* when he argues with one person in the house, he ignores and shuts everyone out to the point where he is currently not sleeping in the same bed as my mom because he misunderstood something my sister was telling him and lead to an argument between my dad and my sister.* my sister has told me that he has made remarks lately that everyone thinks he is stupid. this not the case as my dad is a very smart and logical man and everyone in our house knows it.we have also noticed some memory issues that lead me to believe that he has some sort of dementia, especially because his dad had dementia for a number of years before he died. the memory issues include:* he has misplaced his car keys, when they have a spot on a hook right as you walk in the front door that he always uses. * there are multiple incidents where he has said something in the past, and when we reference that specific quote he will tell us he never said that. (my parents were arguing and my mom brought up the fact that he mentioned in the past that he was going to serve her divorce papers, and he got extremely angry and kept saying that he never said that).* just last week, he went out to the store and when he came home he did not take his shoes off when coming in (as a family we always take our shoes off in the house when we come inside) for over 5 hours. when we bring up to him that he is forgetting things like his car keys, or his shoes on in the house for 5 hours, he gets very defensive and starts saying things like ""i just forgot about it, can't i forget things for god's sake."" him and i share a family doctor, so i made a call to him to see if there was anything he could do to help get my dad in to do some tests such as calling him in for a physical which my dad has not done in a number of years. the doctor said that they do not make calls for patients to come in for physicals and that the only way he could help him is if my dad went in himself with his concerns. i was very frustrated to hear this because i know many doctors will make the call as a way to get patients exhibiting signs of dementia into the offices to start the diagnosis process. i decided i would sit my dad down and have an earnest discussion with him about my family and my suspicions, which is big because in my family we do not have emotional conversations about anything (he comes from an english family that always pushed their feelings down more and more). so i sit him down and bring up the fact that i think he is showing signs of some sort of dementia, and that i think it wouldn't hurt to go make an appointment with the doctor to get some tests done. he was caught a bit blindsided by my words and thought there wasn't anything wrong mentally (we have other family issues that he says is contributing to his outbursts and such). i told him i would go with him to the appointment and support him but i walked away from the conversation with the understanding that he wasn't making the appointment. at this point, i don't know what else i can do in this situation because it seems the only way to get the ball rolling on tackling the potential problem of dementia is if he makes that step of going into the doctor's for an appointment, does anyone have any ideas of what i could do next to help my dad? i really am at a loss for how to handle this situation, as his demeanour and the way his acts is getting to the point that i do not want to go by the house anymore. thanks for taking the time to read my story, i really appreciate being able to vent my frustrations here!tldr: my family suspect that my dad has some type of dementia as it runs in his side of the family. his personality and memory has changed for the worse over the last couple of years, and he refuses to acknowledge that there is anything wrong, and he refuses to go to the doctor's when i talk to him about it.", hi.  in addition to these suggestions may i suggest prayer?  i lost mom to dementia in may this year.  she suffered many years and was on hospice 83 days.  i know that prayer was very effective both because she was a believer (although i was not) and because it really works right thru until the very end.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/iabklo/how_do_i_help_my_dad_61/,How do I help my dad (61)?

"my grandmother. she is 84 years old. she loves elephants, nature, and art. she broke her 2nd hip a month ago and was released from the hospital 3 days ago. i have moved into the house next door to hers to help be a part time caretaker of hers. we also hired a cna for 6 hours a day in the afternoons to help with various tasks. it's still not enough. night time is when i worry about her the most. i am trying to figure out what stage her dementia is at here are some things i have noticed. she knows who i am when she sees me and reaches out to hug me and kiss me and says she loves me, however she can not call me by name its more like she knows she knows who i am but can't quite figure it out. she still calls her son (my uncle) by name when she sees him. physically she can still feed herself but cannot prepare her own meals. a strategy i've adopted that seems to work over the last few days since i started this process is not asking her if she is hungry or what she wants to eat but instead inviting her to join me in sharing a meal together or having breakfast or lunch together and eating with her. i've taken on the role of making sure she gets 3 meals a day and as well balanced diet as possible. when looking at photos together she can name and identify people in the photos that are much older. she has trouble with photos that are more recent. she also can identify herself in photos. she was an artist all her life. her house has all orginal artwork and designs by her as well as tools and supplies for creating art. i used this for some activities the other day. when i asked her if she wanted to paint or draw she didn't show much interest or declined to try. when i started drawing next to her she became more interested and soon started drawing on the other side of the paper i was drawing on. even gave me tips and directions at one point. she can remember things from years ago or when reminded of events from the past she can recall or smile about a happy story. she can't remember what she did yesterday and i suspect she also has trouble remembering what she did just a few minutes before as she asks the same questions repeatedly. to which i always answer in a calm and positive voice no matter how many times she asks.the hardest part for me so far is i find myself feeling so much joy being able to help her and spend time with her to provide company and affection. at the same time i break down and cry at any random moment. our routine lately has been me going over with breakfast and eating with her, listening to music (her favorite is jazz) and then an activity like art, or a light walk, or looking at old photos. we have lunch after and then i usually have to leave in the late afternoon or evening for work. her cna mentioned to me when i left the other day my grandma became more agitated and hysterical when i left when she tried to give her a bath. i have not witnessed this side of it yet as she is always calm and happy when i'm around. the nurse told me she got up and even tried to walk out the door until eventually tiring herself out and laying back down on the couch. when i returned to her home later she was up and alert and i was able to use physical touch and reassurance to alow her to let the nurse bathe her. if there is any advice or resources anyone recommends i am open to all.sorry if this is a little all over the place. this is day 4 of taking on my new role and its definitely overwhelming, rewarding, sad, and happy all at the same time."," waa, good on you!  make a photo collage, of the more recent times / people, including of course you.  i printed out photies, made a loose collage, took it and colour photocopied it a3 size.  not too busy or cluttered, not too small images, confuses them.  clearly label the people / places.  if she's your moms mom or your dads mom, include a photo of you together with them, be easier for her to connect who you are.  i stick the collages up on mums kitchen wall, or the fridge, somewhere she can easily see it daily.   check out your countries alzheimers / dementia org online, they have lot of resources, tips, etc. (all the english-speaking countries have them)   some of them even do carer/family members workshops or mini-courses.  as you found out already, often not giving a choice is the best.  just start doing it and say ""hey, let's blabla..."" i usually leave a note on kitchen counter for my mum when i go out eg ""mum -- suzie back at 3 pm today, thursday"" or ""suzie back for dinner here"".   she's much calmer with that -- she knows it wasn't a figment of her imagination that i was here (i lived overseas for decades)  and she knows that i will be back at whatever time. you're very kind for your granny!  good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i9x1lr/looking_for_advice/,Looking for advice

can anyone explain to me how does atrail fibrillation contribute to the onset of dementia," atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke, subclinical infarcts, microbleeds, and decreased blood flow to the brain, which, in turn, leads to the brain functioning poorly.a lot of what we see related to atrial fibrillation is ‚Äúwhite matter disease,‚Äù (aka [leukoaraiosis]( which is often attributable to silent infarcts due to poor brain blood perfusion. the [white matter]( is the wiring that connect everything together. so you can imagine that if the wires are cut due to an infarct, it‚Äôs hard for information to go from one area of the brain to another. this causes one type of vascular cognitive impairment that‚Äôs typically seen clinically as impaired [executive functioning]( (eg, poor attention, poor working memory, and slower processing speed) rather than overt stroke-like symptoms such as facial droop, limb paralysis, or being unable speak.a relatively straightforward article on this topic can be found [here]( (alonso & larriva. eur cardiol rev. 2016;11(1):49-53).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i8tow4/onset/,Onset

"my father was recently sent to psychiatric ward of an ottawa hospital (unspecialised) for aggression, paranoia and delirium displayed at his seniors' residence. he has moderate-severe dementia and is at the stage where he is pretty confused and speaking in 'word salad'. that seemed like a sound decision for his safety and they were keeping him for 2 weeks while they test new anti-psychotics. however, my father has seriously declined over his stay (incontinence, similar behaviours, severe agitation) and his quality of care is concerning me. my family members visited and found him in a urine-soaked diaper, having not eaten and ripped his gown (no clothes in the hospital due to covid). he had lost his glasses for 2 days and the nurse didn't know he required them. as a guy who lived in a quiet rural area, i can imagine the lack of privacy (patients roam the halls, with all ages and conditions) and quiet is disturbing.  i'm overseas but trying to help with options to get him into a more specialised and attentive residence/hospital/facility. it's pretty distressing.  does anyone have advice on what kind of residence/facility would help or next steps of people to involve? bonus if it is specific to canada or ontario :)"," long term care homes in ontario have done very poorly under covid, just to say off the bat (though you may have heard this). as a first screen i would check which homes didn‚Äôt have problems, which i think suggests better management. what kind of resources are available? (private homes are $4-10k a month.) i can‚Äôt speak to ottawa. in the gta, on the ‚Äúregular‚Äù floors in the ltc homes i‚Äôve seen (i toured a few before covid), there were 1-3 personal support workers for 40 residents and 1 nurse. 7 minutes are allocated to each resident for feeding and dressing in the mornings, for example. and these are not always easygoing or compliant residents, right. cognition problems alone can stretch that out to half an hour or more at the best of times. and the staff are often part-time, no benefits... not always educated in dementia, i think the psw course is like 6 months... between high-need patients and lack of resources, it‚Äôs not hard to see how things can happen, anything from unintentional neglect to much worse.  there was usually a secure floor with probably a different staff to resident ratio. aggressive behaviour would likely land a resident there. i only saw one of those wards, i remember it was quiet. you can check inspection reports of individual homes herenb the ontario government cut back on inspections. many times they were literally phoned in (pre covid). most had warnings as well (ie not surprise inspections). all this has come out in the news lately. it‚Äôs a difficult landscape to parse at the best of times and it‚Äôs really hard now. hope you get good leads.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i6y6m6/where_to_from_hospitalisation_for_behavioural/,"Where to from hospitalisation for behavioural issues - Ottawa, Ontario?"

"hey y‚Äôall. my mom is in the moderate level of alzheimer‚Äôs, creeping closer into the severe. it‚Äôs been a year since her diagnosis, but several years of losing cognitive function after suffering the trauma of breaking her femur and the process of going under anesthesia for surgery. quick context of her life: my dad left when i was 7, i‚Äôm now 35. i have 4 older siblings, with the oldest 11 years my senior. mom didn‚Äôt get remarried until about 9 years ago, after we were all married &amp; moved out/away. she married the widower of a woman she was very close friends with for 30+ years... she had never shown any interest in being with anyone my whole life after my dad. she was more interested in being involved with me and my siblings lives. classic selfless single mother. but when her friend died suddenly a decade or so ago, the widower started coming around and wanting to spend time with my mom. she resisted it so hard. but he was persistent and eventually ‚Äúwon her over‚Äù. i think she thought it would be wrong to get with her late friend‚Äôs husband. my mom is also the classic good catholic girl; had only ever been with my dad, etc. and that catholic guilt &amp; worrying what other people would think made her very hesitant to start dating him. so, in my opinion, her choice to finally marry him was a combination of fear and security. my mom always struggled with money. worked 3 jobs, a total hustler, but always in debt because she wanted to give all us kids everything. she‚Äôs never been fully mentally strong and healthy. depression &amp; anxiety, that i used to think was just caused by my dad cheating &amp; leaving her, but i‚Äôve come to realize is just ever-present in her family history and upbringing. nevertheless, she thought ‚Äúwow, this is a nice man that wants to be with me, who showers me with gifts and takes me on fancy trips, and who seems really happy and funny and fun ‚Äî surely this can‚Äôt be a bad thing to have financial stability and to be with someone who will take care of me, to have companionship, etc.‚Äù and honestly, for the first 4ish years it was great. the first time in my life i wasn‚Äôt just worried about my mom and the fact that she was alone and didn‚Äôt have anyone to count on (besides her kids).fast forward to now. her husband has lost more and more of his hearing - which has been a big frustration for both of them in communicating. but sometimes i think he exaggerates and uses it as an excuse. because oftentimes he will hear things from other people but have to shout ‚Äúwhat?!‚Äù when it‚Äôs my mom who is talking....but long story short, he is a terrible, horrible caregiver. he‚Äôll admit it too. but he does nothing to fix it. for over a year now, my sisters and i have been giving him books, sending him resources, suggesting things to make his life easier... guys, i can‚Äôt stress enough to you how dense this man is. he‚Äôs 74 and a boomer to his core. his emotional intelligence is non-existent. once at the doctors office he &amp; i were talking to a nurse and a social worker in a room away from my mom and he went into this thing about how he worked for lockheed his whole life and how he is a ‚Äúproblem-solver‚Äù ‚Äî and he just can‚Äôt get my mom to realize what is happening; how much he has to repeat things and how frustrating all her ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù behaviors are; and wanted them to tell him ‚Äúhow to make her understand what‚Äôs going on with her‚Äù.... the nurses and i looked at each other curiously and we all essentially told him ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do anything. you have to adjust, you have to change your behavior.‚Äù he just stared blankly like ‚Äúno, i don‚Äôt accept this answer. you women are idiots, so i guess i‚Äôll have to figure it out myself.‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt read the books, he doesn‚Äôt talk to anyone about his feelings. he just blows up at my mom. recently, a friend of my moms was on the phone (mom must‚Äôve called or picked up &amp; not realize someone was there, put the phone down without hanging it up) and this woman heard my mom‚Äôs husband yelling at her. something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre driving me crazy today! crazy crazy crazy!‚Äù i‚Äôve heard him do it too, when i‚Äôm in town and stay at their house. he is mean. very cold and impatient. don‚Äôt get me wrong, my mom can be mean too. but it‚Äôs not her fault anymore. she‚Äôs only mean when she feels out of control in a situation. she‚Äôs lovely when i‚Äôm there and she feels taken care of and loved. he‚Äôs not kind to her, not affectionate. he used to leave her alone at home constantly, even though my sisters and i repeatedly asked him not to. he‚Äôd drive 2 hours to go to the casino and just not tell anyone. and before you ask, no he‚Äôs not in serious cognitive decline. he still works and does complicated financial stuff and all that. he‚Äôs not an idiot in that sense, just when it comes to thinking about anyone but himself. the other day he lost her at the doctor‚Äôs office. not the brain doc, but apparently they didn‚Äôt know she had dementia and let her leave to go find him, since he couldn‚Äôt come in and was waiting in the lobby. after an hour he finally went to look for her and found her talking to the valet trying to find her car. she hasn‚Äôt driven in 2 years probably. we had a conference call with her brain doc a few days ago, to go over her new test results. at one point he (the husband) was talking directly to my mom, trying to explain why it was important to have home heath care come in (she hates it) and why they were saying she needs 24/7 care. it was great because he spoke to her exactly as he always does - not yelling, but very curt and uncompassionate. it was amazing because after he was done talking, the doc/nurse/social worker all started talking to him about learning how to communicate with her better, suggested all the same resources we‚Äôve been telling him about for a year. i don‚Äôt think it mattered though. he‚Äôs not gonna change. it was like pulling teeth to get him to start having home health care come in. he only started having someone come like a month ago, after my sisters found out about him yelling at her while the family friend heard. it‚Äôs only a few hours a week and it‚Äôs basically just so he can leave the house. when he‚Äôs home he‚Äôs rarely even in the same room with her, and when he is it‚Äôs not for her benefit or anything. he can‚Äôt remember to give her medication everyday. i got him a $100 auto pill box thing, did everything i could to get him started with it. i found it in its original box, in the garage with other crap they don‚Äôt use.here‚Äôs a quick list of all the things i‚Äôve tried to implement to make my mom as healthy as possible and to make his life easier, all of which he has either stopped after i leave or never started in the first place:-auto pill box-cod liver oil capsules -eating mushrooms, drinking green tea, taking tumeric w/black pepper in a capsule (all just good for general brain health)-daily walks with her dog, they live super close to a few parks too.-getting a sleep apnea machine so she sleeps better, which is really important for brain health... sleep is like the brains way to flush out all the garbage that builds up everyday. -having a white board by her bed where she looks everyday to remind her of things.-an apple watch to keep track of her, alert if she falls, etc. or any life alert type device.-simplifying their home which is way too cluttered, simplifying the phones and tv setup so she can easily use. it fucking never works when i‚Äôm there. -letting her go to therapy so she can at least talk to someone. we have a therapist that many of us have seen at different points and who is just an overall comforting presence. but he thinks it‚Äôs a waste since she won‚Äôt remember. -having a good pharmacologist managing her medications, since no one seems to be doing it regularly enough ‚Äî she needs to be getting meds on time yes, but she also needs to be on the right combination of meds and have them monitored more regularly so at least that part isn‚Äôt hurting more than helping... there is an amazing doc that could do this about 4 minutes from their house. -oh, and she has this little dog that she absolutely adores. her husband is constantly giving it people food. i can‚Äôt even tell you how many times i‚Äôve explained to him that he can‚Äôt do that. the dog weighs probably 9lbs. it‚Äôs a teeny tiny little lap dog. he feeds it cheese, leftover steak or chicken from whatever restaurant they went to the night before, and most recently i observed him feeding the dog a twinkie. .....this is what we‚Äôre dealing with. a fox news consuming, truth-denying, stubborn, arrogant (and honestly, pretty damn racist) moron who simply refuses to take any of us seriously. and just to connect the racism to how it effects my mom, he said some incredibly racist things to my mom‚Äôs first home health care nurse. sisters were there to hear and were mortified. i know hhc people are not gonna let stuff like that interfere with the care they give but jfc.... i want the people who are taking care of my mom to be treated with respect too. bottom line: i don‚Äôt think he loves her nor cares about what happens to her. he doesn‚Äôt give her any more time and thought than he absolutely has to, and even then it‚Äôs not enough. she calls me or my sisters or my brothers 10 times a day, just begging us to help her. she thinks she can fix it herself by being different. she doesn‚Äôt understand that she can‚Äôt. and he won‚Äôt listen or adapt. i know she doesn‚Äôt wanna be married to him anymore if it continues as it is. he would basically have to be a totally different person for her to be happy with him. she can‚Äôt remember something you said 5 minutes ago, but she is not forgetting how shitty her husband makes her feel. emotional memory goes last, and it‚Äôs just seems clear to me that whatever is broken in their relationship is unfixable, unless there‚Äôs a miracle. or that their relationship was superficial from both sides, and now the husband is just done with her bc all he wanted was someone to take care of him after he lost his wife of 40 years. whatever it is, i just don‚Äôt think their 9 years together is enough to carry them through to the end. i think he‚Äôs done. i just wish he‚Äôd admit it and let us take care of her. i really don‚Äôt think a real divorce is necessary or even a good idea at all ‚Äî i‚Äôd be happy to help take care of her as much as i can, but i can‚Äôt afford all that i‚Äôd need to do it all. my best ideas right now are just to go home and get her, bring her to my house to stay for a bit and see what happens. or for her to go stay with either of my two sisters who live close to her. but they say as soon as she leaves the house, even for a quick errand, she just wants to go home. :/ i live 4.5 hours from her, but my living situation is ideal i think. 35 acres, beautiful outdoors and lots of animals, healthy fresh food, and no children of my own. i‚Äôm here basically all the time, we‚Äôre far away from the busy road. my husband is a wonderful cook. my sisters &amp; brothers all have kids. 3 are nearby her but the 2nd brother is across the country. ugh.... it‚Äôs just awful y‚Äôall. i don‚Äôt know what the right thing to do is. i feel like i‚Äôve tried everything. who do i call and talk to? who knows what to do when the person with dementia has a spouse who doesn‚Äôt seem to give a shit about them? i‚Äôve thought about adult protective services, but what does that even do? i don‚Äôt want them to take my mom or anything. if she is forced to move into a facility, she will absolutely give up the will to live. one of her sisters died a few years back ‚Äî same thing. but her daughter (my cousin) put her in a home that was hours away from their family. mom was the only one visiting her, and even then she had to travel to another state. i don‚Äôt want my mom to feel so sad and hopeless. but i‚Äôm the youngest of 5 kids ‚Äî i‚Äôve never been the one leading the pack. i‚Äôm the one who always goes another way and goes against the grain. right now though i just feel frozen. like we‚Äôre all just waiting for something bad or serious enough to happen to force someone to make a stand and take control. if you got this far, thank you for reading. i‚Äôm not even sure if i made sense or asked a clear question. i guess i just need to know what my options are; what are the resources i can use that i‚Äôm not aware of; has anyone else heard of a situation like this? thanks so much for any advice y‚Äôall can offer. i can‚Äôt imagine a worse time (in my life) for this covid stuff: it was so bad at first when everyone had to stay away. but her emotional health became too fragile and we finally had to realize she‚Äôll die from loneliness if she doesn‚Äôt die of covid, so now my sisters come more regularly and wear masks, try to stay in the backyard, etc. to all of you caregivers out there who‚Äôve been forced to stay away because of this pandemic, i feel your pain. this was so hard already ‚Äî we really didn‚Äôt need or deserve to have this virus totally screw this situation up any more than it already is. love to all y‚Äôall. and thanks again."," wow. i hadn‚Äôt considered how bad the dynamic of a resentful husband can be.  my dad has early stage dementia, but lives alone. this sounds awful for everyone. denying her access to a therapist sounds abusive. he needs to be told that he doesn‚Äôt need to see the point to give her a ride. a social worker may need to do that. 1) call your state‚Äôs equivalent of agency on ageing2) alzheimers association is a good info clearinghouse, but they also frustrate me because they recommend recourses unavailable in my area. which i find irksome. adult daycare? nice idea. they recommend resources but don‚Äôt actually provide anything.3) adult protective services.4) find about medicaid waver in your state. advice:  you really need to simplify.  forget the dog, it‚Äôs fat. the husband will feed it. forget the optional (tea, c pap, mushroom stuff,  changing their home, white board) fight the one most important battle. if its meds, load the med box yourself, put it in the place and call her at med time every day until its a routine.  if its meds management, take her yourself. if it‚Äôs a walk or something the care giver can do,  tell her you are taking her on a walk on (time and date) and go on the walk with them both. do it again until it‚Äôs routine.  give the caregiver jobs. don‚Äôt  give hubs jobs or expect hubs to do it. he won‚Äôt.  sorry he‚Äôs a dick. your mom chose him too, on some level anyway.  you seem to have the fantasy that w/o hubs in the picture you would be able to take care of her better.  maybe, maybe not. think carefully before going for guardianship. he‚Äôs frustrated, ignorant and overwhelmed.  at the end of the day, what does he want? what will change the situation so he doesn‚Äôt have to be an abusive ass?  is it a divorce, or is it he just needs a break? maybe there are interventions that can help change awful to acceptable, if not good.  if you take her, she‚Äôs yours, for years. looking at that time horizon may make it easier to see if any social services can help. because it‚Äôs

"hey guys just found this sub, my grandfather has had dementia for a while and is deteriorating.in a recent bus ride into the city with my gran he missed his stop as my gran got off and has now been lost for about 36 hours in the city, the police are on it and there have been some sightings on cctv and such, while we await his hopefully safe return we have all been thinking about things that can help prevent this in the future.so to my question: 1. we we‚Äôre looking to get gps trackers potentially for both my gran and grandpa to prevent this kind of thing happening again, does anyone have any recommendations for reliable easy to use and convenient ones? 2. we want to get my gran a phone that she can use in emergency‚Äôs, she‚Äôs 80+ and not very tech savvy but knows how to use a tablet, any recommendations on something with a long battery life and easy to use, i don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything aimed at the elderly here.3. not exactly a tech question but if anyone else has any advice on how to help prevent any situations like this without moving him to a home i‚Äôd be really appreciative, just trying to stay productive and not worry.thanks for any help! this is in the uk btw if that matters"," hey there - that's super scary about your grandad. i hope he's found soon!i'm a bit of a tech skeptic when it comes to folks with dementia. this doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to find a solution, but i guess i'm here to urge a little caution unless you have very deep pockets... here's why:gps trackers are amazing. truly. the trick is getting your loved one with dementia to consistently wear/carry the tracker. my mum started disappearing before i moved in to be her caregiver, so i moved to gps trackers to try and keep tabs on her. thing was: she never wore watches or jewelry, so even when presented with beautiful trinkets she would take them off in less than a day, never to put them on again. i tried adding a tracker to her fancy cigarette case, but she recognized the square fob-like device as foreign to the case (without remembering that it was important or its purpose) and so would diligently pick at it until her case was restored to her memory of what it was meant to look like. i found some neat shoe-lace trackers, but she entered a phase in which she would hide her own shoes around the house and so wouldn't wear the same pair day to day. i got her a new wallet (she was in the habit of carrying a wallet) with a tracker, but she never recognized the new wallet as hers and wouldn't carry it. a long list of examples to say: if you're going to find a gps tracker for your grandfather, think carefully about what he's likely to actually carry/wear with him every day. you're going to have more luck, at least based on my experience, if you can find a way to add a tracker to something he already knows and carries in a way that he won't know it is there. (does he use a cane? unless he has many, that might be a good thing to explore?)regarding a cell phone for your grandmother, and also to perhaps open you up to other assistive devices, i'd encourage you to check out the alzheimer's store. here's an example of a simple phone that they sell:i know that your grandmother doesn't have dementia, but if you're looking for easy to use devices... they have some really great options. you'll find some other good simple cell phones on amazon. i'm in canada so the options you have available to you may be different, but i've heard good things about the jitterbug flip phone. on the alzheimer's store, you might also find some other things there that your grandfather might have some use for. again, though, i'd urge caution about new tech for your grandfather... learning how to use something new can be really difficult...hope this helps. best wishes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i59blj/tech_to_help_with_dementia/,Tech to help with dementia

"mom (73) has not been herself on several occasions and in early february, police called me (2 hours away) to her house to assist because she did not want her husband there.i forced the issue that day and miraculously eventually got her to her doctor's office and got a diagnosis of advanced dementia.since then, the police have been there several times for what are civil matters. most recently, in a bout of paranoia and rage, she was attempting to kick her husband out of the house and bit him as he was trying to restrain her.the police were called again and since she insisted she was healthy, she (and her husband) were charged with assault and disorderly conduct.again, the police called me (despite them both insisting i would not be called) and i was asked to help them come up with a plan.rather than discuss anything with me, my mother blamed me for what happened and called multiple times to leave messages to say she was disowning me and i think disinheriting me. she wasn't making a lot of sense, but i think that was her intent. i wasn't even there. i didn't call the police or even ask them to call me, all i did was answer my phone!now the county prosecutor has been calling me (again, unsolicited) and requesting that i intervene since my step dad has not taken any actions to handle the situation apart from getting a lawyer.of note, i was informed that the lawyer told the prosecutor that they think i am trying to get their money! i have no idea where this is coming from. i have never been one to ask for anything from my mom! she sometimes offers, i may protest, but she insists, so i allow it - such as when my late brother would ask for a few thousand for team uniforms for a bike race and she wanted to gift me an equal sum to make us ""even.""i want less responsibility in my life, not more! i do not want to tend to their finances.i did call their lawyer after the diagnosis to request a copy of her living will so i know what her medical wishes are, but that is only because she gave me a large package of their wills and trust documents, but despite my stepfather's living will being in the packet, hers was not.so, i guess i go up there this weekend to talk, but what do i do??? where do i even start?what if:1. they refuse to discuss it?2. stepdad may have started the poa process, but does not come up with an actual plan of what to do for her?3. they say they have a plan, but do not disclose what it is to me nor act on it?all of the above are very viable possibilities for this weekend and i am overwhelmed even thinking about it."," as the previous comment said consult an elder care lawyer.  if they won't discuss what's happening or have not formulated a plan the elder law lawyer can at least give you the questions to ask to get them started.  they  (your mother and stepfather) may very well be overwhelmed by the situation and don't know how to act or where to go for help.  you also might contact the county senior services department in their county to apprise them of the situation and tell them of your concerns.  when you say advanced dementia what does that mean?  did she go through cognitive testing and did those tests reveal that she is able to act on her own behalf?  if not the courts are able to assign guardianship.  is it a specific dementia?  there are many types and they present differently.  erratic behavior is a symptom of lewy body, frontotemporal lobe  and wernicke-korsakoff.in these situations knowledge is power and the more you know the more you can help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i50upt/what_am_i_supposed_to_do/,[deleted by user]
"hi guys, i have posted in here before about my grandfather making inappropriate comments towards me.i‚Äôm posting again as the past couple of weeks have been a nightmare, but today was the turning point of all. little background info: he suffers from lewybody &amp; dementia. a couple weeks ago he was very unwell. he had pancreatitis and gallstones, which was then told he needed an operation to move the gallbladder. he refused so he discharged himself after having a mental capacity test - they deemed him as fine. they promised to release my grandad with a care package, they didn‚Äôt. since he‚Äôs been home, his mobility as been horrendous. he is bed bound. lost a lot of weight. and all he is doing is laying in bed watching tv. i had to phone around to find some care as i can‚Äôt do it. i am not strong, physically and am no longer strong mentally. today, care workers started. he‚Äôs having 4 calls a day. however, today his catheter bag was blocked so i had to help him empty it and this meant by him walking to the toilet with his zimmer frame. as we were walking to the toilet, he said he was dizzy. i told him to stop and take a breather. this is when he became unresponsive and fell on me, i don‚Äôt know how but i managed to hold his weight. his legs were jelly and his eyes were wide open. i screamed multiple times for help but nobody came, so i had to just let my grandad fall because it was becoming a danger for the both of us. i ran outside and the postman came inside and helped - he called the ambulance. (could have done this myself easily, but i panicked. he looked dead. i thought he died in my arms and my brain wasn‚Äôt functioning. i was in a state of shock.)the ambulance came and his blood pressure was dangerously low. they deemed the house as not safe for him to be in, so they took him into hospital. my grandad came around before this and refused treatment, but i begged him to go in. so he did. i was hoping that this would give me time to figure out a better solution - it didn‚Äôt. he has been discharged and i feel so lost. so upset. like i can‚Äôt do this anymore. i‚Äôm drowning and i can‚Äôt get to the top to get air.the doctor and nurses say that everything is fine and i have nothing to worry about despite me telling them that everything is not fine. he is always falling, he is always so unwell (he will never be better, i get that) but they don‚Äôt seem to realise that his home isn‚Äôt safe. his social worker is the one deemed his mental capacity as fine &amp; i agree it is, but at the same time he doesn‚Äôt understand how some of his decisions can lead to serious issues - like discharging himself when he needed an operation, or like how him being in bed means he needs to stay in bed. like this morning, he screamed my name at 4am because he thought his catheter bag was full. it wasn‚Äôt and he was sat on the stairs, ripped it off his bits &amp; got really angry with me and refused to put it back on. he doesn‚Äôt remember this. how can a paramedic say his house isn‚Äôt safe for him and then a doctor act differently? i know it‚Äôs only been a day, but clearly something isn‚Äôt right. i have decided today that i can longer do this. i can‚Äôt sit around watching someone die - it isn‚Äôt fair. he doesn‚Äôt want me to go out and live my life and it makes me feel guilty. i love him so much but when i have 0 support from anyone, despite begging for it, i just can‚Äôt do it.i‚Äôve suggested a nursing home to my dad, but my dad is more concerned about money. he doesn‚Äôt want to lose his inheritance. but i also don‚Äôt want to lose my strength and end up with depression because i have dreams, i have aspirations and i am able to live them. but my mental health is getting worse because i am struggling to cope with him alone. he is stubborn and doesn‚Äôt listen to me. he is as good as gold with other people. has someone dealt with this before? how do i deal with terrible health care professionals? terrible parents? and a terrible illness at the same time? sorry lol i am just really sad and i just think hearing other experiences may make me feel less alone. i‚Äôm sorry"," here's a comment that was posted as a reply to my post--copying it here for you to see. seconded. look up senior services and adult protective services in your area and call them today. you need to say its an emergency, that he's in danger alone, and that you need immediate help. call his primary care doctor and tell them the same thing.don't downplay it.my father wandered into a neighbors locked fenced backyard and was attacked by their guard dog, and then didn't tell anyone about it until the next day when a home nurse had stopped by to check on him. he needed stitches and antibiotics but even then he left the hospital before everything was done because no one made him stay.has he been seen by a neurologist? if you can get a referral from his primary care for a neurologist to give him a cognitive test - it might take a few weeks for this but then you'll know what you are dealing with and also have a bench mark for his cognitive state.i'm out of state and was trying to dealing with my dad who turned out to have advanced dementia, and even with me and a neighbor calling aps and filing a report it was over a week before someone came out to check on him. by that time i had gotten him into memory care facility.(i didn't need to get guardianship in order to do this - i had the neurologist and his primary care write letters based on their tests of my father saying it was their professional opinion that he needed to be in 24/7 memory care and that it was not safe for him to live in his home even with a full time nurse. that along with already having a medical poa for him was enough to get him admitted, and yes, i talked to a lawyer first.)this is all too much to put on a grandkid, its not fair to you and i hope you set some boundaries with your dad and take some time for yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i4wo88/my_20f_grandad_83m_is_deteriorating_family_and/,My (20f) grandad (83m) is deteriorating.

my grandpa is on the decline with dementia and my grandma is his primary caregiver while she can manage him. i'm visiting for a week helping them get their house ready to sell and compile old photos and records on her computer.one of the biggest issues my grandma has to deal with is his diet coke addiction. whenever he wants a drink instead of grabbing his open bottle next to him he goes to the fridge to get an unopen bottle. next thing you know he has 5 open bottles next to him and gets defensive if you try to combine what's left of them into one bottle or put the warmest ones back in the fridge.my grandma would hide them in boxes or in the back of the fridge so they would be cold when he would want one. (he's very particular that they're cold). that's been working for a while but he's been finding the hiding spots recently. he gets into random things a lot too and my grandma is getting burnt out from it (understandably). are there things people on this sub have found that help situations like that? is it a good idea to continue to hide/lock his diet coke up? any suggestions with managing that?," also i would suggest to maybe not keep multiple bottles in the fridge? like maybe two, and storing the rest somewhere at room temperature so he wouldn't grab them. then, if he takes the second one, even though he's already opened the first, put the first one back in the fridge and so on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i4g8ia/advice_for_controlling_a_diet_coke_addict/,Advice for controlling a diet coke addict
"i think the title makes it clear but there‚Äôs a bit more to it. stepdad was diagnosed a year ago with early onset and he‚Äôs been gradually getting worse. it‚Äôs getting upsetting. mom has hired someone to help him twice a week and is planning to find a nursing home for him. she takes good care of him and makes sure that he gets exercise and stimulation. but in the mean time, i‚Äôm really worried about her own well-being and how she‚Äôs coping. dementia does not run in either sides of my family or in any of my extended family. it‚Äôs something we‚Äôve never faced. i dread visiting because i know my mom isn‚Äôt okay. it‚Äôs almost easier to talk to my stepdad than it is my mom. my mom is constantly negative, she absolutely cannot see the other side of things. she hates his children. she always reminds my stepdad that he forgets. yesterday, he got a call from his daughter and she was so angry about it. i thought it was sweet. she said his daughter is thinking about moving back and i said she should, mom disagreed. when stepdad tried to tell us about his conversation, she kept interrupting him with ‚Äúwe know that, you already told us.‚Äùit‚Äôs so upsetting for me to see her treat him this way (and i really don‚Äôt even have a close relationship with him). i know that her anger isn‚Äôt on purpose. i live an hour away so i‚Äôm not able to be there as much, i have no idea what it is like to live with him. and i know it‚Äôs gotten harder since mom moved to working from home because of covid. i suppose i could use some insight into what my mom is going through, because i can‚Äôt relate. i‚Äôm struggling a lot right now because i feel like a bad daughter, but i also know that i need to draw boundaries for my own sake."," i'm in a very similar boat to you, my mum has been my dad's full-time carer since his diagnosis almost 10 years ago. your mum is struggling to process so many things in relation to your step-dads diagnosis, add in the changes to her working situation and the world in general, and we can all appreciate that your mum is feeling very out of sorts. 1st thing to do is educate yourself about dementia: teepa snow and careblazers on youtube are good places to start.2nd thing is spend some time with your mum during her respite time, allow her to relax and have an honest conversation about this whole situation: her frustration is very understandable but can be very harmful to her future health.3rd is spend some time with your step-dad and if you can talk to your step-sister. find out her plans for caring for her dad or is she just wanting to see him more, knowing her thoughts you might able to give your mum reassurance that step- sister is wanting to help with step dad rather then become a 2nd burden on your mum. you don't mention any full siblings but if you and your step-sister can work together hopefully you can achieve something similar to my sister and i's pattern: she spends time with dad whilst i take mum. this extends to many situations from allowing my mum to attend a family funeral to giving my mum time to go shopping. please feel free to dm me if you have any questions or just need to vent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i40aaf/how_to_support_my_mother_while_she_is_caring_for/,How to support my mother while she is caring for stepdad with Alzheimer‚Äôs?
you guys will probably remember me from making a thread the other day about how i needed help convincing my mum to put my grandmother in a care home.this afternoon i saw her using my cantu curl cream as body cream and rubbing it on her legs and body. she has a fungal infection on her ankles and open lesions on both. she puts the hair cream in the open wounds. i obviously confiscated the cream as doctors had been trying to figure out why it wasn‚Äôt healing and this is *not* healthy. she started chasing after me and trying to manhandle the cream from me. i ran to the kitchen in fear of my life as she started threatening that she would harm me in our native language. then she started punching and assaulting me in the kitchen as i was backed to the sink and had no escape and she didn‚Äôt let me leave the kitchen. (my mum is at the gym so i‚Äôm alone). she reached for a knife but i managed to shut that down rather quickly.i have packed my bags and am waiting for my mum to get home from the gym so i can tell her about my departure. i draw the line at assault but assault over cantu? _no_ this truly is an evil disease but sometimes i wonder how much is dementia and how much is personal choice. (oh and if anyone is wondering i hid the cream in the pots closet).," i was just talking to care homes today as our doctor warned us a few weeks ago that he may eventually need to go to one. i've found a lot of places won't take care of a violent patient, so on top of telling your mom to find a home for her, you may also want to find someone a neurologist to find the right medications to calm the violent episodes.my dad has been violent in the past, and since covid started, he was getting really agitated and violent, even palming my brother hard in the chest and nearly knocking him over (he's still strong at almost 90!) we've been working with his neurologist on different medications and dosing, and found a balance that keeps his anxiousness and agitation down while not just making him a walking zombie. the home i spoke with today said they are willing to work with us if he gets violent again.i'm really sorry this happened to you. my dad has never been violent with me but there's been moments where he clenched his fist and looked like he wanted to punch me out. it's terrifying what this disease does to your loved ones.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i3lo5r/update_my_grandmother_just_tried_to_kill_me_up/,UPDATE: My Grandmother Just Tried to Kill Me Up Over Hair Cream

"hi, i‚Äôm writing on behalf of my father who is 57 (i‚Äôm 22) and has frontal temporal dementia. he is currently in a home right now on a ‚Äútrial run‚Äù for 30 days, since he went downhill quickly and we have no other choice at this point (it‚Äôs just me and my mom, she works and i go to school). they were so hesitant to let him into the home because the director stated that ‚Äúyounger dementia patients are more likely to be violent‚Äù and ‚Äúhe‚Äôd have to prove himself‚Äù and it made my blood boil. my father is so bad that he cannot dress himself or speak coherently anymore, but because of his age and how rare it is to see a younger person with dementia, they made assumptions. i completely understand wanting to keep your other residents safe, but more facilities need to realize that ftd can affect people of any age, even as young as 30.we are now at the mercy of the home for the next 30 days until we get a final word on if he can stay. after buying 1k worth of furniture to furnish his room, they can still turn him away. it‚Äôs crushing. has anyone else struggling with a loved one who has ftd experienced age discrimination?"," my sister has ftd and has been in memory care for two years.the staff may not understand or have explained it correctly, but people with ftd do have a greater likelihood of violence since the disease often affects both the social filter and impulse control.  they may be worried that a man in his 50's who develops aggressive behavior may be a greater physical threat to staff and other residents than someone in their 70's.  with younger people with ftd, it's not a meritless concern.in my sister's case, she was evicted from her memory care early this month due to two violent incidents against other residents.  no one was hurt (my sister is very healthy despite the ftd and only 66, but she is not strong), but they decided that she could not stay and there is a clause in the lease which allowed them to cancel it immediately.i don't really blame them for kicking her out, but it was sudden and unexpected.  i found another memory care home that is better able to handle people with ftd and those with difficult behaviors - something i didn't know existed when i first looked for a home for my sister.given my experience, my advice is this, assuming your dad passes their 30-day trial:\- examine the lease/resident agreement closely and interrogate the staff about what specific conditions or events would trigger an eviction clause.  make it very clear to them that you expect to be notified immediately if/when your dad exhibits any aggressive behavior.\- have a plan b.  at least get some research done on another facility in case your dad has to move on short notice.  there are memory care homes that are better able to deal with ftd - try to find one in your area.  i live in colorado and at least here those facilities have staff with additional training, have a 24/7 a rn on staff, the ability to give prn meds, and some kind of association with behavioral health hospital.just as general advice, based on my experience, i think it's critically important for your family to sit down with staff and let them know your expectations for care and especially communications wit you.  i would put your expectations in writing and send it to their executive director as well.  i've found that memory care homes, especially with the additional burden of covid, are often not good about communicating what is going on with your loved one.  and since visiting is so much more difficult (or impossible, in the case of my state, since homes are closed to outsiders), you will not be able to check on things yourself as much as you normally would be able to.to use an old ronald reagan phrase (before your time if you're 22): ""trust, but verify"" everything the facility does concerning care for your dad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i1hrlb/ftd_and_age_discrimination/,FTD and Age Discrimination
"my mother (mid 60s) has always been a bit of a flake but we‚Äôve noticed an increase in the forgetfulness and a change in her general behavior/ moods/ reasoning in the last 6 months-year. we‚Äôve gently brought up several times over the last month making an appointment w neuro just to get a baseline and see if there‚Äôs any cause for concern. my father made the appointment for a month out and he let her know. she is furious with us claiming we never talked about this and how we think she‚Äôs losing her mind. she now refuses to speak with us. any and all advice will be considered, i want to be sure i‚Äôm navigating this in the best way."," i‚Äôll second the idea about fibbing. also, my lo has such impaired short term memory that i can keep practicing the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer until i find the one that works the best. she brings up the same topics, conversations, and accusations repeatedly but because she doesn‚Äôt remember having the conversation i can respond a little differently each time until i find the best way to have that conversation with her. it is excruciating on my end but the better i can do at living in her reality, the easier it is for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i1d55f/mom_doesnt_even_remember_weve_talked_about_making/,Mom doesn‚Äôt even remember we‚Äôve talked about making her a neurology appointment
"so my grandmother (80+) takes medication that specifically say she has to take with food. in years past, this was not an issue because she was such a foodie. lately, however, she doesn't seem to want to eat much of anything. this is especially hard in covid-19 time, since she is a super duper vulnerable population member. my dad, mom, and i try to make/buy things that she likes (or requests in her super lucid moments!), but it usually ends with her picking at the food and maybe eating the side stuff like yogurt or fruit, then having us put it in the fridge ""for later.""we've tried making meals she likes and eating with her, but she'll only take a few bites, all the while making a kinda yuck face. so, we'll buy food from her favorite place (like five guys) and sit to eat with her, but she'll drink the milkshake and not eat the food. as you can imagine, it gets frustrating at best because that's a lot of food money, and worrying at worst because she is not eating and getting weak. not to mention the fact that she will come in and angrily tell us how hungry she she is while literally rejecting every option she is given. another issue is that as much as she likes sweets (usually the only thing she's guaranteed to eat), we can't give her sweets all day because we've only recently gotten to the point where she doesn't have to regulate her blood sugar with insulin.i'm completely tapped out here. what exactly should we do?"," we made milkshakes for my dad using ensure or boost - plus milk, ice cream, plus whatever fruit or flavor he wanted.  one favorite was peanut butter powder, so that‚Äôs a protein win.  his doctor said that at a certain point in their lives any calorie is a good calorie, just get them to eat anything (but he didn‚Äôt have diabetes).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i1bmkr/how_do_you_deal_with_a_hangry_senior_who_doesnt/,How Do You Deal with a Hangry Senior Who Doesn't Want to Eat?
"my mom is 78. she‚Äôs had a slow decline dementia for at least 5 years. but before covid, she was mostly still there. needs help with cleaning, laundry, getting places, medicine taking, cooking, etc, but she always remembered us, got around fine, took care of herself and cat fine. she‚Äôs been in an assisted living for 4 years and doing great, with friends and visits and a new life built there. then covid lockdown. about a month and a half ago, i had to take her to the emergency room for dehydration. 4 days and back out but i noticed she was having trouble keeping food down and really low appetite. two weeks later, she collapses at her al and back in the er for more severe weakness and dehydration. they told me she wasn‚Äôt eating much or drinking at all but had her on iv fluids. they found a c.diff infection and began treatment. went to a rehab place after dehydration was fixed but hospital offered no reason for her lack of appetite and throwing up most things she ate. rehab recommended hospice. a week in rehab saw her continue to decline so back to the hospital again where they were trying to get a gi specialist to look at her but covid lockdown meant no outside doctors. i would have to take her to a specialist. they recommended hospice again. so now she‚Äôs on hospice at my house. no appetite, and anything she might eat/drink, like ensure, comes right back up. water mostly comes back up, too. but she‚Äôs still there mostly. remember us, remembers things, loves on her grandson. i feel like i haven‚Äôt done enough. like i need to take her to a specialist, but she‚Äôs so weak at this point she sleeps most of the day and can‚Äôt get out of bed without help. i feel like i‚Äôve failed her. like i‚Äôve given up when i could still fight for her. like there‚Äôs more to do. there‚Äôs no diagnosis beyond ‚Äúalzheimer‚Äôs‚Äù when i‚Äôve asked. i‚Äôm starting to question my decisions. have i done the right thing?"," it sounds like you‚Äôve done a wonderful job meeting her needs at each step with the best information you had at the time, which is all any of us can do. in your shoes, i would try to get my loved one evaluated by her primary physician to rule out something like a uti as the cause of her decline, and i would also ask about getting an order for a hospice evaluation, too, and ask around for recommendations on great hospice providers in your area. a decreased appetite is one of the symptoms that can signal a patient‚Äôs transition, but this is a good time to rule out any other potential issues that should be addressed. separately, electing for hospice benefits doesn‚Äôt mean anyone has failed in properly caring for their loved one, and it won‚Äôt accelerate your mom‚Äôs decline, but it can help ensure the quality of her remaining time, and you‚Äôll get support to establish a plan for her to remain at home if that is her wish and yours. i encourage you to explore the full range of resources available to your mom and go easy on yourself as you do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i1bkal/my_moms_stopped_eating_and_doctor_recommended/,My mom‚Äôs stopped eating and doctor recommended hospice.

"hi, my boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother has advanced dementia and i‚Äôm going to start caring for her during the day time while he and his uncle work. most of the time she doesn‚Äôt know she needs to be taken care of, so if you offer to do something for her she‚Äôll refuse. she‚Äôll insist on doing things her way even though my instructions are to make sure she doesn‚Äôt... like putting away dishes that weren‚Äôt cleaned properly or putting things in weird places. you can go behind her and redo it but if she notices she will get aggravated. she also follows people around when they do chores and gets upset if they aren‚Äôt doing it the way she thinks it should be done. it‚Äôs also hard to distract her with things like coloring books and puzzles. they‚Äôre either too confusing for her to understand or she feels insulted for ‚Äúbeing treated like a child.‚Äù i‚Äôm anticipating having to constantly explain my presence to her when she doesn‚Äôt want it. i‚Äôve taken care of her before and i know i‚Äôm expected to be in the same room with her most of the day with the exception of bathroom breaks/small chores so that i can hear her if she falls. so if she tells me to leave i really won‚Äôt be able to... but i also don‚Äôt want to provoke her.in your experience, what is the best way to work with a person who refuses things like meals when they aren‚Äôt capable of cooking many things for themselves? what should i do if she tells me to go away? typically i would go to my boyfriend or someone else who is closer to her and ask them to talk to her, but i will be home alone with her five days a week this time around. i‚Äôm very nervous about being able to find a balance between being able to take care of her properly and knowing how to preserve what independence she‚Äôs got. i don‚Äôt want to offend her by constantly reminding her that i need to take care of her because she‚Äôll yell that she‚Äôs grown and doesn‚Äôt need it. but i also don‚Äôt want to be a bad caregiver by doing the wrong thing... i just wish i knew what the ‚Äúright‚Äù (or least aggravating) responses were. any advice?"," sounds like she needs to have her anti-depressants adjusted.  until she's able to be calm and rational, could you get a radio and play calming music from her childhood?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i16v7n/advice_on_caring_for_someone_who_refuses_help/,Advice on caring for someone who refuses help please

"hello, everyone.   i've never posted on reddit before, so i apologise if i do anything wrong, or against the reddit social etiquette. however, lately, i've been falling into a mild morbid curiosity with dementia, and listened to the album *everwhere at the end of time,* which, though disturbing - intrigued me and made me truly feel sympathy for people who have been affected by this disease - either by having it or having loved ones have it. anyways - it led me to research dementia more and i've had a sudden realisation that my grandmother seems to be having some potential would-be symptoms. for reference; she's an alcoholic in her late 60s/early 70s and has smoked her entire life. my family have tried to get her to stop drinking. she lies about it a lot and pretends she isn't, but we know she drinks. the point of me mentioning this is i read alcoholism and smoking increase chances of dementia happening. anyways, some things she's been doing;\- she confuses family members. at first, this has just been confusing my cousins and me - which i always assumed was a ""normal old person thing"" since she has 4 grandchildren. however she's started doing it with my dad, my uncle, other members of the family, etc.\- she has always been meek and feeble. but the few times i've seen her, recently, she's been even more sad and quiet than usual. ""recently"" meaning within the past 2-3 years. she tries to make small talk, sometimes, but these days (i last saw her about 2 weeks ago at my uncle's house for a birthday party) she hardly even seems to be keeping up with conversations - it feels, to me, like she's just nodding her head and pretending to understand what everyone else is talking about. sometimes it takes several times to get her attention and get her to snap out of her mind. \- she struggles with making decisions. whether big or small, she cannot be trusted to make choices by herself because she'll change her mind from one second to the next. she's engaged, but she seems to *sometimes* utterly hate her fiance (other times she's perfectly happy) , and it's been told to us by my uncle that apparently she's gotten violent with him before (with her fiance), i.e throwing things, etc. we always assumed that's because she was drunk, but now it has me wondering...\- she forgets she does things. like, sometimes simple things, but for example, she will drink, or lately; buy cigarettes, smoke them, and then lie about it, except it truly feels like she is convinced she did not smoke at all, even though the corner shop vendor saw her do it (and he knows my uncle and told him about her smoking)\- though not too common, there are times when she'll call my father up late at night crying and screaming about how evil my uncle is. granted, my uncle *is* a shitty excuse for a human being (petty thief who we're pretty sure has a drug problem, 3 kids, and crazy schemes) however it usually always turns out she's either making things up, lying or exaggerating, except when she's talking about it (usually at night) she seems utterly convinced he did this or did that.   not long after this, if my dad tries to solve/figure out the situation that my grandma is deeply distressed by, my grandmother will suddenly be perfectly okay and is at my uncle's beck-and-call once again, stating that she herself was just 'overreacting'. \- lastly, she just...'feels' like she has her head lost in a fog? like she's there, physically with us - but it scarcely feels like she's *there*. this situation is...specific, i suppose. everyone in my family assumed (including me) this was just her heavy drinking influencing her because alcoholism has been her signature thing since before i was born (i'm 18). however now i'm growing up and realising things have been going downhill for quite a while, now, and now i'm starting to feel nervous.i'm sorry if i'm bothering anyone - thank you for reading, if you got this far. i've never known anyone with dementia, before, so i have no idea how it manifests itself besides research. hopefully, of course, my anxious thoughts and analysation of her is wrong and she's perfectly okay - except i can't help but feel like it's very well possible.people in both sides of my family generally don't make it to 80. be it because of liver failure, cancer, tumours, heart disease or other - so we've never really had a chance to even 'see' if it's a hereditary condition since most people in my family have not survived to an age where dementia becomes more commonly developed.i apologise if i seemed in any way disrespectful, as well.  i'm very much worried about her - we've had a rocky relationship due to her substance abuse problems, but she's still my grandmother and growing up as her first grandchild i have many fond memories with her. tldr; i'm wondering about initial dementia symptoms in women aged 60 - 70+, in fear my alcoholic and life-long smoker grandmother might be developing it.", *whom* we're,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/i0kybu/initial_symptoms/,Initial symptoms?

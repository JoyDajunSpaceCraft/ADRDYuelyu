exercise helps prevent dementia by oxygenating the brain.  how often must one exercise to prevent dementia?, exercise reduces inflammation too - both in the body and the brain. a pro-inflammatory cellular environment is correlated with dementias and probably also propogates the disease,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cg5n6r/how_often_should_someone_exercise_to_prevent/,How often should someone exercise to prevent dementia?
"i haven’t posted to reddit in years, literally. i visit when i have an issue - i think i have two separate accounts, i have no idea. sorry for my lack of involvement in such an amazing community. sharing and intimacy are not my strong point.i put my 82 yr mom (she has dementia, copd, and stage 4 kidney disease)and her brother in assisted living july 3, 2019.  he died from a massive heart attack two days after i moved him in. this is a whole other sad, separate story. i feel so terrible about that, but this post is mainly about my mom. the only positive thing about my uncle’s passing is the money he left my mom in his life insurance. without that, she wouldn’t be able to afford care at all. life brings gifts through loss - i’ve been seeing that more and more since i’ve gotten older.she resents me for moving her there. every day i get two phone calls or more. one is to tell me that she no longer likes me, that i’ve broken her heart, abandoned her. the next call is a teary apology full of self loathing - this one saddens me the most. the last thing i ever wanted to do was hurt my mom - i moved her to keep her safe. i live 3000 miles away from her, my brother lived 45 minutes away from her and was no help. i have always handled everything - paid her bills, i set up a caretaker when she lived at her home, arranged her doctor’s appointments, visited 2-3 times a year, gave her money when she ran out  (social security is a joke).i don’t need a pat on the back for any of this. i did it because it’s what you do for someone you love. i often did this from other countries - my work involves travel. sometimes i don’t even know how i managed to do all of the things. i know it’s going to take time for her to adjust. i am so anxious about her, so sad that she’s unhappy. the relief i’ve felt knowing she’s taken care of has been surpassed by this tremendous sadness and guilt. i’m grateful to find this community and have taken great comfort in reading posts. i can only hope this will all get better in time."," don't be so quick to put uncle's money in mom's name if she has little assets. my wife got my mother into a very nice home that accepts her ss and the ssi wife got her on a few months ago. talk to a lawyer. don't feel guilty. as a patient, i will feel guilty if i didn't end it when i can no long care for myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cfw8qb/guilt/,Guilt
"using a throw-away for anonymity. mil is in her late 50s and has lewy body dementia. she used to live with her dad in another state, but he definitely couldn’t take care of her, and her health was declining rapidly because of this. she was hospitalized twice last year and had at least one flair up of scabies. his house is the dirtiest i’ve ever seen. we decided about 6 months ago that it was time she come live with us. it’s not been going well. our lives just aren’t compatible with having her live here. we have a toddler and we’ll be having another baby soon, and they have to be our top priority. i’m not going into all the details on why she can’t live here anymore, but i’m sure you can all understand how difficult her being in our home has been. she hates it here also, she tells us she’s going back to her dad’s all the time. but what are our options? she’s not bad enough for a nursing home, memory care assisted living centers are only private pay, and she has no money, and there’s no one else she can live with. we know that if we even try to discuss anything with her family (her dad, siblings, and her other son, none of which are helping at all financially or physically), they’ll all guilt my husband into keeping her here (which i think is bs, i would have cut most of them off a long time ago if it were me). i’d love to hear some ideas about where she could live that’s not in my house. we’re all absolutely miserable and we just can’t live like this anymore."," i'm in a similar situation with my mom. she has medicaid, but not bad enough off for a nursing home or foster care home. she was assessed and based on her level of care, she qualifies for only an arch (adult residential care home) that will accept social security only. there is no resource to help place her in an arch. there is a list of 400 residential care homes in my area and it's up to me to call and ask if they will accept only her social security as payment. many only accept private pay. she has no other money.i'm sure every state is different. i'm in hawaii.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cfoizx/she_cant_live_here_anymore_what_are_our_options/,"She can’t live here anymore, what are our options?"
anyone else here mainly raised by a parent with early onset dementia? my dad was pretty absent in my adolescence so i was mostly raised by my mom. we didn't know at the time (thought it was just ms)  but for most of my life she had dementia. she was formally diagnosed when i was 17. growing up with her was really difficult and i think it has caused me a lot of mental health issues as an adult. i feel like i should have handled it all better and not let it affect me so much because it's not like she had cancer or anything really bad. sorry for rambling but i guess i just want to know if anyone else has had issues due to being raised by a parent with dementia. i feel like it really affected me but i also feel like it's my fault that it affected me so much.," my dad was diagnosed when i was in my early/mid twenties. looking back i wonder how much stuff that happened in my teens was part of his personality and how much of it was dementia. it's extremely hard to deal with and it's not your fault that it affected you, there's no way you could have experienced that without being affected. it's hard and often traumatic at any age but on top of that, since you were still a kid, you probably didn't get all your needs met which does affect mental health in adulthood for most people. plus most young people aren't usually dealing with a parent with dementia and it can be very overwhelming and isolating to be in that position (at least it was for me). in my case i've found it has been helpful to think about it as a grieving process. even though my dad is not completely physically gone there have been many smaller deaths of parts of him, and letting myself grieve those deaths has helped me to heal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cfbgl8/raised_by_parent_with_super_early_onset_dementia/,raised by parent with super early onset dementia

"my mom is always hungry. consumes everything. pouts like a child if someone is eating in front of her and she doesn't get any, *right after she was given food.* says she's hungry right after having been fed, and then gets irritable and says she's never fed and that she's barely had any food. typical dementia stuff, i know. so i'm making kung-pao chicken for myself. typically a meal i consider too spicy for my parents. my dad says they've both eaten, so i go okay i'm making this for myself. he then decides i have to make extra for my mom. i'm 35 years younger than my dad, and 40 years younger than my mom. i eat more than both of them, always have. i used to be accused of over-eating, when in reality, much of the time.. i was just still hungry. metabolisms vary among people, but my parents never really took that into consideration. this package says ""about 3 servings"" and like... i can eat all of it myself. all of it will about cover my hunger.  sometimes maybe i eat a little less of it, but not by much. now i have to split it up for my mom, and then some for my dad. i'm just so frustrated with this set-up. most of the time when my dad makes meals, there's never enough for me, but i'm always expected to be prepared to make extra for at least my mom. i think just little things are setting me off right now. i've got my orientation for university tomorrow, and it's going to be an all-day affair. i'm terrified i'll just have an anxiety attack and break down crying going over something simple and make myself look like an idiot in front of all of these kids *years* younger than me. my only saving grace is that i look their age. i don't know if i can afford it. still don't have a job, and i only look for one half-heartedly. i don't want to come home to my mom after a hard day at work or school. my dad can do it, but i'm not him. i can't see things the same way he can."," it's made me gain a ton of weight and i mostly order premade and restaurant food, so also in debt now. mom will ruin perfectly good food cause she doesn't like it so she makes it paletable so she can eat it before it goes bad (1hr old). like the from-scratch alfredo i made. she dumped canned chicken and boxed mac n cheese and raisins in it for some reason.can you get a little fridge?get a container set she cannot open. like b07gxz8jbh on amazon. we also have some glass ones she cannot open. doesn't prevent her hiding them or trying to get into them or leaving them on the counter, but if you can put a small personal fridge in another room or under a child lock, that will help immensely. ones with sharp edges or air tight ones she struggles with.mom has days where she eats very little, and apparently her diabetes is still fine so ... idk. we will remind her she just ate and if it is followed by a temper tantrum we'll give her something else. maybe work on what she's eating, and portion control to control the pace of food, make sure protein is huge on it cause it'll fill her up. but we know it's probly not hunger, it's stress.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cejsxq/this_is_such_a_silly_thing_to_rant_about_but_its/,This is such a silly thing to rant about but it's on my mind

"let me first start off by saying that i love my father very much, please don't take this to many any different.i grew up in a house with 4 sisters and me being the only boy. i rarely had any responsibilities at all growing up since i was much younger than my sisters were and they for some reason were asked to do everything around the house. this was the worse thing my parents could have done to me though! i am now 35-years-old and had to move back in to take care of my mother who had copd and my father who has alzheimer's disease. my mom passed away in february and i miss her dearly but at the same time, i thought that meant that would get sort of a break. i was mistaken, severely.after my mom's death, dad's alzheimer's disease took a turn for the worse. it's as if he skipped an entire stage somehow. he is now at the beginning toward middle of stage 6 so he can't do much at all for himself. as i said before, i have four sisters but they don't help at all. they 'may' visit once every 2 months or so for an hour at a time. i am mentally disabled myself so taking care of my own self is hard enough as it is. i often bounce from panic attack to panic attack and my ocd gets the best of me at times. here lately though, i've been having dark thoughts. i'll get to the point throughout the day where i just need a break so bad but i have no way of having a break and i start thinking about how happy i would be to die. this scares me. i have talked to my psychiatrist and got started on a new anti-depressant but it never feels like enough.income is also something that my sisters should be helping me with but won't. i'm on the disability so i don't get much income for myself at all and then with dad's i get about $800 a month but it's all gone the second it comes in for bills. i feel as though i am struggling to keep floating above the water but feel as though i keep getting dragged below the surface nonstop. i'm sorry to complain like this but i suppose i just needed a place to vent. it is my opinion that it shouldn't cost money to get old. it does though, majorly so. caretaking a parent is hard enough as it is but money struggles seem to just make it worse.does anyone have any good suggestions to help make my day to day life better? i just need to cope better. :("," wish i had advice to give, going through something very similar with my mom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cdmlgg/im_so_depressed/,I'm So Depressed!

(yes, i have blue eyes which my mother loves and kind of always obsessed over) i’m trying to cut and paste lyrics and i keep wanting to share more cause it’s not just one stanza.*but my dreams they aren't as empty**as my conscience seems to be**i have hours, only lonely**my love is vengeance**that's never free*&amp;#x200b;*when my fist clenches, crack it open**before i use it and lose my cool*&amp;#x200b;*no one knows what its like**to feel these feelings**like i do**and i blame you**no one bites back as hard**on their anger**none of my pain and woe**can show through*i do get mad at dad for ignoring things, but i have gotten better with not getting mad at mom. frustrated, yeah, but like tonight i just rolled my eyes and reminded myself she acts like we’d starve her but we take good care of her. i rant to my friends, and to twitch. we all get angry at the situation and it’s just so damn useless. people try to understand, know the big things, but you can’t know what it’s like to take mom’s keys away, take the spoiled food away, fight with someone who’s survived for 68yrs without my help thank-you-very-much and say no, you’re doing what i say right now.and i thought no one understands, though they try to.but i thought y’all might understand  &lt;3thanks for listening &lt;3"," i just wanted to share that i have a song that similarly hits me so hard whenever i listen to it. i can't even read the lyrics without tearing up. i spent the day with dad yesterday and i'm happy when we have those good days but i'm forever missing the short amount of time when we had a normal adult (well kind of adult, i'm only 26) relationship and i just hope he's proud of me, and knows i love and appreciate everything about him. even during the times where i was a hopeless brat. check it out if you feel like blubbering for a bit more - ""helpless son"" by said the whale.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ccyz0e/when_a_song_punches_you_in_the_gut/,when a song punches you in the gut
"i have not had any alcohol since june 25th.  my mother in law with dementia who had been living with us for over 2 1/2 years was recently placed in a nursing home yesterday.  my husband is the one who got her admitted and is struggling with guilt, and anger, and greiving.  i have been taking care of her consistently several days a week for months now and it has effected my mental health.  i was drinking to cope with the stress of her being here.  she was not easy to deal with and often tried to walk away.  we couldn't let that happen because we live ina  rural area near main roads and she would get lost and possibly run over since she has not a concept of danger.  he came home last night and asked me to leave and said he couldn't deal with me so i did.  today he was been in a bad mood bordering on needing to go somewhere for help.  i drove past a liquor store 4 times today.  i made sure to be on the phone with a supportive friend so i can honestly say i didn't drink when that would be my solution in the past.  my husband is hurt and angry with me and my kids.  he called me selfish.  he says he doesn't feel like i care about him.  i wake him up. make his coffee, make his lunch, keep the laundry done, cook supper, do dishes.  i have been cuddling with him extra and even left social engagements early so tath i could hang out with him and make him feel supported.  i wish i knew where i went wrong.  but i didn't drink, and i so want to.  the store by my house is closed so i am home waiting for my meds to kick in so i can go to sleep.  i just need someone to give me advice on how to prove that i care about him.  what can i do to make h im believe that?  he, my son, my daughter and myself are in therapy seperately and sometimes together.  the main point of contention is that my son is trying to assert his independence and my husband wants to try to have more control over him.  but i didn't drink.  i have therapy wednesday and he has it tuesday.  i may see if i can get him to come to my session and do a littel marriage work.  i know a lot of this wall of text has nothing to do with drinking, per se, but in teh past i would be drunk right now so i didn't have to feel.  iwndwyt"," caring for a person is a huge responsibility, we often deny to admit the fact that caregiving takes a huge toll on our social, economic and personal life and relations, but it’s true for all of us. no exceptions. but let me tell you something, it’s very noble of a profession (if you’re entitled to earn some bucks through it) and no one can deprive you of the emotional reward it provides.as a society, we’ve always survived depending on and providing for others in our proximity. caregiving can be of various trajectories, for an alzheimer’s patient, it starts with keeping an eye on them and gradually increases to the extent of feeding them and wiping their butts(sorry!). for a cardiac patient, the trajectory rises for a certain time and drops significantly after a while. it’s not easy, but taking care of ourselves is not less important to keep our dear ones healthy and sound.caregiving will definitely change how your life looks. but life is full of twists and turns and unexpected detours. if you love the person you are caring for, it makes a difference. it’s your perspective that matters. you can accept this change in your plans and deal with it the best you can, or you can be bitter and resentful. taking on this challenge will not necessarily “ruin your life,” but it will change it.you can check out these very much effective 400 breakthrough stress elimination strategies to help recompose yourself.here we go with 7 tips for you to survive the long term journey of caregiving,1. getting a helping hand the first thing you can do to get some “own time” is to get someone help you, always make yourself open to communities and ask for help from your friends and families.your spouse is the one needing care? ask his brother to come over and watch a football match with him once a week, your mother needs your help? ask someone to take care of them for some time and insist them to take money for it, that way they’ll not be thinking of it as a charity and will be ready to help you again.don’t hesitate to ask for help if you don’t want to develop depression yourself and come to my blog every now and then. paying a wage to them will surely help you cope up with the thoughts about bothering them and their thought process.you can get caretakers on a part-time basis too to help you or at least for cleaning and other household chores.2. getting rid of worries and letting go you have a job in hand, an almost full-time job, an exhausting profession, but you don’t always have to keep worrying about it. it’s not easy to see someone very close to you becoming someone else altogether and not recognize you, seeing someone very active in their lives becoming incapable to even brush their teeth in the morning. i know the hardship, but once you get a hang of it, you start to understand the limitations of past naive you who was determined to fix everything for them. it’s not gonna happen.get this self help ebook or you can read the anxiety and worry workbook from amazon too.3. getting enough exercise leave the couch, let them sleep for 30 minutes and run for the gym, tell your friend to keep an eye on them for the time being and just run if you want. this will not only help keep you in shape but will help you to relieve the frustrations and mental toxicities out.you will obviously be tired after all-day-long caregiving, so don’t think big, just take a walk around the block or do some cardio in a park. exercises videos help a lot, you can arrange a mat and start doing exercise at home itself without letting the vulnerable ones leaving alone.give this a go in case you are not able to get out of the house, but as i’ve said earlier, get a helping hand to take care of them and go outside.did you know that exercise has several benefits on mental health too?and do not forget strength training. go to the gym at least thrice a week.4. gifting yourself a holiday go hiking! go backpacking! go with friends! go solo! go anywhere! go everywhere! just go.if you can, even if you don’t want to leave them alone, even if you don’t or can’t depend on anyone, just trust them once and let yourself enjoy. get in contact with local communities and services to provide care for 3-4 days, make them understand the schedule and arrange the medicines beforehand and trust me, they do a pretty good job, they have enough experience to care for your loved ones.don’t forget to make yourself available. keep your cellphone charged and provide the numbers of your friends if possible.we have a pretty good guide for you to get started.5. getting a hobby maintaining a hobby can be difficult for caregivers, but what do you do when they sleep? what do you do when they get busy watching the tv? do you not think those are the right time to refind yourself and get into something recreational?what kind of hobby are you talking about?let me get you a list then,art and craft: if you had a passion for pencils and brushes ever, this is for you. get into the world of greys and colors and leave the worries behind for the sake of yourself, just let the reflection of your mind scratch the canvas, not your life. music: piano, guitar, drums, accordions, flutes, whatever you seem fit, there is an online tutorial for it, not one, there are several free basic tutorials. let me know in the comments if you need any links to any courses, i’ll be more than happy to provide those for you. photography: get a camera, any camera, start leaving the house more often and start clicking, a well-composed photo can give you more pleasure than 100 episodes of tv shows. you can “crowd” your walls with your own photos too. this is the only guide you will ever need to start clicking and improving yourself. cooking: can’t get out of home? no problem. start cooking for yourself. there are several websites like tasty to help you with recipes and step by step videos. gardening 6. socialize more the same old advice. don’t keep your frustrations and worries to yourself, share them with your friends, invite them home, pour yourselves drink, talk. go out with them occasionally, make new friends, ask them for help, just don’t strain yourself with your own emotional burden.appreciation of life, personal growth, enhanced self-efficacy, competence or mastery, self-esteem, and closer relationships are some of the positive psychological effects of caregiving, but it’s also to notice that caregivers are more often to notice depression and anxiety than non-caregivers and many of the times, the effects don’t wear off soon.more social caregivers have been less prone to develop psychological effects than their counterparts and have observed to be less prone to sustain the effects of the caregiving period.7. food and sleep when you’re a caregiver, taking care of yourself can sometimes fall by the wayside. but keeping yourself healthy is equally important. if you don’t eat healthy, your mind isn’t as sharp as it needs to be for the people who need you most. here are some tips for you to stay in a healthy diet,always have breakfast and make breakfast the heaviest meal of the day rich with protein and fat to ensure the supply of energy and endurance throughout the day. include eggs, meat, fish into your diet alongside vegetables and whole fruits. maintain everything in good proportions. don’t eat too much or too little, give yourself enough time to chew the food. don’t forget to drink enough water. prepare meals ahead of time to not get into confusion and mess. use electrical accessories if possible, you have someone vulnerable to fire, remember? keep easy to make, precooked mills handy. get enough sleep throughout the day, if your priorities are keeping you awake, consult the physician and get them something to sleep better.get yourself comfortable bedding, make a playlist of soothing music and let your body rest the whole night, at least 8 hours.i wrote this in my blog once [carenconcern.com](",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ccxue9/confusion/,COnfusion
"my mom has always been a very social person, constantly talking on the phone or to whomever might be around the house. these days, a lot of her talking is gibberish and i'm at my wits' end. it's mentally taxing on me to try to decipher what she intends to say or to continually tell her that i don't understand her words and it's taxing on her because of the frustration that she isn't making sense to me. because she has always been such a talker, this will go on for 30 minutes to an hour without a break. it seems that the only thing that snaps her out of it is if it escalates to the point where i'm yelling or she's frustrated to the point where she is in tears. obviously that is not an ideal way for either of us to handle given the frequency of these episodes. just looking for any tips on how you guys have handled with your loved ones, i'm at my breaking point."," i have a lady like this at work who is like this, you cannot possibly converse like you once did. i find the best thing is to agree a lot, say something like ...that's all been sorted out you don't have to worry about it...

"i seem to only visit this subreddit when i'm in crisis, and for that i apologize. &amp;#x200b;i am my mother's sole caretaker. i'm here 24/7. i do literally every task needed to keep her healthy, happy, and clean. i'm happy to do it. i was a little shit growing up and she had my back, so this is how i pay her back. the only time i ever ask anyone else to do anything is perhaps a few times a month when i need to pick up her prescriptions and she can't be left alone. actually that's a good starting point for my grievances. imagine if your sibling, who was employed and in their 40's, made you pay them gas money every time you need their help with transpo for your mother. we're not talking every day, maybe twice a month. she lives 10 minutes away. this same person pulled themselves out of corporate america because they ""couldn't deal with the stress"" and now has free section 8 housing, our dad leased a car for her, and she works part time as a hostess at a restaurant. that's all fine and dandy (except when she's short on her bills and manipulates my mother into letting me give her some cash; even if it means we have to go without, because my mom has no idea what's going on with her bills.).   if i say no, i'm the asshole in my mom's eyes. if i stick up for myself, i'm the asshole in my mom's eyes. remember this part, it's important.  &amp;#x200b;on top of that, she comes over to ""give me a break"" a few times a week. let me explain to you what that consists of. she brings her dog (which forces my dog to have to stay locked up in a bedroom for most of the day, multiple days in a row.). the dog chases my elderly cats around and eats all of their expensive specialized food. she smokes all of my marijuana, which costs me a fortune, but is needed on hand to keep myself and my mother calm on rough days. my mom has rage issues. i have depression/anxiety. she smokes all of that stuff knowing that we're going to have to go without. she never offers us a dime. i am a  pretty good cook, and so i feed her 3 meals from scratch along with my mom every time she comes over to ""help"". listen, she basically lays on her back like shes on vacation for 72 hours. she even asks me to take her own dog out for her while she's staying in my house. i put up with all of it because the alternative is having my mom take her side and flip the fuck out on me. &amp;#x200b;the other night i got sick of eating shit and started yelling about what a sociopath she was, in front of my mom. my mom took her side and left our home with her. what should have been a rare 12 hour break for me ended up being filled with calls from my mom, alternately telling me she missed me or what a piece of shit i was. oh the kicker was that they ate out, and she dyed my mom's hair, and then asked me to fucking pay for it; when mom shouldn't have even been gone in the first place. she's on a strict daily routine to help make her feel more comfortable. ughghghghakjdhf&amp;#x200b;this whole thing is maddening. i have like no rights to keep anyone away. my sister is truly detrimental to my mother's well being, but my mom can't remember (or just doesn't care) about all the bad behavior the sister exhibits. i don't really expect any solutions. just ranting, because it helps to type this all out.", rant on!  and hide your marijuana when she comes over.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cby0tf/does_anyone_else_have_a_sibling_that_makes_caring/,Does anyone else have a sibling that makes caring for your parent actively harder than it should be?

"so my grandmother has lived with me and my mum for about 2 years now and over time she’s completely deteriorated and become pretty much entirely dependant on us. during that time i’ve felt a lot of resentment if i’m honest. don’t get me wrong i love her and i’m glad to have her in my life but caring for her has taken over mine and my mums life, we can’t do anything without worrying about her first, she doesn’t like to leave the house (partly due to mobility issues, partly due to anxiety) so going out and doing things is nearly always a nightmare unless it’s only for a short time. i noticed she started forgetting things or getting confused shortly after she moved in with us, at first i put it down to standard old age forgetfulness until she started forgetting how to use her tv and other things she could normally manage in her daily life without issues. then she started getting very paranoid and depressed, one minute she’d be smiling and happy the next she’d be convinced none of us loved her and she’d be sobbing with no real reason or trigger. it’s taken a long time and a lot of dr appointments but yesterday we finally got an answer, vascular dementia.it seems weird to say it was oddly relieving to hear? because we were worried they’d say she was fine and that would mean that my grandmother had just become a cynical, paranoid and lazy old woman. but now we know that’s obviously not the case. i’m also feeling a lot of guilt now, because i get so frustrated by her behaviour and how dependent she is (i never show that to her face though) despite the fact i now know that she simply can’t help it. it’s really drained me because i know this particular type of dementia doesn’t really have any treatment options and that it’s all just going to get worse from here. it sounds horrible to say it but i hope she passes peacefully before it gets to the later stage, i don’t want her to have to go through that and i know that me and my mum certainly won’t be able to care for her once she’s at that point.  that will mean a carehome which my grandma doesn’t want to go to, which makes me feel even more guilty that we may have to move her to one against her wishes if it comes to it. idk i’m just rambling at this point it’s been a rough week and i’m just tired and anxious about the future so any advice or just comforting words would be very appreciated."," yes, you need to make sure one of you gets a power of attorney signed by your grandmother, while she is cognitively able to do it.  if not, you have to go to court to get guardianship over her, which is a time consuming process that also costs a little bit of money and an attorney.dementia is a cruel beast. there is no true treatment or cure for any type. just take deep breaths when you get frustrated, or get into your car and scream. wait until you’re in the shower to cry. try to keep a sense of humor to make her laugh. try to be a strong shoulder for your mother, she’s losing her mother.  best of luck to you all, hugs from florida.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cbp1zb/finally_got_a_diagnosis_so_many_mixed_emotions/,"Finally got a diagnosis, so many mixed emotions"

"i can't seem to straighten out my thoughts here sorry.i got a call two months ago from the person who has been managing my parents dwindling retirement that mom has been making appointments she hasn't been keeping and has been acting confused.i got mom a appointment with her doctor for a mini mental exam and she failed the memory and reasoning tests.doctor referred us to a neurologist, but when the neurologist called mom to confirm the appointment she cancelled because she doesn't think anything is wrong with her.her short term memory is very bad, her long term memory seems ok but she's recalling stuff that happened years ago as if it happened today.mom's the head of the household with her, dad and my disabled sister.i live 45 minutes away, i've got a full time job and a girlfriend who's kid is going through some shit and was diagnosed as schizoaffective. i'm kinda full up on responsibility right now.i'm trying to engage my sister but all i get from her is anger and hostility, she won't help me help mom, last night she was all riled up that i haven't been there and now i'm sweeping in to try and be in charge or some bullshit.i don't know how to get my sister to work with me to help mom (and herself! if mom looses the house she's homeless too!).dad's a disabled vet, i don't know how mentally capable he is, i called his case worker at the va and left a voicemail asking if we can get him a mental evaluation.mom is being very difficult, my sister is being difficult, dad and i are scared and stressed out.i'm trying to get mom to sign power of attorney papers. i've got online access set up with the bank where the mortgage is, and online access to the electric company, i still need to get water and gas information.i'm having a hard time processing things, i've fallen into depression with suicidal ideation, i've started meds and i'm trying to get into therapy.i feel devastated, i feel a lot of grief and loss right now."," in a pretty similar situation.mom is 72 and had been in and out of the hospital a lot in the last year with c.diff infections, was passing out, having seizures, etc. - the latter two probably due to an ambien prescription.we finally got tired of the constant facebook ""i'm in the hospital again"" posts and scheduled a flight out to her in texas.  my sister is 2 hours away but works constantly.  we ended up bringing her back home with us after the doctor told us that she couldn't go home alone.  she was living in a second floor apartment and we just couldn't risk her staying there by herself.  she's been formally diagnosed with alzheimer's, parkinson's, and vascular dementia.  the alzheimer's diagnosis hasn't yet been confirmed with an mri, principally because she keeps cancelling the mri appointment.  she also won't provide stool samples to determine whether or not she still has c.diff.  i suspect she doesn't but we still have to convince her. i got access to all her major stuff - social security, medicare, supplemental medicare, banking, energy bill, cell phone, and her various healthcare providers.  she did almost nothing online and she relies heavily on constantly phoning the bank for example to confirm her balance.  her medical appointments she'll call them up and cancel often at the last minute, claiming she's too tired etc. in any case we've seen pretty similar behaviors.  i'd say overall her mental/neuro state isn't too bad but she's now had a formal workup by a neuropsychologist who recommends we get her under a voluntary conservatorship asap.  the neuro thinks her decision-making skills are not good at all which is absolutely true.  we already have medical and financial power of attorney however poas don't really give you the ability to force someone to do something - or not do something - if you feel it's not in their best interest.  major difference is that my wife has really been stepping in to do most of the day-to-day help.  my mom can still get around, prepare her own food, shower, etc. so physically she's not a total wreck.  good call on getting your dad evaluated.  pending that i would see what he can do to help day-to-day.  my sister is ""available"" but our mom does not want to live with her because apparently her husband is a raging alcoholic and his adult children are basically all totally nuts.  my little brother is married and has two small children and lives in a tiny apartment that barely fits the four of them so that's pretty much a no-go.  we're basically the best of the not-so-great options.  my siblings are not being ""difficult"" per se but are just not in an ideal situation to help daily.   to have her move in with either of them is not really a viable option.  yes this is all ridiculously stressful.  it's hard and i can sort of understand the suicidal part though thankfully i have a support system to help with my mom - basically my wife now - and my mom has not yet declined to the extent where she's 100% bonkers or heavily reliant on daily help for physical and mental needs.take it one task at a time - getting the poa, getting her and your dad evaluated and tested, getting conservatorship if necessary, making sure all the bills are getting paid.  you're all but certainly too far and too busy with work to really make sure she's going to all her medical appointments.  as stressful as it is you're just going to have let that go and hopefully she's not hurting herself not going to her appointments.  i can tell you it's practically a full-time job navigating the appointments, the doctors, the tests,the medications, and making sure they're properly keeping all of them. i would see what kind of assistance with elders you can get in your city/state/country.  in california there's  ihss but the application process is admittedly long and there's no guarantee of course you'll get any kind of award that will help financially - this is why the medical deeming of her exact condition(s) is critical.   not to sound cruel but the worse off she is medically the better chance you stand to get more financial assistance from the government.  it may take several attempts to get her to keep appointments but she needs the neuro testing to get proper and complete diagnosis and to help you, your dad, and your sister down the line.i know it's rough but keep your head up and do your best to stay positive.  it is hard and it often seems impossible but you'll get there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/c8dlwm/i_feel_so_overwhelmed_and_completely_unprepared/,I feel so overwhelmed and completely unprepared to help my mother.

"i made this account just so i could post this as i'm at the end of my tether &amp; i don't know what to do.so my grandmother (86) hasn't been diagnosed by a doctor (she won't go) but i have a family member who has worked with dementia patients and definitely believes she has dementia.i don't know how much difference it would make if she is a diagnosed i think i would feel better that people know and know how much im struggling.i am disabled i have a lot of health problems myself and basically housebound and im stuck here 24/7 with my grandmother (i only have 2 siblings and they have their own life and i feel the responsibility is left to me because im always there, i can't get any more help from them so not an option) the funny thing is my grandmother thinks she caring for me and doesn't believe she needs any help, she can do a lot for herself so i wouldn't say she was at a care home stage yet.i just can't take anymore and i really really don't know what to do. she is constantly losing things, moving things, then accusing me or visitors and then gets so angry and abusive. she asks sooooo many questions over and over again and needs constant reassurance and its not like i can just leave and get a break or go for a walk i have to keep going and there's only so much you can take before you lose it then i'll get angry or cheeky and that will set her off and the fights can get nasty. ive tried so many different techniques when she wants to argue but always ends in a bad way.the pressure of her &amp; everyone relying on me is too much and im struggling so much, i've got my own health to worry about and i feel my life is just being taken from me (i'm 34) im not fit enough to constantly search for items, fix things, help with every little problem which is constant all day. the forgetfulness having to constantly repeat things is driving me insane.sorry if its like im complaining a lot, i just really need to let it out somewhere. i love her but she has always had a controlling, aggressive sort of personality and in the last few years it been 100x worse. she has an obsession with the neighbours and always saying people have ""fell out"" with her and constantly bitching and being so paranoid and accusing its so horrible to listen to, the twisted stories she'll come up with (that change details every time she tells it)i feel like im going crazy im always breaking down and currently she's in a mood with me and i've to' ""never talk to her again"". no one cares as long as i am here, like where can i go anyway (no escape) i feel im in the worst shitty scenario.i've wanted to post here in such a long time but this is the first i've had the courage, i know no one will have answers because im in a tough situation but i just wanted to share with people that will understand.the only next thing i can think of doing is getting someone to take me to my (&amp; hers) gp and tell her everything and see if she can help.this has cost me the relationship i had with my grandmother, i know she can't help it but living like this 24/7 i do resent it and im starting lose any emotions for her."," you might be able to get the gp to come and make a home visit, but yes, you need professional help and the gp would be the first place to try.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/c7249m/just_need_to_let_it_out/,Just need to let it out....

as a person who has been diagnosed with dementia i am dealing with many things emotionally and mentally. most of these things are definitely not positive. the biggest thing lacking is support. it seems all the groups and support structures are all for caregivers and family members. the people with dementia don’t really have a place to go. this is a sad fact and i don’t know what to do about it.," i am so sorry. i can only imagine what this must be like based on how my mum is doing. such a difficult and hard loss. i would suggest asking your doctor about support groups that might work for you. i have found the mayo clinic, alzheimer’s and lewy body websites to be very helpful but i’m a caregiver so i am looking at them from a different perspective. however if you reach out to them, they may have some help for you that you can tap into. in the meantime, i hope good things for you. i hope you have some people in your life who care and can show you compassion. i think talking to my mum openly and factually about the disease and how she is feeling has helped her so please find someone who you can be truthful with about how you are doing. i hope that you can find support and can feel love and hope. i hope that you will continue to find joy in your life and in those you care about. i hope the rest of your journey is gentle. so much love to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/c2z8sz/support/,Support

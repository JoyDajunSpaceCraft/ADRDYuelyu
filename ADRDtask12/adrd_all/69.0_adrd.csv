"i just became a certified dementia and alzheimer's trainer through the nccdp (nccdp.org). the training i offer is online and is the first step to becoming a certified dementia practitioner which 1st of all is awesome but also the course provides you with such good information related to dementia. you can sign up for the classes through my site. please note that i charge a fee and then there is a fee to get actual certification. not everyone meets criteria to become certified, but everyone can take the course. you don't have to be certified but it does look good on resumes. please share this with anybody you think would be interested. i am hoping to offer continuing education for this course in the future but as of right now i do not offer this. you can book at grayeducationguidance.com",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qouk4y/dementia_education/,Dementia Education

"hi all, i am on day 4 of a 5-day run (cannot wait for tuesday) with my  grandfather. i am not losing my mind quite yet, but i have had to stop my gym routine during these longer stretches staying with him and the gym keeps me sane. he sleeps pretty much from 1am - 9am (we're working on some more settled consistency with melatonin). i cannot be in the house 24/7 with him during these 4-5 days care binges. i already can only sleep at my house 2 days a week (pending scheduling from the agency we are hiring home health aides from). he cannot walk without assistance of a walker, has a hospital bed with guardrails, wears depends (as back up, he does use a commode), and lately has been very uninterested in doing his routine to rotate between bed and couch and his leg exercises. i would like to attribute this all to a bad weekend because he has now decided he hates the tv and is bored. would it be awful of me to sneak out for a gym class at 7am for 2 hours while he is still sleeping? i don't know how to gauge this. we have an aide 24-40 hours a week, but it seems silly to book more for just 2 hours early morning. i suppose i can move some hours around with her schedule, but i also really like to optimize my time ""off"" to work on trying to get a career started, spending time with my cat (who is being cared for by my boyfriend and a friend) and try to spend time with my dude. everything is so compressed, and its so hard to relax here when i'm with pop. i can feel pangs of irritation with him, and i know it affects his mood and whole day when i'm cranky---working out really mitigates that by furiously racing in a spin class lol. tdlr: how long can you leave someone with dementia alone if they are consistently asleep at the same time everyday?"," he has regular phone service?  you've a cellphone?you could rig up a sensor/dialer, to let you know when he's ""on the move"".if your workout area's two minutes away, no problem.  if it's much more than five minutes away, there may be some level of risk.  does he wear a gps gadget?

"hi everyone,my mother was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease last year and i'm her primary caregiver since then. i've been dealing with a lot of changes, grief and burden for being in this position, the most extreme feelings and difficult struggles i've ever had. i have a lot of things that i pretend to do while she's isn't in the worst stages, like watch together her old recordings in vhs (i need to convert to digital), participate and take photos in a walk event, travel and meet new places (she didn't travel much in her life). i want to create new good memories with her while we can. but i'm noticing that she is declining faster in the last months, her delusions getting worse, and i will only have more free time by the begining of the next year. so i'm afraid that her decline will make all of this plans not so enjoying or more meaningless for her, and i think it's a sad thing. i'm realising now that she isn't in the same place that she was when diagnosed last year, and i think i'm struggling to acknowledge this, seeing her slowly disconnecting more and more. did anyone here lived this same fear? how did you deal with it?"," with this disease so much is out of your control. my husband has lewy body dementia, we used to go for walks every day and now he can barely walk a block. this disease means you have to correct your course as the disease progresses.  you have been doing all you can to create memories now maybe just sitting by her side or helping her eat or get dressed or any of the small things we do every day to help our loved ones will be you creating memories.  it is so hard watching them slip away, you will just have to find a way to create meaning in the every day stuff.  i was very angry at first, then sat in pity about all i was losing then came to accept what is happening.  i know that trying to fight off this disease doesn't work so i had to decide to accept it and do whatever i can to make his life easier.  it is not easy and i often start the day crying in the shower, but i know that taking care and accepting each stage will help me help him.  best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qogyuq/fear_of_not_having_the_time_to_do_the_things_that/,Fear of not having the time to do the things that you want

"when my grandma(she raised me) was still in earlier stages, a few times a week i could tell that it was actually her i was speaking to. the tone of her voice changes, if that makes sense. the last time i heard her actual voice was some time in march. tonight, after a sudden progression in her disease the last two weeks- her voice came back for a few minutes.we went from her telling me she doesn’t like me and for me to go home (i go over every night to put her to bed, it’s been especially difficult lately) to her, without prompt, telling me she loves me. she even spoke two full sentences! something she hasn’t be able to do in months.it’s only a short window, but hearing her regular voice and especially hearing her (really her!) saying she loves me was so beautifully bittersweet. i miss her. she does repeat when i tell her i love her, but it’s in her dreamy, far off way with a look of almost skepticism. and sometimes, she’ll very suddenly and very briefly(a few seconds) recognize me and be over excited and cry while kissing my face but nothing compares to a few solid minutes of her being here, of hearing her real voice and knowing she knows me for more than a few seconds."," you are so lucky to get these brief little showers of love, embrace every second and always remember she is still there and manages to escape for a little burst of love just for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qog126/the_small_windows_in_which_theyre_themselves/,The small windows in which they’re themselves.
"my grandmother is early stage, but entering mid stage.  what i mean by that is 90% of the time she's still only suffering from early stage symptoms, but the other 10% of the time she's ""testing"" the symptoms and levels of mid stage.  she refuses to accept she has dementia (though i know she knows that something is wrong with her).now, i've never worked with dementia patients, but i've worked in psychiatric care and with people with cognitive delays.  so i'm very familiar with redirection techniques and how to use them.  normally, when she starts going ""off"" on something, i just redirect the conversation.  it's a huge help.  my grandfather, he doesn't get that.  he just corrects her, and then an argument starts between them.  here's my main issue though, tonight was a particularly bad night for her.  she mistook me for a completely different person.  she thought i was her brother in law.  this has only happened one other time, nine months ago, in which she mistook me for her *actual* brother one day.  both the first time nine months ago, and tonight, i redirected the conversation.  i didn't correct her.  i'm wondering if the redirection is actually a *bad* thing in this case.  i'm not afraid of getting her ""mad"", so much as i am getting her upset.  now, if she was at the point where this was a constant occurrence, i may let it go.  maybe i *should* have corrected her tonight though.  she still has the cognitive ability to *accept* her diagnoses, she just won't.  i'm wondering if this would have been a good ""intervention"" even if it upset her.  i see her 7 days a week.  i think i should have calmly explained to her who i actually am, that she's mistaking me for someone 43 years older than i am, and maybe it's time to accept she's having difficulty with her memory and see a specialist like her pcp keeps recommending.  should i have done that?  or did i do the right thing?  am i just second guessing myself?"," i don't see the point of you trying to tell her she is wrong about who she thinks you are.  she has some type of cognitive illness and believes what she is seeing and saying.  telling her something different won't make her suddenly aware that you are who you are.  she needs to be seen by a physician in order to get a diagnosis in the event she will need medication to help with her symptoms. it's important to have a diagnosis because some medications can be dangerous for some types of dementia.  so, see if you can get her in to see a neurologist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qoeazl/should_i_correct_her_in_these_situations/,[deleted by user]

"my dad passed away three years ago today from this terrible disease and i still struggle with it. rational me understands i lost him long before his actual death but emotional me still holds onto this weird idea that if i could do something that would make him proud he would remember. this carried over well past his death. i’m writing this to tell you all to watch out for your own mental health. you can not receive validation from someone who is gone, and if you are a care taker, please remember to acknowledge your own needs and live your own truth.my dad took great pride in me being a good golfer. amongst his friends that became my identity. one time he asked me to take a year off work and pursue this dream. he used to try to sign me up for us open local qualifying and while i had spurts of really good play, i was never of the pedigree to actually compete in that arena. i have mental health issues, diagnosed with ptsd in my early 20s from suppressed child hood trauma. basically i developed the yips. i literally shake so bad over 1 foot putts that i miss them because my inner child fears the bullying that comes from missing something so simple. if no one is around i make them though. then his dementia came, i decided to for go achieving independence in my 20s and lived at home with my mom to help take care of him and my mom. i became obsessed with the game, i would do insane things like hit 400+ balls in the middle of winter at a “heated” driving range daily, i even qualified for a few elite amateur tournaments. none of this really mattered or helped him remember because he was so far gone he would claim i won things i didn’t to his friends. i didn’t care, i thought i could still achieve that validation and it was nice having someone believe in me more then i ever did.after his passing i medicated through the game, i was hell bent on qualifying for the us open. i found work in florida so i could practice year round. i was desperate for that validation and didn’t care that i was sabotaging my personal love life by going on this grandiose journey. my game got pretty good and i signed up for us open local. unfortunately the qualifier was rained out that year and the date it was moved to i would be coming off a 25 hour shift. i still wanted to try, and when i got home i changed into my golf clothes and sat on the couch. i fell asleep, woke up late and missed the tee time. i called my mom sobbing. this was 2019, i didn’t learn my lesson because i basically repeated the same process in 2020 except this time covid cancelled open qualifying. looking back 2019 was my best chance. i had (more) mental stability and other things in my life were going well.however the kicker to 2020 was covid took my job away, it was terrible for myself, friends, and ex but i finally had this opportunity to have that year to really train like my dad wanted. i took it and ran. i thought i was doing him proud but i was really just ignoring my own emotional needs, growth and relationships. i was being selfish but at the time didn’t view it as such. to compound the problem and dream i won my club championship this summer. i say this is a problem because the way i won it. it went to a playoff, and in front of who knows how many people i hit my approach to a foot. instantly i was known by everyone in the club and i had a reputation as a badass. no one (other then my playing partners) knew i missed 9 putts inside 3 feet over the two day tournament. ironically the kid i beat in the playoff conceded my tap in. we played the first round together. he even helped me read putts the first day which ultimately calmed me down. i feel like training in the cold helped heal my ball striking mind and wonder if i trained short game in the cold i could achieve the same results. but i’m getting side tracked with that statement. after beating tyler in the playoff i confided in his dad that i felt bad for winning, this was the first time i won anything golf wise and have lost in playoffs before. it’s brutal to be on that side of things. it is not fun to say the least. he yelled at me for saying this to him. but at the same time i wouldn’t of gotten my mind in the headspace without tyler’s kindness during the first round.the problem with winning like this is that people talk, all of a sudden i had a reputation for being this badass golfer who did something amazing despite the pressure. everyone at the club knew who i was and it was hard to remember basic things like everyone’s names. everyone wanted a game, and if i’m being honest i like the game for the solitude. i love playing by myself as a means to clear my headspace, but my game was to a point where people wanted to see it and the attention felt nice. i finished the year strong, and was determined more then ever to make a 2021 us open run. i trained the off season harder then i ever trained. i had a brief stint in florida, i left despite my (now) exes wishes. florida seemed appealing because work was coming back to that state because they didn’t give a fuck about covid, but ultimately i was putting the goal first. unfortunately the day i left to go down there one of the guys i was staying with attempted suicide. the other guy didn’t tell me until i got there two days later (i drove). i had just entered hell. my ex gf was distant because i left, the guy i was staying with was unloading on me and the company had asked me to keep it quiet to protect him. i had no one to turn to. i was also sleeping in the same bed he tried to hang himself off of. i had so many questions, i wondered if he tried because he knew i was coming down and didn’t want me there. jobs also kept cancelling. with no work or income i decided to head back home. i also missed my ex.me and my ex were growing more distant, but i was still hell bent on this goal. i found an indoor simulator space to practice in. the guy cut me a deal, 200 bucks to train all winter as long as i came in off hours. so i’d wake up everyday at 4/5am drive to the suburbs and hit 400+ balls. my ex never gave me a hard time about waking her up during this and that’s something i took for granted. i was making big strides in club head speed and shot making, the space even had a putting green in there! this is where golf is a bitch. to an extent it doesn’t matter how much you practice if your mind isn’t right. in february unemployment claimed they over paid me 12000 dollars. to deal with this i had to keep my phone on me at all times. i became screen addicted and neglected my exes needs. part of the process was being on a call back list, so everytime my phone rang or went off i had to be there. i can’t explain to you how mentally draining it is to be attached to every notification you get on your little pocket dopamine. it’s beyond distracting. this lasted for four months, non the less i persisted with my dads dream.opening day on the golf course finally came. on my way to the course someone ran a red light and totaled my vehicle. i should mention i live in a big city and have a 40-60 minute commute to the course. i didn’t believe i was that injured and was hell bent on making opening day so i got my roommates car and went and played. i’m actually did ok for the first few holes until i realized i had whiplash. i remember sitting in the parking lot crying to my friend because i had worked so hard effectively for nothing. i knew the year was dead, i knew i was injured but i didn’t know the toll it would take on my mental health. i started physical therapy for a herniated disc in my neck and had some upper back issues that restricted my swing. i began rushing between golf pt and work. the entire time i had to have my cell phone on me and the number of calls from ambulance chasers was exhausting. i persisted with the dream because it’s all i had. it had become my identity. one you thing you should learn about trauma brain is the importance of slowing down. when this happened i was effectively rushing every minute of every day. instead of adjusting my goals i turned it up, and this can cause a lot of problems for someone like me. on top of this i didn’t exactly look hurt; so while my play suffered my “friends” who once adored me when i was good were dismissive and devaluing. i’d hear stuff like “i want to play with the old version of you” (three days after the accident) “golf is a lot harder when you have to work for a living” etc. essentially i became a circus act for people i thought were my friends. golf culture can be toxic, it’s a privileged world, and speaking up about other people’s poor behavior did not go well for me.during this time my girlfriend and i were growing distant. my new job had me working till 8 so we saw each other less and less. she immediately recognized my struggle and tried to get me in therapy, something i put off. covid shut down my industry so i finally had work again and with pt and training how was i suppose to add therapy on that? also how was i suppose to turn down work when we’re shut down for 18 months! i already had to work pt in around that.a week prior to the qualifier she tried to break up with me. it was a day before my birthday and a week before the qualifier. i was devastated to say the least. we still had issues from me leaving that we never addressed and while we had a beautiful relationship before i left things just were off. i shut down emotionally and didn’t know how to turn my situation into an opportunity. i was hurt, just really really hurt. so i isolated. i came begging back and she gave me a chance to redeem myself. i tried to explain the situation and she just grew mad at me. and i don’t blame her. i wasn’t putting her first, i wasn’t even putting myself first. i was attempting to find closure in the worst possible way. i was ignoring growing as a person and an adult and chasing scores because that’s who i became. i withdrew from us open local. emotionally i was a wreck but my neck and back weren’t at a place to compete. the usga will actually punish you if you don’t perform well in these and there are other usga tournaments i have a more realistic shot of playing in. (i’ve missed usga mid am by a shot or two in the past). i was so unaware of my mental heath at the time because i was so focused on being ready for that tournament. even if my body was ready i doubt i could of succeeded. ironically i’m pretty well versed in sports psychology books but i feel like that topic does not do trauma justice if you want real help seek a professional.this past summer was much of the same. at work i was trying to get out of doing some heavy lifting because of the pain and i felt devalued to the company despite having a pretty long tenure there. i was painted as lazy and didn’t want to work. no one seemed to care that i literally had took jobs for them that cost me unemployment dollars because of how that’s set up or that i literally took a job that paid less then unemployment because i saw it as an opportunity to grow new skills. i’d try to talk about mental health with friends but i was met with things like “so what you have golf” like being able to control a golf ball means my brain functions properly. there was also a large empathy gap between the people who stayed on to work and those of us that got unemployment. they didn’t know that by working one day a week as a fill in it was actually costing us hundreds of dollars when we were just trying to survive. and i didn’t understand the stress they were under just keeping things afloat.my golf game came and went in phases. i couldn’t handle gambling even friendlu bets. i eventually disconnected from the group i normally played with because i became a punching bag. hurt me shooting 76 wasn’t good enough for these people and it was hard to meet the unrealistic expectations they had of me considering my situation. i’d only be treated the same if i shot a score. i started playing alone. i love playing alone. i could be me, free from judgement and my scores reflected that. i always wondered how many golfers there are out there that are good enough to play on tv if they know the cameras aren’t on and nobody is watching.me and my now ex broke up for good. i was in shock and emotionally unavailable so she had enough. in the beginning i blamed everything on her also. i failed to look inwardly and see how i was at fault.  we also broke up originally over text on the golf course. i snapped two clubs that day in front of guys that don’t care what i shoot. i didn’t tell them what was going on in my phone. she did so many nice things for me i took for granted. i wrote evil things about her, and sure she did some bad stuff but a majority of it was in response to my emotional neglect. she didn’t deserve the words i wrote about her and i also didn’t expect her to read them but knew there was a chance she would. (i posted a response on r/bpdlovedones because i was so convinced that’s what i had went through) essentially i was being a man child. she blocked me on all forums, and moved on. a week after the break up she was already bringing another guy around her mom. she had had enough, after all she did hold out for nine months and i wasn’t working on myself.finally golf didn’t matter. i no longer had the drive to wake up and go to the course. i didn’t want to be confronted by anyone about my bad behavior. i isolated in my room which was a total mess for about a month. i didn’t tell anyone about the break up. there were times i really thought i was going to commit suicide. i felt so hurt and so unvalued. i worked so hard at the game and to not even have the opportunity to try is crushing. it’s something i hope i’ll get over. it hasn’t just been the work i put in after my dads passing it’s been a decade of work and commitment.now comes the point of all this. i started getting help. i reached out to my mom and loved ones. they’ve been supportive as fuck. i had to find my real friends, the ones who didn’t view me as a walking scorecard and they listen. i have a coworker that we do self care together. i’ve been going to therapy. i’m writing this as a vow not only to myself but to my dad. my dad wouldn’t be proud of me for doing what i’ve done. he’d be proud of me for building a happy life. i am no longer going to play golf to seek my fathers validation and i will only play because i want to. i’m no longer going to value people that judge me by my score and not the content of my character. i’m going to address problems in my relationships before they get out of hand. and this is going to be my reminder. and if you’re someone who is struggling as a caretaker for someone with dementia please don’t do what i did. get help, it’s ok to grieve, the sad reality is nothing you can do or imagine is going to bring them back, so count the good days when you have them and be easy on yourself during the bad ones.tldr: 3 years ago my dad passed away with dementia. he wanted me to be a pro golfer, i chased the dream not because i wanted it but because he did. a series of events brought me to the lowest point of my adult life. don’t be like me, get help."," helluva rollercoaster. thanks for sharing, glad you're making good steps and seem self-aware.and thanks also for sharing the link to a loved one with dementia. dementia is brutal and it robs you of your proper memories of your loved one. we all grieve in different ways (before and after they pass), and as you say clearly, we owe it to ourselves to try to stay on track.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qnkq5s/todays_the_three_year_anniversary_of_losing_my/,[deleted by user]

"i had been trying to figure out a way to get her into assisted living as 40 hrs/week with a caregiver wasn't enough. then, three weeks ago my alzheimer's mother fell and was taken to the hospital (she's ok). i used this opportunity to get her into assisted living. the place is basically a studio apartment, with her own bed/furniture and private bath.the move was quick, and i packed as much of her stuff as possible. i'm in the house a few times a week trying to clean it out for it's eventual sale. her clothes that didn't make the move are still there. the transition has been tough, and she's been threatening to run-away (which will be impossible). and she's refusing to leave her room to socialize.she says that she has a list of things she absolutely needs, but won't show me the list. and that she must go into her closet to see what clothes she needs. i've offered to grab *anything* she asks for, but she's becoming heated about it. she wants to go into \*her\* home and grab \*her\* things. (i have dpoa and full control of the house that's in a trust)i'm having an internal debate (guilt) and i'd like to ask your opinion. should i let her go back and risk a meltdown? or continue to obfuscate and re-direct (""y*eah, i'll get a key made for you as soon as possible.""*) and not let her back in? which will probably also result in a meltdown."," i feel like i was kind of in your shoes recently, but my mother went willingly into an independent living retirement community, isn’t that far gone, and we did bring her back to her house several times to continue to pick up things that she wanted. during those times we basically just let her rummage around and she did pack up a few boxes. most of that stuff i had to put into a storage locker.if you have moved her into assisted living versus memory care i am going to presume she’s actually not all that far advanced in the disease. if you think you can handle it, it might be worthwhile to have her go collect a few of the other items that she may want. but only you know your mother. if you think this could turn into a stand off where she refuses to go back to the apartment, forget it…  i’d just string her along. she also might get confused because it is possible that you have already moved the stuff she is looking for into her new apartment but she doesn’t know where it is or remember and will think somebody stole it when she gets back to her old house and it is not there.when my mother officially moved into her new apartment is when the proverbial poop really hit the fan. she became very confused, very upset very depressed, and nothing, nothing at all was right at the new place. she still refers to it as “the facility you have me at” but she has moved on and now socializes and has found new friends and actually seems relatively happy. it all seems to have really worked out well, especially with the increased socialization which she really did not have in her own home (worse with covid).fwiw, i feel tremendously guilty all the time about many of the decisions that i have had to make unilaterally. ultimately i think it is very important to do what works best for you. the words of my deceased father ring in my ears “i’m doing the best i can”. and again i think to myself when i have pangs of guilt “i did the best i could”.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ql3lt9/my_mom_wants_to_go_home_for_her_things/,"My Mom wants to go home for her ""things"""

"i’m not sure where else to go.my (25f) grandma (81f) got diagnosed with vascular dementia about 6ish months ago. however, i noticed her personality has slowly changed over the years (for the past 7ish years she has become more angry, says things that aren’t socially acceptable to say/says offensive things, talks about death often or how old she is, cries more often, etc.) - i watched her turn into a different person for the past few years &amp; it’s been weird. idk if it was the dementia slowly developing or if she just had a personality change.now, knowing she has dementia her behavior makes a little more sense. but over the past 1-2 months it has gotten really bad. she would call me 5-7 times a day so i had to block her number &amp; unblock it when i had time to talk. also, i will mention that i moved out of state from my family about 7 months ago, but went back to visit a couple weeks ago and got to see her. it was hard because she just looks like a shell of who she used to be. last night i got a call from my dad (her son) that she was in the hospital &amp; he broke down. i have never heard him cry like that. apparently she wouldn’t eat or drink anything &amp; became unresponsive. i also broke down &amp; immediately felt so much guilt for blocking her number &amp; felt bad i couldn’t be there. i just got home from visiting a few days ago. i was begging the universe to give me a chance to talk to her. an hour later she randomly woke up &amp; started cussing out the nurses (sounds about right for her), but i got a chance to talk to her &amp; this was the first time i had ever heard her not make any sense. she was saying my grandpa beat her with his cane (he can barely walk on his own, let alone pick up his cane). she was beaten by her husband in her first marriage (not my grandpa) so i’m wondering if her dementia is causing her to experience ptsd or something? i couldn’t help but burst into tears hearing her talk like this. her voice was full of suffering &amp; i can barely stand to watch her deteriorate like this. i’ve never lost a close loved one before. i have no idea how to cope with the guilt, fear, sadness, etc. i’m going to therapy this week, but i wanted to hear what other’s on here had to share. thank you in advance.", we had to put my grandma (80+ with vd) on citalopram as a mood stabilizer. it is not uncommon for memories from traumatic past events to come up. the medicine has really helped. she was angry a lot and just very unpleasant until we got her medicated. emotions are hard to regulate with dementia and it seems like the scope of view only focuses on themselves. think of it like the behavior of a toddler. sort of the same- i'm uncomfortable and can't explain why so i throw a fit. except it is coming from someone with a lifetime of experience to draw from (even if they can't verbalize it) so it can be more hurtful and pointed. my grandma liked to threaten to throw me out of the house. after the 1st few times i was very hurt and didn't understand why she would say hateful things because we had been close. but she was only a small part of who she had been. so i grieved for the lose of my grandma while actively caring for her. you are experiencing it at a faster rate than a lot of us. i've had 4 years to process her lose but you have just begun. everything you feel is valid. and it can be jarring when you aren't seeing her everyday. therapy is an excellent idea and i'm glad you are taking steps to keep yourself healthy while going through it. consider talking to your dad about finding a local one too or even a support group if he has not. depending on your location there might be a senior services department or caregiver groups through local memory care homes. your family is definitely not alone in the struggle of dealing with dementia and end of life care.hugs to you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qkgqrg/how_to_cope_with_grandmas_dementia_feeling_lost/,How to cope with grandma’s dementia?

i was thinking it would be a great relief to add some comedy to this awesome sub - every friday people  share something that their lo  with dementia said or did that made them laugh? yes dementia is serious and we don’t need to be reminded of that. but we do need to have some relief and through some of the absurdity there’s some black humour too. **mods obviously this is up to you just an idea**," my mom has lost a lot of weight over past year and none of her clothes fit & so had to go shopping. she took many outfits into the change room. she tried on one outfit (which we both really liked). this outfit made three appearances, with a thumbs up each time, till i removed it from her selections inside her change room. she tried the remaining outfits on without further interruption.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qkdb6k/friday_funnies/,Friday funnies?

"like so many others on here, i'm beyond burnt out.  i just need a place to vent.  since my dad broke his hip earlier this year, i dropped everything in my life and have been living with my parents to take care of them.  my dad has always been distant, never gave a crap about the kids or wife, aside from the usual ""i feed you"".  he never took us out, he never asked me how i am doing, we were just objects in his life.  i left the house at 19 and struggled to build myself into what some would call a very privileged career and life.    mom and dad kept working but dad's dementia got worse and worse, i would visit once or twice a year.  it wasn't until he broke his hip and required hip surgery that we noticed his dementia advance from early stages to mild.    later in the year all his other medical conditions piled on and he gets hospitalized again for three months, i spend day and night speaking with doctors, surgeons, and specialists.   he finally gets out of the hospital and with multiple procedures that each required anesthesia and his dementia has advanced to later stages.   aside from him planning and scheming every second to go smoke, he now has given up on eating and drinking.  every meal is a fight, every glass of water is him pushing back.   whenever he doesn't drink water, he gets a slight temperature and i have to threaten him with hospitalization to get something down.all this has taken a heavy toll on my health, career and i just dont know if i can continue.   if we were to switch roles, he wouldn't give a crap, he would say ""that's too bad son, i have work in the morning"".  i catch myself getting angry, frustrated, a flood of emotions from my childhood come running back.  i feel like i'm back to being an object in his life to fill a role, which he could care less about.    i'm looking at switching his primary care doctor, who has been absent in his care all this time, and also having him join the pace program, which i'm hoping might help to take some of the load off.    anyhow, thanks for reading, prayers, and thoughts with you and your loved ones.   i have nothing but utter respect for the caregivers that have been doing this for years.p.s. if you have any tips on how to increase his appetite, please let me know."," extra virgin olive oil is 120 calories for 1 tablespoon.  id put 2 tablespoons into a soup or stew or something to give him an extra 240 calorie boost that takes one swallow to eat.  dont give more than that a day though (besides whatever normal amoubt of oil you use ib food) as a little is actually good for you but too much can act as a laxative or slow digestion.heavy whipping cream is 400 calories for 1/2 cup.  use 1 cup in a soup and you got 800 calories already.  i also use it in mashed potatoes and in the gravy itself.  can make a sweet desert drink too if  if you add berries, sugar or chocolate.protein bars.  the one i give my dad is 300 calories per bar.  it actually has very few carbs too though most have many carbs.potato chips do not fill someone up.i leave grapes on the table which he always eats up just cause they are on his table in front if him.sausage patties.  two little ones are 300 calories already.  spam i think is dense calorie too.  in general, pork is high calorie.  protein shakes like glycerna.my dads a narcissist too so i feel for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qk0i65/dad_with_dementia_and_narcissism/,Dad with dementia and narcissism

south asian )  medications ( none as of the moment albeit i do take occasional benzodiazepines [ alprax ( alprazolam ) 0.5 and tryka ] for my occasional insomnia  , preexisting ailments ( none ...atleast none that i am aware of ) so...this would be my first post here in this here subreddit so do bear with me if i it's not really tidy and proper as per the due quality or on point to the regulations on which this subreddit in particular adheres to. nevertheless i am at my wit's literal end and both my mind and body can no longer bottle this sheer agony and trauma any longer if anything . also it's literally scaring me to say the very least to comment here if anything , given that this subreddit stands for everything that i absolutely fear and thus it is an extremely taxing endeavor to even post here .so before i start to elucidate and give a rundown of all the events that transpired ever since a month or so ago i'll go ahead and explain my previous ""experiences"" of episodes which involved medical attention or which now that i look back to where dare i say ""quite queer"" if i ought to designate them as such , nevertheless...even as a kid i was considered ""mentally ill"" as i was severely hyperactive and would wander around the classroom in preschool and even roam around the school premises i had a very inquisitive and vivid memory and imagination as i wholeheartedly remember how i used to play around with branches and frolic around the enclosures housing the school pets . nevertheless i was later taken over to a psychiatrist as i developed a fear that someone was going to attack my dad or family the psychiatrist gave me a particular medicine ( something called depsonil or similar ) and that stopped the said outbursts significantly but my parents cut down the medicine later since it was turning me into a ""zombie"" practically , moving on the said symptoms stopped albeit i would also like to bring into notice the fact that i suffered from a head injury when i fell backwards from my bed and hurt the back of my head ( albeit since i showed no symptoms of brain injuries like vomitting and such we never paid much heed to it ) now that was in the 2006 - 2007 .  furthermore i also had severely curled and utterly sordid my handwriting was...it was utterly jumbled and horrendous but over the course of time i was able to fix it up and even aced several times to be considered somewhat of a prodigy in my school and then there was the fact that my intrigues on military world history , cryptozoology , natural world , mysteries , the occult ( i literally  used to read bernard heuvelman's books when i was like 9 or 10 ) and extreme proficiency towards english along with my completely westernized upbringing given my father made me an oddity in my indian school where i experienced severe bullying for a long tenure of time without any particular individual whom i could call as a ""friend"" well that was until i graduated to highschool and made some friends at the age of 17 but as ill fate would have one of my friends passed away from dengue ...after that college disappointed me severely as everyone there below subpar with the sole exception of maybe a single bloke i befriended along with a single teacher back at that time i started to plan for immigration and dropped out because of some complications then due to some problems i couldn't immigrate and the covid lockdowns ensued shortly , nevertheless i was severely depressed and almost was simply existing if anything until i found about scp and other overpowered fictional verses which i used as a means of getting out of my stultified tenor ...i would also like to bring into the notice the fact that shortly before this i was extremely heartbroken at my ineptness that i could not earn along with the health of my aging father who was in his late 60s at that time . i always had this knack of visualizing my life as a videogame or a comic if anything ( i am perfectly aware as to how deranged it sounds ..but i never had schizophrenia like hallucinations or hearing voices in my mind ) [it's somewhat similar to ichiban  kasuga from yakuza 7]( without the visual hallucinations , i always used to create mental stories and events bordering into sheer ""what ifism"" to a strange alternate course of events of sort to something utterly fantastical ( super powers , weapons and all other kinda bits and bobs involved) , i also would like to say that i used to talk to myself under different contexts repeatedly using different dialects and accents to keep my vocabulary and lexicon reet and honed , i even used to think about how it would be if i was in some other countries which i had not visited yet ( these helped me to write a lot of stuff as i used to write stories a lot if anything ) moving on , i never was under any form of delusion or such actually , if anything i was extremely aware if these odd habits that i had even as recent as a few months ago whilst i was in nepal . and i was dare i say somewhat flustered and bothered as well since i couldn't offer any financial support to my family , welp i shan't digress with my backstory anymore ( which i merely presented to use as a source of context ) and get on to the problems that has caused me to write the post here today...so ever since i was in college i had a case of severe gastric problems due to not having a meal for a long tenures because of classes and such and i immediately assumed and imagined my minor gastritis as a potential stomach cancer ...after ig healed off with the aid of homeopathic medicines from a local scottish doctor , i was under the impression that i had brain cancer back in 2019 whilst i was immigrating and that was due to a migraine most probably as i am quite inclined to register , nevertheless i was absolutely petrified and used to cry and sob whilst being pretty much ascertained of my impending doom , moving on even a six or so months ago i was ascertained that i'm afflicted with a mouth cancer apparently ...which turned out to be a simple canker sore on my tongue . now ..on 26th september i was having some problems falling asleep for a few days and decided to google my symptoms ( the worst mistake that i ever did ) and it showed me about prion diseases especially sfi and scjd these absolutely terrified me on spot and i started to cry...for the next few days i was having severe panic attacks , heart palpitations , muscle twitches and even memory problems and such i was having severe problems falling asleep but because of the aid my family ( my parents ridiculed me but my uncle's family was extremely supportive to say the least ) provided i was finally able to curb that thought away a few days ago and returned to a normal sleeping pattern , now ...my problem started eversince i was under the impression that i had a prion disease ...i was having severe problems whilst reading ( mostly missing out words and re reading once to grasp the gist of the sentence or paragraph ) these where actually symptoms of sfi apparently which scared me as well ( note that this never happened before this or even if it happened it wasn't that prominent at all ) so i left it out but even then after my sleep improved when the said problem was persisting i just had to google it again and i found out about all different types of dementias and especially ftds ....this scared the fuck out of me since it matches my symptoms no one in my family ever had any form of dementia except maybe my grandmother who was already 97 years old . i keep missing words , misspell stuff whilst reading and have problems recalling words ( note this has been happening more since the last few days ) what scares me is that i had impeccable comprehension and even a few weeks ago i scored a c2 in the british council english aptitude test , i also then recalled the fact that i have had problems recalling names of movies  , words for a few days ( though i always remember them later on within a few seconds ) and even problems to articulate sentences whilst speaking in english ( i'm multilingual as i can speak bengali which is my primary language eversince the pandemic , english with a slight east london accent and different dialects and some basic german and hindi ) now that i remember it has been happening for a few months before my problems when i jokingly used to say that i had a ""brain damage"" to my family ( but even then i used to remember the said stuff in literal seconds ) so roughly this has been happening since last january maybe ? but it never even bothered me as i still was able to learn and store multiple informations in my mind ( i literally debated scp in different branches with different languages  ) but since a few months i was forgetting some old knowledge ( which could very well be because there is literally an endless amount of info whilst it comes to scp ) and had troubles recalling and mispronouncing names...this scared me especially when i learned about ftd , even now i'm still able to remember new info and even have a perfectly working short term and working memory to the point that i can remember the conversation of bystanders i heard on the pavement or similar , also i have developed severe short sightedness in my left eye which i discovered on 28th september , i also had some episodes of hypnogogaic hallucinations where i used to see grotesque images or dream like sequences whilst falling asleep along with spasms and twitches ...it is also to be brought into attention the fact that i had a lot of hypnic jerks way before the problems started months ago and i always have had sleeping problems where even a single day of allnighter ( back even a year ago it was extremely rare ) would literally cause a nigh mental breakdown if anything . i noticed that i am extremely emotionally expressive and pessimistic if anything eversince the lockdown but with the smallest hint of reassurance i can literally do a 360 and become quite headstrong until another depressive issue grips me in it's throes ( which is mostly caused by a tertiary causes like quarrels amongst my parents or other family members , seeing my former classmates , financial woes or something similar ) i get extremely gutted and dour sometimes even having severe problems to fall asleep . now in the context of anxiety apart from the aforementioned instance where i already stated my worries about my father...ever since the lock down i literally haven't went outside other than to fetch groceries or stuff like that , haven't met with the single friend i had and always had worried about financial woes and be bogged amidst the constant squabbles of my family having quarrels ( which sometimes resorted more along the lines of physical    skirmish ( bloody hell ...took me like 2 minutes to remember this ) and then thinking how my dreams and ambitions where for naught ..i sometimes used to cry as well since i saw all my classmates living luxuriously or well established , or because of how skint i was or even have sleepless nights over the thoughts of my parents ever increasing age and for the fact that how if something was to happen to one of them i would proverbially and literally loose my mind and if something was to happen to me they would be completely helpless . i do not wish to be a liability to my already aged parents and they have so many hopes and dreams in regards to me that i am just merely sobbing and stifling a cry whilst drenching my pillow covers each and every night at bed as of the moment from the thoughts of developing alzheimer's or some form of ftd ( i'm also worried about developing lewy body  dementia as well since sleep problems are a presenting symptom there as well )the main predicament that has been absolutely gnawing and nagging me from the inside is that i have ppa which results in one losing their very concept of language , however i'm only experiencing this problem regarding comprehension or reading ever since i read about prion diseases , i'm losing so much hair because of stress...i'm literally crying ..my long luscious black hair was my pride and joy...i used to decorate it with multiple coloured ribbons and play with them now they are just a sickly shell of their former selves...ever since i had developed the severe stress i kept on having comprehension problems and later on ever since i read about ppa since i had reading problems ...i found that i might have ppa or other ftd which further scared the living jibbies out of me , i keep reading words wrong and miss words simultaneously as well like i read ""potions"" as bloody ""potatoes"" only last day as for my word recall problems i generally remember the word i'm seeking in less than a few seconds but sometimes it can be delayed then there is the fact that sometimes i have troubles articulating my speech and words ....i'm literally at my wit's end as of the  moment if i am being honest ...also i would like to bring into notice the fact that the first time i took alprazolam was when i was in middle school and even before that i used lick alprazolam tablets as i confused them with candies when i was a kid ( i know it sounds super wonky but that's that ) . literally before my problems i never had any problems with comprehension and even finding words ..heck the only thing i can relate to is probably how sometimes i usually used to forget names of movies or stuff and had to brainstorm for a few moment...that's about it .i would also wish to notify the fact that i always have swirls , patterns , cones and colour blobs when i close my eyes but that has been happening for a very very long time iirc so i never even paid much of a quip of an eyebrow if anything ....i also should bring in the fact that i was assured that i was gonna die last year and later called dibs at the fact that i'm gonna kick the bucket this year , it's all too harrowing and simultaneously straining for me to say the least...i don't even have a large family as most of my paternal or maternal relatives don't fancy to keep any ties with us and thus we are completely left alone to fend for ourselves..the only thing i can do is to just..wait and watch where my predicaments take me..i beg any neurologist or psychiatrist present..please help me..my mom and dad albeit they may seem crude , extremely self centred , indignant and callous are everything to me...i cannot live without them so i beg you...please tell me whether i have something truly sinister and nefarious so that i can take somewhat appropriate steps so that atleast they can live somewhat of a comfortable life in my due absence ."," i'm not sure that any of us are qualified to even remotely diagnose what is happening. something you have to consider too is as we age and are exposed to a huge amount of information to digest and sometimes our brain chooses what is the most important to hold onto. some of it will not make the cut. shout out to the scp world. it is incredibly complex and my son and i enjoy it. i also have a very active imagination and could run whole scenarios in my mind. so i understand where you are coming from on that front. but you may need something as simple as blood work to start with getting a diagnosis. lots of pretty easily treated disorders can mess with our bodies and minds. but the 1st step is definitely getting to a doctor and getting a check up. it could also be heightened anxiety and lack of good sleep that can lead to function impairment. the last few years have been a lot of unending stress and that is not healthy for anyone. you may just even need to start by trying meditation or seek therapy (online can be an option). talking it out with someone who is not related can be helpful. they might be able to breakdown everything you are going through. i would look for simpler causes before expecting it to be neurological at this point. iron levels, thyroid, etc should be ruled out first. i wish you

"i don't really know why i'm typing this, i guess i just need to vent with people who will understand.my mom has been diagnosed with dementia a few months ago. we kind of knew it was the case, but a pet-scan (which was incredibly expensive as she has no health insurance for we can't afford it) confirmed it. she has real trouble speaking as she can't find the words she wants to use, and in result i can barely understand her, every sentence she speaks turns into a game of figuring out what she's trying to tell me. she can barely stand up without falling for some reason, and affording the exams to figure out what's wrong and go to a specialized doctor is very difficult for us (we live in brazil, btw; public health doctors are hard to come by because of the humongous waiting lists). she can't eat, she hates every food in the planet, except for some fruits (and even then, she doesn't like them as much as she once did). no doctors ever say anything about this, but it's been taking a toll on her quality of life, as she barely eats because she's disgusted at the food. i prohibited her from driving most of the time (she crashes and scrapes the car pretty often), and i don't have a license either, so i can't take her to places. i feel like the responsability on me would get even heavier if i learned how to drive, so i've been avoiding it.my patience unfortunately runs thin as it's so hard for me to see the state she's in that i've been answering to the situation by getting angry at her, even though it's not her fault at all. she has always been independent and smart, and now she's getting more dependant on me by the minute. she can still sort out her meds, but for how long? she's been getting precarious with her personal hygiene, and she won't let me help her as she doesn't feel she needs help.i feel infuriated and extremely sad at the thought of having her dependent on me. i don't think i could deal with it. i even decided i don't want kids because i don't want to take care of another human being like this again. taking care of her and seeing the way she is right now has been taking a toll on me. i have a psychologist and take meds for ocd, but it's just not enough for me to deal with this in a healthy manner. my therapist says i should try to have more light-hearted moments with my mom, but she's depressed as well and doesn't want to do anything other than ""watching"" tv (she barely pays attention to it and/or doesn't understand what's going on).i know she'll get worse and that things won't get better at all. which makes me feel completely hopeless. i get thoughts about how if she died, things would be better, as she will only get worse from now on and has little hope of having a better quality of life, which makes me feel horrible with myself. she says all the time that she wants to die. she complains all the time about how she can barely eat or walk or talk, and it feels like torture to me hearing this everyday. she doesn't talk about anything else, practically, just about her symptoms. i just feel like escaping this situation all the time, but i have few escape valves. few things give me pleasure anymore, and i'm having personal problems with how i view my own life, work and relationships. i feel like i might get depressed if i don't better my life in some way. it's just so much to deal with at once.i'm an only child, so i have no siblings to help me take care of her. i have to get out of work during my work hours to take her to doctors and exams, which greatly restricts the jobs i can have, as they have to be home office and with the freedom i have in my current job (however i don't have a computer to work at home, as i work editing videos, and the pc i do use belongs to the company i work in right now). i feel stuck, freedom-less. i'm 26 and been dealing with her decline since i was 24 or something like that.she used to have an addiction to slot machine games and i've been dealing with that since i was 17 years old, taking care of her money for her and having to deal with her lies and emotional breakdowns  because of that. it's taken a toll on me as well, but i use to have hope that she would overcome it. she eventually did, thank goodness. but with the dementia, it's different now. i have no hope left. not even one bit.sorry for the wall of text. i needed to get this out of my system.", call a hospice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qjypy7/vent_its_getting_harder_by_the_minute/,[VENT] It's getting harder by the minute
"back in 2016 after years of showing symptoms, i aggressively started trying to get my wife (55 then) diagnosed. for three years i was repeatedly told someone her relatively young age having dementia is extremely rare. end of 2019 with a radiated glucose pet/ct scan she was diagnosed with lewy bodies. this past spring i reached out to the neurologist to get medication to control her anger and belligerence associated with her hallucinations and conspiracy theories. the neurologist decided, given her symptoms the lewy bodies was a misdiagnosis. he ordered a battery of dna tests. even though the dna tests came back negative and with no other additional tests performed, the neurologist now says she has ftd. she is currently deep in the middle stages. the family would like to donate her body to science, especially somewhere interested in her brain. any advice on how to make this happen would be greatly appreciated"," my mom donated my dad’s brain to a research hospital. i’m not sure where you’re located but that could be something to look into, there are places that will just take the brain. university or research hospital in your area could be a place to start. just as an aside, he originally was diagnosed through a neurologist with ftd. then his dna sequencing didn’t have any of the known ftd markers (one did come up that may be connected but they’re still doing research on it). and no alzheimer’s genes either. and then his autopsy came back with ftd, lewy body, and alzheimer’s, which the researchers had only seen in two other people. sometimes it really just is hard to pinpoint, and there’s still so much research being done.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qjwy3t/donating_a_dementia_patients_body_to_science/,Donating a Dementia Patient’s Body to Science

"i suspect my mother has some sort of dementia, perhaps triggered by a noncancerous brain tumor in her frontal lobe area. she also has seizures that may be damaging her brain.anyway, the issue is i can't tell when she's being stubborn or when she simply doesn't comprehend things. she will have accidents but refuse depends because they are embarrassing. she won't go to the doctor til she's basically forced to. she won't eat because she has no appetite except she has a sweet tooth often. she won't bathe regularly because she says she doesn't move around and doesn't get dirty, but if i point out stains she will get embarrassed and will wash her clothes ""for me"". she's also kind of rude and passive aggressive toward me, pointing out things i do wrong or that are negative i think to prove ""see, you aren't perfect either"". i just simply say that's rude, or please don't be mean but it's really difficult when i'm literally just trying to help her.so that makes thus even more of a question...is it ok to give her ultimatums regarding her care or is that damaging? i can't tell if i'm just being a b*tch to an impaired but stubborn person or being helpful to a person who completely has no logic or reasoning abilities.my thoughts are if she wants to come on a long shopping trip or something she has to wear depends, but i worry forcing that will be humiliating for her, almost abusive. she doesn't feel the urge to go until it's too late sometimes, so the whole time we are out i'm stressing and constantly asking if she has to go etc.she also has difficulty with conversations, if you ask her a question she will look at you confused or try to bluff a response, so you have to ask it a couple times in different ways for her to get it. she also can't do math anymore. are these signs of dementia?she is extremely depressed and withdrawn from life, and my sister feels as though when she has a baby my mom won't even care. we want her to speak with a therapist that specializes in elderly but of she refuses, then what? can we say if you don't take your mental health seriously our relationship with you will be damaged, or is that manipulative? same with getting her to go to a doctor and even submit to any sort of mental evaluations for dementia etc. i'm scared to even bring it up because she just shuts anything like that down.i am at my wits end and i feel like this isn't even as bad as it'll get. but i want to help her and can't just let her deteriorate further without trying. any advice?"," everything you are describing can be explained by the tumor in the frontal lobe including that she seems depressed. when was the last time she saw a doctor about the tumor? were you there for the visit?  talk therapy is pointless for the tumor or dementia. brain tumors can cause personality changes that seem like depression but aren't. even if she's truly depressed, the answer for her, given her cognitive state, will be medication.  a medical visit is necessary with a doctor that specializes in brain tumors - go back to the doctor that diagnosed the tumor or bring those medical records to a new neurologist. he/she can tell you what's causing what and do additional testing, such as for dementia, if needed. you can just tell your mom it's a required follow up visit regarding the tumor.  schedule the appointment yourself and tell her the day before or the day of the appointment. you can even say the doctor's office called to inform you of the appointment. some people say that it's required by insurance. don't mention to her about mental health, dementia, etc. in the us, doctors are not able to give medical information to family members without written permission from the patient. even if the doctor can't talk to you, you can still give the doctor information. write down all the examples of the problems she's having and give it to him. then you won't have to say it all in front of your mom. meanwhile, no ultimatums. it won't work because of the brain damage. also see if you can stop pointing out her mistakes and flaws. there is a book available online called ""understanding the dementia experience"" by jennifer ghent-fuller. i think it might be helpful for you in improving your communication and tactics with her. treating her as you would a child, with ultimatums, doesn't work when you're dealing with brain damage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qh4pw7/are_ultimatums_ok_im_really_having_a_hard_time/,Are ultimatums ok?

"my dad started showing some sort of memory issues back in august 2020, he was hallucinating and saying he wanted to go home(even though he was at home) he said he felt like he was being abducted a few times, and other people were staying in his house also. we eventually convinced him to move to il as we were worried because he was leaving his home at night. after a few months the directors thought he would be better in al, so we unfortunately had to move him from il to al (which i’m sure caused a lot of confusion). he has had a lot of traumatic things happen lately (his dogs passing) and i just feel so bad for leaving him alone there sometimes. he isn’t the most social person but sometimes i will go over there and he is talking to people in the lobby. if i am over there in the evening he gets to a point where he says he wants to go home now. i get stuck at that point because i don’t know what to do. i show him his nameplate that says his name by the door, try to jog his memory on things that we did in the apartment that day because he remembers some things if they stick out but nothing clicks. it would be okay if he didn’t get aggressive and start saying he is going to call the police/why are you doing this to me? i can’t bring him to his old house because i’m worried either he won’t believe it’s his old house or won’t want to leave the house at the time. so i’m getting to the point of being unsure if me going over there is doing more harm than good. he always is really happy whenever we hangout and that makes me happy but this stuck feeling of when he says take me home is scary. i feel bad complaining about what i am going through when he is going through hell. i’m  just hoping that there is someone who has gone through this and could give some advice. thanks", thallium is one of the causes of dementia. look it up. it’s easy to test for thallium exposure by doing a heavy metal hair sample test. if it’s positive for thallium the good news is that patient will stabilize and sometimes even get better.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qgja1x/not_sure_what_to_do/,Not sure what to do

"my dad has been showing signs of dementia for a while. it runs in his family. last winter, he just stopped eating so he could lose weight and get rid of his type 2 diabetes.we could get him to occasionally eat, but he would get so nasty when we asked him to. we basically kept him alive with glucerna and carnation instant breakfast. he absolutely refused to go to the doctor. things were also complicated due to the pandemic because i am a kidney transplant patient and covid-19 could kill me. plus my parents are older (dad's 69 and mom's 63). dad has always had breathing problems and has been recently diagnosed with copd. he was a smoker. he was also a big time beer drinker. he was a functional alcoholic until he recently. in may, we had to take him to the er because he couldn't breathe. getting him to get into the car is a story for another time. he would up spending about a week. he definitely showed signs of hospital delirium. they said he likely had early stage dementia. when he got home, he was doing great. he was in good spirits and was eating! this didn't even last a week. in the beginning of june, things fell apart. one day, he just crashed. couldn't figure out how to use the water bottle he'd been using for years. couldn't hold anything. couldn't walk right. it was terrifying. we took him to the er. they wound up finding a blockage in his heart. they tried to fix it was a heart cath, but it was too solid. they needed to like drill it or something. however, they refused to because he wouldn't lay still, follow directions, and had randomly stopped taking his meds. his mental health began to deteriorate. the hospital chalked it up to alcohol withdrawal and basically messed around and delayed his spinal tap and mri. he got major tremors, possibly from withdrawal. they had to partially intubate him so he wouldn't choke. he was nearly a vegetable at one point. when he woke up more, he was confused and agitated. they had to restrain him because he ripped out all the ivs and wires. the confusion got worse. we had to put him in a nursing home while he healed. they actually talked about putting him in a psychiatric hospital because he was so bad off. thankfully, he improved the entire time he was there, which was about 5 weeks (he was in the hospital for 3 weeks).he's home now, just about two months. he's still confused, but it's better than it was initially. he says some strange things and has major short term memory problems. the worst of it is the eating. we had to hide all the medicine prior to this because of his tendency to take whatever he wants (again, it runs through his family). now we have to hide anything we don't want him to hoover down. he nibs around to find things to eat. today, we caught him with mom's foundation. he didn't know what it was. so naturally, he ate it. he put it in a mini bag of annie's cheddar bunnies. luckily, he didn't eat much of it. we asked him why he did it. he has a few answers. it makes things taste better. i just put it on my fingers. he didn't know what it was.i know he has brain shrinkage from alcoholism, but i'm pretty sure he has dementia, too. we need to talk to the neurologist again, but things have crazy with him going to the doctor 3 times in less than 2 months due to breathing issues. i guess i'm just looking for support on how the hell to cope with all this. there's more to it, but this is already super long. tl;dr: dad likely has dementia and ate makeup today and i just need to talk about it with someone who may understand."," nad but i can relate, this sounds like my mil, we don't know for sure but the theory is that alcoholism (and other drug use-- lots of uppers/downers in the 70s) may have caused the dementia. or perhaps made it worse and appear earlier. she never had a weight problem though-- if anything she was underweight. in the final years we couldn't get her to eat much at all, she'd sip ensure all day long. mil had a 6 second memory. you could time it like a clock. be visiting with her. leave the room. 1-2-3-4-5-6. re-enter. she would welcome you like she hadn't seen you in days. she let her dog out in a snow storm and he froze to death as she forgot. she'd take her medicine then take it again 6 seconds later. what a mess. but she was highly verbal until the very end--- and great at confabulation, so it took awhile for the family to put 2 and 2 together. tl;dr: it ultimately really doesn't matter what the cause of the dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/qgg22v/maybe_its_dementia_maybe_its_maybelline/,Maybe it's dementia.

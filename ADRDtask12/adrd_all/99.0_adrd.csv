"my grandma is staying with us and sometimes she might think she's at her old home. she even sometimes think that long past relatives are still alive. this infuriates my mom. she yells at grandma and calls her names. she keeps trying to explain things to grandma as if they'll stick, but obviously they won't. she's treating grandma like she knows what she's saying. seriously, my grandma could say she met abraham lincoln and my mom will actually sit there and explain to her, in detail, how that isn't possible. people say it's my mom grieving, but i don't really get it. please help :(", it sounds like your mom might be taking out her emotions on her mom. it's painful and scary to hear stuff like that. i recommend documentaries on alzheimer's disease that you watch together,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jfcw38/my_mom_doesnt_seem_to_get_that_my_grandma_isnt/,"My mom doesn't seem to get that my grandma isn't ""doing this on purpose"".

so my mom is 55. she is diabetic.she had a mri of her neck before having neck surgery and they saw white matter in her brain. she asked her neurologist about it and told him she is having some memory issues. he said he thinks it could be vascular dementia caused by her diabetes. he said she could reverse it if she got her sugar better controlled. i've noticed her having some memory issues and saying the wrong or name only a few times. i'm mentally disabled and live with her and my stepdad. my grandma moved in and has dementia so it's been stressful. i'm very worried about my mom. so is what the doctor said true? does white matter always mean dementia?," white matter hyperintensities/lesions occur frequently as you age, becoming more prevalent the longer you live. it is definitely a contributing factor to dementia, along with low levels of acetylcholine, amyloid beta plaque buildup, among other possible factors. i wouldn’t know if white matter lesions certainly lead to dementia, but studies show that people who develop dementia usually have a high amount. don’t mistake this for any kind of diagnosis. only the doctors would be able to tell with any measure of certainty. staying mentally and physically active, along with healthy eating is always good advice. i hope for the best for your mother.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jf8zap/possible_beginnings_of_vascular_dementia/,Possible beginnings of vascular dementia?

"it seems like my 58 year old mother has started showing prevalent signs of dementia, i don’t live with her so i haven’t see any symptoms besides for over the weekend she didn’t know where she was when she came to my house for a visit and had been misplacing items in her hand and car, and on monday was 3 1/2 hours away from home when she got lost while driving and couldn’t do simple tasks such as use her phone or realize she ran her car out of gas in the middle of the highway. today when my father took her to the hospital she had trouble remembering how to get dressed and where her clothes were. she has long term memory but nothing short term. she can’t tell you what she did that day or the day before, but knows who my brother, and myself are, and who she is. any insight on this would be helpful as it seems to me like a early onset case", i am so sorry you’re going through this. what you’ve described are all the same symptoms my mom had. she is also 58. she was just recently diagnosed with early onset alzheimer’s by a neuropsychologist. it was a long road to get that answer. we asked doctors to specifically screen her for alzheimer’s/ dementia as they had ruled out lots of other items. i wish you and your family the very best.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jf58hd/early_onset/,Early onset

"my dad keeps sneaking out. he figured out the door guardian lock in about a week and a child lock within a day. the problem is that he randomly decides not to stay on his allotted path and can't navigate beyond that, so he ends up hopelessly lost whenever he gets the temptation to go to safeway, and absolutely will *never* ask for help. he does this every 1-2 months. apparently today was the day, and my mom is driving around on the path he normally defaults to when lost and trying to find him.i'm trying to find something that won't cost $1,000 but also won't require a key on both sides. he's demonstrated that a simple mechanical solution (such as child locks or anything that just adds an extra step) won't work. if i have to, i'll try to convince my mom that we should do a keyed double cylinder deadbolt, but it's really not the preferred solution and she seemed pretty against it when i last suggested it. i just can't find any keypad or smart locks that lock both ways.added bonus is that he leaves things unlocked (and sometimes wide open) so our two year old flight risk is also able to escape. i already spent $100 on a keypad schlage lock installed backwards on the door to our garage because he was sneaking out through there, and when he couldn't go through there he figured out the door guardian lock. can't really install a lock backwards on the front door though.was wondering if anyone else has gone through this and figured something out and could perhaps impart some of that knowledge to me.tl;dr dad randomly gets lost, but is still clever enough to figure out child locks and such. trying to find out if an effective front door solution that doesn't entail a keyed double cylinder lock even exists.", i have no experience with dementia but would a gps tracker work as an alternative much like an probation ankle monitor that is not possible to remove so you could find him if he gets lost.this is assuming he only gets lost and isn't a danger to himself/others.nevermind: it was already mentioned below.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jey90e/need_help_finding_the_most_effective_lock_solution/,Need help finding the most effective lock solution
"i’ve had many dreams about her, most were nightmares which my family reckons is caused by when i was her carer. i had zero training and taking care of my grandma as she deteriorated was very much a learning experience that left me in a very bad place by the time she was moved into a care home.  usually my dreams of her would be her crying out to me at night and me not being able to move or get to her. or her coming back from the care home and me being told i have to care for her again (i love my grandma but i couldn’t bare to do it again) but this dream was different.i was on a train and i spotted my grandma walking down the cart looking for a seat. at first i was freaked out because my first thought was “how did she get out of the care home and how is she walking!?” as my grandma was pretty much bed bound by the time she was moved to the carehome. i called out to her and she started calling me by my mums name and sat down beside me. i can’t remember much of our conversation but she was very confused thinking another random person sat opposite us was my sister and i just went along with it because that’s the one thing i remember doing whilst i cared for her. she snuggled up to me and seemed content, for the first time in a while i didn’t feel anxiety when speaking with her but i remember thinking about what i was going to do when we reached our destination and how i was going to get her around as she has such poor mobility. eventually we arrived at our stop and i helped my grandma off the train and i turned to look for a member of staff to see if they could find us a wheelchair or point me to a phone but instead i saw my grandad’s car with him standing beside it smiling. my grandad died about 10 years ago but he felt so real and looked exactly as i remember him. i asked him why he was here and he said “i just want to say how proud i am of you. it’s okay, i’ll take it from here.” i gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek as told him how much i love and miss him and he said the same. he got my grandma into his car and they drove away. i woke up and i thought i’d feel sad but i feel happy? i get emotional but it’s just been so long since i’ve seen my granddad and he really felt like he was right in front of me. i always hoped that he would feel proud of me for what i was doing and he’d be watching me from afar somehow. im by no means religious but i do like to think we aren’t entirely gone when we die, even if it’s just to live in others memories and dreams. my grandma has said a few times to my mum that she’s going to meet my grandad at the bus stop and i honestly feel like when people die they go with those that they loved the most or at least that’s what i like to think. my granddad loved trains and vehicles in general so it was so fitting to see him collecting her from the station. i’m just rambling now but i don’t have anyone to share it with right now and i wanted to make a note of it while it was still fresh in my mind so i don’t forget it. i know it was only a dream but it’s given me so much comfort and inner piece and i really feel like i needed that."," thank you for sharing, what a beautiful gift this dream mus have felt like to you. i like to think  of the reunion side of things in the end, and this dream felt like what i hope for. beautiful!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jepwee/just_wanted_to_share_a_dream_i_had_about_my/,Just wanted to share a dream I had about my grandma.

"recently, we got an interesting perspective on dementia in nursing homes. i had to go into a nursing home for physical rehab when i lost the use of my left side due to a relapsing remitting neuropathy. the inability to drive led to severe social isolation, with the huge strangely figure eight shaped home being my entire world. i'm not demented yet, when out walking, would become completely disoriented in the identical, beige maze of hallways. the younger oxygen delivery people,who were not demented, got lost trying to make deliveries. the numbering system on the rooms made no rational sense. workman were constantly walking around on the roof, giving an impression of a second floor. many elderly who had been transferred to the home from a hospital and had never been outside it logically assumed the place had a second floor due to the constant sound of walking workman. the place was seriously moldy, it had a strong smell of gas by the boilers. smoke alarms would go off at all hours, disrupting sleep and sending ambulatory patients out to stand in the cold. deaths were constant, and depressing. you would barely get to know someone and they would have heart failure and die.like prison, it was a different world. like prison, people also banded together in strange ways, and had amazingly convoluted psychodramas over the smallest aspects of life in the facility.", curios. do you think this is true for all/most facilities or just a percentage? my mom is going for her test on the 29th. they are 90% sure it will show dementia so this is more for how bad and any additional aide. she is becoming difficult to deal with because she is belligerent about taking any medication. she is dreadfully afraid of a facility and i‘m at a loss of what to do. my husband and i work full time. keeping her out of trouble/entertained/safe is becoming a full time job. i have an aunt that is sharing responsibility by keeping her 6 months then with us for 6. no other family. i just don’t know how long i can keep her out of a place...any insight or help is appreciated.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/je081g/dementia_or_institutionalization_syndrome/,Dementia or institutionalization syndrome?

"i know this is another post asking ""does my loved one have dementia?"" but i don't know where else to turn.my grandma has always been tough and at yes difficult. she's blunt to you but sensitive about herself. loud and boisterous, yet sulky and pouty if you accidentally offend her over the smallest thing. i love her, but she is complex.my job became work from home so i moved across the state to live with her during covid. i was immediately shocked with just how, well, unpleasant she acted. irritable, snide over small things. but she's always been a difficult person so i thought it was the stress of a global pandemic and me being at home with her.then she forgot about something we did last december. it wasn't a big deal, so i just reminded her again. later she told me it confused her that she couldn't remember that event--even that didn't worry me. we all forget little things, right?then one day, quite out of the blue, she accuses me of forging her signature on something. i was shocked to say the least. i gently reminded her that the document she was referring to, she was out of town and i asked if i could sign on her behalf. i doubt i'm the first child or grandchild to sign for a parent/grandparent when they weren't available! she didn't believe me. i pointed out this document required her ssn, how could i have known that if she didn't tell me it (i don't have access to these type of documents of hers)? she was silent.the moment that got me reflecting on this happened tonight. we are out of town and she got into a fight with my dad over some childhood memories. the overall memories were right, but dad kept correcting her on small things.

"so, for reference, i am actually a registered nurse.  i'm not a psyc nurse, but working in the er exposes me to a good bit of alzheimer's and dementia patients.  i know this sounds bad, but when you see bad illnesses and death a lot, you kinda become numb to it.  i became very good at separating work from home, and actually having a family memeber with dementia just never crossed my mind.my day, 64 years old, fell a few months ago.  after the fall, he lost a lot of memory from things in the past year.  obviously i, as well as his doctor, agreed it was likely memory loss due to a concussion. fast forward a few months.  the memory has not returned.  a few weeks after the fall, i threw him a little birthday party.  yesterday when it was brought up, he had no memory of it.  he thought my 5 month old was over a year old.  so these things seem small, but my dad forgets nothing. like i didn't get away with anything as a teenager.  he worked in criminal justixe and did a lot of undercover work.  he could remember the license plate number of cars passing by our house hours later.  he is a very very sharp person.  at his last neurogist appoitment the doctor mentioned alzheimer's.  as a nurse, i believe she was very unprofessional and insensitive to my parents. you don't just casually mention ""oh maybe he has dementia or alzhimers, we will wait and see."" of course he is upset.it really hit me last night that thus could be real.  my mom is in denial, but i see the signs.  little things he forgets, as well as big things.  he cant remember that he stayed at my house 2 night while i was in labor.  he forgot that his best friend had an aneurysm and was airlifted for major surgery.  he is trying so hard to remember things, but ye cant.  does this look like the begining of dementia? i think i know ths answer, but i just need to hear it.  being a nurse is a wonderful career and i am great with my patients, but it is a different ball game when it is family.  i feel lost and scared.  i know how thus disease can progress.  he is so independent and i can't imagime how he would feel to loose that.  any advice, stories, or insights are welcome.  thanks in advance.  and if i have 10000 misspelled words, forgive me.  i'm typing fast and have been up all night."," falls are often the very earliest sign of dementia. that's what happened to a family member. she was having inexplicable falls now and again about 10 years ago, but the first sign that we had was when she was talking to a relative on the phone about a holiday that never happened,and that was only about 5 or 6 years ago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jdfcqd/very_concerned_about_my_dad/,[deleted by user]
"hi guys. my grandma is 86 years old, has dementia and is bedridden. we make her wear diapers and change it thrice daily. however, she would often rip the diapers off and pee on the bed instead. we kept telling her to just pee in the diapers to which she agrees but she still rips it off anyway. we tried putting trousers but she would figure out how to untie the knot so she can reach it. its incredibly frustrating especially with washing the mattress, the trousers, the clothes, cleaning the torn diapers, etc. anyone had any similar experiences or know a way to make her pee in the diapers? thanks guys", how does she react when you put the diapers on?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jddzuq/help_with_grandma/,Help with grandma

"hi all. i’m 23 years old and since i was a kid my mom has had memory problems. in my childhood those memory problems were really only prevalent in the evenings and nights when she would drink alcohol, but for the last maybe six months it’s been getting progressively and noticeably worse. i’m going to try to get her to go to a doctor to get tested but it’s hard because she’s very defensive. i guess i’m wondering what a test for dementia or alzheimer’s might look like and what happens after because i truly have no idea and i’m very stressed. my mom is only 55 but her family has a very bad history with alcohol. her brother died last year from a heart attack due to withdrawal from alcohol and i know he’s been in and out of rehabs all his life. my mom‘s dad also had a very bad problem with alcohol and died from some kind of liver disease. my therapist suggested it could be korsakoff syndrome but i truly don’t know and i’m just very worried. i guess i'm just looking for some kind of answers about how she might be diagnosed and what would happen after that.tldr my 55-year-old mother has some kind of memory problems and i’m looking for insight at best"," generally tests carried out to determine if someone is living with dementia consist of brain scans and memory and cognition assessments. should a dementia diagnosis be made, i would recommend connecting with other carers for someone living with dementia, support groups, or a dementia helpline if this is available where you live. because it is a progressive disease, it's probably best to sit down with her and discuss who will manager her finances; make decisions for her; complete an advanced care plan, so that the family can respect her wishes when she becomes significantly cognitively impaired. given her history of (?heavy) alcohol use, it's possible she may be living with alcohol-related dementia. but the only way to be sure what's going on is to speak to a doctor and run tests.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jcnn6d/my_mom_might_have_some_kind_of_memory_problems/,my mom might have some kind of memory problems

"i don't think i've posted here all that often, or really ever, so i'm not sure if it's the right place to post these things, seeing as they might have their own threads somewhere down the line.  originally i was thinking to ask for help with some of the things in here, but i'd rather not pour all of this down strangers' throats right before maybe asking for help, so i'll just ask for help with this one thing that's more recent, and then continue to rant in a way that is very abrupt, for i am editing this afterhand.  **||in short, my aunt with dementia is starting to wear an excessive amount of clothes when she hides in her room toward the later half of the day.  with her being in that room so long, how can we make sure she's not going to suffer in the hot heat of el paso from her odd behavior?||**once again, i must reiterate that the rest of this essentially-an-essay is just for the sake of me ranting; it's purpose purely for it to get my thoughts off of my chest.  if you decided to read at least this far and decide to discuss the one of my question laid above which is the most recent in my family's woes, then i thank you kindly- and to you and everyone else who might read at least this, i give you full permission to leave that reading here or wherever you see fit, as everything lying therein below this is only in the purpose of having it written all-out in the open, to be read or ignored by anyone who sees it.  but mostly, and more specific, i would like to know if anyone else has been having problems with a loved one suffering from dementia that's been wearing five-too-many tops- and how they've handled that troublesome self-harming behavior that is just one of many that loved one suffers from.for context, my aunt who used to live in assisted living is living with me and my family now.  being the eldest of my grandmother's children, she was the favorite child, even though according to my mom, aunt, and uncle, she tormented them their whole childhoods.  apparently, she was diagnosed with something that made her antagonistic around the time *i* was born, so i never saw that side of her up close as her medication made her more mellow than she was before, and i was generally just a quiet kid.  all of that to say that when she does some of her antics around the house which i'm sure many of you are generally familiar with, the rest of my family- who were the ones who had more experience dealing with my *grandmother's* dementia when she was still alive with us- don't really give their sister the same patience they gave their mom, so i'm the only calm head most of the time.  it's kind of fortunate, in very few ways, that all of this started just a month or so before the lockdown, because i'm still around the house even while taking my college classes.  they fight with her from time to time for something or another, but i'm at least around to mediate certain grievances, which i'm glad in doing.as of late she usually stays in her chair in the living room earlier in the day, which was moved so she wouldn't stare at everyone.  apparently she was caught staring at me sometimes while i was asleep on the couch, but i didn't mind on account of my not being conscious, and i figure that's more her headspace being far gone at the time than anything.  but she gets out of my old room late at night a lot now, i've noticed (with me also being awake well into the night for separate matters) (cough procrastinated college homework, rdr2).  she keeps going to the bathroom constantly even in the day too; she doesn't drink much water though, and we think she's just doing it out of habit.  despite that, she's had a few accidents without telling anyone, until my mom changes her diaper when the day ends, though she hasn't had one in a while now.  but when the day ends and that hasn't happened, we find out that she's already dressed herself in seven layers; according to my mom, two bras, three tanktops, a pajama shirt, and a jacket just today.  and all of that while we don't know anything because she's in her room at the end of the day with the door closed every time we open it.sometimes she thinks she's still in an assisted living place.  i'm the only one who goes along with whatever story she gives for the most part, since i've heard that's the best thing to do, i think.  my aunt's apparently a nurse, but at least she's still her sister.  my uncle is some guy who was in 5th grade with her, despite being a handful of years apart.  i guess i'm a patient too? since she keeps asking when i'm getting picked up- but she also asks what happened to the other guy, so i'm not sure if that means i'm a nurse too- and god knows who that mysterious ""other guy"" she allegedly talked to is.  and my mom might still actually be her sister just visiting her; she's a little vague on that, while other times she's the head nurse.  but what's for certain is that my sister's youngest children are the *bane* of her existence; she'll stare at them while holding her ears in apparent pain, and at times yell at them- she doesn't grab them anymore as she'd done before in family gatherings, thank god- but she never just goes to her room when they're here, despite spending most of her day there anyways *and* being told to do so.  that's the only time i really get angry at her, which i'm ashamed for doing so, since deep down i know half of it is just the disease; the other half her being a cranky old woman.  it's only the rare visit when my sister really just needs to spend the day focusing on her grad work when she leaves them here- and yes, we all follow our city's local emergency directive, it's still bellow 10 heads under our roof when they're here.she also sometimes claims she lives with her aunt and cousins though.  they're still alive, thank the lord, but with my great aunt being so old, her being at far greater risk and just not being all there in her head neither, i don't think her visiting them would be so good, despite me thinking that could do her some good to see them.  but she keeps asking where her mom is, which has been bothering everyone at the house.  when she doesn't get an answer, she just figures by herself that she's at church, and i just tell her she very well likely is- and that's the truth, i do believe.  the only times she ever tried to break out were so she could make it back to her aunt's house- a place that isn't where she thinks it is- but thankfully due to our house's layout, my uncle and i's generally permanent seating arrangements, and her usual ones, she can't ever make it to the door before anyone knows she's there.  i don't know how healthy it is to tell her that her mom's at church now though, since even though it's been a while since she tried to leave the door by herself, it's even more dangerous for her to be outside now.i feel like this is becoming more of a rant than anything now though, so i'll end this here.  in short, her frequent visits to the restroom, the lack thereof at times and further lack of asking help, her curious over-the-top wardrobe choices (she even stole one of my shirts i made the mistake of leaving there, though i surrender she wore it better), teenager-like time in her room, irregular sleep schedule that we're doing our best of correcting, and her antagonism towards the children are our real big gripes.  the two women in my family, my aunt and mother, do the lord's work when it comes to changing and bathing her, and my uncle in feeding her and the whole family, but they all have very short patience with that woman, and though my own duties are far smaller around the house in comparison, i'm at my wits end in bringing myself between her and everyone else when she or someone else picks a hill to die on.  i thank you if you've read this far in as it wasn't all that necessary; and if you haven't, i'm just glad to get that off of my chest."," how old is your aunt?

"i posted several months ago about my grandma who had dementia who eventually passed away in may after a severe decline that occurred seemingly without warning. she and i were extremely close when i was younger. she and now just my grandpa live on my street so i was always at their house growing up and everyone knew i’m the favorite grandchild. it was neither hidden nor thrown out there on purpose to rub in anyone’s face. everyone just knew.last night i was thinking about her and ran across a post where multiple people suggested those who were interested to listen to a youtube video that used music to represent the stages of dementia, but only if you were in the right space mentally. i should’ve listened. i listened to it and read the description box and it hurt me knowing that it was probably an excellent explanation of what she and others have gone through or are currently going through. at the very end when she had no idea that she was in the house she’d been in most of her life, my grandpa, my mom, and myself were the only ones she knew each and every time she saw us. the day she got home from the hospital, i came to visit and she knew who i was right away and tried so hard to carry on a normal conversation with me, asking me how i was and where i’d been. she studied me intently and told my aunt (her daughter who she couldn’t remember) that she was just looking at how pretty i was. i left the room and told everyone how she knew who i was because i didn’t get my hopes up for her to remember me. even though i didn’t mean to hurt their feelings, i’m sure i secretly did. i went back in with my mom who asked her if she knew who i was. she said, ”well yes, that’s [my name].” as if it was so obvious and she didn’t know why she was being asked. she had also forgotten she’d just seen me a few minutes before that and her eyes perked up. when it was time for them to pick her up to take her to the nursing home, i went in to tell her goodbye and my cousin said, “look, there’s [my legal name].” my grandma looked at me and corrected her, calling me the nickname she always had. it brings me joy knowing what few brain cells remained had me embedded deeply.she was in a lot of pain and hallucinated. it was just hard for me to digest seeing the woman who had taken care of me needing care from me. now that she’s gone, i’m really feeling it. by “it,” i mean guilt, anger, and relief.i feel guilty for being relieved that i am now able to carry on normal adult conversations without being asked the same question, verbatim, 40 times in an hour. i mean, for fucks sake, how many times do i have to tell you the party is next saturday, not this saturday? i am proud of myself for never getting too frustrated and saying, “you’ve already said/asked that!” i’d stay up all night to make sure she didn’t wander off in her car. luckily, she gave up her keys willingly, unlike her own mother who suffered the same fate. since i was pretty young when her symptoms exhibited themselves, it’s so frustrating and makes me angry when i try to think back at memories i had with her before the disease overwhelmed her and killed her while still leaving her alive because they are truly so far and few between. i’m just feeling some mixed emotions. it sucks. thanks for reading."," can you please share the link to the youtube video?having a loved one with dementia or losing a loved one with dementia is extremely hard. i still have trouble wrapping my mind around how dementia affects a person. though my mother is still living, i find myself feeling similar. thank you for posting this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jbhu7p/i_feel_so_guilty_angry_and_relieved/,"I feel so guilty, angry, and relieved."
"i'll try to keep this short because this is hard on me.i recently placed my mom in an adult family home.because of covid i haven't seen her for three months. i finally saw her this past weekend.because of the disease and the drugs she looked off..seemed warm yet distant. i miss the old her. the person before the disease. dementia, for me, is a disease that is worse than dying because it makes us relieve the pain over and over and over again.it's very hard for me and makes my heart hurt. i figured i was a strong person. but im not."," you’re so strong and you don’t realise it. making the decision to move a family member into a home is really tough and not an easy decision to make. it took me and my family about a year to come to that conclusion with my grandma and we tried so hard to do our best until it literally became so bad that we were in over our heads, looking back on it now we should’ve put her in a home sooner. i’ve only managed to visit my grandma once since she moved there and due to covid visits are only permitted by talking through a window. it’s hard but definitely better than risking the alternative. they will have days where they are more docile and quiet but from what i understand the drugs often help them to feel less anxious. before my grandma went into care she would yell and cry most of the time, we would try to console her but even she didn’t really know what was wrong. since being in the home shes much happier, she has friends and the opportunity to socialise which she didn’t have before as she would usually shut herself away in her room which definitely made it worse. it’s okay to miss them and to mourn their past selves, hold onto those past memories because they are so important and she would want you to remember that version of her. it took me a while to look back on those memories because whenever i thought of her i would only remember my time as her carer and how traumatic it was for both her and myself. i often wish my grandma would die quickly not because i don’t love her or want her around but because i hate seeing her suffer to such an awful disease and i think anyone who has had experience with this illness would agree. just please don’t think you aren’t strong. it’s okay to cry and feel everything you’re feeling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jbdawl/the_hard_thing_about_dementia/,The hard thing about Dementia

(my explanation for my affections is that grandma was dying and i had realized i needed to be more affectionate to the people i love a lot more because life is too short.) mom later told me that a few days before the incident, grandpa talked to her about me living with him and apparently thought it would look suspicious to other people, which confused mom. like what’s suspicious about your granddaughter continuing to take care of you after she took care of you and your wife for four years? and grandpa had said “you know i’d never do anything to her.” and mom just kind of looked at him like “... i don’t think you’re her type. you’re too old and she’s gay.” said in a lighthearted joking way. but it’s made me realize that he has been thinking this way of me for multiple days. once my uncle and mom came to talk to him he expressed regret and said he doesn’t know what came over him. he also said some alarming things like “i don’t have any reason to live.” and we took away all his guns. my family has kept me away from him and i haven’t seen him since the funeral last month. mom stays with him now, he hasn’t done anything inappropriate to her and she says he just stays quiet and watches tv all day. he’s asked for us to forget about what happened and for me to come back. my folks have said no, even if i did want to do that. i’ve been doing research on dementia and have also started a job working with elderly patients. i’ve been wanting to blame this all on dementia, that it’s not the real grandpa that did this. it would be so much easier on me to think that. but grandpa hasn’t shown any of the warning signs of dementia. he’s sharp and does his bills and organizes his medicine and does all his daily tasks no problem. his personality is the same. i know inappropriate sexual behavior is common in those with dementia, but is that the case here? do people with dementia plan out the sexual behavior days in advance while knowing who the person is the entire time?or is it the grief of losing his wife of 65 years that caused him to do this? is that a possibility?i’m just grasping at straws here. i don’t want to believe that was the real grandpa that would do something like this.", hi sorry i’m jumping on this late. but vascular dementia can absolutely cause sexual disinhibition! so it definitely could be that. vascular dementia doesn’t necessarily cause personality changes either.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jb1cte/could_this_have_been_dementia_sexually/,Could this have been dementia?

(i got screamed at yesterday because the lightbulb in his lamp blew out, his dinner was too hot, we were out of hot sauce (we weren't, it just wasnt where he thought it should be), and other things not worth mentioning.)i've read that a major change like this could be caused by dementia, or just male aging issues. when i try to find a list of other dementia symptoms it gets me nowhere because all the early symptoms are things he's always been/done. i can't bring the subject up (""you've been really angry lately, are you feeling okay?"") with my dad without getting blamed/screamed at, so of course he won't get tested. my mom insists he's just older/not feeling well and is just grouchier for it. aunts/uncles/cousins don't see it because i guess he saves all his rage for when he's at home. i am unwilling to live like this any longer, but i don't know what to do. if i move out, it feels like i'm abandoning them when they need me the most, and my mom will be the one to suffer - the story of my entire adult life.  also, if my dad really is having degrading mental health issues, i want to help him. how do i tell if it's dementia or just worsening narcissism? and if it is dementia, how do i get him the help he doesn't think he needs?  i know i can't force help on someone, but 1) he's my dad, and i still care about what happens to him, 2) i dont want his tantrums to escalate from verbal to physical - i don't think i could forgive him, 3) he's not the only one suffering here.", op i read someone’s suggestion on another post that i thought was great. go see you dads gp and have a chat with them about your concerns. they could call him for a ‘routine check up’ they’re offering all their patients or something along those lines. that way your dad won’t likely resist.he’s unlikely to agree or listen to your attempt of being logical. forget logic here if his cognition is degrading it’s pointless to expect him to be rationale esp if he has a difficult personality,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j9txbx/dementia_or_worsening_narcissism/,Dementia or worsening narcissism?
"me and mom are at the verge of mental breakdown taking care of grandma. northern  malaysia here doesn't have much facilities that are prepared to help us take care of her. and if there are any, it's in the next state (penang) and places are closed down due to covid.so... idk. idk what i'm expecting by posting this... but i need to get this out of my chest...grandma (mom's mother) is about 92 years old. has a really bad temper. some older relatives suspected that grandma had some kind of npd (narcissistic personality disorder) in her youth, taking her daughters' physical and mental health for granted throughout her whole life and then expecting them to take care of her in her old age because of self-serving east asian filial piety values. mom and aunts are taking turns to take care of her daily - most of their lives are already gotten hit real bad due to covid (their businesses ruined, one lost her job, another works in a school that is now closed down). out of 5 sisters, now 3 of them are getting near to mental breakdown by taking care of her. she almost burned down mom's house by messing with the kitchen. then, her legs' muscles had deteorated to the point of not able to walk - and yet, she insist of getting up to ""work"", and inadvertently fall down. then, when we rush to her side to help her back up to her bed, she hit, punch us because she thought we ""kidnapped"" her in her sleep (she doesn't recognize us since 2 years ago). one time, she grabbed my aunt's head and bit her ear (it was a bloody incident) - leading to the said aunt to vow never visit her again.i lost my job due to covid, so naturally i am ""assigned"" to care for grandma. mom had to quit her job to take care of her . and every single day, we get verbally, physically assaulted by her. you have to pay close attention to her 24/7, or else she will try to get up and fall down, but if you sit next to her 24/7, she will hiss at you, assault you when you get too close. ...and of course, she doesn't recognize me anymore. she thinks i'm some kind of bad man who wants to kill her. i don't know if she thinks i'm a nazi soldier or some showa-era japanese imperial soldier that try to burn her alive or something. she hits me. she curses at me. she even tries to strangle my mom last night (mom sleeps next to her, in case she wakes up, so she can help her get to her pee chair). now, i look at her. and i can't see her in that flesh shell of hers anymore. it's like someone else has taken possession of her body and my grandma... she's not there anymore. i mean, i already know she's not herself two years ago. but trying to save mom from being strangled to death by her (and how is her legs so weak but her hands' grip is so strong?!) gives me a rude awakening that my grandma...is no more.... i miss my grandma. sure, aunts say ""she isn't really a sweet person"" and she is used to abusing them in their youth. sure, maybe the loving grandma that i remember was probably me remembering her narcissistic love-bombing. but i miss her. i'm sorry... idk what i'm expecting by typing this out for the world to read...but i guess... i need to let it out of my chest to finally grieve losing her."," that sounds really awful, i'm so sorry!some ideas in case they help: try wearing some sort of a costume and see if you get a different reaction out of her. try different costumes, particularly any that will lead her to deduce instantly that you are a different known person - maybe a famous person or role). maybe she will find it difficult to think you are a soldier trying to kill her if you are in a dinosaur costume?can you get some kind of rigid collar for your mother to wear that would offer some added protection against assault?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j9n1xr/my_grandma_thinks_im_some_kind_of_kidnapper/,My Grandma thinks I'm some kind of kidnapper

"they is a good friend of mine. few months ago i started to get worried about how absurd their thinking had got, which represented itself as complaining about stupid things and having weird opinions, as if logic had been slightly ruptured.now they thinks i have stolen their medicines, doubts me all the time, verbally abuses every now and then, short-term memory is shot. false memories, traveling back in time, fear and confusion, delusions and hallucinations are frightening. i am not sure what kind of picture they has about situation, they has always known being in high risk as it runs in family and i think half a year ago they said it has definitely got him. ""no doubt"". implied having it again two months ago, week ago and yesterday. they actually seems to be getting ready to the progression of condition. but they maybe does not get how serious it really is and how it affects. we haven't had proper discussion about it. i don't know how much it is denial and how much inability to insight. i have pointed out and insisted many times they has false memories and such serious things happening and they mostly doesn't take it well, but sometimes does. nowadays i mostly don't want to put much energy to that or get stuck debating, it mostly doesn't seem beneficial.they is going to hospital for two days this week, which will dramatically improve their moods, but i wish they would also see neurologist or something there. thing is, i wouldn't want to run just yet for exceptionally good reasons (but very soon), and i guess there can be yet short brief of better insight through acceptance-their personality is such that dementia would be bigger ""nope!"" than for most people-also apparently insanely harder and more dangerous to stand to other people. they has trust issues and really hard wants to be independent and free, which probably makes it more difficult to them. also has tendency to paranoia and psychotic stuff already. they actually fakes and makes excuses also. i dunno if it can be unconscious, sometimes their bullshit seems very transparent yet possibly not for them.last night they got physically abusive to me, first time towards anyone, probably in almost decade or so. they is in physically inferior situation for a while yet (but they has electric self-defence weapon) and overall it is very dumb from them to get violent, it could ruin a lot for them too. but they just couldn't control themself, they said, after apologizing. they wanted a hug. we had a hug and went to sleep. i don't know what they thinks about location of meds and electronics now. maybe it was just spirits messing up or simulation has got too complex and is just glitching. maybe it was me who took em. it seems to be i can't predict too much predictable, stable, logical, rational acting from them, though at times they seems sane and nice. which is scary thought, in no case they should do it again, for themselves too (at least if they don't want to push me away, which they has always had tendency to do to people), but it maybe will not help. as maybe won't the hospital visit.i have read that journey of dementia is different to everyone and nothing can prepare to deal with one with it, but uhhh... your experiences? advices? i really wouldn't want to deal with this kind of anxiety on a daily basis, which is kinda equivalent to my brain telling me to fuck off, i guess. i am not for this, particularly as i should heal my own shit also. i would want to say i am going to fuck off as soon as it can be arranged conveniently, which is though barely possible for many reasons. projects will die, they won't get new flatmate, who helps them weeks after surgery? morbid shit. fucked up year."," well, it escalated quickly. i ran, their behavior got just lunatic and really dangerously combative. i think there was no realistic options right now. i left so fast that they might have had ruined half of my property left in the apartment. i think about involving professionals somehow but dunno rly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j5hkyk/flatmate_most_definitely_has_dementia_and_i_dont/,Flatmate most definitely has dementia and I don't know when it would be Best to run.

"grandma went to stay at an in-patient facility through her hospice, it was a respite care stay-giving us a much needed breather. anyway, when i picked her up yesterday to drive her home, she smoked a cigarette. i told her it was the only i had for her until we got home. then i was on various phone calls for most of the ride trying to figure out how my brother and i were going to take turns staying the night with her and my uncle because the hospice social worker said we can't leave them alone. i look over at one point and she's in my glove box (okay, that's fine). then she grabs a tampon out and starts examining it (whatever i'm trying to focus on the phone call)... she slowly starts unwrapping it and pausing to look at it before continuing. she fully extends it and throws the wrapper on the ground. then she started mumbling about a lighter. at this point the phone drops to my lap and i ask her why she needs a lighter.

"hi - we very recently added a relative to our household who is almost completely blind and has dementia - the memory loop is about 2-5 minutes. 2 successful things today:* folding dishtowels of different sizes and textures* taking pens/pencils out of a box and putting them in a mug, it didn't matter which side was up. she did ask, though, so i think she could have done itshe didn't need or request help with either activity. i don't know that she was excited, but she did say she was glad to help me. i had said these things would be very helpful for getting the kitchen clean. 1 failure:* putting napkins in napkin rings. i think it was too visual of a concept to grasp, and then when i tried to explain it verbally, it was frustrating for her. i think she doesn't remember what napkin rings are - but i know she had them at her house. if i think of a better way to explain it i might try again, but i think it just requires too much eyesight for a new concept. pt starts next week. we often keep music she likes playing in the background. we try to keep conversations going just asking about her life many years ago or narrating what we are doing, talking about dinner. it's hard to keep up though. i know she's getting bored, but i'm having a hard time coming up with ideas that seem like they'd be interesting and not too babyish. or maybe that doesn't matter?if you have any good suggestions for very-short-story or poetry audio books, podcasts, etc that don't require a lot of continuity to be interesting and aren't stressful, that would be nice.  i really don't think a book - even a favorite one - would be good. she just can't remember that long.she's british and 95, so anything from about the 30s/40s on is probably familiar. us material is fine for the 70s/80s and onward. thank you!!", one of my residents loves to throw little rings or balls into a basket. sometimes they like to color too,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j47g4f/need_activities_for_dementia_blind_maybe_25/,"Need activities for dementia, blind, maybe 2-5 minutes of memory"
"hello everyone, i hope you are keeping safe and compassionately giving care 🧡🧡🧡today i want to share a few strategies on how to communicate with alzheimer’s patients. i hope this will help those caring for loved ones with alzheimer’s and can’t seem to figure out how best to communicate with them.1. limit potential distractions while talking to them. it would help if you made sure that there is nothing to distract the patient while having a conversation. switch off the tv, radio, or any other devices, get rid of stuff that could divert their attention, or ensure the environment itself is not distracting.2. speak naturally and use non-verbal cues. do not speak to the patient like an infant with a high pitch or by getting close to their face; it is very humiliating. if you want to get their attention, a gentle touch and calling them by their name works perfectly. non-verbal cues such as gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions are also important in connecting with the patient.3. talk one thing at a time. it is important to discuss one topic/subject at a time to avoid confusing the patient. while communicating, remain connected and present to ensure the patient maintains their line of thought on the subject matter.4. focus on simple conversations. learn to keep conversations short and simple by breaking information into smaller chunks. do not repeat statements; instead, rephrase them. do not jump in when the patient struggles to find a word; they will be confused. patiently wait for them to remember the word with subtle hints here and there. repeating familiar words or names also helps build the patient’s familiarity with these words or names.5. be creative. you need to be creative in countering their resistance or frequent confusion or reality. for instance, a retired patient can demand to leave for work because it is their duty. this could mean they are not engaged enough, and they need something to keep them busy. come up with creative activities that will keep them occupied. another example is when they decline to take a bath, you can offer them options, like an alternative time for them to take a bath. should sound like this, *“jane, how about you take a bath at 2pm or does 3pm sound better?”*6. be patient, compassionate, and avoid being aggressive. communicating with an alzheimer’s patient can be very difficult, especially due to their unpredictable emotional and mental states. be patient as you learn how they communicate. use active listening, take everything they say into consideration, and act on their requests as long as they do not compromise care. avoid arguing or talking back; instead, learn what triggers emotional change and interpret their responses and attitudes to certain situations.7. understand that you play a crucial role as a caregiver. interacting and communicating with an alzheimer’s patient will have some good and bad days. however, as a caregiver, you should aim at providing the best, even on the bad days. the patient relies on you for comfort, emotional, and mental support; therefore, learn to listen and communicate with them truthfully.please feel free to ask any questions or share any more strategies that have worked for you in the past.have a beautiful day, and keep loving and caring for your patients or loved ones 🧡🧡🧡"," these are great. i slipped up remembering these today and it ended up with an ugly episode with my dad over a simple mis-communication. i have been very stressed over something else going on in my life and my patience was thin, and no one triggers me more than my father. it eventually blew over but it serves to tell me that as a caregiver this entire disease process is a long and difficult road and we need to constantly keep learning. i have to remind myself to just step back and not let emotions take over, because it's not him, it's the disease that's talking. you can't argue with a disease.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j416w6/simple_communication_strategies_for_a_patient_or/,Simple Communication Strategies for a Patient or A Loved One with Dementia Alzheimer's.

"just for clarification, we feed him good meals. this morning he had toast and cereal with a banana and his pills. that should be enough right?apparently not. he’s basically always asking for food. even when he just ate.last night he had pork and beans with bread, minutes later he asked what was in the fridge and what we’re making for dinner (it was 10:00 at night), i told him that he just ate and his plate was still there, said thats my uncle’s, who lives a few states over. i gave him some water with crackers. i walk by him with a cat bag from the litter boxes and he thinks its food, i tell him that i cleaned the cat boxes. he thinks im lying and wants to check the bag. or if i walk by with food for my mom (shes usually on a work call and i bring her chips and what not), he asks what i have and if he can have some, usually right after he ate. else i would make him something.a few nights ago i told him to go put his pajamas on after a big meal. i go in the kitchen to clean up and hes in the cupboards asking what we made for dinner.i dont know. its very aggravating but he just doesnt get that he already ate. does he not feel how full he is? he says at the table that he cant eat another bite when i insist that he takes some more so he wont scavenge, so i know that im not under feeding him. i dont get how you can eat more after a plate of beef and mash with bread, and dessert."," don't say he's already eaten - in his reality he hasn't eaten, so anyone saying he has is lying which could be really upsetting or worrying. he likely literally doesn't feel whether he's full and can't remember that he's eaten. i'd be tempted to have loads of low calorie nutritional snacks in so you can say ""yes i'll bring your dinner in now"" and then have small plates. snacks i can think of are fruit, veg, nuts, seeds, crackers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j2wk1k/grandfather_constantly_hungry/,grandfather constantly hungry?

"i was wondering what you guys experience was with late stage dementia. she is completely bedridden, incontinent, lost function in one of her arms and the other is constantly shaking. cannot eat or drink herself, frequently has hallucinations and delusions, and 99% of her time awake is just screaming and yelling in pain or various people’s names. haven’t seen her laugh in a very, very long time. yet somehow she still appears somewhat healthy and is eating fine. around 2 months ago she was taken to the icu and was in a one week coma due to a chest infection but she managed to recover from that. what are people’s experiences with this kind of dementia? it is lewy body dementia."," hospice, morphine",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j2hu3x/life_expectancy_for_late_stage_dementia/,Life expectancy for late stage dementia?
"just a vent... advice welcome. hugs needed. my grandfathers condition is rapidly progressing. his processing just doesn't exist anymore. he's had the same bedtime routine for literally years but nowhe wont take his pants offhe wont put his depends onhe wont put his jammies onhe wont take his hearing aid out before laying downhe says he doesn't feel sick. he says he's not upset. he just wants us to go away.he can't understand why he needs to do these thingshe thinks there are bad guys coming to take him awayhe thinks we want to take his wallet and steal his money(he has a set amt of money in his wallet and an ""allowance"" from his retirement thats put away for things he needs)he thinks we want to take his keys away (he has random no use keys and a house key, he's always with us so thats kind of a backup)and he's become stubborn, and combative. he's been physically fighting us as well as just shouting. its so difficult because along with the expected inability to understand and process instruction or information, hes (mostly)deaf. been deaf his whole life. turns out its much easier to get context clues from conversations when your cognitive abilities havent been affected... never learned to sign out of pride. writing down questions or instructions never works either. he can read it, understand what it says but can't understand he's the one meant to do it! not only that but we can't even comfort or console him, he just can't ""hear"" what we are saying. or he thinks we are trying to trick him.so now i sit tonight waiting to be awoken by him saying he had an accident. because he wouldn't change this evening. i will reassure him he's not a burden. i will clean up and put him into bed again.  and i will do my best again tomorrow. because seeing how fast things can go south the past few weeks has made me reflect. im happy to be one of the people he can count on. im happy we still have eachother. this shit really isn't for the faint of heart. much love to you all. thanks for reading. keep strong. xoxo"," there is nothing easy about it. if you are religious - pray. if you are not, harden yourself, because it will get worse till the very end. if sickness corrodes the mind so much, the mind is basically gone. remember the good days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j2d57v/rambling_vent_about_tonight/,Rambling vent about tonight
"i wish apple would let caregivers install a senior package for an ipad that allowed caregivers to operate their care receiver devices remotely. my mom uses her ipad for a few puzzle apps, netflix, email, texting and occasionally answering face-time if she is having a good day and can figure out how to answer. i wouldn’t care if i had to travel to an authorized apple store to verify with my poa that remote access is for my mom’s devices. but i’m sick of the two-factor authenticator and other update bullshit that skyrockets her anxiety and it never fails, it happens after the regular assisted living staff have left for the evening. yes i have auto updates enabled which works consistently for apps but not software updates.snl was spot on with their amazon echo silver skit! rant over!", confused about the updates part.  can’t you just turn off auto updates?i feel you tho.  i so wish my dad used android phones but he can’t handle the change.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j2ac2q/damn_you_apple/,[deleted by user]
"i’ve posted in here a couple of times before but i guess i’m just looking for advice again. my grandad suffers from lewybody syndrome and dementia. these past couple of months he’s been in and out of the hospital, and almost 3 weeks ago he came home from hospital after being in there for 7 weeks.on saturday, my grandad fell and i thought he broke his arm so we waited two hours for an ambulance. he was complaining about being uncomfortable and i genuinely thought the ambulance wasn’t going to arrive, even after trying to chase up where they were. so, i got him onto a chair where he complained of feeling dizzy and that’s when he had a stroke/seizure (i’m not sure) and he went into cardiac arrest. i’m only 20 and i never thought i’d experience something like this. his body went stiff and i remember the 999 woman was telling me to do cpr and she was counting with me. my dad was there and he over took as my dog ran away as she was so scared, but i am so lost. i feel broken, i feel alone. i feel like everything that i have ever done for him was never good enough and i should have done more. i understand that this condition can dramatically change but one minute he was responsive and his stubborn self and the next he was practically dead. with coronavirus, i’m not even allowed to visit him in the hospital. although, they made the exception today and he is severely unwell. he has a broken hip, chest infection &amp; a small bleed on the left side of his brain. he thinks it’s 1967, he thinks that he is at home and he was telling me to take him down the stairs. he is on oxygen and can barely breathe independently. since being his main care giver for over a year and living with him for less than a year, i feel like i have truly bonded with him. there’s been hiccups but i love him. the night before his accident he apologised for being nasty with me, he told me that he cares and worries about me. i hope he knows that i care and worry about him too. that i love him.i don’t know why i wrote this post. i suppose i’m scarred and i just want to maybe talk to somebody who has had experience with this. i can’t deal with watching my grandad die and my family is so dysfunctional. i want someone to ask me if i’m ok because in reality, i’m not. i walk into the kitchen and i just see visions over and over of the whole event. i thought today, seeing him would give me clarity but instead it’s given me more visions and more worries.i love and care about him so much that it hurts and i hope he can feel better soon, or at least find comfort. i want him to be out of pain. i wish i could take it away from him."," i’m so sorry. a year ago in march, my grandpa (whose dementia was already progressing) choked during dinner at a restaurant, lost consciousness, and had to be taken by ambulance. like you, i kept seeing it happen. about six months later, i started seeing a therapist to help with that and other stressors in my life. she diagnosed me with acute stress response. please take care of yourself for now- your grandad sounds like he’s getting the medical care that he needs. hang on to that conversation from the night before. one of the things i am thankful for is the number of times between that night and when he died (9 months later) was the number of times i would visit and he would say ‘there’s my girl!’ when i came in, or told me he loved me as i was leaving (he was never really too affectionate before the dementia). it doesn’t necessarily get easier, even after they’re gone. it is a relief knowing they aren’t suffering anymore, though. my thoughts are with you and him- i can’t imagine how difficult it must be not being able to be with him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j28lye/how_do_i_get_over_this_traumatic_experience/,How do I get over this traumatic experience?

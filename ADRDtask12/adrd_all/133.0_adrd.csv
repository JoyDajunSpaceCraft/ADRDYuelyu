 i live with my dad who is disabled and has dementia and was told i could get paid something by medicaid and not sure how to go about this. anyone have any experience with it? we are not hurting but it's been over a year and since i can't get a job i figured i might as well give it a shot.thanks for any assistance.," it depends on the state you live in, because each state has different medicaid programs. does your dad have full medicaid? in louisiana, if he has full medicaid he would qualify for what is called the long term personal care services waiver. you'd call and apply for this waiver and they would approve or deny the application based on the questions they ask you and the answers they give. then someone would come out to see y'all in person to develop a plan of care and provide you with a list of personal care attendant agencies. you would have to choose a pca agency and basically be hired on by them as an employee. that's how you get paid to care. i'm a social worker in louisiana and i've applied for this waiver on behalf of a family before. i hope this helps at least get you going in the right direction, since like i said, each state is different and i only know how to do this in louisiana.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5ynm7o/anyone_know_how_to_go_about_getting_paid_to_be_an/,Anyone know how to go about getting paid to be an in home caregiver?

"my husband was dx with parkinson's 7 or 8 years ago.  he's retired now but used to be a program manager for a local city.months ago he had a pop up on his computer that said microsoft had determined there were problems on his computer and gave him a number to call.  luckily i was able to convince him to give me the phone during his chat with the scammer and ended the call.  i explained it was a common scam and went into a little detail.i'm guessing they kept his phone number, because two days ago he received a phone call from a ""microsoft technician"" aka scammer who said unauthorized people were using his computer to do computations.  i explained it was a scam and he said he was just keeping them on the phone to mess with them.they called again today.  he hasn't given them any personal info, i don't think.  when i asked him why he keeps interacting with them after we've talked about it in the past, he says he read about it being possible for people to use our computers so he thinks they are legit.  i explained there's no possible connection between his phone and his computer and went on to explain how they scam people.  so 1 - he lied to me two days ago to humor me  and 2 - he's not understanding they can't possibly know if he even has a computer and 3 - he is not recognizing the possible damage they could do to us.i believe this is cognitive decline... do you?  (sorry i needed to vent and hear other's opinions before his next dr. appt.)  tia!"," i agree with some of the other comments on here. it really is hard to pin. one of the biggest early signs of dementia is the inability to remember new information. but as another person said, this could be a cognitive decline due to the parkinsons disease. there are cases where it actually makes the brain develop dementia. i'm a cna for dementia residents only and i had a resident who had major frontal lobe damage due to a work related accident. he developed parkinsons which in return developed dementia as well. sounds like it could be both or it could just be a cognitive decline because of the parkinsons. regardless, i would talk to his doctor and if similar things occur, have some tests run.   as for lewey body dementia, i'm no doctor, but i've worked with enough people with that specific type to know the symptoms. i personally would say no. lewey body is a bit different than normal dementia because of the symptoms. if i recall correctly, mostly if not all of the residents i've had with this type experienced very vivid and lucid hallucinations. most were visual but some were auditory and even sense (like smell and taste) related. i know that parkinsons related dementia and lewey body are similar and sometimes display similar symptoms, but definitely don't rule this out until the necessary tests are performed. in my experience, it has always required a proper diagnosis so don't assume too much until the tests are done.   i hope this can help you and your husband and just remember that no matter what you have to stay patient.

"had to put dad into a home a few months ago because he stopped eating. at the hospital he was diagnosed with lbd. at the time he was ok with going but now he calls every day asking for his car. i have told him multiple times that his doctors have told him he can't drive and discussed the disease with him, but he just blows it off and flips out. i try to distract and deflect, but i don't know if i am doing that right. how do you deal with the constant anger? "," as a cna for dementia residents only, one thing that i've learned in my time as a caregiver is that you have to become a master of deception, reflection, and redirecting. it is not our residents job to live in reality, to live in our world, the disease has taken that ability away from them. it is our job to live in their world. in most cases, being honest with someone who has dementia almost never has any benefit. don't tell your father that he is no longer able to drive, instead, tell him that his car is being worked on in a workshop. tell him that as a favor to him, you took it in for a routine oil change and while they were looking at the car, they found a few parts in the engine that needed replacing and offered to do it for a generously discounted price. and as an early birthday present to him, you are covering the small cost of the repairs and will bring the car to him when it is done. remind him that the repairs will take at least two days. from the information provided, it sounds like his dementia is progressed far enough for him to forget things on a daily basis. if this continues to be a behavior, always resolve to the given answer or something similar or something that he will find more believable. if he refuses to believe the given answer, tell him that you have to take care of something urgent, (small task, nothing too hard for him to grasp)and that you will call him back within the next hour. if he calls you back before then, and asks about the car, tell him a reversal of the original answer. tell him that your car is in the shop and that you borrowed his until yours is fixed. don't directly tell him that he himself gave you permission, but that your mother did.   these are just examples and you can alter them or use something that you find more effective whenever you want. but this type of reply can help minimize anxiety from your father because they are believable situations.   the key is to make it seem like that you are trying to help him or acted quickly out of a desperate situation. it can likely even make him feel better.   and always remember, when speaking to him, don't use phrases like ""don't you remember?"", and so on. it can cause the situation to escalate because he simply may or will not remember because of his disease. always try to involve him in your reply as little as you can as this can cause reactions where he gets upset because he will say that he didn't give you permission, etc. i think i got my point across.   i hope this technique helps you and your father. i know it's hard to deal with a loved one with dementia, i see it every day and the majority of people can't fully comprehend the situation or obtain the amount of patience they need to cope with it. but like i said, it's our job to live in their world, not the other way around.

"my parents are both elderly (80s). dad has dementia, and has become very abusive. mom has been caretaker for years. she has to place dad, for her own safety, and for his well-being. i'm very worried about what this is going to do to her. they haven't spent a night apart in over 50 years. i'm worried she may have a nervous breakdown, and that her health will decline (she is already struggling with health issues)any advice, suggestions, experiences would be greatly appreciated."," your mother is making the right choice. i work as a cna in a specially designed building dedicated to dementia residents specifically. the choice to put the care of your father in other people's hands is not an easy one, but it's for the best. if you guys do your research and pick the right place, he will (hopefully) be in the care of people specially trained to deal and take care of dementia patients with these types of behaviors. i couldn't even tell you how many residents i have that have continuously tried their best to deal physical damage to myself and others. but that's why we're there. hopefully he can be put on the right medication to help treat the aggressiveness. in my experience something like a mood stabilizer, anti psychotic, or an anti-anxiety help to treat those specific behaviors. some times it has to be a combination of all those and then some, it depends.   as for your mother and helping her cope. reassure her that the pressure of taking care of your father can be lifted and make sure that, choosing the right facility, will ensure that he is with people who understand the illness for what it is and are ready to deal with whatever behaviors his dementia causes him to have.   she won't have to fear being harmed by him and can have peace of mind that he is in good care. this applies to you as well.   i can't stress enough how important it is to thoroughly research any and all nursing facilities you consider moving him into. always take a tour of any facility you're considering and ask literally any question that pops into your head. making sure that he is at a place where they really care about the patients rather than their/your money is crucial. i'd love to say that all nursing homes have their primary focus on resident care/well-being/happiness, but i'd simply be lying.  many nursing homes are run down, for profit buildings that only care about the monthly paycheck. instead of spending 1:1 time with residents who display aggresive/physical behavior and have trained their workers exactly on how to deal with them, just take the easy way out and heavily medicate any potentially problematic patients to the point of them being zombies. not all are like this, but you really have to keep an eye out for any red flags that pop up that make you have doubts.   i'm lucky enough to work at one of those ""gems"" where the entire facility has been specially designed to make the resident feel like they're home as much as possible. all of my residents have their own private rooms with access to their own private bathroom and personal shower, with the exception of a few rooms that house 2 residents but with the same living conditions. it's more expensive but the care we provide is (i can say proudly) exceptional to most other places. all meals are freshly cooked by cooks who all have backgrounds in food services, many who have at some point had their own restaurant even. the food company we use is gordon food services so you know that we're not ordering our ingredients from some off brand, microwave meal company. we have family style dining so one item is made with sides every meal and everybody gets the same thing unless they ask for something else which is cooked fresh as well. it's a great place for what it costs.   we also have daily activity directors who work from 9-5 to keep our residents occupied in engaging activities. we have happy hour every friday where we pay semi-pro musicians to come play live music for our residents where they can sing along and drink alcohol.   be cautious though, even if you find a place like mine, the biggest priority is the care that the resident recieves.

"," i can't speak in terms that i have a loved one showing signs of a cognitive decline or with dementia, but i am a cna who has the pleasure to work in a specially designed lock down building dedicated to dementia only residents.   the best thing you can do is get the required tests done to produce a proper diagnosis. the underlying problem is pinning where your mother is at in the progression of her possible dementia. based on the information you provided, she is already displaying some very obvious signs of some type of dementia, but until she is tested, it's hard to pinpoint exactly how well her cognitive functions are still performing. if she's at the point where she's forgetting things on a daily basis your first course of action is to find a specialized doctor who can help with diagnosing her. then if she gets to the point where she is no longer able to provide her own simple care, you need to see what you can do about either becoming her durable power of attorney, or finding/appointing someone who can take that position. that way, you can be the one to decide what precautions are to be taken for her wellbeing since she is no longer able to do so herself. for example, my resident's durable power of attorney is their son and/or daughter. they can decide a number of things including whether or not to recessutate them in the event that they go into heart faliure, etc.   you always want to keep an open mind and be as patient as you can with her. most people don't understand that dementia isn't simply just dementia. it is a broad spectrum that has numerous different types that all cause different behaviors and affect the brain/body differently.   if she is still at the point where you can have a conversation with her about getting tested, and she can remember the conversation 2-3 days later, you have different options.   if she is at the point where she can not tell you whether or not she agrees to get the testing done, you'll have to explore other options in getting her tested and getting a proper diagnosis.   i can't stress this enough, but, for future reference: if she progresses to the point where she has been diagnosed with some form of dementia, had known it in the past, but no longer can remember or do the the simplest of cognitive functions, she more than likely needs to be in the professional care of someone like me either at a nursing home or have a home health care worker who can help her with those things. i honestly believe that her being in a nursing home would be the better decision because she is way more at risk of endangering herself or others in her own home because of all the things that become hazards, stairs and the kitchen area to name a few.   if it ever gets to that point, the cruelest thing you can do is to constantly remind her that she has dementia. that also means constantly reminding her of deceased relatives, parents, etc. they have to relive that pain every time they're reminded.  if she gets to the point where her mind is very far gone, let her live in her world as she sees it. i've always said that it's our job to live in their world, not the other way around.   if it comes to that point and she lives in a nursing facility, make sure she gets the care she needs and deserves, you both have that right.   and if she every asks her why she's there and you've exhausted every other redirection that you can, don't tell her that it's dementia. tell her that she lives in a retirement community with other people like her where they're well taken care of.   if she remembers the dementia, never call it that unless she does so herself. adress it as a ""problem with memory"" and remind her that it's common among the elderly. i have always found that this helps.   i have a resident who we count as highly independent in the sense that she remembers how to eat, she can carry out a full conversation even though she forgets the majority of what you tell her in an average of 3-5 minutes. it takes a lot of patience and you really have to be a special fit to work in that environment but i honestly can't think of anything i'd enjoy more. she frequently asks why she's with us and she's one of our residents who you can be pretty forward with. i tell her that she has a problem with often forgetting things. she asks if she's crazy and i constantly remind her that she's no more crazy than me.   i hope this answer helps you and your mother. always be patient with her, that's one of the best things you can do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5xla5e/whats_the_best_way_to_approach_the_subject_of/,What's the best way to approach the subject of dementia?

"little background - i'm the assistant manager of an after school program consisting of ages 5-11. our facility is large with anywhere between 25-40 children in attendance daily. we have a pool, gymnasium, track, trampoline room, and a huge outdoor area, their favorite place to play. this area backs up to an assisted living facility.the assisted living facility has one rogue occupant (~80ish) in the advanced stages of dementia who likes to sneak out, wander around, and oftentimes gets lost. she can walk fairly well but is otherwise non verbal and cognitively checked out.when she sees us bring the group of children outside, she wanders over because she wants to play with them, which makes the children extremely uncomfortable because she will proceed to try to grab them, tug their hair, poke their faces, get at their jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, etc), pull at their clothes, hug them and not let go/block them from leaving, grab their backpacks, chase them as they run away, and more. yesterday she tried to lead them back to her house up the hill and give them plastic bags to eat. sometimes she will stand off to the side staring at them and suddenly rush forward babbling and flailing her arms. she chased me and some of the girls around the entire walking trail yesterday, stomping angrily because we wouldn't stop.none of this is malevolent. she is simply very mentally far gone and i don't think she even understands what's going on or what she's doing. when she finally leaves, it's usually to wander around elsewhere and we're always having to call assistance to one of the subdivisions in the area that she frequently gets lost in.we have had a talk with the children and they know to try and avoid her while playing, but it hasn't helped because she just chases/corners them if they ignore her. usually we get several in a day complaining about how she scares them/makes them uncomfortable and a few parents have complained, as well.as one of their supervisors, how can i go about addressing this situation? i've done everything in my power that i know to do. talked extensively about courses of action with the children, lead them to another area if she gets too handsy, try to distract the lady away from the kids. i don't have the authority to talk to her facility or otherwise take extreme action. my boss knows of this issue but i don't think she understands just how uncomfortable it's making the kids because it's 'just an old lady who doesn't mean any harm'. i know she doesn't mean any harm but she's wandering around unsupervised and now the kids have taken to hiding behind my chair whenever she comes around.i want to be as respectful and gentle as possible handling this. is there anything i can do?

"i'm moving my grandpa to a new assisted living facility over the next couple of weeks and would like any and all advice on moving him, things i can do to make it easier, etc.our story below:my grandma passed away in august and didn't exactly clarify how bad my grandpa's dementia had gotten. she also seemed to have a little bit of it towards the end. they were married for almost 60 years. i have no parents, no brothers/sisters, and no aunts/uncles on this side of the family, so it's been entirely dependent on me helping him. i'm 27, and very inexperienced with healthcare. i live four hours away and was trying to keep him in his hometown because he said he wanted to stay there. he lives in a really small town in rural nevada. the assisted living facility there is absolute garbage, and have continuously fought me on basic needs for my grandpa. i took him to the emergency room on thanksgiving because his oxygen had dropped so low while i was visiting him and he was running a fever. his physical therapist was there and suggested i take him. (she works at an outside agency that has no affiliation with the facility) when i went to the hospital his doctor was upset because he was prescribed 24-7 oxygen, and they weren't keeping up with it at the facility. (he also has copd.) when i brought him back to the nursing home i handed him the doctors 24-7 prescription and instructed them to please have him wearing his oxygen at all times. the facility had their rn write a different prescription within a couple of days to have him only wear his oxygen at night. well, what do you know, he's back in the hospital, has been twice since then, and now he has pneumonia. the doctors at the emergency room were concerned that the assisted living facility again didn't have him on 24-7 oxygen. every time he's gone there, they do this same song and dance. i'm officially done with this and moving him close by me. it sucks because we can hardly afford it, but i'd rather this than risk losing him because of straight up neglect by a facility we pay almost 4000 to a month! it sickens me. i'm concerned about moving him because i know it's going to be very disorientating, but i don't know what else to do at this point.edited for clarification/punctuation."," ask local ministers and priests and social services if they know of anyone of reputation who will live in his home for free lodgings and give care and cook for the price you are paying to the facility or a little less.  if your grandad has space, it could include a caregiver family member who could help in shifts if someone wants an additional outside job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5vu0bm/moving_my_grandpa_would_like_some_advice/,Moving my Grandpa - would like some advice

""i've got 9 kids, and grandchildren up to the sixth generation"" she used to say. that wasn't even a year ago. now she can't even remember that her son came to visit for four days for her birthday two months ago; we all went and picked him up from the airport, and now it's like it never even happened. she can't remember the date she got married. she can't remember the year she was born; if you ask her, she'll say the right month and day, but then for the year she'll say 2000-something. she had some bank business to do yesterday, and when mom took her, they asked her to sign some papers, and it took 10 minutes to get her to sign in the right spot, and then another 10 minutes to actually sign it because after signing her name perfectly in beautiful cursive, not shaky or going up/down-hill, she couldn't remember how to write the same letters in print in order to print her name. mom kept having to show her a piece of mail with her name on it so she could copy it letter by letter.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5vl96q/i_hate_everything_so_much_right_now/,i hate everything so much right now;

"my 92 year old aunt has no children and has alienated our entire family. she's doing her best to alienate me too, but i know she needs help and so far i'm the only one willing and able to step up. i'm very sure she has dementia, as is pretty much every healthcare worker that's come into contact with her. after changing her mind back and forth for around 2 years, she finally decided to move from her small town into a very nice assisted living home in the city closest to her doctors. well, she didn't exactly decide to move into assisted living. she first moved into the independent living part of the home, but also occupied a ""respite room"" in assisted living while she was healing from a broken vertebrae. last week she finally decided that paying for two apartments probably wasn't the best idea and has moved into an assisted living apartment. the thing that finally brought the dementia to our attention was her loss of balance, and subsequent falls. when she moved a couple of months ago, she had a broken foot, wrist, and vertebrae. the vertebrae is a compression wedge fracture that is only getting worse over time, despite the monitored care. this is due to her osteoporosis and her absolute stubbornness in refusing to take it easy and wear her brace correctly. i'm seriously concerned she's going to keep injuring herself until she's flat on her back and catches pneumonia, which i'm certain would kill her. and she's fallen 6 times since late october. additionally, she is extremely suspicious of everything, and thinks everyone is trying to steal from her. i understand this is a big part of the disease, but i just don't know how to deal with it. i honestly believe she's hiding cash, but i haven't figured out where so i can prove she's still got her money. meanwhile, she ""loses"" about $80/wk. she's had to downsize quite a bit as a result of the move, which has been hard. even harder has been her selling her car. she shouldn't have been driving long before this move, but the people in the small town felt sorry for her and allowed her to skip the eye test when it came time to renew her license. technically, she has a license until the end of summer. she's been determined to buy or rent another car so she can start driving again. harder still, there will come a point in time where she will have to change doctors. right now she goes to military bases, but as i don't live in the same city she will soon lose her transportation when i go home. she is absolutely adamant about not seeing civilian doctors, even though multiple people have tried to explain that it won't cost her anything and she'll be able to develop much longer term relationships with the doctors. heck, there are even doctors that would make house calls that she could see for free. i understand that this has been so much change for her, and i honestly don't know if i'd be handling it well, and i'm 50 years younger. but the verbal abuse that is constantly heaped on me is taking its toll. there have been a few times i've engaged in disagreement, which just makes everything worse. i keep trying to remind myself that it's the dementia talking, but her personality didn't do a 180 with the dementia. if anything, she's her same old self, only turned up to 11. now some family members are advising me to drop her and cut her out of my life. she's living in a great place, and i completely trust the people caring for her, but she still needs someone to help handle her finances and take her to appointments. she's already got an open case with adult protective services because she falsely accused the family of forcing her to sell her car and house, and while i'm not worried about the outcome of that i am worried that if everyone drops her she'll become a ward of the state. i'm completely out of my element and have no idea how to handle everything. any advice?tl;dr: 92 yo aunt with dementia and i think i'm failing her. help please"," check out ""teepa snow"" for excellent videos on understanding dementia and great care and interaction strategies :) teepa snow. com and the pines of sarasota webpage and free video library :) good luck sounds like your family member is lucky to have you and your caring heart looking out for her take care of yourself too... we cannot serve from an empty vessel ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5v76x8/i_am_so_overwhelmed_and_have_no_clue_what_im/,I am so overwhelmed and have no clue what I'm doing.

looking for audiobook recommendations for dementia patients (prefer availability on audible via amazon).  has anyone had success/failure getting dementia patients to listen to books?," yes, my mother listens all the time. aim for plots that the listener will be familiar with.  if she/he won't be insulted, find out what a favorite book was from childhood was. my mother really enjoyed listening to alice in wonderland, for example. however, she enjoys listening to many classics as she has a master's in english lit and can enjoy hearing the stories over. the big thing with getting her to sit down and listen is that we pretend we really want to listen too. then it becomes an activity and she can calm down and do it. if you just plug a dementia person into a book, they will probably get bored and quit. i turn the book on so we can all hear it, then do something else. a word of warning: they won't remember the plot, so just get something that can be enjoyed in the moment.

"i live in a condo with 4 units per floor; one of my neighbors is an elderly (early/mid-70's) woman who lives alone. from the start we knew something was off with her, her behavior was strange and annoying e.g. almost always using the fire escape on our side (there are 2, another on her side of the bldg) so she could pass our and our neighbor's across units (she is very nosy), always having to talk to anyone who crosses her path (it's obvious she's desperate for company and conversation, but she is so pushy and aggressive people don't like her or want to be around her), bothering our contractor so we had to tell her to leave him alone so he could concentrate, and she got angry and defensive and tried to physically push her way in our place!!she also brought up religion/god/the bible right away even though we hardly knew/know her! and we caught her creepily loitering for no reason in front of our and our across neighbors' unit. we finally had it with her harassing behavior and told her firmly to stop bothering us and she got ugly and would do things now and then like pop out of her unit to ""surprise"" us when we were in the vestibule and made obnoxious gestures/faces and inane remarks to ""get back"" at us. she is so not normal. her behavior is deranged and disturbing.we just have avoided/ignored her totally and at least for us, things have been tolerable. but as for our neighbors, it's another matter. one of them moved here recently and they became good friends and often talk outside each other's units, but then a few months ago the dementia neighbor took it upon herself to join them and every single time she heard them she would come out. it got to the point they couldn't talk as often, to avoid her. they finally had enough and told her they just want to talk with each other, and she got very upset and hysterically yelled ""you hurt me!"" ""why do you do this to me, why do you hurt me so?!"" she went on and on ranting, and they had to calm her down. then, the very next day, she complained to one of them about financial problems and that she has no money, and asked for $300. the neighbor told her she has 2 brothers/family and she got mad and said ""i'm angry, it's only $300!"" he still declined.so it seems she's escalating and her behavior is getting increasingly unstable; this woman is not only aggressive and pushy, she's difficult, annoying, high-strung, has a nasty vindictive streak, no respect for boundaries, self-centered and is very thin-skinned and quick to take offense. she doesn't have the kind of close-knit relationship with the neighbors to be conducting herself the way she has (they're just casually friendly), nor to request money. besides, even if she's cash-strapped, she's got assets--owns 2 condo units, including hers and another her grown son lives in in our bldg, both worth several hundreds of thousands each. and she has a vintage car she never drives/is inoperable and is worth a good sum, in fact some people interested in classic cars were interested in acquiring it but she won't sell as it belonged to her late husband. so she could sell any of those and get a large infusion of funds. she could also rent 1 of her parking spaces, or take on a roommate if she needs cash quickly and can't wait.and to further show how intolerable this woman is, as i said, her son lives in the same condo just a few floors below, and not once have i known him to visit her. it is she who has to go down to him. that's very telling, isn't it, that he lives right here yet avoids her like the plague. she also pays his utilities/maintenance fee so if she needs money that bad, she should stop since he's a middle-aged adult who can, or should, be able to support himself.anyhow, i'm just wondering what can be done? maybe informing the manager/condo board about her, and her son...perhaps reporting her to state agencies and maybe even the police? it sure is obvious she needs help and is a problem/potential danger to others, and really needs to be in a care home! in fact, given her volatility, we are worried she's capable of doing something like setting the bldg on fire!"," if you really believe she has some type of dementia, you believe she has a tragic, terminal disease. so you could start with a little compassion and try discussing with her son. if that seems impossible, call elder services to do a welfare check on her.

"hi, my name is judy cornish. i’d like to share something we’ve discovered at dawn; there is very good news for families with someone experiencing dementia—that people with dementia can live happily and safely when we support their intuitive thought skills and experiential selves.  we’ve found that when we focus on and support the abilities rather than disabilities of dementia, our clients are happier and their families can postpone costly long-term care. i’m an elder law attorney who became involved with dementia. i’ve spent the past six years working with people with dementia, most of whom live in their own homes. i began to see a pattern in their functioning that medical science does not pick up: they were losing rational thought but not intuitive thought, and losing their remembering selves but not their experiential selves. i’ve written a book outlining my findings, which will be available on amazon this spring. we’re trying to get the word out to families so that more people with dementia will be cared for in ways that support their autonomy and dignity, and more families will be able to avoid being bankrupted by institutional care. i’m hoping to take part in your ama program.best regards,judy cornishwebsite: thedawnmethod.comtwitter: facebook:  "," would you please provide examples of how to ""use"" or access, etc., intuitive thought. i read all of your recent posts last night. i would like to understand it all better.i'd also like examples with experiential selves too, please.thank you!

"my grandma has been diagnosed with having dementia 3 years ago but showed signs for several years before then. i started staying 5 nights a week and part of the day around 6 1/2 months ago but started staying 24 hrs/ 5 days a week after my grandpa became ill around 4 months ago. through the past 6 months she's progressively started having more outburst or becoming more agitated. i know that her dementia is probably worsening but i feel part of it is the change of not having my grandpa at home. he's been back and forth between the hospital and rehab centers and we're really trying to get him strong enough to come back home currently. we had him home for almost a week and she seemed so much more at peace the week he was at home.my current dilemma is that the focus of her agitation is her wanting us to take her home. i've dealt with this plenty with her and generally if she's confused about home it's because she has a bladder infection. we had a urinalysis done and she was prescribed medicine for a yeast infection which is a change. she's expressed that the home she wants to go to is her hometown and she wants to go see her twin. we had already made plans to visit her twin in 2 months but i don't think that is going to be soon enough. it seems to have become the source of most of her agitation, she feels as if we're trying to keep her from seeing her sister/ home. my questions are could a yeast infection cause this confusion/ change in her? it seems as if it's only really been the source for the past 2 weeks or so. we have plans for visiting with her sister in  2 months but i don't think it's going to be soon enough for her. i wish we could just drop everything and go like she wants too but it's not plausible nor can we just drop everything for a trip at this moment. we can try and work out something sooner but i'm concerned that if this is a more permanent change for my grandma that we might just be opening up a can of worms. i feel like taking her on this trip would really help but i feel like it could make things worse too. what are your thoughts, opinions, and/or advice? thanks for taking the time to read this rambling post!"," uti's can definitely mimic dementia symptoms. it's the first thing they teach in nursing school! with that said, that's usually for seniors that didn't have memory symptoms before. it could be progression of the dementia but i'd check her meds, her nutrition and water intake as well.

"after months (maybe year+) of trying, my mom finally got my grandpa to see the doctor for the memory test. he doesn't think there is anything wrong and my grandma is in denial, but everyone else could see him worsening. doctor officially diagnosed him with alzheimers. his parents and siblings all had it so i guess it's not too surprising, i just didn't think it would jump to that level that quickly, i thought there was more of a progression.dr isn't reporting him to dmv but said there will come a time that he can't drive and that is going to be a hard battle when that day comes. and losing their independence i worry will crush them and rob them off what time they have left. grandpa is 84 and grandma is 85. they have lived in the same house for 40+ years and no one sees them leaving willingly. there are going to be some tough talks in the coming years."," i have a similar situation with my grandma, she was diagnosed around 3 years ago. she had been showing signs that i noticed 4 years prior to diagnoses, however the rest of the family kind of wrote off the idea when my mother and i would mention it. we were around her more as we would drive them on any trips over an hours drive as she was no longer comfortable driving that far away. we didn't want to take away her independence or my grandpa's as he had given up his license many years before for vision problems. however we did set some guidelines, she had to have a passenger with her if she wanted to leave the county (we live in a fairly rural area). she was fine with that as my grandpa already went with her most of the time, he couldn't drive but he still could give her directions if she got mixed up. she could drive in the county by herself but she just needed to let someone know where she was going. she had her license taken away away a little over a year and a half ago and it was hard for her, she gets upset about it infrequently still. my grandparents have lived in their house for around 45 years now, we're hoping to keep them at home for as long as we can. we're currently trying to get my grandpa back home as he's been in and out of the hospital and rehab centers for the past several months from illness. it will be hard but try not and focus on what's to come and try to focus on what is. depending on your grandma's health i would recommend someone go to their appointments with them as an extra set of ears if they would allow. also if possible i highly recommend you all see a lawyer specializing in elder law and get a poa set up and they can really help get things sorted out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5su3jd/finally_diagnosed/,Finally diagnosed

"hi,i'm looking for some advice on my grandfather / dad (there is two of us here, however the grandson is typing so i'll be typing from my point of view), this is a **big post so i'm sorry** but if anyone could have a read and provide me with some advice i would greatly appreciate it!--# noticeable onsetin 2015 we started to notice that my granddad had the start of dementia/alzheimer's and we spoke to his doctor (with his wife/my nan) to make them aware and see if they could do anything but for some reason they said that they are unable to do anything or say anything to him until he asks/mentions it...# 6 months laterabout 6 months later he had a tia (transient ischemic attack) and was taken to hospital, they released him the next morning but started him on some tablets.# 6 to 12 months laterwithin the next 6 months several people like his neighbors mentioned that he is forgetting things and repeats himself lots.# other attacks &amp; hospital visits.since then, he's had a few more smaller tia's and we notice his memory is getting worse and worse, he can't remember going to the hospital in the last 5 years (even though he's been 5 or so times, twice by ambulance).# confusionhe repeats himself a crazy amount of times, even sometimes in very quick succession. he misplaces things like his keys, phone, hat, chargers... etc and gets confused with even the simplest of things that 10 years ago he would have been able to do just fine, he's broken several things lately from trying to ""fix"" them himself because he would have normally been able to fix them but now he just does things wrong.we recently installed new taps in the kitchen and bathroom and within a month he had broken the taps in the bathroom because he tried to undo them because ""they felt broken"" which is just because they are different and could be turned easily where as his old taps had broken and were pretty fused up.he purchased a new door bell recently and he brought it over unable to get it to work so he wanted me to have a look at it, he had tried to open the doorbell to fix it and had damaged all of the plastic where he was trying to push a screwdriver into it to open it up when all he had to do was pull the plastic tab (it said ""pull me out"" on it) to get the battery to connect. i let him take it home and we said we'd come and put it up on the weekend (2 days away), when we turned up he had been trying to open it up again because it ""wasn't working"", he had forgotten that he had brought it over and the only thing required was to put it up on the wall.# violence/angerhe get's quite angry when he gets confused and he's also been a little violent towards my nan by punching her on the arm on multiple occasions, we've spoken to him about this and told him that he can not do this, we've also spoken to my nan and told her not to wind him up. it starts of by him forgetting something and then my nan goes on at him over whatever it was and he gets angry and ends up being aggressive. since we spoke to her about it he has been fine as she has been doing what we told her of not making a fuss over it, just let it go even if it's very annoying.# repeating himselfspeaking to him a few days ago, he repeated the same story to us about 5 times within the space of 10 minutes. we don't bother saying anything instead we listen to the same story 5 times. he however isn't aware that he's told us.# recent scansover the past month he's also been having a few mri scans and memory tests to check for any changes with his brain, however he still doesn't really tell any of the family (or his wife) the results and probably forgets the results by the time he gets home.my granddad was spoken to on a 1 to 1 basis with my dad in the car when they were coming back from his mri scan and my granddad said that he didn't think he had anything wrong with his memory, my dad thought this was the perfect opportunity to talk to him and he told him straight up that he did believe that he though there ""was something going on with his memory"" but that there isn't anything to worry about and that he should just get on with life and enjoy himself. after he got home and my dad had left, he apparently broke down in tears and got upset over it all. we actually went down the next morning and already he had forgotten most of the previous day and didn't mention dad thinking he has something going on. i could tell him the upcoming winning lottery numbers though (he asks all the time if i can get him the winning lottery numbers as i am always able to help fix things for him) and within an hour he would have more than likely forgotten them.# getting lost...the biggest worry with him for us is him getting lost, he goes out in the car (doesn't tell anyone where he's going) and goes off at hours at a time, we don't know if he gets lost or what is going on.what we really kind of need is to get a tracker on his car/on his keys but we don't want to appear or be invasive for his privacy, the main reason we want a tracker is to make sure he's safe and ok, there's been many occasions over the last two years where it's 11 at night and he's not home after going down to the pub, he's not told his wife where he is and she obviously gets very worried, upset and scared. we have to go out and try and find him. he just doesn't understand and laughs at it every time.we noticed a note in the kitchen about a ""loan"" and we're not sure what that is about, he says he doesn't know what it was about either and we're obviously a little worried that he might be in trouble with money and also a bit worried that he seeing someone on the side (i wouldn't be surprised, likewise our nan wouldn't be surprised) and maybe giving her money (even though the money he has is equally shared between him and his wife)# taking control...we've already kind of taken some form of control by speaking to the pharmacy (with him being there) and getting agreeing that no changes to his tablets or how they are delivered can be made by him without one of us being there because he gets confused and has changed delivery of his tablets several times causing himself lots of stress, the staff at the pharmacy stress and causing himself to have to wait a few days without any tablets.# forgetting to do things like eating, brushing his teeth, wearing a coat... etche forgets to eat and has to be reminded by his wife constantly, if she was to pass away he would quickly get into a state and either not eat enough and become unwell or just get dirty because he forgets to brush his teeth (his wife reminds him every day), he forgets to put underwear on (his wife reminds him every day) and he forgets to go out with a coat on even though it's supposed to rain later on.# what next?this is all of our first experience with someone with dementia/alzheimer (we're pretty sure it's vascular dementia) and really don't know what to do so any help and advise would be very much welcome and appreciated."," it's hard to develop a plan without access to his physicians and medical records - doesn't the spouse have access or any authority?  to more practical things: i would ""break"" the car (take out fuses?) or ""lose"" the keys so he can't drive - it would be horrible if he harmed someone. limit the amount of cash and try to make sure he doesn't carry checks (my dad would just sign a blank check and hand it to the cashier at stores for them to fill out...).  make photocopies of identification he carries in his wallet because that will probably get lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5rto1f/looking_for_advice_on_my_granddads_ever_worsening/,Looking for advice on my Granddad's ever worsening dementia.

my mom was diagnosed with early onset 6 years ago (when i was 20 and she was in her late 50s) and i'm currently living at home with her. i do spend a lot of time with her but i need some time alone as well... she also has an aide for part of the day. the problem is her screaming and random shouting has been getting worse and worse; sometimes she sounds tortured and no amount of comforting will help.she can't walk anymore (lives in a hospital bed at home and i or the aide or my dad move her to a chair next to the bed sometimes &amp; the tv is usually on) and can't have conversations although if i say or do something obviously funny she'll laugh &amp; smile and often shouts that 'i want to kill myself' or 'i'm gonna die' (these are the only complete sentences she can say/scream) when she's in a bad state. sometimes she'll shout things like 'hey you! you you you!' or 'hey get out get out get out!!' or 'woooooahhhhh!!' and indecipherable shouting. she still recognizes me but she can't recognize people by name. she is still able to eat and swallow although she can't feed herself &amp; wears a diaper that needs to be changed.does anyone have any insight into what can help with the screaming? and is this something that alzheimers patients eventually 'move on' from? i don't even really know exactly where my mom is at in the progression (i guess she is somewhere in between stage 6/7?). it is pretty disturbing to be woken up to screams and i know she is in a state of despair when she screams.edit: i should mention that most of the screaming and yelling happens during 'sundowning'; late afternoon/evening but she also can be like this in the morning and in the afternoon when she's being changed; then she literally screams bloody murder at the aide, can you get medical marijuana?  definitely worth a try. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5r4xt4/how_to_deal_with_the_screamingvocalizations/,How to deal with the screaming/vocalizations?

"because my grandmother (85 years old) spends most of the day in bed (her body has given up, she's physically weak and she's basically not logical about anything or anyone) she sometimes finds it frustrating and she calls me to get her to stay on her feet so that her body doesn't ache. but whenever i get her to stay on her feet she starts crying hard. it hurts so much to see her suffer that way. i look into her blue eyes (i'm the only one in my family who's taken after her eyes) full of tears and her confusion and powerlessness and how she can't even say words because they don't make any sense, and i sometimes end up crying in front of her. i grew up with her in our house and i am so glad that i'm taking care of her now that i'm on vacation before i go back to college, but to see her condition come to this...it's heartbreaking. my heart hurts. a lot. edit: she unfortunately died on 10th of february. i feel very devastated. one week after i went back to college.", it's so hard but stay strong. my mother at age 66 is going through this. take it day by day.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5okfo4/it_hurts_so_much_to_see_my_grandmother_with/,It hurts so much to see my grandmother with dementia cry.

"edit: sorry, realised this is bit epic. thowaway because step-sisters!hi all!my father (82) has been suffering from memory issues for about a year. it started with forgetting words during conversations - he tends to 're-phrase' around the problem or substitute something that sounds somewhat familiar but doesn't make sense. the memory issues have escalated into confusion about day to day events.he is/has:* quite often unable to remember whether he has taken medication. * often confused about time; generally thinking that upcoming events are going to happen much sooner than in reality.* taken to sleeping in his clothes, claiming to be cold.* sometimes gets confused between people - he sometimes talks to me about me as though i'm not there.* usually sleeps excessively during the evening (before going to bed very early).&amp;nbsp;a lot of this is quite variable - some days are a lot better than others. the severity of the problem also usually gets worse during the day and also under stress.&amp;nbsp;he's been referred by his doctor to have a ct scan and from there to a rice clinic (specifically it is a 'memory clinic') to see a consultant. he's had various verbal tests ('how many months in the year?', 'what is 100 minus 7?' etc.) - he apparently did not do very well. the consultant appointment is at the end of the month and both my step-mother and myself will be there. i'm pretty sure he's heading for some kind of dementia diagnosis. can anyone advise what is likely to happen at the appointment (it is 60-90 mins apparently) or make suggestions as to useful things i should ask about?&amp;nbsp;to complicate the fact that this is happening now (and to add stress), there is also a house move coming up. they are downsizing substantially and my step-mother has found a quite appropriate flat in the centre of town. he usually suggests to her that he is ok with living there but whenever he talks to me, or anyone else, he insists that he doesn't want to and will move to the town where he grew up (on his own). he seems to flip-flop between the two possibilities. i don't know if maintaining the two options in his head is a fantasy that is caused by his illness or whether there is some legitimate basis to either of them. personally, i don't feel he will be able to manage although with external care/supervision it might be possible. i'm having a lot of difficulty determining whether he should be allowed to explore the option or whether he lacks the capability to make this decision on his own. i should like to bring this up with the doctor - but since my step-mother is going to be there, just mentioning it (and suggesting i am even entertaining the idea) is going to be highly confrontational. is this kind of flip-floping between outcomes a common symptom? is it common to want to relocate to where you grew up?thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!!"," my mum got diagnosed over 4 years ago. the urge to visit where you grew up is very common among sufferers of dementia, luckily for us that's only two miles away so we can drive there often. moving to a new location will probably be more difficult but i would certainly bring it up with the specialist by saying something like ""my dad is due to move location soon and i assume that this won't cause any problems?"" and then you sound like you are on your mother in laws side. i would imagine you will receive some sort of dementia pack from the specialist (we did) which should contain a lot of information and advice. check out what local help is available in your area, day centres and organisations like respite (the scan is to determine what type of dementia your father has, this may be vascular dementia (caused by a mini stoke which may have gone unnoticed) or something like alzheimer's. you may also want to visit a solicitor for legal advice, i don't know if your father has a house in his name only, if so you need to get it signed over to your step mum or yourself etc as the government does have the power to take property to pay for care if you or your mum will be unable to look after him in the future (hopefully that's a long way away).

"my mother's dementia has very much advanced and i am exhausted. i have been in town with my mother for a couple weeks helping her out. i miss my bed, i miss my partner. the dementia had increased substantially and she is having many symptoms of decline across the board. she got into a bad situation, and i have had to help out quite a bit. because of this crisis the court acted quickly and the papers are in place with me as conservator. it's been a lot of work for me to try to get her out of the mess that she fell into. i have a lot to organize, but some days i have mostly been putting out fires. my mom seems happy to have my company and help. unfortunately i am in this alone, as my siblings do not provide any assistance or support. i haven't slept well for two weeks. i feel like a zombie. i have to stay here as my mom's caregiver because she can't be alone. i am working on find a caregiver. i am supposed to be at home (500 miles away) getting ready to return to work this week, and i am worried by missing so much work that my job will be at risk.", i am so sorry. i have nothing to say that will help you. but i am glad that you are helping your mother. you probably would feel like shit for a very long time if you did not. i hope you can get some sleep tonight.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5lit90/xposted_i_need_to_vent_and_get_some_support/,[x-posted] I need to vent and get some support
"(**quick trigger warning:** i get kinda dark at the end of this, talking about death and all)[so last time i posted]( i got so much information and support, which i really appreciate. it'll sound super cheesy but i'm just so glad that there are other people who were willing to listen to me and be empathetic and lend an ear.unfortunately, because my grandma never held a job here in america (she took care of the apartment that she lived in with my mom &amp; aunt while they worked) and moved here with almost no money, there's not much in the way of a savings or retirement plan that we can fall back on to support any type of care, which means the private homes are out of the question. she's also really vital for her age (despite the dementia), so nursing homes that insurance would cover won't take her. i think our best bet for now is adult daycare or an in-home nurse? my mom's still hashing the details out, but it's slow going. grandma's been diagnosed in the late stages of alzheimer's so that may open up more options for us.i finished my first semester at university, trying not to worry too much about what was going on at home. everything sounded pretty okay in phone calls, so that alleviated things a bit. i've been back for winter vacation and up until now things seemed really good! until tonight, when grandma spent two hours trying to find the phone number to ""her house"" or the directions so that she could take a taxi. all she seemed to think was that it was by a hospital in lima. even when my mom told her that we were in the united states, she seemed really adamant to get there.sometimes i feel super guilty for thinking that she might not be alive to see the next year as a positive thing, but i know that she's slowly just losing herself and even her early memories are getting jumbled up. at least before she could tell us about things that happened to her as a kid or family members that have passed away. it hurts to think about how i'm talking about the same person who taught me how to peel an apple or helped me with my math homework in fifth grade, but i guess them's the breaks. every little news fragment about how our treatment of the disease is slowly improving at least gives me a little hope that this type of degeneration may not have to happen to my parents or the many other people i care about (including all yall here, even if i don't know you personally)on a more positive note, grandma was laughing with my mom about how systematically my dog begs for her for food: he goes up to her, does a little ""patita"" as we call it (cutesy spanish slang for foot/paw; it's when he gently paws at whatever's closest to him to get attention), gets a tiny bit of her food, and then proceeds to lay on her feet in case she drops something else. **tldr:** things are still pretty grim, but we're dealing with it the best we can. no matter what, we're trying to enjoy the time we have left with grandma and i'm trying to live my life without worrying too much, since things seem to be going better than i thought they would while i'm away.also, dad has learned to use google translate to communicate a little. hooray!"," for home care you would want a caregiver, not nurse. these run between $11-$26/hr, depending on whether you use an agency or not. still quite expensive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5le3v7/slight_update_to_frustrated_and_tired/,slight update to frustrated and tired
"i am really sorry if this is the wrong place for this post. if it doesnt belong here i will delete it or the mods can handle it. i will try to keep this as short as possible but it might run on a bit. last night at ten pm my dogs went crazy and started barking at something outside our front door. i went to look and i saw a little old lady crouched beside my garage hiding from something. this is in anchorage, ak and it was 15 degrees out and snowing heavy. i opened my door and asked ""who was there?"" and she replied ""its me susan"". the next couple of sentence she spoke where clear as far as the words go but the words didn't go in any kind of order. so i invited her in and got her something warm to drink. we chatted for like 20 minutes, she had no id or other effects with her just a coat, house slippers (her feet where frozen), and a pocket knife. she was very confused about where she was and wether she knew anyone in anchorage at all. she didn't have a phone or list of contact numbers. at this point she told us she has some kind of dementia. i suggested that we call the police to come help us find out where she should be. at this she started to become very agitated and upset begging me not to call the cops, crying. she said she could just call a cab. i got her calmed down and told her i could give her a ride if she could remember where her house was. so we got in my car and started looking (i was very skeptical that we would find it) but sure enough after 20 minutes and some back tracking we found her apartment. she invited me in and we hung out for about twenty minutes. her apartment was cozy and filled with lots of really interesting art by some fairly famous alaskan artist and bunches of other cool pieces i didn't recognize. she told me very lucidly about her family, her dead husband, her daughter and sister. she told me all their names and married names and about her grandkids. i gave susan my phone number and told her if she needed anything to call and not to leave her house again. then i left and went home, this was about 11:30 pm. i dropped by her place this morning with coffee and checked up on her. she remembered me (but not my name) and thanked me for my help. we had a pleasant chat and drank coffee, at certain points she was confused about people, places and things and then other times she spoke very clearly and confidently about things. so heres my question, i found her adult daughter on facebook she is a second grade teacher at a school very close by. i want to send her a message but am very uncertain how best to approach the topic. my intentions is to let her know that i found her mom in a pretty unsafe place and if she wants to exchange phone numbers so that if she needs someone close by who can check on her that my wife and i would be happy to help. how do i approach this so i don't make susan's daughter feel like i am judging her for letting her mom live alone or for what happened. i just don't want to see this lovely older woman get hurt because of improper supervision. at the same time im just a neighbor its not really any of my business and her family may very well have a good handle on things."," nothing new to add in terms of advice, just want to say that you did  a really good thing. i don't know many people who would have handled the situation with such grace and compassion.

[deleted]," i'm not a doctor of any sort so take that into account when reading this, but you say this has been going on for years except for a lull when you were a young teen.  that doesn't sound like dementia to me.  dementia and especially alzheimer's have noticeable memory lapses, she wouldn't try to hide her delusions from certain people and symptoms would progress over the years, not stop and come back.  there are other mental disorders that can cause paranoia, schizophrenia being one of them.why don't you bring your concerns to your father?  some cultures and families don't speak freely about mental health disorders.  it can be a taboo subject.  but it's possible she had a diagnosis and was on meds during the years she didn't seem paranoid, and now she's off them for some reason.  maybe your father doesn't know.  whether it's dementia, schizophrenia or some other paranoid personality disorder your father should be clued in because he's her husband.  he can make sure she gets the help she needs while still being sensitive enough that she doesn't think you've turned on her too.  you, your father and your brother need to have a conversation on how to deal with this as a family.

"i'm 50 years old (male).  single and no kids.  mom has late stage dementia.  my sister (54 years old, single, no kids) lives with mom and takes care of her.  mom needs 24x7 care.  she can't walk, needs to be spoon fed, can barely talk (mostly mumbles jibberish), has to be bathed and changed.  a hired caregiver takes care of her during the day, i take over the afternoon, and my sister the evening and night.2 weeks ago, my sister passed away.  no warning signs at all.  she had a headache friday night and passed out.  it was a brain aneurysm.  she passed away 2 days later (early sunday morning).  i spent 48 hours in the hospital with her while our caregiver helped with mom over this extremely stressful two days.just like that, i am now mom's full time caregiver.  i sleep on a mattress on the floor next to her at night (she needs to be turned a couple of times so she doesn't get bed sores).  i change her diapers.  caregiver gives her baths, but due to holidays, she was off, so i gave mom a bath this weekend.  today is my 4th day with mom all by myself.  caregiver will come back tomorrow (tuesday).mom has lived in the same condo for over 30 years, so i don't want to move her.  i'm bringing stuff over from my apartment and wondering if i should just give up my apartment.  it's been brutal clearing out my sister's stuff.  i haven't had time to grieve my sister's passing yet.  i'm absolutely overwhelmed.  i'm just taking things step-by-step.  learning about mom's meds, going through my sister's paperwork, arranging cremation and funeral stuff, and dealing with mom.  i'm actually thinking about skipping the funeral.  i just can't do it.  my biggest fear is that i don't have any back-up.  my sister and i were back-up to each other.  i'm now alone.  i have no social life anymore.  i have a girlfriend and used to spend all weekends with her, but am not able to see her anymore or go out anywhere.  i'm an avid cyclist and used to go on long rides several times a week (mountain and road biking).  had just bought a nice road bike.  all has come to an abrupt halt.  i can't even risk biking and getting hurt, nor do i have the time.  my life took a 180 degree turn overnight.  i had promised my sister that i would take care of mom if anything ever happened to her.  i'm gonna stick it out and do my best.  not sure if i can hold up.  i really don't think mom has much longer to go.  hiring extra caregivers or putting her in a home can be very expensive and not sure if i can afford that.  i'm now paying mom's condo hoa and utility bills and supporting her, so finances are already stretched.  on top of it, mom has severe anxiety and sundowning.  i'm trying various meds.  just put her on hospice care last week, but they are slow to respond to my questions on meds.  trazadone was a disaster and kept her up and hallucinating all night.  seraqual and buspar work better, but each has it's own issues.  i'm very frustrated.  thanks for reading and allowing me to vent.", you might find this article helpful:,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5kep7j/i_became_a_full_time_caregiver_overnight/,I became a full time caregiver overnight.

"my mother was placed in memory care three weeks ago.  i understand there is a settling in period and that it takes some residents about a month to feel like they are at home.it's not happening.  my mother is getting worse and worse.  more angry, confused to the point where she cannot remember what happened 30 minutes ago, unable to remember how many kids she has.  she cries and says she wants to die, let her go.  then a lot of swearing and mocking of whatever i kindly say to her.  i called the nurse practitioner who is assigned to her and they are running tests to see if she has a uti and are starting an antidepressant.my concern is that the staff says she is on klonopin.   she had a paradoxical reaction to lorazepam, making the sundowning behaviors go to extreme levels of hysteria and using her phone in her room to call 911.she's becoming suicidal and nothing, no visits, no photos of the great grandbaby, no treats or cookies (all of which she loves) hold any interest and she moans, cries and states she wishes to just die.i know dementia causes emotional problems and i realize that the move made things worse.   the place where she is is kind, clean, has plenty of activities but when my mom is on the phone with me she says sarcastically, ""they feed me like a baby.  and weigh me like i am a doggie.  where the f am i?  where did you put me? what state am i in?  get me the f out of here!  nobody does a thing for me here.  i don't even know if they even feed me.  i am in dirty underpants and do you think they even wash my clothes??? (i visited two days ago and her room was spotless and her clothes all washed).should i press to get her medications changed?  or should i wait to let the antidepressant take effect?  i know she was sundowning pretty bad, pretty early in the afternoon and i understand the need for medication but i'm wondering if what she is on is contributing to the severe depression and wondering if her kidney disease (she has about 30% of kidney function left) is making it so she doesn't process drugs as well as she should.i'm so sad over this- a month ago she was addled in her own place and now she is in a new place,  completely unaware of the staff (all of whom i've met and like) that is helping her, completely confused as to where she is  and so, so angry about it.   this is new territory for me and i'm just unsure of how situations like this are handled.  do i need to be going over there more often?  help walk her to activities and sit with her so she has a familiar face while she settles in?  how involved should i be with medications? i used to handle all her appointments and talk to all her doctors- i am out of the loop on the days her new primary sees her.  i appreciate any advice.  dementia really really sucks."," it can take up to two months for her to get used to her new surroundings, and the dementia appears worse because she's no longer for anything to fall back on. the rest of the advice is already given.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/msf6tj/dementia_worsening_in_memory_care_advice_needed/,dementia worsening in memory care- advice needed
"my father has been hiding his dementia until recently- my mother has a sound mind and kept him straight, though she is now in and out of hospitals due to multiple myeloma and is unable to help him.we have realized while he tries to take care of her, that he over does her medication (multiple pain medications) to potentially dangerous levels. they have a live in care taker who cannot help dose medications. we limit the amount of pain medication in the house at one time and we are using pill boxes now. my father is mixing up percocet and oxycontin and then forgetting he has dosed her and goes to dose her again in his lapse. my father is refusing to allow me or my siblings to help more in these situations, is there anything we can do or suggestions for our situation?"," not sure where you live, but in england, the chemist can put the correct meds into a blister pack (or dosette box, whatever they want to call it) and you dad can still feel he is in charge with the meds by giving your mum the correct day and time. the live in carer can also monitor this and become aware if any other days/times have been taken. chemists here don’t really like doing blister packs as it’s more work for them and less money... but the service is there so fight for it. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mscqrv/seeking_advice_for_parent_with_dementia/,Seeking advice for parent with dementia
"my grandma isn't able to care for herself anymore so my family and i are moving in so i can be her care giver. she has 3 extra rooms in her big house that she said we can stay in. one for my fiance and i, a nursery for our baby, and a room for my dad.one of our current struggles is that all 3 rooms have stuff in them, and all the closets have her clothes in them. i am trying to encourage her to box some clothes up and put them in the garage or storage unit so that we can use our closets and she is upset by this and very reluctant to do so. i am not sure how to handel this. she has a huge double door 15foot closet in her room that is full of clothes, and 3 dressers full of clothes so there is no room in her bedroom. despite rarely ever doing anything outside of her home and only wearing 5 pairs of pants and a handful of shirts and being wrapped in her bath robe all day every day, she is very reluctant to box up her clothes and store them elsewhere. what can i do? how can i encourage her to make this change?", what i did for my grandma was had a family member take her to their house for a couple hours and just get it all cleaned up. depending on her and what stage she’s in she might be more excited and shocked by a clean house rather than realize what’s missing. another thing is make sure her things are well covered/hidden so if she goes into the garage she won’t see it because she will start taking it all out and putting it right back where it was.. it’s worked with my grandma when we had to clear out her room and she was at that stage where if it was out of sight it was out of mind! i hope this helps and if not i hope you find something that does good luck :),https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mscmd1/grandma_with_dementia_and_hoarding_issue/,Grandma with dementia and hoarding issue

"hi everyone. i’m glad i found this sub, reading through has made me feel much less alone just in the past few weeks. up until december, my father was completely independent, living at home with my mom. a little kooky here and there, but we had never once had a notion that there was dementia on the horizon. he’s been unsteady on his feet for a while, sometimes using a cane, but that’s always tracked back to a car accident a few years ago. in december he fell, broke some stuff, had some surgeries, and went into rehab. he contracted covid in a medical setting and seemed to recover without much issue (no breathing issues or hospitalization). but in the three months since, he’s deteriorated drastically, directly into what looks like mid stage dementia. its so overwhelming.now he’s so back and forth. sometimes agitated/occasionally combative. but most of the time pleasant even though he has no idea what’s going on. he has no idea where he is — he thinks he’s in the park, or in the city, or on a boat... but perfectly happy being completely delusional. tells stories that as far as i can tell have no basis in reality. now that ive accepted that there’s no point in trying to get him back to reality, and just go along with it and keep it positive, honestly those are the best times. because of the fall he hasn’t left rehab (and will most likely transition directly to long term care when medicare runs out), so luckily that part isn’t an issue. but i’m having a lot of trouble figuring out where he falls in terms of actual diagnosis, because the onset was so fast and they symptoms so varied. we’re going to see a neuro with him next week. just curious i guess how this tracks to anyone else’s experiences and eventual diagnoses."," covid seems to hit those with dementia really hard, because it often attacks their neurological system (which carries communication signals thru the body).  some if this may recover with time, and some may be permanent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ms70bf/covid_into_dementia/,COVID into Dementia
"it feels like i really 'dropped into myself' after my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer's. i saw him this week and he was so frail that i just feel terrible. i am someone who always made plans, had goals, looking forward to 'moving on' or 'moving elsewhere' but that feels contradictory to where my father is. he is slowing down, becoming more still, dying. i am struggling to 'move forward'. i feel so much guilt and sadness. how can i dare live when he is not able to?i wonder how people manage to 'get on with life' whilst dealing with a family member who has dementia? can you enjoy other aspects of life? do you feel as if your life is 'moving forward' or standing still?"," personally, i think this feeling is much influenced by the changes in how elder generations are treated.  when you look in census results during 1800s and early 1900s, you see that elder generations were consistently cared for by the younger generations.we had great-grandma living with us from when i was 8 years old, so seeing this modeled was an accepted part of being a child or grand-child.  it was the return of their investment in us as children.in my personal life, when i was care-partner to someone (changed at different times of my life) that need to give care put a ""pause"" on many aspects of life.  all my energy was used in providing for the other -- and that is okay because i value them.  -- much harder when it lasts for years and years and years, but still okay in the larger perspective.... and now i am the one who needs care (and have for 20yrs).  i am something over 60yo (born 1957 but can no longer subtract) and able to participate in my own care but not able to go very many hours without a care-partner.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ms2lw2/do_you_allow_yourself_to_move_forward_make_plans/,"Do you allow yourself to move forward, make plans, be happy?"

"hello, hopefully this post is okay. this is something new my family is dealing with so i need some help working out how to feel about things. a very brief backstory: grandparents were married for 65 years, the last five of those my grandmother’s physical health was failing and she let us know that for their entire marriage my grandfather had been abusive to her in multiple ways. she didn’t want to leave him or have the family get involved in any way, she just wanted us to know in case she needed help with something. she died two years ago and my grandfather acted completely inappropriately in the days and weeks following her death, there were lots of screaming matches between him and family members, he said horrible things about his deceased wife, wouldn’t let anyone grieve, talked about money as if it was the only thing that mattered now, etc. it was really traumatic dealing with him and as a result no one really got to deal with her death until months later.  as a result, most of us have cut contact with him over his actions following her death, and also because he was never really nice to be around before then anyways, we just all loved our grandmother so much that we put up with his behaviour for her shake. this week he has officially been diagnosed with dementia and the doctor attributes his violent outbursts, lies and manipulations and other behaviours to the dementia. the moral problem we’re all having now is that we cut off contact with him because of the way he is but now it turns out it’s because he has a disease. are we in the wrong for basically cutting him out of the family when it turns out it’s not technically his fault for being the way he is? but at the same time he was abusive towards my grandmother since the 1950s. i haven’t yet done any research on early onset dementia so i don’t know if it’s possible he has always been dealing with it?does anyone have any thoughts or advice on things? it’s a very tricky situation and unfortunately the doctor can’t comment on the moral side of anything and can’t speak for anything that happened in the past since he never really went to see a doctor for much. any replies are welcome and appreciated."," i'm a little blunt about caregiving for abusive elders.  please don't read if you can't handle bluntness or profanity.&#x200b;>she let us know that for their entire marriage my grandfather had been abusive to her in multiple ways.holy shit.  that's just fucking awful.  i wish my g'g'greats had the option to divorce their abusers, everyone's life would have been a lot better.  my g'g'great grandmother had to kill g'g'grandfather because they couldn't divorce... it was a bad world.&#x200b;>and also because he was never really nice to be around before then  anyways, we just all loved our grandmother so much that we put up with  his behaviour for her shake.he better treasure those memories.  oh wait, he has dementia.  well i'm sure broke up that the abuser is going to forget the only happy memories he has because he married a lovely woman, who he then abused.  lemme go get a tissue.&#x200b;>are we in the wrong for basically cutting him out of the family when it  turns out it’s not technically his fault for being the way he is?the assaulter who abused and beat down your beloved grandmother isn't getting love and devotion and whatever.  this is not morality nor justice, this is the consequences of his actions.  reap what you sow, sleep in the bed you made, stand in the boots you pissed in.  he made his choices so stop worrying about if it's your responsibility to undo them.i mean... that he's abusive, lying, and manipulative *now* is just one extra turd on the pile of shit.  do you think your grandma told you he was abusive so you could agonize about this?  no, she told you so you wouldn't have to suffer his abuses after she was no longer a buffer.  she knew what she was doing.  stop sacrificing yourself to his viciousness, she wanted to save you that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mrdnb4/need_some_moral_advice_i_think/,Need some moral advice I think

"first of all, i want to say thank you to everyone who commented on my last post and offered me a tremendous amount of help, advice, and support regarding my grandmother who suffers from dementia (alzheimer's). you truly have no idea how much of an impact you've made. second, i come here to give a bit of an update and ask for more advice, or at the very least knowledge of what comes next in the process. update: she is still having these (overwhelmingly) negative delusions although they do change day to day. originally, it was that i was dying, then that i was having a miscarriage, now it's that my ""husband"" (she means my boyfriend) is dead and i have to fight his family for an inheritance as well as a fear that i am going to be kidnapped and held for ransom because he owes over $100 000 to some people in london. she still doesn't like when i leave the house, although she's not worried my ""husband"" will kill me anymore since he's ""dead"". now we just tell her that i'm going to see my professors to talk about school and she seems okay with that although she still has full conversations with me when i'm not here. wherever she is, she hears me talking to her. however, now the fear is that if i leave the house i'm going to get kidnapped. she also keeps trying to go on the balcony to see if there's anyone there - i'm really worried about that, we have to basically stand guard at all times. we also ordered some locks to put on our doors, so she doesn't come bursting in at all hours of the night so we'll see how that goes. now for the medical update and where i need advice. the first thing the doctor checked for was if she had a uti and it turns out she does not. second, he  started the process of getting a mental assessment done for her to determine that she is not mentally capable of making medical decisions for herself. i'm not exactly sure how this is going to work because she doesn't speak english, but the gist is that the assessment will be done. this is in the hopes of gaining medical power of attorneyship over her and placing her in a long term care home. however, he warned us that no long term care facility will be willing to take her if she is aggressive. this is where my worry is. although she is not physically aggressive with us, she is known to be especially aggressive when it comes to hospital workers, nurses, etc. so, i'm worried that even after the doctor signs off on her not being able to make medical decisions for herself and we find a home for her that doesn't have a ridiculous waitlist, they still won't take her because she's aggressive. my question is, is this the case most of the time? are there places that will take people who might be physically aggressive? what do we do? i'm just so deeply disappointed that it seems like they're basically saying ""too bad, she's your problem"", when i'm so worried about her safety. not to mention i can feel my own mental health plummeting. i'm anxious all the time, my heart is constantly beating super fast, i can barely eat, and i have trouble getting to sleep. please let me know if there's anything else we can do, or if you have any advice."," for the balcony - here, there's home burglaries all day every day so for sliding doors we put a pvc pipe in the track so it can't be pushed open even when unlocked. and we use sliding door locks - they're basically little clamps you tighten around the top track next to the door. you'd have to reach up and unscrew it to get out. obviously that makes it a bit more precarious to escape if there's a fire, but it's an effective way to keep a door from opening easily (bonus: if she's short, she can't reach the clamp anyway).for the ltcf - i find it very, very hard to believe 'nowhere' would take someone aggressive. sounds like they don't know what they're talking about. sure, not every place would, but i'm certain that's not every single facility. aggression is very common in cognitive decline, and not everyone has family they can just live with.for the assessment - are spanish speaking doctors/nurses not a thing where you live? it's very common to find bilingual clinics or just physicians here (california). they should also let a translator, like a family member, be present. for my grandma's assessment, my mother sat next to her. due to covid, the doctor couldn't get too close, but my grandma's hearing is awful so my mom sat next to her to a) observe and b) repeat things loudly to my grandma, since they're in a 'bubble' together and proximity isn't an issue.the assessment and diagnosis should provide clarity about what kind of care she needs and if medications could help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mr2vtm/i_need_some_more_advice/,I Need Some More Advice...
"hi.  new to reddit but hoping for some advice regarding my dad with az.  he is around mid-stage i'd say.  he lives nearby in a duplex i own where my sister and her family are in the front and he is in the back.  this is working well for now, as he has some independence but still lots of care.   he is very aware of his diminishing health and mental acuity and desperately wants to tell his stories for posterity.  because he has macular degeneration as well, he can't really write things down or type (not sure he could anyway).  he would like to have a way to record his thoughts and stories and then share them with his ""many friends"" (hardly any sadly).  does anyone have any suggestions of recording devices that are super simple to use, can be sent to people or, better, transcribed to text.  i bought him a small sony recorder but it is too complicated (although it is the simplest one i could fine).  today i downloaded an app for his iphone and we're going to try that.  my guess is that he will have forgotten how to use it by the time i get back there later.  or maybe there are services that help someone to record their memories?  he gets much enjoyment telling (and retelling and retelling...) his stories so even if we never do anything with them, being able to speak them will help fill his day and give him some enjoyment."," i no longer travel, but my kids have started video recordings of my mother talking about family history and treasured inherited keepsakes on their cell phone when they visit.  then these vids are gathered together.  so what if the same story is told a zillion times, but often they can get her channel changed to talking about something else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mr2nos/recording_devices_for_az_patients/,Recording Devices for AZ Patients?

"\*i am reposting this question from another forum to get any second opinions.i'm  unsure about what to do here because idk what is required of legal   consent in getting her help, from everything i've read it seems she can  refuse help, even though she poses a danger to herself/others. she only  speaks spanish and has declined any/all help. she has showed signs of  dementia, she has parkinson's disease and its greatly impacted her  cognitive functions, and from this event we learnt she is also a  hoarder.   so  here is what happened the other night: it was 1:30ish  am, i don't  usually stay up so late so late, but its lucky that i did. i  smelt a  weird burning smell coming from my vents and i wasn't sure if  maybe it  was something lingering from dinner, so i go out in the  hallway just to  make sure, and the entire hallway is thick with smoke.  we have 8 smoke  detectors in this one hallway, and yet none of them  went off. i wake my  partner up, told him to call the fire dept. and  then proceeded to bang  on all the apartment doors to get my neighbors  out. the last door i went  to was her door, because it's near the exit.  as an extra detail, it's also the apartment directly below mine. nobody  answers, i was super  concerned since the brief encounter with the smoke  in the hallway was causing us to be sick (we coughed for hours after  and were nauseous).  the fire dept. roll up and can't locate the source  of the smoke. i tell them that there's an old lady in the first  apartment and i couldn't rouse her, and that i felt it was from her  apartment. they bang and bang and  bang until she finally opens the  door. she has this glazed over look in her eyes and a big smile on her  face as smoke seeps out. and yes, the source of the fire was in her  apartment. she had fallen asleep while cooking a steak and it caught  fire and i think the smoke fumes prob kept her knocked out. i really  feel that she would have died, had i not been awake. so this is an issue  for the safety of the building as well as her life, all our lives. so  the fire dept. all go in there and handle it, but they didn't  even ask  her to step outside or check her out medically. she is clearly  not  mentally intact. the fire chief talked to us since we called them,  and  he said that it was not a normal living situation, that it was a  fire  hazard, and he and called my landlord to set up aps check in.  so  we  were relieved at least something was going to be done. she declined the  help of the firefighters...she literally went back to watching tv after  they left like nothing happened. i talked to my landlord about this  situation, and she is obviously extremely concerned, but felt powerless.  this lady doesn't even pay rent sometimes, and the landlord out of  kindness, just lets her pay whatever, sometimes $300, sometimes $500,  because she doesn't remember the cost of her rent. the women's family   (she has 3 brothers who are well to do) want to help her, but shes   stubborn and declines, my landlord even found her a lovely charity  funded  place for elderly latina women that is nice, and she refuses. so  we are  relieved about adult protective services becoming involved  because shes clearly a danger to others/herself but for some reason even  though it's  clear she needs help, and that she is not all there  mentally, she still has the right to decline, which is something i don't  really understand, since this is a situation that is dangerous to  everyone who lives here.  so i'm waiting and watching to see if aps does  what they are asked  of... a van pulls up, its salvation army, and they  are there to do a  wellness check. they don't speak spanish, and they  knock on her door,  ask if she needs assistance, and of course she says  no and slams the  door in their faces. so what good is that if that's  all they are going  to do? all my worldly possessions, my pets, my  livelihood (i make art to sell online) is all in my apartment and i am  living above a hoarder who has dementia and almost caused a fire. i'm  frankly very scared, and i'm  not sure what i can do. idk how consent  works when someone is clearly  incapable rational behavior and is  literally a threat to herself and others. the landlord is exhausted. we  don't know what to do since her family won't step in, and aps isn't  doing much. what can be done? should i call aps on her and go into   further detail? maybe get our landlord involved since she has a lot more  information about her unusual conduct? i just don't understand why nothing can be done when its something that could cost her life and the lives of others."," \*\*\*\*update: since the state has become involved, her family are finally stepping in. i spoke with the landlord, they have begun packing, and the family have found her a place with round the clock care. i wished they could have done this sooner, but i pass no judgements, because maybe they didn't realize the amount of decline in her functions, or how hazardous her living situation is. hoarders are notoriously private after all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mqwoaq/help_my_neighbor_has_severe_dementia_lives_alone/,"HELP.

i used to be one of the caregivers for my mother since 2011. she had cancer and she was paralyzed. she passed away two months ago. i am now the sole caregiver to my father who is also paralyzed and has dementia. lately his memory loss became unbearable. he forgets that he already ate breakfast and lunch and dinner but he keeps asking for them nonstop. he calls my name nonstop. i hear him call my name with a loud voice almost all day long and for the most part of the night. i cannot describe to you how that affected my life. i can’t eat i can’t sleep i can’t work [we are still working from home]. i can’t use noise canceling headsets although i have them because he would start yelling very loudly and the neighbors start to complain. i am too weak and too desperate to the point where i’m considering taking my own life. i haven’t even had a chance to grieve my mom. her death was a trumatic experience and we couldn’t even have a funeral. and now i am suffering because of what my father is doing. i completely understand dementia and i understand thats everything is out of his control. however i’m feeling hopeless. i’m contemplating into my own life as i’m writing my post. i hope to hear from people in my situation. how are you coping? please let me know. i am extremely desperate., please don’t take your life. you are worth life. can you call someone?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mqwl7o/driven_crazy_by_the_demands_of_the_caregiving/,Driven crazy by the demands of the caregiving role I’m playing.

"early on and disease, how did you figure out when it was your loved one talking or the disease talking?i recently moved my mother into an independent living community. she does not need memory care or assisted living, but she doesn’t have her car and i think she feels pretty trapped. also trapped by her difficulties in cognition and executive function. after four months she is still having difficulty learning the ins and outs of the community. she can go to the dining room in the trash room and knows her way around but doesn’t seem to be able to be taking advantage of the other activities, although they are significantly reduced because of covid.she called me the other night with various issues and just generally seems so unhappy. keeps her referring to the community as “this facility“ and displeased with all the “sick old people”. she’s called me with similar complaints in the past and never called the directors of the facility to tell me they usually see her walking around and having a good time with people. other times she does tell me how nice people are. then she will tell me how depressing and miserable they all are. i really don’t know what to believe.", your description sounds exactly like my mother. same exact thing. she’s been in her “independent living” apartment for almost 3 years now and she still talks about how “the place is falling apart” and she hates it. unfortunately she’s gonna have to go to memory care soon (especially if she gets lost again). if she thinks she hates it now she’s got another thing coming. i always just told her to find a place she wanted to move to and i’d look at it with her (because she has zero capacity to do so). that would appease her enough to end the conversation. good luck.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mni9nr/how_to_figure_out_who_is_taking/,How to figure out who is taking

my mom is finally in hospice as of last tuesday for early onset dementia at age 59. she has been sick most of my life and for me it has been a very difficult past 20 years or so. ever since i can remember i’ve tried my best to keep it all a secret because people are usually dismissive and not understanding. i guess i’m just struggling with everything because i feel so much pain and hurt and loss and grief and i’m constantly being told that it could be worse and i’m lucky to even have a mom. maybe they are right and i’ve never experienced actually difficult life situations so i’m blowing this all out of proportion. i don’t know. i feel very conflicted and it’s making her dying even worse," the suffering of others doesn't negate yours. it's not like doctors will tell someone with a broken leg that the pain isn't as bad as dying from cancer. you're absolutely justified in being upset and grieving. dementia is a cruel fate for both the diagnosed and their families (usually moreso for family/caregivers). i fully understand why people can think that it's better to have them around with dementia as opposed to losing them entirely, and in some ways it is. but in other ways people really can't understand until they've lived through it. it can feel like losing your loved one over and over, and the good memories can feel like they're being replaced with new ones of exhaustion, frustration and resentment. there's a lot of separation in timelines where you segregate the memories of who they were 'before' being sick because you know this new chapter isn't 'them'. but like others have mentioned, we get it. sometimes the best way to keep sane during this process is to shut out the unnecessary opinions, turn off your phone, have a good cry, think of a few good memories, and then come back to the world when you're ready. you can't fill someone's cup if yours is empty, so remember to take care of yourself too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mmytyr/is_it_really_not_that_bad/,is it really not that bad?

"not sure if this is the right place to ask, so if there's a better place, i'd appreciate the redirect. my mother is 83, has hydrocephalus, and dementia. previously, she had been living at home with her husband acting as primary caregiver. a few months ago, she fell in her home and fractured her hip. as a result, we had to move her out of that house into an adult foster home, because her dementia and balance issues make her a high-enough fall risk to require 24 hour care.  (her husband remains in the family home for now)at first, i thought the move was overwhelmingly positive. after a year of covid lock-down, she was seeing new faces and having daily social interactions with multiple people. the physical therapist and occupational therapists gave additional stimulation, and the caregivers are making sure she gets exercise to improve her overall mobility, and i suspect she's eating better meals. her own attitude remained extremely positive, and we (my brother, myself, and my father) visit her three times a week at least. the caregivers asked for a prescription for anti-anxiety medication, which we obtained and started. it was a low-dose (zoloft, i think?)  and we started it about two weeks ago. this morning, i got a message from the caregiver saying that my mother was having increasing anxiety, including screaming and attempting to hit the caregiver, and she wanted to talk to the doctor about increasing the dosage of the medication. the caregiver says that when my mother experiences unknown pain or anxiety, it has begun escalating into aggressive behavior. i don't want my mother to experience distress. i don't want the professional caregivers to be at risk for harm. but i have some reluctance, some concern about over-medication. maybe it's just ignorance about pharmacology, or an irrational suspicion that heavily-medicated clients are easier to provide care for, but mostly i'm facing a lot of straight-up ignorance.what kind of relationship is there between anti-anxiety medications and dementia symptoms? what's the typical onset-and-adjustment period for anti-anxiety drugs? are there other medications out there used in the treatment of dementia or it's symptoms? what questions am i not asking? what **don't** i know to ask about?"," my mother with vascular dementia also has had negative reactions to benzodiazepines in the past (lorazepam, xanax, restoril,) so i always say no benzodiazepines. to calm agitation she’s on seroquel now, which is an anti psychotic. there’s also haloperidol which didn’t work for my mother and others. but the anti psychotics are a level up from normal anti anxiety meds like zoloft or lexapro. i had my mother on lexapro, which was switched to buspar and sertraline, then when that wasn’t enough we had to upgrade to the anti psychotic, seroquel.medications like zoloft or lexapro don’t make things worse i don’t believe. anti psychotic and benzodiazepines will calm her down if she’s more agitated but can also have more side effects.if i were you i would push back on prescribing anything too heavy until absolutely necessary. if she only gets aggressive when she’s in pain or hungry that should be easy for the caregiver to control. when she gets aggressive for no reason and it’s throughout the day, every day that’s harder.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mmd0f0/questions_about_medications_for_dementia_patients/,Questions about medications for dementia patients
"my grandma is 73 years old and was diagnosed with dementia cca a month ago.it all started being quite problematic a year ago when my town went into lockdown for a month. grandma is at that moment living with my uncle, aunt and cousin in a decent house with a really big yard but she got scared because of the virus so she didn't want to go out of the house, not even into the yard where she had some vegetables and flowers.she has a tv in her bedroom and she would watch mass/service (she's very religious) on it since she can't go to the church. the first ''weird'' thing was when she told us that the priests are coming into her room to hold mass and she even asked my uncle to give them a bottle of olive oil as a gift (for context: my family has olive trees and we are making our own olive oil). my first thought was that she probably fell asleep while watching the mass and was dreaming of those priests in her room. stuff like that continued but only with the priests, for example she said once that they are mad at her because she didn't sing and similar stuff. she even said that they asked her to be the next pope. now that i think of it it was alarming but back then i thought that the corona is driving us all nuts, that's she sleeps during half of the stuff she watches and we even told her that they can't see her or hear her to which she agreed. basically, she would say something ''weird'' and we would tell her ''grandma, it's not like that'' and it seemed that she understood it and that she was okay with it. also, maybe important to mention during the lockdown i didn't visit her because we were really cautious with all that virus stuff.the summer was as far as i know okay. she was always a piece of work and acting like a victim so even when she was a little bit off, for example not wanting to sit with all of us at the table i thought it's just her being her petty self but also, when i would talk to her she would remember my boyfriend, she would talk about my life with me, my job, etc. so i wasn't really worried and the stuff with the priests stopped.fats forward to a month ago:she started being very aggressive, especially towards my aunt. she never liked her. for context: my uncle was always ''the golden son'', he always got everything and she would even lock his bedroom and forbid my father to enter it when uncle was at work (back when they were younger) so maybe one of the reasons is being an ''overprotective mother'', one of the reasons for sure is because my aunt is from ''another town'' (we are actually a pretty small town, almost village and there was always that stupid rivalry between the villages), also maybe one of the reasons is because my grandmas house was always clean and tidy until my aunt came and she kinda became ''the boss'' (which my grandma started calling her for the last month, or even more) and the house honestly went to shit. it's always messy, they smoke with the windows closed, they got a big dog which sleeps in their bed and hangs out in the house which my grandma doesn't like, she (grandma) also bullied my cousin when she was smaller (i have no idea why, she does look a lot like my aunt, maybe that's why?). she would slap my aunt, call her names (after what a assume a while my aunt started provoking her when she would insult her which i think is not okay, you need patience with grandma?) she would scream, she would tell her friends and my family that they are beating her (which they didn't but they were maybe aggressive with her, uncle told me that he did grab her and sat her on the couch, after that she ran away), she would think that they locked her but she would actually lock herself and then she would bang on the door of her bedroom so once my cousin had to go trough the window to her room to unlock the door from inside because grandma didn't know where she put the keys, she would constantly cry that they took her money so my dad had to go every other day to my uncles to count the money that she would hide somewhere and then forget where it is, she would run away from her house. my whole family was searching for her one evening and she was hiding in a freaking bush watching them. after that they called an ambulance and she was pretty ''sane'' during the conversation with the medical staff. she would also ask my family if she can come and live at our house. so, after what i assume was 2-3 weeks my uncle decided to put her in a retirement home for people with dementia and similar. he did it so that he told her that they need to visit a doctor and he left her there. i don't think that is the way you treat your mother but this is all a new experience for me, that's why i'm writing to you guys.what i want to know is:my uncle and his family kinda neglected her? they always talked bad about her, whenever she would join them at the table they would roll their eyes, my cousin was always very rude to her, they never had patience with her even when she was mentally healthy. they did cook for her, they went to the doctors with her (well, they would leave her alone with the doctor but at least they would take her there) but she didn't have any positive emotional or social interaction with her. also, my cousin(s) (i have two of them from that family but the older one is not living with them anymore) and my aunt would always prais my aunt family side, my aunts family side was always their fave if that means anything in this case. i feel like my grandma didn't feel at home for quite some time. does all of this have anything to do with her state?my uncle didn't visit her since he put her in the retirement home, neither did my cousins, his comment when my father told him that my sister and i visited her was ''they don't allow visits''. i'm really disappointed in how our family relationship turned out but i'm more sad because of my grandma.my sister visited her last sunday, she said that she thought that she came to take her home but my sister told her that she can't do that without the doctors permision to which my grandma agreed. they talked for 2 hours (that's how long the visits are), even laughed but when i visited her she was a totally different person. she was ready with all her bags in the corridor of the retirement home, wanting to go home. she was just going left and right through the corridor, taking 2 bags from the pile to the other side of the corridor, coming back to the pile, taking a look at the other side of the corridor, noticing the other 2 bags there saying ''what are my bags doing there?'' and then grabing those 2 bags and puting them on the pile again and it continued for 45 minutes. after that i realized i won't be able to sit down with her and talk to her so i left home. that night she wanted to escape through a window and she even hit the nurse. i don't know is it smart to visit her again? are we having a bad inffluence on her or is it better to visit her as much as we can? they said if she continues like that, that they'll have to send her to a psychiatry permantently (she already was after the second night there but they brought her back to the retirement home after a few days of observing)i'm just really heartbroken and don't know how to cope with all of this. i'm just waiting for a big fight to burst out between our families."," it sounds like, if nothing else, she wasn't getting proper care with your aunt and uncle.should you go visit her again? yes. the behavior you mentioned sounded a lot like sundowning. was it later in the day? with my mom, somewhere around 2p.m. she'd be all right with staff but if we were there she'd start demanding to go home or telling hateful stories that even she, when you asked in a roundabout way, knew weren't true. you might ask the staff what time of day she's at her best for a visit or when a visit would be most beneficial.i'm sorry she's going through this, it's a nightmare with only one end. at least she does have some family who care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mmcw7p/emotional_and_social_neglect/,Emotional and social neglect?

my grandpas dementia is getting worse and it’s come to the point where he’s stopped taking his medication and leaving food to rot in his fridge and just generally not taking care of anything. we are trying to fill out medicaid paperwork and thought now would be a good time to do guardianship as well. does he need to be able to consent for guardianship? he doesn’t speak english well and spanish is his first language. do you think getting a spanish speaking attorney would be helpful? or would a family member translating be okay? is the process long? what kind of questions should we expect? we have a meeting scheduled with a local estate law attorney next week. any advice or tips in this process would be great. also any help on the medicaid process and caregiver stuff. for reference we are in vermont.," i am the court-appointed guardian for my sister and have been through the process in my state (colorado).every state will be a bit different, which is why it is so important to use an elder-care attorney.  i don't know about vermont or other states, but the comments here so far do not apply to guardianship in all cases - colorado in particular.here in colorado, there are two possible roles - guardianship and conservatorship.  conservatorship runs a ward's finances.  a guardian runs everything else.  i'm the guardian for my sister and the family requested that the court appoint a professional fiduciary that we selected as conservator, which they did. sometimes the court may assign both roles to a single person.again it may vary by state, but here in colorado neither a guardian nor a conservator is personally financially responsible for the ward. in fact, they can bill the ward for their time and expenses.we went with the guardianship & conservatorship because my sister was not competent to agree to a poa and refused to move out of her apartment despite the clear safety need to do so.  guardianship gave me the legal authority to move her to a memory care facility without her consent.  in fact, the court directed that i do that when guardianship was granted.  again, states will differ, but a poa is generally a much more limited form of legal authority.the legal expenses for guardianship can be high because generally one should retain a competent attorney and it requires one or more court dates and hearings and filing lots of paperwork.  additionally, since the court orders and authorizes the guardianship/conservatorship, generally you're required to make reports to the court (here it is annually) to ensure you're filling your responsibilities.  if you don't the court will remove and replace you as guardian.and the responsibilities are much greater than with a poa.  as a guardian, you are legally responsible for the welfare of your ward and can be held accountable if you neglect that responsibility. there are also limitations.  generally, you cannot, for example, move your ward outside the state where guardianship was granted without the court's permission.as far as consent, i believe most states have a different process for consensual guardianship vs. an involuntary guardianship.  also, in general, if your grandpa is too far along with his dementia, a consensual process may not be possible because he may no longer be able to legally consent.  this is where a medical/neurological evaluation would come in.also, in such proceedings, other family members can objection to the petition.  the court will hear and consider all sides and then make a decision.  if you have family that will oppose this move, then they generally have the right to have their voices heard in the process. your options are to present better arguments to the court or convince your relatives beforehand not to object.but all this may be different in your state, so it's good that you have scheduled to speak with an attorney.  professional counsel with expertise in this area of law will be able to help you determine what is the best course for your family.best of luck to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mlzqtc/guardianship_process/,Guardianship process
"my fit, well-groomed, well-dressed, pretty active, physically healthy 82 year old mom has been worried about her memory for 5 years now and she has brought it up at every doctor's appointment (i go to all of them with her). she always answers their questions about what day it is, who is the president, etc., correctly at her appointments. she repeats herself a lot to the doctors, though, so i know they know she has at least normal cognitive decline. she also has a few days a year where she is super sleepy and in an altered mental state (saying weird things as if she just woke up from a dream) and i was so worried about her on one of those days that one doctor scheduled her for a brain scan that came back fine/normal/typical.  the most dramatic elements of my mom's decline are her near-total loss of ability to do simple math, manage accounts, etc. she blanks out on the mere existence of accounts that she's had for years and she also can go through 5 or 6 checks trying to get one bill paid. she recently made one of her kids current (not springing) poa and resigned as trustee of her revocable trust with 2 kids as co-trustees. i know all of her accounts, obligations, bill due dates, etc., and it's my hope that she stays as willing to be pampered in an administrative respect as she has been so far (all of her kids, myself included, have pitched taking over her affairs for her as a form of pampering and she has been willing to accept the help (which she needs). anyway, **i find myself wondering where this is going and whether i'm letting her down in not being super vigilant about getting her diagnosed(?).** sometimes i read about lbd and think that's going to be her (super sensitive to medications, talking in her sleep a good deal and occasionally getting up at 4 am, thinking she has an appointment that she needs to dress for and get out of the house, etc.).  i'm told she's very atypical in that--in mere social situations-- she's very mainstream, kind, appropriate, beautifully dressed, etc. (she may not remember people's names, but she'll greet them warmly and say ""forgive me, i'm forgetting how we know each other?"") i guess i keep expecting her to behave unlike herself in addition to forgetting things, but she is just herself less all of her business acumen and computational skills, etc. (and less her memory of many peripheral people, past vacations, events, etc.).  **is hers a familiar/typical progression? she's definitely accelerating in losing her memory and what's left of her ability to manager her affairs, but she's still herself.**"," if she has dementia and hasn't progressed very far in 5 years, i wouldn't worry about getting a diagnosis until something definitive and very obvious happens. we never pursued a formal diagnosis from a specialist with my mom, her doctor went through what was happening with us, checked to be sure there weren't any delerium issues causing the problems, and said she had dementia. no big fuss with a neurologist, no visit to a psychiatrist. mom got the care she needed, at home and later in memory care, but she wasn't dragged through a bunch of extra tests.it sounds like your family is stepping up and taking care of her, you're all to be commended for that. it's amazing how few families can do that. just keep doing what you're doing, love her, and keep her as happy and safe as you can. in the end, diagnosis or not, the end is the same with very little difference in treatment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mlw8ry/how_important_is_a_dx_my_mom_82f_is_very_fit/,"How important is a dx?

"so my dad hasn't yet been diagnosed - he's just waiting for the mri. the neurologist has said it almost certainly is dementia, and he certainly has multiple signs. he's just about still working but they've started asking if he's planning on working the last two years until he hits retirement age (65). my mum has taken his car keys away after half a dozen minor scrapes and bumps. he is confabulating and so much worse than a year ago. my dad is in denial and says he's fine. my mum hasn't told my brother because he doesn't deal with emotional things well (coping with his own depression). my mum is 4 years older and suffering from arthritis herself fairly badly but her mind is luckily sharp as ever. i'm 27, a junior doctor  in full time work and need to plan put what will happen so my career vaguely works and i can look after them. i'm trying to persuade my parents to move house so they can live next door or with me qhen i buy a house, this won't be for about 3 years due to moving during surgical training. i just don't know how to cope with it. i just got home from a weekend with my parents, the first for some time thanks to covid, and its the first time i've felt like it was me supporting them rather than home being a safe place for me, and i know how selfish that sounds. i'm already looking out for my brother so he doesn't try suicide again, and i have been on suicide watch and ocd support for a close friend turn housemate through covid. it's my dad, and he's always been such a clever, witty person and now he's so quiet and withdrawn and just less and less my dad. i don't know how to balance everything and try and juggle my dad, my brother, my mums loneliness, my friend, my career, and my own health. i feel like i can't get away from it all ever, at work i see dementia patients all the time, i get home and i'm looking after my friend and trying to keep in contact with everyone, then i'm trying to revise for exams. i feel guilty about wanting to escape it all. i feel guilty that when i thought about them moving in with me i thought about whether anyone would want to date a guy in that situation. i feel guilty about being sad i can't move to nz like i dreamt of doing. i feel guilty about not spending time with my friends or revising etc etc. this isn't me looking for advice or anything, just a rant at the world. i feel like i'm going to drive my friends away because i'm always talking about it to them and not just chilling or joking around so i'm trying not to always talk about it. i can't put more on my mum as she's got so much to deal with already, i've already hidden my previous suicide attempts and depression from her and dad because i saw how my brothers attempt broke them. i can't get professional mental health advice thanks to my career, if i go i have to declare it and in surgery, especially my speciality it's the equivalent of admitting you're weak and not coping (sadly drs have 0 compassion for other drs even though we'd tell a patient they're being silly and fully justified). i'm just so upset and terrified and sad about dad and i don't know how to deal with it. i will cope with it, i know i will, i always have and always will. people are relying on me and i won't let them down. dad told me he was proud of me today and i barely kept in the tears, so yeah, not going to let him down. rant over. sorry all."," i'm sorry you're having to deal with all of this. it definitely far too much for one person to deal with, being a junior doctor on its own would be stressful enough. i've been pleasantly surprised by the support available through a local carers network so it's worth finding out what is available in your area to help both yourself and your mum. getting additional support in place is not letting anyone down, i'm concerned you will burnout otherwise.  please take care of yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mlrpat/dealing_with_my_dads_impending_diagnosis/,Dealing with my dad's impending diagnosis

"my (40m) wife’s (36f) father (72) has been in assisted living for close to a year and a half now.  he’s got copd, diabetes, limited leg strength (big fall risk) and very poor memory/dementia. he was a heavy drinker that went in for a surgery over 2 years ago to open a vein and improve his circulation, but alcohol withdrawals after the surgery almost killed him and put him in the icu for over a week. when he finally recovered enough to get out of skilled nursing and into his current assisted living facility, he was left with even worse memory and mobility than he had 2 years ago. despite all his medical problems he somehow survived getting covid19 while in the assisted living facility. he’s one tough asshole. he and my wife have never been super close due to the fact that her parents split up when she was very young and she moved away with her mom. she’s an only child, though. her dad’s brothers all live in another state. the last time he ended up in the hospital for an extended stay it was during a drunken fall over (broken femur) over christmas back in his home town about 4 years ago. the alcohol withdrawal complications also almost killed him then too, and that’s when his memory really started to fail him.  his brother helped take care of his affairs while he was there, but said he’s not going to be his responsibility ever again. so ever since the complications from his most recent hospitalization occurred, all the responsibilities have fallen to my wife (and me). as i mentioned it’s been two years and we still have no advanced healthcare directive because there need to be witnesses and he has to agree to sign it (he won’t) so all we technically have is poa. at least one or two weeks a month he goes through these spells where he calls us wanting to go home, or he wants a his wallet, checkbook, etc back so he can “take control”. my wife hates getting yelled at and rarely takes his calls, so he calls me and leaves me voicemails instead. i do what i can to distract him or tell him stuff like “let me check with the doctor and call you back” just to buy time.  i’m at my wits end though. he has an iphone that i’m beginning to think we need to take control of in order to limit any calls he’s getting from spammers, pharmacy medical bills, etc that may be causing him to think his affairs are in total disarray.  i also empathize with how confused he is and why he feels like we don’t care, but even if we explain his situation to him he will call us 30min after we talk to him asking when we are going to come pick him up and take him home, as if nothing we just said registered. i wish my wife would take on a more pro-active role in handling his affairs but she works full time and has some mental health problems of her own. those problems tend to make her bad at keeping up with his financial situation and keeping in touch with his doctors, facility staff, etc. it feels like i’m the one who asserts more of a poa role than she does. he’s not my father and yet some days it feels like i’m the one who has to shoulder this the most, even though i know the situation is a bigger source of depression for her than it is for me. it still creates a real strain on our relationship though, and soon i will have my own parents to start worrying about.  i wish i could just ignore his calls and pretend everything is fine but i can’t. has anyone else here become the de-facto poa in regards to a dementia patient and somehow gotten themselves out of that situation? how did you do it? i’m worried anyone we hire (or guardian appointed) to help manage his affairs is just going to drain what money he has left for care even faster."," i don’t really have any good suggestions because i’m relatively early in this process myself.i do want say that you sound like a very good person, a wonderful husband and even a better son-in-law for doing what you’ve already done. don’t let your father-in-law ruin your marriage or your health though.it might be worthwhile to reach out to your local department of aging or even social work at a hospital to find a way to have someone else help manage his care if his own brothers and daughter will not or cannot. this really shouldn’t fall on you. ultimately, unless you want him to live with you he may have to run down whatever he has left so that he can eventually get long-term care through medicaid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mlmdin/dealing_with_fatherinlaws_dementia/,Dealing with Father-in-Law’s dementia

my mother was diagnosed with vascular dementia almost 2 years ago. there’s a little mental health mixed in just to make her more interesting. she also on the  narcissistic spectrum - all the colours of the rainbow 🌈 she  is very bitter towards me since she blames me for losing her independence and being in a home. i’m her poa and she barely understands what that is and thinks i just go shopping with her money. she is always always asking about her money and where is it. i tell her it’s in the bank safe and sound. she also wants to know how much there is. the problem is she has financial scammers that are still in regular contact with her. she tells them everything how much money she has and since they have already taken advantage of her in the past i do not trust them but sadly she does. she has a mobile that she can make calls from but i’ve diverted all calls to myself. that way anyone trying to call her get me and hang up. i don’t want her constantly divulging her finances to these people and i’ve noticed she’s now started to call new phone numbers to people i do not know. she makes friends with people very quickly states they are her ‘best friends’what in the world do i do? i don’t want her to think i’m hiding stuff from her but i also know that she mouths off to every one including nursing home staff about her finances. it’s embarrassing and makes me feel very vulnerable as her only child.i need to protect her and me. i even found out that one of them tried getting in a lawyer to see her to do a new will. i nearly had a heart attack the only reason they didn’t succeed is cos of corvid. i’m in a constant state of panic and it’s affecting my health. the home can’t stop people from visiting her but they seem to mostly only be in contact with the phone.," if she's saved these scammer's numbers in her phone, do a hard reset/get her a new phone and only pre-program your number.  then she can't easily call the bad guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mldo4y/need_advice_what_do_i_tell_her_every_time_its_a/,Need advice - what do I tell her every time?

"my dad lives across country with his girlfriend. we noticed something was off about a year and a half ago. he stopped taking care of himself i.e. showering, brushing his teeth, he stopped eating, didn’t pay his bills etc. he started drinking way more than he used to and basically stop leaving the house. with this, he began showing signs of memory loss which was a red flag for dementia due to my family’s history (two of his sisters are in assisted living for dementia and my grandmother died of alzheimer’s). he refused to go to the doctor, but i flew out to see him this weekend and forced him to go. the doctors have diagnosed him with severe depression and possible dementia. when this it was explained to his girlfriend, she decided she could not take care of him and left.now that his care is on me, my dad insists i am “meddling in his business“. i know the thought of moving across the country to be closer to me and other family will overwhelm him, but i also know that this is the best for him. at what point do you make the decisions for them? i have such anxiety about leaving him here to live on his own, but i also know that he is not going to come with me willingly. we are setting up home health aide so i know that he would be safe for the time being, but i’m also trying to mitigate having to fly home just to get back on a plane and fly back here. he has literally no friends or family where he currently is. it was just his girlfriend’s friends and family. i feel very selfish, but i’m sick of living on edge and not knowing what the next steps are. i am so nervous i’ll lose my job over the constant back and forth.", my family has just hired an elder law attorney. it is worth the peace if mind. they are there to advocate for you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mjn8qo/how_to_help_someone_that_doesnt_want_help/,How to help someone that doesn’t want help
"i'm a 28f living at home with both my parents (78m, 74f) and my sister 32f. about three years ago my mom was diagnosed with fronto-temporal dementia and right now seems to be in pretty advanced stages. she needs help with almost every task and cannot be left alone but it seems that putting her in a facility seems kind of far down the line. i moved home a couple months before covid hit, thinking that it was going to be temporary. then i quickly saw how much help my mom needed which has increased in the \~15 months that have since passed. in my household, i am the only one working. my sister is unemployed (and not looking for a job) and my parents are both retired. i'm a teacher and have been in the classroom with students in person this whole school year and it has been a lot weighing on me to have this stressful job (also my first year as a teacher) and then come home to my family.i feel guilty for feeling this way but i just wish my life were different and that i could move out without feeling guilty. i love my mom so much and i love caring for her in the ways that i can because she has done so much for me and i feel like its all coming full circle now. but i feel stuck at home. i want to live with my friends and have my own space and have my own schedule and eat what i want for dinner and basically just have the independence back that i had before. i know things are obviously different now and i don't want to abandon my family. i know if i left it would be a lot harder on my dad but sometimes it feels like i just can't take any of it anymore. things with my mom are certainly extremely difficult but the hardest part of all of this is that its a package deal living with my dad and sister. has anyone else had to face this decision? a friend just asked me if i wanted to move in with her and i already said no last year in order to stay home. i just don't know how i feel about this and i want to make the right decision. i would still live close to home (prob no further than 20min by car) and could visit and come to help often. but i wouldn't be around for when she needs things in the middle of the night etc.", 28 is too young to be a carer to an older loved one. i have looked after my dad and my mam both with dementia it’s crushing work. i’m in therapy now to help me get my shattered brain and life back together. i’m older than you also with lots of life experience and happy memories of my younger years. go and make memories with life affirming activities and people that are nice to be around.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mjl7i1/do_i_move_out_or_stay_with_my_mom/,Do I move out or stay with my mom?
"my father started cognitive decline a few years ago. he was very neglectful and basically ignored my sister and i in favor of his wife’s kids. until he started to get bad and his wife left him. my sister and i are the only ones who have stepped up to care for him. he’s stubborn and won’t let anyone manage his finances, we spend hours helping him with various things only to discover he’s undid our work. after 3 years of caring for him im at the end of my rope. i went on antidepressants, i am in therapy. that didn’t stop me from having a full blown meltdown at work. they asked me to rake fmla to care for myself. less than one week into this my father had a massive heart attack so the entire “self care” break was spent in the hospital feeling massive anxiety and exhaustion. now he is facing round the clock care, and will probably run out of money before he dies. the money he left is was basically his olive branch because he knew he was a shitty dad. i was going to use the $ to get out of a job i loathe and go back to school to do what i’ve always wanted to. now he will die penniless and leave us nothing more than likely. i feel shallow for resenting him, for feeling transactional about it. but it’s deeper than that. when a parent has neglected you and then you find yourself caring for them when no one else will .. i honestly don’t know how to cope anymore. i am in an ocean of depression and anxiety and dread with  no end in sight"," oh my heart goes out to you. i second the vitamin d and also think that vitamin b drops sub-lingually might help. both of these i take in the morning. i also found that magnesium (chelated) in the evening helped for me and also my dad. he started getting it each afternoon abt 3 pm in the nursing home to help with his sundowners. he lived with us for 3 years before he ended up in the nursing home. hardest job to take care of him and the constant challenges. plus, my ptsd from growing up with a neglectful narcissistic dad was awful. i found a good therapist for that.please take care of yourself first and check into the services available for you and for him with the nearest area agency on aging. usually they have resources to help you as a caregiver, too. take as much help as you can get. you are not alone but i know it feels like you are. 💜",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mjkwxt/really_struggling_with_my_feelings/,Really Struggling with my Feelings
we put my mom into care two weeks ago and after a very rough start she is beginning to settle in a bit.  the people who work at her memory care center are wonderful.  i am asking those who have had family in care and also the caregivers- what are some good ways to show appreciation?  they work so hard.  thanks for any ideas.," there is no such thing as a ""natural"" caregiver. you are not born with the ability to be a caregiver; it is not an innate skill like walking or flying. you don't ""just know how to do it."" becoming a good caregiver is hard work, and most people need assistance and support in order to learn how to do it well.    tending to the needs of another person requires a large amount of patience, understanding, and sometimes self-sacrifice. it will be hard, but you can learn how to do it well. here's how:    learn your limits and be willing to ask for help. good caregivers know when they need help from others, whether it's emotional support, respite care (also called temporary care), or information about resources that can help them. don't let pride keep you from asking for what you need.    find out what works for you and for your loved one. some caregivers find that humor helps them cope; others need more practical help in dealing with their loved one's illness or behavior. the best way to learn what works is by trial and error; try different approaches until you find something that gives both of you relief from stress, improves the quality of life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mjgpul/how_do_you_show_appreciation_for_caregivers/,How do you show appreciation for caregivers?

"i (25) take care of my grandmother (83), who we think has mild to moderate dementia, essentially all by myself. she will not allow me or my mom to seek help for her memory issues though, and becomes enraged if you talk to her about it. but i initially moved in with her for a place to stay while i was going to college, but her health has gone downhill so rapidly that i decided to stay with her and care for her. during this time my depression has gotten much worse, and i have to really talk myself out of self harming, because no matter what i do for my grandmother she is never happy, and i’m almost always in some form of trouble with her. i feel like such a failure of an adult that i’m in a position that i’m financially dependent on her because i don’t make enough to live on my own, and i’m working on my masters degree, and if i were to move out the rest of my family would be disappointed in me for not taking on the task (more of a burden though) of caring for our family member. i just wish someone would help me with taking care of her, she’s too much for one person to handle 24/7. but we can’t afford to pay for a caregiver or a retirement home with a memory care unit. and my mom will only spend about an hour or two with her once a week before she gets tired of my grandmother’s behavior as well. anyways, my grandmother wanted easter at our house this weekend, and it’s been nothing but stress from being asked numerous times about the food, keys to the doors, to family spending the night, and the list goes on. after she made numerous worried phone calls because she couldn’t remember that easter is tomorrow and she couldn’t remember how long people were staying for, she then screamed at me and told me she was so embarrassed of me that she “could literally just die” because i did not greet my cousin and her kids exactly the way my grandmother wanted me to. and that she was never going to have easter at our house again, due to my actions (which was accidentally oversleeping this morning), so i don’t know why i even try anymore. i’m almost to the point where living in my car sounds better than living in this house with her. it makes me feel really bad because i do love her, but between the stress of my job, school, and my grandmother i’m finding very little reasons to continue on living. i’m just exhausted...", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mjb9zt/easter_weekend_and_depression/,Easter Weekend and Depression

"my gran was moved to a memory care facility last year. she lived with us since 2014. when we cleaned out her mil suite attached to our house, we were left with containers upon containers of shit just thrown together that we didn't have the brainpower to organize at that time. ""i'll get to that later"". well, those boxes are taking up 40 sq ft of space in your basement, and ""later"" is looking a lot more like ""soon"".it's silly to jump into it without a plan. so i made you a plan. i developed your method. you have one less thing to think about now in this emotionally taxing project. get your coffee, and read through this guide. you're going to freakin' conquer this. let's make sense out of that chaos.here we go!**determining the scope**take a gander at your stack of bins and boxes. take out each bin and rustle through it. focus on identifying what you’re going to be working with.example: for my gran, we had notes, paperwork, photographs, household items, “memories” (more on that later), and more fucking paperwork.**number your containers**this will save your ass later and help keep you organized. number each box and tub. physically. write on those things with a thick ass sharpie “tub” or “box” and then a number. it doesn’t matter where the box came from. it doesn’t matter what order they’re in. just as long as you establish inventory, you’ll be grand.example: i have tub #1—tub #5 and box #1—box #6**isolate one box &amp; make room**take out a container from the collection. place it in a comfortable spot where you have room to move around. you may be getting up and moving from place to place, so make sure your room is clean and clear of obstacles. a clean room is a must. put all the other containers in a separate area away from your organization room. trust me. if you look at it, it will only intimidate you.**establishing categories**you know the term “when organizing, never touch anything twice”? that’s bullshit in this kind of project. we are taking this rollercoaster in steps. the purpose of, what i call “round 1”, is to separate trash from the important stuff, and put ‘like with like’.you’re going to make an area, preferably with another big empty container, for each category. here are the categories that will mostly encompass everything you’re bound to find in the hoard of miscellaneous small belongings thrown together at the end of a clear out.memoriesphotographspaperworkpaper memories“i have no idea”trashlet me go over each category.""photographs"". every photograph you can imagine. even the printed ones. not the ones in frames. if you want to be really progressive, keep the polaroids seperate from anything else. the two types of chemicals used in the processing of the types of film degrades both of them. portraits, cat pictures, garden pictures, the literal only picture of your great grandfather. all of them.""memories"". these are objects, artwork, books, etc. anything a person keeps for any reason until they leave the earth. or your house. a lot of them are only sentimental to the individual and don’t mean much to you. don’t evaluate this concept yet. focus, remember your categories. move along.""paperwork"". this is the serious shit. your boxes will. will. have paperwork that you do not know if you should keep or not. place every 'document' that is professional correspondence, medical records, housing inspections, homeowners insurance, receipts, etc, into one designated ""paperwork"" box. don't stress yourself out wondering what it actually is and if you actually need to keep it just yet. just determine if it's administrative paperwork or ""paperwork memories"" and sort it first.""paperwork memories"". this can sometimes be easy to determine, and sometimes it can be difficult. because in my gran's final year or so living with us, she clipped everything out of the newspaper from articles on bird care (she has no bird) to saving full page advertisements. there was also a lot... and i mean a lot of notes that she wrote down from day to day that don't make a lick of sense. a grocery list. the word ""hair"". someone's phone number. the name ""nick"". the name ""lenore"". notes from my mother who was her primary caretaker. notes that say ""i'm going to the store. i will be back by 2pm. i love you."". if in doubt, keep it. and go through it later. but these are still paper memories and go in the ""paper memories"" box. this also includes stuff that is obviously important and needs to be stored like college diplomas, yearbook pages, letters from loved ones, cards, etc.""i have no idea"". you will come across some shit that's just... weird. like you really won't have a single idea what to do with it. make a box for your confusion and come back to it way later.“trash” is anything you determine to be trash. if you don't need it, and it doesn't tell a story or represent your mother, let it go. you might not want the scribblings of your parent in their decline of mental capability. you may want to hold onto those pieces a little bit longer. that is absolutely okay.**things you will need for sanity**you’re almost ready to go through your first container! you will need a couple of things to keep yourself organized.1. post-its (brand name. they stick much better)2. a couple of black sharpies. i say a couple because you will misplace it every single fucking time you put it down and you need to be able to pick up another while the first one is probably sitting under a pile of crap.3. buy at least 3 boxes of sandwich baggies (sealable) and 4 boxes of freezer baggies (gallon).4. a notebook on a clipboard and a hoard of pens.5. trash bags. get the good brand.6. white mailing labels.7. file folders8. scotch tape**opening pandora’s box**once you have all of your supplies within arm’s or leg’s reach, your organization room is clear, you have one container, and you’ve had your coffee… put on a playlist. pro tip: nothing sappy or sad. one sad tune is enough to keep you tunneled on a certain object for way too long and emotionally exhaust you enough to cut your organization day short.open the box. take a breath.when you come across any of these things, grab a gallon baggie, slap a blank mailing label on it, and grab a sharpiephotographs or polaroidsadmin paperworkpaper memoriesexample: baggie labeled “tub #1 – photographs” or “tub #1 – admin paperwork”**the bulky important paperwork**this is something i learned the hard way. you’re going to come across certain things that take you a couple of minutes to figure out. and they will be bulky, but skirt the line between important admin paperwork and memories.for example: i found scatters of 400 pages of my gran’s book she published in 1998. it took me a good minute to accumulate all of the pages. and they just kept showing up in boxes. for like 3 days, that manuscript was its own category. i threw them all together in the end with the “paper memories” category.**label. all. non-obvious. items.**the term “when organizing, you should touch everything only once”, has a more important mental and psychological message, which is “when organizing, you should determine what something is, only once”.that folder in tub #3 that just says “west palm beach”. at first glance, you don’t know exactly what’s in that thing. could be anything, really. so take a look inside. grab a pen and a notebook on a clipboard. write down the contents of the folder.for example: on my notebook, the “west palm beach” folder had homeowners insurance, property tax assessments, receipts, email correspondences, inspection reports, final floorplan, and a couple of other things i don’t really remember.grab a post-it note, or a piece of paper big enough to tape onto the outside of the folder. write down, in sharpie, on the note, the contents of what is in that folder.why: when you go through the collection’s stack of paperwork during “round 2”, you won’t have to spend critical time and energy determining the contents of every folder. when you have big bold labels on stuff, you’re saving your brain from expending energy doing critical thinking later on. you really don’t want to have to pick up the same stack of “west palm beach” 3 times, and every time having to flip through it to figure out the contents. do the dirty work the first time, and you will save yourself the trouble later.**use those baggies!**so many things can fit into baggies!

"hi everyone,throwaway account because i don't want this linked with my main account for privacy reasons.so, my (38f) father (85) has been living in a nursing home (specific for alzheimer's) since november 2019. caring for him was impossible at home, my mom was his caregiver and she couldn't take it any longer. he was much happier at the nursing home than at his own home, always in a good mood, he thrived. this is, until covid came. then, basically the whole nursing home caught it, he had mild symptoms but i feel that the isolation and the temporary stop to services like therapy and stuff really made the disease worse faster than it would have been otherwise. also, he was still recognizing us in february 2020, then not anymore after covid, at least not constantly. so, covid robbed me of that.his condition worsened slowly, until last tuesday they admitted him in the hospital for labored breathing. they sent him back to the nursing home, since the only available therapy seems to be hydration and oxygen (sorry english is not my main language, and i'm a bit confused, i hope it makes sense). basically, he's dying. despite covid, they suggested us to go visit in person, they didn't say it out loud but it's clear our visit's purpose is to say goodbye.i went to visit, he's unconscious and breaths very heavily, if i didn't know it was him i wouldn't have recognized him. he's so different from the last time i saw him in person (a month ago, more or less).my feeling are mixed, my relationship with him was always so difficult, he was abusive towards my mother (even if in subtle ways and doing things that were accepted as normal 50 years ago). i'm sad, but deep down i think my feelings should be stronger. i'm waiting for the news, and i don'd feel dread at the thought. i feel like the inevitable is happening. i'm calm, i function almost normally. i have been grieving for the last two years and this feels like the end that was supposed to be from the beginning. i hate that he has alzheimer's, i hate that we never spoke about our differences, that our conflicts never went away and he just faded away with no resolution. i guess i'm not hating that he's dying. all of this is just awful. sorry, i think i just needed to get this out of my chest to strangers.&amp;#x200b;tl;dr: my father with alzheimer's is dying and i needed to vent"," i’m sorry that your father sounds like yes he’s dying as you say. do try to talk about your feelings more with family and friends and therapist if possible. it’s going to be your own journey of coming to your own peace and resolution about him. i know it’s more complicated when you have a parent with dementia who was also not such a nice person. i’m living that now parenting a mother with dementia that was abusive towards me all my life. i care and look after her as i would anyone who is vulnerable. but it’s not easy, those emotions are so conflicting then people also assume your grieving the loss of a father that they assume you love so much. so you nod, say thankyou and grieve in your own unique way. you’re grieving for so much more than anyone could ever understand. the loss of a parent that could have done better. the loss of the hope that things could have changed or atleast an acknowledgment that they weren’t the best.if you feel it could help you to write a long letter to your dad and maybe put it with him when he is laid to rest. just an idea. you have so much you need to say maybe not to him since he’s not able to respond 🙏🏼 may you have peace in your heart and the ability to let go and forgive in time. death is such an equaliser for us all",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mifv17/my_father_is_dying/,My father is dying
"i just posted about finding photos of my family cut up and shoved into plastic bags in her belongings.she went to live in a memory care facility about a year ago after it was evident that she needed to be watched absolutely full time and have skilled nurses around full time who know how to restrain her.gran started believing she was still in college when she was still living with us. she used to ask us what time lecture was today, and would ask if we read the assigned texts. we would of course play along for the time.the problem started when we would need to give her medicine. it was actually a little bit cute. she said she felt so wrong taking drugs from her sorority sisters, but if we promised not to tell her boyfriend, she would take it. this only worked for a couple of times before she absolutely refused to take the pills. she would have triggers, where she would get a small realization of reality, and then have a psychotic life threatening breakdown. this happened 4 times before we took her to 'her dorm' (the memory care facility). we would visit her every couple of weeks, but every time we came, she would snap into 'reality' so hard that it would leave her in a state of absolute inconsolable crisis and eventual full blown psychosis.the head of the facility gave us a call and had a heart to heart with us that we ultimately understood. they said that seeing us tears her away from her delusion, which is the only place in her life that she believes is comfortable. they said that when they have to sedate her after our visits trigger psychosis, the medicine puts her life at risk. we came to the agreement that having us visit her is putting her through unfathomable stress and that we should only visit when things are dire. i thought i had come to terms with my grandmother not knowing that i exist. i didn't think that being seen by her would threaten her life.losing a parent/grandparent is hard. but this is one cruel experience for all of us."," hi friend. i'm really sorry you are going through this. i'd like to commiserate with you. we placed my dad in memory care a month and a half ago. after a couple awful visits (dad crying and saying we abandoned him) and some candid conversations with the care staff they have recommended we no longer visit him. he has been doing quite well adjusting, never asks about us, never asks to go home, he doesn't know how to use a phone so we definitely don't get phone calls. i think he just doesn't know we exist until he sees us in person and this breaks his current ""reality"". after the first awful visit it started my wondering if we'd ever be able to visit. i've been expecting this but perhaps not this soon. i'm really sorry and i'm here to chat, if you need. i find talking to others who have been through this is really the only respite. it's so unbelievably painful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/midwpw/i_cannot_see_my_gran_in_her_memory_care_facility/,I cannot see my Gran in her memory care facility anymore.

"today, a visiting nurse came to see my grandma to check on her overall health. my dad, and my grandma's in-home caregiver were there. the nurse checked on grandma's bed sores, medications, and overall home safety. after her visit, she called me, and told me she felt it wasn't safe for grandma to be at home by herself. finally. someone friggin' understands.i've been telling my dad for months and months that it's not safe for grandma to be in her house by herself. he kept arguing saying that if we get grandma more help she's gonna get mad and nasty at us. but now, there's a nurse actually telling us that it's time to either get grandma a 24/7 caregiver or to get her into memory care. and we can't argue! cause if we don't get her help, we could get in big trouble.when i told my dad what the nurse said, i think it finally sunk in. i told him that if the nurse makes an aps report, that police could get involved and something seemed to click. he's still scare grandma's going to throw a huge fit, but i told him it doesn't matter how mad she gets. it's not safe for her to be in that house alone.i've already been reaching out to memory care facilities near her home, so now it's just a matter of filling out applications and planning the transition.i feel so validated today, and such a huge relief that someone understands and is listening. and grandma's going to be somewhere with people who can help her 24/7. help her take her meds, help her take a bath, keep her company when she gets lonely. and she's going to be safe.", safety first!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mi62s9/finally_someone_understands_and_is_listening_to_me/,"Finally, someone understands and is listening to me."

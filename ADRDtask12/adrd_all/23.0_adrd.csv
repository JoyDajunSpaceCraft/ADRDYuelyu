"hello all,my dad(80) and step-mom(75) left yesterday for an 8 day vacation that we were concerned about, but hopeful they would enjoy. my step-mom has been having various levels of mania for a year and has had the focus of most of our attention. my dad was diagnosed with early-stage alzheimers last august, just before she started having manic episodes. (her breakdown was definitely partially due to his diagnosis. )my dads license was taken in january and he’s really upset. thinks he had another 5 years of driving in him. i saw things that made me nervous for several years and there have been lapses in memory, moments of confusion, and stories that he is sure happened but definitely didn’t. however, for the most part, our conversations are pretty cogent. my question is this. how much is he pulling himself together when he’s talking with me? i see or talk to him about every three or four days. it’s usually pretty surface stuff, but i saw him on friday for several hours, and honestly he was so with it i questioned us having his license pulled.  he was navigating the grocery store, having a nuanced discussion about how to handle covid, talking about my dog. all kinds of stuff but he was completely there. this, as opposed to what my step-mom is telling me. they are coming back home tonight. a little more than 24 hours after they left. her story is that he was yelling at her while driving that she’s going the wrong way, couldn’t sleep in the bed because it’s too firm to the point that they woke the air bnb staff to get a cot at 4am, which he also didn’t like. and he wanted to come home. talking to her was a tour-de-force of lost dreams today that they will never be able to travel. their vacation was ruined because his disease is so bad he needs to be in his own space or it’s too upsetting for him. all of this seems very plausible. we were preparing to meet them at their home to help them unpack and kind of deal emotionally with the loss of this trip. which is hard to do because they get mad at us if we imply they are incapable of things or having any issues. then i called my dad. we had a completely calm conversation. the beds were too hard, so they’re coming home. he wanted to go on to their second destination, but my step-mom didn’t and he does what the boss wants. no anger. no depression. everything is fine. at this point i don’t know if they will get home just fine, or i’ll be driving three hours to help them navigate home. i don’t know if my dad is really slipping like my stepmom keeps saying or if her mania is the problem. they’ve got me so confused i’m not even sure if my dads license should have been pulled. maybe the stories she was telling didn’t really happen?tl;dr:how much can a persons behavior swing between there and not there? my dad seems very with it compared to the stories i’m hearing from his wife.", i have no experience of your step-moms situation but my dad was diagnosed 10 years ago. he can still hold a decent conversation but on the other hand he doesn't recognise his home of the last 20 years. i hope you are able to support them both going forward.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/h93tkk/how_wide_is_the_range_of_mental_functioning/,How wide is the range of mental functioning??
the doctor told dad that it was alzheimer’s and that was it. so what happens next? she knows who we all are but gets us mixed up. she has been showing signs of su downing for a couple of years and has been doubly incontinent for about a year but is mostly lucid.so what happens next? i’m just reeling currently and want to support a dad but i don’t know how., remember to give yourself time to adjust to this new reality. teepa snow on youtube is a good resource to start watching.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/h93di8/mum_just_diagnosed_whats_next/,Mum just diagnosed.

"my father has several underlying conditions, was prescribed several medications, and all of a sudden had an event in april where he was suddenly confused and we took him to the ed.  he was admitted and then we were told he had hospital delirium.  they could not determine cause, then finally after a few days he had a pet scan which showed only mild onset of alzheimers.  we were told because of his high intelligence that he has been hiding it for years. two months ago he was correcting my math on a bill, and only showed normal type of older age forgetfulness.  within 1 week of his diagnosis he was showing more typical signs of alzheimer's but it was like we lost him in a week.  he was put on haldol to calm him and now he only has some moments of lucidity.  he has been declining rapidly. has anyone had any experience with misdiagnosis, or conversely such a rapid switch from normal to full on alzheimer's, within the course of a couple of weeks?", i highly recommend you watch [this video]( teepa snow is amazing and addresses the problem of misdiagnosed dementia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/h8ghaz/possible_misdiagnosis/,Possible misdiagnosis?
my wife father has alzheimer’s for the better part of 2 years before covid 19 we would let him walk on his own everyday without a problem. due to living in ny and him residing in a hot spot area of covid 19 infections. we felt it was best to keep him and avoid him getting sick but it’s become increasingly hard to keep him still and understanding won’t listen to reason or sense . thinks the virus is a lie and a joke and won’t wear a mask or respect or understand the reasons of social distancing . how do i go about trying to help him understand the reason of protecting him ?, it’s not media he has become very delusional over what is right from wrong . it doesn’t help that the sun is out early in the morning and you can hear and see the kids playing in their yards. that is what makes him sense or think that we are down grading the issue . it makes it hard keeping a constant vigilance over him because he requires to much attention and since  i work i really can’t be around him as much because i really don’t want to expose him in and kind of been exhausted.  my concerns are just trying to find a method that can keep him calm and collective but he doesn’t like to read or help at his home and when he was perfectly healthy he hand the mentality of dictator at best . so it’s a struggle  i just need some form of way to get through him or find him a hobby which he can pay attention. to instead of trying to run out the house at 5 am and causing problems,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/h89hrr/father_in_law_wont_understand_he_cant_go_outside/,Father in law won’t understand he can’t go outside
"hi reddit,my grandparents are stuck with us because of covid-19 and have been in the us since february (they live in mexico). they were staying with my aunt up north and recently came down to try to get back home. they have been staying with us for a couple of weeks, and it is so tough watching my grandmother. she is in mid to late stages of alzheimer's, and it deeply saddens me. she looks for my grandfather when he is right next to her and very visible. when she goes to the rr, she can't find the toilet, forgets to wipe and wash her hands. she forgets she eats right after she eats. she wakes up distressed, trying to figure out where she is and who the heck is around. she's clueless a lot of the times and doesn't notice when people get home or when they are speaking to her. she doesn't remember who i am, or who her children are. when she speaks to us, she mostly thinks she's speaking to strangers. i don't know how to deal with this. i apologize if this sounds rude or something; i have never been in this situation. throughout my years of studying psychology, i have learned a lot about alzheimer's but never had to witness it firsthand. i am afraid of what's to come as i know that it only gets worse from here. i wonder if she knows she's a little lost or if they lose that part of themselves too. i wonder how much it tears her children apart (my mother and aunt included) if it's affecting me too. they are much closer to her."," your mum and aunt will be incredibly sad as this disease makes you watch as your loved one slips away from you whilst still being there. i have found the easiest thing for me is to grieve for my parent, its not a perfect solution, i still get very angry/sad, but it does help me to process and get through each day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/h80j9y/grandmother_with_alzheimers/,Grandmother with Alzheimer's

have a newly diagnosed parent. my elder sibling has her reasons for wanting to stay at a remove from the day-to-day realities of caring for the parent. she lives on the other side of the country and i doubt she's going to be involved to a great degree.i am more than likely going to shoulder the caring as much as i can. but i'm concerned that my sibling is already angling to get power of attorney and i think this could cause problems in future and i feel like it's not fair to claim that influence if you're leaving the consequences of decisions (relating to healthcare etc) to someone else? feel very alone and overwhelmed with worry at the moment. any advice appreciated., power of attorney can be just a notarized form your parent signs.  just go get poa first it takes like 15 minutes. get financial and medical.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/h77o1e/worried_that_my_sibling_is_looking_for_power_of/,Worried that my sibling is looking for power of attorney but has no intention of being there to care.

"as seen in [psychology today](in the popular imagination, alzheimer’s disease (ad) is primarily a disorder that affects short-term memory, but it is a far more serious condition than many acknowledge. ad is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive and functional deficits that can also impact behavior and personality. in the early stages of the disease, behavioral changes may include irritability, apathy, and anxiety. in later stages, those who suffer from ad may become increasingly aggressive, restless, anxious, and even suffer from delusions.alzheimer’s is not only a progressively debilitating disease but is, unfortunately, becoming more common. a [2019]( report released by the alzheimer’s association notes that an estimated 5.8 million americans are living with ad-related dementia in 2019 and that the disease affects one in ten individuals over the age of 65. this includes 3 percent of people between the ages of 65 and 74, 17 percent of people ages 75 to 84, and almost one-third (32 percent) of individuals over the age of 85. according to the [national institute on aging]( it is the most common cause of dementia among older americans and the sixth-leading cause of death in the u.s. it is the[ fifth-leading cause of death]( among americans older than 65 and afflicts [women]( far more often than men.though the prevalence of ad among seniors is not on the rise, the number of people suffering from the affliction is expected to increase as members of the baby boomer generation enter their sunset years. furthermore, many believe that it is irreversible. however, new research may indicate that there is a line of defense that will at least help prevent ad from developing.**what alzheimer’s disease does to the brain**ad affects the connections between the cells in the brain, which are known as neurons. when these networks are disrupted, individual neurons begin to lose functionality, lose connectivity with other neurons, and eventually die.typically, the first part of the brain to be affected by the disease is the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, two regions associated with the creation and storage of memory. recent episodic memories are typically the first to be impacted by the disease, with more distant memories remaining unadulterated until subsequent stages of the disease.as ad progresses, it will also affect the cerebral cortex, which is the area of the brain responsible for language, problem-solving, praxis, planning, and organization. consequently, it may become difficult for individuals with ad to perform tasks that require concentration, visuospatial skills, or abstract thinking, and it may be very difficult for them to live independently. as the disease progresses, more parts of the brain become affected, thereby making it virtually impossible to live without constant supervision. ultimately, it is fatal.these connections are not merely disrupted due to old age. researchers hypothesize that neural networks are gradually bogged down by a buildup of proteins in the brain. one of these proteins, known as beta-amyloid, begins to collect between neurons, thereby disrupting communication between the cells. beta-amyloid is a naturally occurring protein that is derived from the cellular metabolism (technically known as the proteolytic cleavage) of a larger protein known as amyloid precursor protein \[app\], which is responsible for performing a range of neuronal activities. amyloid deposition oftentimes begins [20 years]( prior to the first clinical symptoms of ad.another protein, tau, normally facilitates the exchange of nutrients and other molecules between neurons by strengthening [microtubules]( which play a key role in the intracellular transport of materials. in brains with ad, these tau proteins begin to bind together in abnormal patterns, creating what are known as neurofibrillary tangles. these tangles block the flow of molecules between neurons. research suggests that the buildup of beta-amyloid proteins is a precursor to these neurofibrillary tangles, though it is not the sole precursor, as such tangles are not exclusive to ad.in healthy brains, microglia, a type of glial cell, clear out waste from the brain. this includes excess beta-amyloid and tau proteins. as the brain becomes increasingly cluttered with buildups of beta-amyloid and tau proteins, however, microglia can’t do their job. when microglia fail to do their job, the brain releases another type of glial cell (which are known as astrocytes) to get rid of the plaque. they too get bogged down by the plaque and release chemicals that lead to inflammation. this can also lead to vascular problems within the brain.**what causes the plaque associated with alzheimer’s disease to form?**there are a variety of factors that influence beta-amyloid plaque growth. on the one hand, the heritability of ad is considered to be between 60 percent and 80 percent, largely due to genetic variation. when the gene [trem2]( functions improperly due to mutation, for example, it can inhibit microglia from effectively clearing the brain of excess beta-amyloid proteins, which, in turn, can set in motion a chain of events leading to ad. the e4 allele of the [apoe gene]( as another example, is associated with the increased presence of amyloid plaque in the brain. mutations in the [app gene]( may produce similar phenomena.while it is doubtless that genetics does play a role in the development of ad, several new studies have indicated that a diet high in sugar and simple carbohydrates can also affect the probability that one will be afflicted by the disease. more studies will have to be conducted to determine to what extent diet influences the development of the disease — if diet can independently trigger ad or if diet only compounds hereditary risks associated with ad.there are numerous types of proteins that work in conjunction and clear the brain of debris — including dead or damaged cells, foreign material, or the tangles and beta-amyloid buildup described above. in some cases, diet has an influence on how effective some of these proteins can be. this correlation became clear as researchers found that patients with diabetes are more likely to develop ad.in some circles, ad has become known as “type 3” diabetes because of how common it is that individuals with chronically high blood sugar develop late-onset ad. a longitudinal [study ]( in the journal diabetologia in 2018 followed 5,189 people in the united kingdom over the course of a decade and found that this is true for all diabetics. people with type 2 diabetes and people with type 1 diabetes are more likely to develop ad than those who do not have insulin problems. the study’s author,[ zheng et al]( wrote that “memory, executive function, and orientation z scores showed an increased rate of cognitive decline with diabetes.”a[ study]( conducted by melissa schilling of new york university found that the link between diabetes and ad is not due to insulin problems per se, but due to the enzyme that breaks down insulin in the bloodstream, aptly known as insulin-degrading enzyme \[ide\], also helps break up clumps of beta-amyloid proteins in the brain. this would explain why an individual with type 1 diabetes, who does not make enough of the enzyme in the first place, and an individual with type 2 diabetes, who often ends up with excess insulin in the blood, both have a higher risk of developing ad. as schilling writes, “if ide preferentially targets insulin and insulin levels are outpacing ide production, ide’s ability to breakdown other amyloidogenic proteins will be markedly reduced.” on top of affecting diabetics, the phenomenon could also impact individuals who are prediabetic, i.e. those who have a glucose intolerance caused by chronically high levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia).given that most [non-diabetic]( instances of hyperglycemia are associated with a diet that is high in sugars and simple carbohydrates, and that hyperglycemia is associated with increased amyloid deposits in the brain, it stands to reason that diet can play a role in the development of ad. zheng et. al have found that efforts to control blood sugar levels may prevent brain function decline. “future studies are required to determine the long-term effects of maintaining optimal glucose control on cognitive decline in people with diabetes,” they [wrote]( “our findings suggest that interventions that delay diabetes onset, as well as management strategies for blood sugar control, might help alleviate the progression of subsequent cognitive decline over the long-term.”these findings suggest that the rise in the prevalence of ad and the increase in the number of individuals with diabetes are related, and that the primary mechanism driving both trends is a diet that is frequently associated with hyperglycemia, which, in turn, inhibits ide from naturally breaking down both insulin and beta-amyloid proteins in the brain. though more research is necessary to better support these findings, they present yet another reason why people should avoid a diet that is high in sugar and simple carbohydrates. diets that contain whole grains, lean meats, fish, green leafy vegetables, and fruits keep blood sugar levels from spiking, on top of providing the body with the necessary vitamins, minerals, and fiber it needs to stay healthy. while there is no one singular diet that is ideal for everyone, eating meals comprised of mostly non-processed foods like those described above are preferable to meals consisting of starches, sugars, refined flours, and additives.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/gneh74/alzheimers_disease_or_type_3_diabetes_alzheimers/,Alzheimer’s Disease or Type 3 Diabetes: Alzheimer’s is not only a debilitating

"how do you deal with poop?ive been caring for my father 5 years. i told myself that i was willing to do it until he forgets who i am and i become overwhelmed w poop.the poop thing is happening now. i got him reusable diapers, which i have a system for cleaning and don't mind washing.what i cannot cope with is poop on the bathroom floor, on his shoes, on the kitchen floor, smushed in the the carpet, in the light switch, on his pants sitting on the couch, everywhere. he tries to clean it it up, so it isn't obvious sometimes. like today, i saw the lightswitch was smeared in it but i hadn't seen it at first because he wiped it off - but only superficially.help!this might be my breaking point, unless i can find a way to manage. i won't put him in a home during covid or when i can't visit him, but the poop everywhere thing  (only started the last week or two) is too much."," my girlfriend mother lives with us and she start having similar issues as well. we had to assist her when this would take place. being that she wouldn't alert us when she had to use the bathroom, we had locked it an told her to contact us as soon as you need to go.  we also set an alarm by the door in case it wasn't locked so we could be notified. we also use onesies so she couldn't disturb anything down there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/gmefhf/poop/,POOP

"hi all, i’m new to this community, as my 76 year old best friend is in the beginning stages of either alzheimers or dementia (i’m not sure which, he had some type of diagnosis late last year).he looks to me often for tech related help and in the past i’ve helped with his printer, online banking, etc. lately he’s been struggling with his flip phone. the problem is, i just spent almost the entire day trying to teach him how to delete text messages from his phone. there are 5 buttons to press in total. however we have been repeating this explanation for almost the entire day and it isn’t sticking, which is totally out of character for him. we wrote it down. we made a jingle. nothing. i have known him for 6 years and i’ve never seen him struggle even remotely close to today. now i am trying to prep for the future. going forward, what is the best way to help him without getting frustrated with him or making him feel stupid? he is a tremendously smart guy and otherwise hasn’t really shown signs of deep trouble yet, but i want to make sure he isn’t demoralized and i want to be the best help that i can. are there any resources for helping someone to re learn ? tl;dr struggling with remembering how to do certain tasks, how do i help re-teach calmly and efficiently?"," one thing that occurred to me after i logged off last night is you should try to find out his situation regarding paying bills. does he have children who can step in and handle that? does he have a power of attorney set up so someone in his life can handle his finances? if he can't delete text messages, things like paying online bills, then paying regular bills, are going to fall apart. and that might be followed by avoidant behaviors - just not paying taxes because it's too confusing, instead of getting help with them. and eventually not getting the mail, or not opening it, because it's overwhelming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/glrscp/early_stages_and_relearning_tasks/,Early stages and re-learning tasks

"hey everyone. i’m in nyc. so, this past thursday my mom had some sort of episode- her demeanor seemed more off lately, and at one point she sort of slid from sitting on her bed onto to floor- no injuries thank god, but she had no strength/willingness to be helped back into bed. we sat with her for a good 30 mins before she felt able to get up. once she was back in bed, she ate, drank water, and seemed to bounce back to her former self. over the past couple of days though, she has been a lot more out of touch- doesn’t know where she is, she’s very scared, etc- and most importantly she has started wandering. 3 am today, she walked out the front door trying to find her mom’s house. her mom’s house is back in england, her mom passed 2 years ago. when she had that episode on thursday, we were torn about calling an ambulance- our thinking was, if she absolutely needs one, we’ll call, but if she goes to the e.r. now, she’ll be exposed to the virus, and she is definitely in a high risk group. we called her neurologist, but while i did get to talk to him, his offices are closed and he agrees she does need to be examined in person. we are currently trying to get an appointment with her gp. to add to all this, she is illegal- no ssn, no medical coverage at all. we’ve been paying everything out of pocket which is fine, but when we’re discussing the real possibility that a home might end up being our last resort, there is no way for us to pay that sort of bill. so, as of right now, we (her kids, there are 4 of us but one is completely ignoring the situation) are being there for her around the clock- this is only possible right now because we’re all either working from home or have minimal schedules. i don’t have a clue how this will work when things return to normal. so, i don’t have a specific question really, just wondering if anyone had anything they could suggest regarding any of this. thanks."," yes, check uti! we had a woman missed diagnosed as dementia but it was a uti, also dehydration and blood pressure, best",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ge242s/bad_situation_any_advice_appreciated/,"Bad situation, any advice appreciated"

"hi all, i apologize in advance for the length of this post. i’m really at my wits end. i’m worried about my mental health. my mother is in the late stages of alzheimer’s, has breast cancer and is now bed-bound. my father is in the early stages of dementia and his behavioral changes have gotten to the point where i honestly just throw up my hands and give up some days. i need to find a way to get his driver’s license taken. i’m in my 20s, 6 months pregnant, an only child, and both my parents are in their 70s. i have taken on all of their responsibilities, while struggling to work and maintain my own. whenever my phone rings, it’s about them (doctors, banks, whatever). i feel like i have no life anymore, my existence is just to make sure they’re okay. i’ve have people tell me that i shouldn’t have gotten pregnant, that i don’t need to worry about my baby, that my parents are my number one priority, it goes on. it seems as though i’m not supposed to live my life and enjoy it. i understand being a caregiver is a lot to say the very least, but sometimes i just want to feel like a 20-something who is enjoying her first pregnancy and not like someone much much older with two elderly parents in various states of decline. i turned my phone off today so i could just have a little break. i turned my phone on to talk to my boyfriend for a few minutes, not even 15 mins into the call, someone was calling about making an appointment for my mom. i just burst into tears (pregnancy hormones factor into this as well, i guess), because it never stops. i can’t get a day, let alone a few moments just for me, for a mental health break. six years ago my parents decided to move to a town where we have no family or friends. last august i had to move to this town too in order to take care of them. i hate it here. i have no friends here, no family and my boyfriend is back home in miami. with this virus going on, he can’t come and be with me. i’m lonely, angry, frustrated, and have started having panic attacks again. none of that is good for my baby. yet no one seems to care that i am at a breaking point. my parents gave me a great life and i love them, but there were two of them to take care of me. i’m just one person. it doesn’t help when my parents’ friends call me to talk about how “it will get better”. no it won’t. it’s like they don’t understand that alzheimer’s disease and other dementias get progressively worse. i want to tell them to shut up and leave me alone if they’re going to come at me with the bs. when do i get to live my life? by the time my parents were my age, both had traveled around the world and were well into their careers. i don’t know what to do anymore. i’m not living, i’m just existing for my parents. i feel like i’m out in the middle of the ocean barely treading water. thank you so much for reading and for any advice. i really appreciate it 💜"," if your father has been diagnosed, you can call his doctor and request that they notify the secretary of state (if you're in the us) about suspending or revoking his driver's license. if that isn't a possibility, you can report him yourself to the sos. when my mother got her suspension letter in the mail, it did not specify who reported her, and it gave her 30 days i think it was to contest it by scheduling a road test. i don't know the road test rules for contesting it during the pandemic, but i'm sure you could call or email and ask. or ... just report and see what happens. do you have an advanced directive for your mother for medical decisions? what about for your father? my mother's specifies that she didn't want extraordinary measures to prolong her life if she was both mentally and physically incapacitated. we just went through setting up hospice for her and triggering a dnr order. one thing that surprised me was that hospice costs are covered for her under medicare. i feel a little weird bringing this up because i posted about hospice another time kind of recently in this forum - but we're going through this right now, so it's on my mind. but if your mom has breast cancer, you'll be making a decision, if you haven't already, about if you want to treat that aggressively, or switch to hospice and just keeping her comfortable at this point. if the money is an issue and you do decide not to treat the cancer, hospice might be the affordable (free) and compassionate option for some in home care, and you'll need some of that while you are dealing with your own pregnancy and birth. plus hospice workers, unlike some other in home care givers, i think are better at being a support system for you. and it sounds like you could really use some of that right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/gd03os/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,I don’t know what to do anymore
"hello friends, my dad has alzheimer's and seems to be advancing pretty rapidly. my mom has been my dad's caretaker but i know it's burning her out. a couple things i'm looking for help on; we need some kind of tracking device for my dad for when/if he wanders away. i've seen plenty of watches but my biggest concern with any kind of wearable is getting him to wear it. it doesn't help much if he walks away without the watch or other wearable on. i've seen the tracking soles for shoes but it needs charging almost everyday. thoughts on what works well and how to get them to wear it?the other thing i'm looking for guidance on is how to find out what kind of assistance my parents qualify for. my dad was a 9/11 first responder and is part of the long-term study so i've asked my mom to mention it at his next check-up. but i'm curious about who i should contact to get more info on financial assistance for long-term care. thank you in advance!"," there are aging and disability resource centers or departments of aging in the states. look online for these, they have a lot of information about benefits. also health and human service centers will have information available about area specific resources you can use. a lot of churches have information about community options available. there is more than you think out there that have information available to help your mom out with burn out. if you have family to reach out to that can come “spend time” with your dad so your mom can have a break once in a while could also be an option.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/gcffew/resources_for_longterm_care/,Resources for long-term care

"hello all,i just joined this subreddit in need of some advise. my grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimer’s in 2003 and we’ve watched her condition deteriorate for years now. she lived in our home from about 2008-2013. she’s in an assisted living home now and my mom would visit her every day before the lockdown order. today we got the news that my grandma has been diagnosed with covid-19. i’m doing the best i can to try and console my mom and tell her that it’ll all be okay. as her daughter, my mom still wishes that she was able to do more for her. i understand where she’s coming from, but she couldn’t put her family’s life on a 100% hold. we made some serious lifestyle sacrifices when she was living with us, and although it was a lot, my mom just wishes she had done more. i don’t know what to do. i’m very saddened by this news. i know i won’t be able to say goodbye in person and let go. she lived with us when i was a preteen so i regret a lot of the angst-fueled conflict that i propagated, but i’ve come to terms with the fact that i won’t be able to really apologize and let go in person. my mom on the other hand is devastated and i just have nothing positive to say because she’s convinced herself she hasn’t done enough. can someone please offer advice on anything i can say to her?"," i sympathize with you! taking care of a family member with alzheimer’s is difficult and heartbreaking.just tell your mom you are proud of the sacrifices she made and make sure to listen to her. tell stories or ask about how your grandma was in a certain situation or memory. telling stories always helps my mom deal with her pain of losing my grandma to this disease. remind her she has done a lot and that you know grandma loves and appreciates everything she’s done, whether or not she was able to show it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/gc9yml/how_to_console_my_mom/,How to console my mom
"so my dad died yesterday on the age of 53 to this terrible disease. i've posted bere before, but he got the diagnosis on the age of 49. it went downhill so fast for the past months, it's actually insane.right before covid-19 went full force here we put my dad in a care-facility since it just didn't work anymore at home with 3 kids. it was a blessing and a curse, since he could get the treatment he needed there, eventhough we weren't able to visit him.last sunday he came home to start his final journey (thank god for progressive euthanasia laws here), and he passed away easily in his sleep.our journey ends here, for now that is, since the disease runs in the family at an early age. my uncle had ad as well, but he isn't declining as fast as my dad did, and of course there is the fact that me and my sibling have a 50/50 chance of becoming sick in our early 50's. thanks everyone for the loving words and support the past years, and may your journey with this awful disease end as easily as it did for us.love you all!", so very sorry for your loss.  i just lost my mom to this monster a few weeks ago.  take care of yourself.  you did a good job.  i pray you don't get it later.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/gc51ch/our_journey_is_over/,Our journey is over
"my older neighbors who we've lived alongside for 30 years usually go out for dinner and often had company and family over before their kids' jobs took them out of the area. the wife has been declining over the past couple years, and increasingly doesn't think the house they live in is theirs, thinks there is company over even when they don't have it, gets all dressed up thinking they are going out when quite obviously they aren't bc of the covid-19 closures. if he's in their garage or out getting groceries, she wanders around the house and yard looking for them, and we can often hear her screaming at him about things. he himself is ok mind-wise, but neither of them are 'doctor' people. they are stubborn and used to often say that seeing doctors regularly wasn't all it is cracked up to be. we share a yard, and when she sees us out, she often comes over to vent and complain that husband is being grumpy or won't let her leave so they can go back to her house, or talk about how nice her house is, the people who own it must be really neat. today she came over and was literally on the verge of tears because they were arguing and she was so frustrated. i could hear her screaming ""i""m leaving"" over and over... and then she was outside the door to their empty locked garage, pleading with anyone for a ride to take her home. this went on for about 2 hours over the course of the afternoon. is there anything we can say to her when she comes over to help calm her down at least? i know it's not our place to interfere, and her family needs to act to help her out, but it is really crushing my family to see her like this, we don't know what to do. i don't know if a ""oh, that's your house, you live there"" would confuse her even more or not."," you definitely can try changing the subject with her or go along with it. you said their adult children moved away. there is a very good chance their kids don’t know what’s going on or how bad. i know that older couples are often afraid to tell their kids about any deficiencies in health or mobility for fear they will be put in a nursing home. you should try to contact one of their kids or some other relative if possible. you also may want to contact adult protective services if you can’t get a hold of a family member. this isn’t easy for anyone to witness the mental decline of someone they’ve known for a long time, it’s nice that you are there and aware and concerned for their welfare.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/gbqnlu/please_help_with_my_neighbor/,Please help with my neighbor

"my husband of 30 years is in the hospital because he had fallen a week ago and broke his hip. i was just in the kitchen and he got up from his chair like he’s done a million times and he just fell and broke his hip. his dementia is due to severe liver cirrhosis with the fluid ascites build up, the diuretics can’t pump it out fast enough anymore and the hospital can’t drain it out it out enough anymore. he’s in the hospital and he has his cellphone and he remembers how to call me. he calls me all night telling me the dr cut his leg off, but he had a partial hip replacement last week when he was admitted to the hospital. he’s telling me he was kidnapped and being held at a gas station in elkhart. he grew up in elkhart indiana but we live in michigan now. the hospital will not let me see him due to coronavirus. this past year he’s been very delusional, sometimes he just sounds like his old self and other times he’s just extremely delusional. i was talking care of him even when sometimes he didn’t recognize me anymore. he would accuse me of stealing his wife’s purse and i am his wife, he would think i’m his mother and she’s passed away. he remembers our two sons. you know this is hard and it’s not going to get better. because of he’s age 72 and his mind he’s not considered a candidate for liver transplant. this truly breaks my heart and soul"," i am so sorry that you are both going on such a terrible journey.  i hope i’m not out of line if i say that hospice may be a blessing for him with the physical state that he’s in - he has to be in a lot of pain, even if he can’t correctly verbalize it.  also, you have to take care of you right now.  you can’t be taking phone calls from him all night.  the hospital needs to take the phone away at night. since your husband has full blown dementia, he won’t remember that he called you or not.  that’s why he calls you again and again.  you need to make that stop.  it’s not being cruel, he doesn’t understand.  you need to be in your best shape to deal with what’s coming.  hugs from an internet stranger in florida",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/g9kg4v/my_dear_husband/,My dear husband
"my dad is 51 and was diagnosed with frontal lobe atrophy and dementia 8 months ago. we’re assuming a lot of the damage occurred when a warehouse-type garage door fell on his head a couple years ago and it’s just now rearing it’s ugly head. he’s been having a lot of extreme headaches. so his neurologist had him get a blood patch and whatnot to see if it helped. a couple days ago, he was in so much pain he said he felt like he was dying so they went to a nearby hospital and got shots that seemed to help. since he was feeling better, he and his wife thought it would be a good idea to drive to virginia to visit his sister. yesterday, he got really confused and didn’t know who they were, where he was, etc, lost all orientation. he got aggressive but they were able to calm him down and get him oriented. today, they were driving back and my dad’s paranoia sets in. he’s convinced himself that his wife is having an affair with the neurologist. so driving down the interstate, 11 hours from home, he chokes her. she pulls over and he gets out, saying he’s walking home. someone sees him and calls the police who convince him to get back in the car. we were able to get him to agree to take his medicine so he would sleep the rest of the way home. i’m terrified. i’m terrified that he’s going to just get even more aggressive and mean than he already was. i’m terrified when we go on vacation in a few months, sharing a condo with him, that’s he’s going to get confused and aggressive in front of my children. i’m terrified that this is progressing so incredibly fast that i’m going to lose him way sooner than i expect. idk i just needed to get it all off my chest to people that can possibly relate.", i'm sorry you're having to go through this.  i think you'd better cancel your vacation plans seeing as travel and unfamiliar surroundings agitate him.  please reach out to your doctors to see if you can get medications and/or medical cannabis to help him remain stable.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/g9c8dv/just_need_to_get_it_off_my_chest/,Just need to get it off my chest

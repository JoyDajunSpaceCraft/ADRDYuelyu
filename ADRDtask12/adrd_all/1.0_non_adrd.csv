"i used to be super addicted to heroin back in my 20s, went to rehab at 28, clean for 6 years. got a wife. fixed my relationship with my family. lived the good life. last year my mom gave me access to her bank account because shes shit with computers and wanted me to show her how to use her online banking app. i helped her out, everything was fine. a week later i reunited with an old friend of mine, jason (not his real name). i met jason while i was studying medicine, and we lost contact after i decided to go to rehab, but i figured hey why not see how hes doing. so we meet up at a bar, we get talking, and i realize that i missed him so much over the years without even knowing it. soon were drunk walking home when he pull into an alley and gets ready to shoot up. i tell him im gonna go on ahead cause im uncomfortable, but he tells me it wont take long, and i havent seen him in years, so i wait. after hes done, he offers me some. i was drunk and happy to see my old friend and i thought 'hey, one time shouldnt hurt. ive gotten sober once i can do it again.' so i took his offer. next day, i met up with jason again. i told myself just one more time, then im done. well, its been a year. when my wife found out she left me, my family stopped talking to me, my whole life crumbled. but like i said, my moms shit with computers, and i cant exactly get a job, so ive been using her money to buy shit. not just drugs, food and stuff too. the last time i saw her she was in the first stage of dementia, so i doubt she even noticed her money getting drained. i dont know what to do. i have nowhere to go, i have no money besides what im stealing from my mom, i feel like shit constantly but theres notbing i can do about it. ive been thinking about oding but i still have some hope that things might get better. but idk. moral of the story, dont steal from ur mom, and for fucks sake dont do heroin.", he should never have started then he wouldn't have an addiction. to look for sympathy for his stupid mistakes is ridiculous. i see homeless drug addicts on the street every day and don't feel sorry for any of them. they all had a choice and picked the wrong one.,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/vqbh86/ive_been_spending_my_moms_retirement_fund_on/,,ive been spending my mom's retirement fund on drugs for over a year
"my grandmother has just recently passed away and if i’m being completely honest i’m not that sad about it. she got alzheimer’s when i was fairly young still so i never really knew her, just parts of her that were never quite *there*. but even though i don’t feel sad, i keep reliving this horrible thing i did as a child. i think i was about 12 and me and my grandmother were arguing about god knows what. we argued a lot since i didn’t understand her disease and she couldn’t remember what we were fight about. all i remember was feeling extremely frustrated, and all i wanted to do was to get her to shut up so i yelled “because you have alzheimers you cant remember anything!” again, i don’t remember a lot about her our life together and basically nothing about that fight but i remember the look on her face like it was mere minutes ago. it haunts me. she was so sad. it’s like she remembered right then all the sadness that came with her being diagnosed, and all the pain and sadness her illness had caused for other people. i can’t even describe how sad and miserable she looked. it looked like every last bit of hope, or happiness just drained out completely. she staying quiet and sad for at least 10 minutes ( for context she usually forgot conversations about 3-5 minutes after they happened at this stage). the worst part about this, is that i never even felt bad. when it happened all i can remember thinking is “finally.” for years and years i never felt bad or gave it another thought, until she died and now i don’t even get to say sorry."," god will get you for that, walter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/vcmz1e/i_told_my_grandmother_who_had_alzheimers_that_she/,,I told my grandmother (who had Alzheimer’s) that she had Alzheimer’s to win a fight.

"so, a little bit of back story. i was raised solely by my dad, his a good man, a lot older than most other dads growing up, but always has been my best friend. i don't think we've ever even gotten into one fight. it was all well and fine, until i was 15, when he was diagnosed with early-onset alzheimer's disease (ad). it wasn't as bad as it sounds at first, sure, my dad would forget things every now and then, but slowly, it crept up, to the point where he struggled to remember my name. he has always remembered i'm his son; but things like my interests, name, birthday, times etc, were a struggle for him. because i was a minor, and my dad was considered ""terminally ill"", according to my state law, we had to have three nurse's move in with us. all three were lovely, they would alternate the times/days they stayed with us, always one nurse living with us while i completed high school. i turned 18, and was finally considered by law an ""adult"", free home nurse service was discontinued, and not ready to look after my dad alone at 18, continued the service, using my dads savings, my inheritance and his pensioner money to pay for the service. this lasted 3 years, with a nurse staying around 3 nights per week, instead of 7 - as a) i felt i could handle most nights alone, and b) i was in charge of all this money that i knew would dry up, so i tried to make this process as slow as possible. well, the money inevitably dried up. i was working a shitty part time job, barely eating healthy myself, doing my undergrad at college (more fees), depressed and going broke...fast. i didn't really know what to do, where to turn to, i had almost zero support from the government, health organisations, social workers, college...nothing. then, out of the blue, a guy on grindr (gay hook up/dating app) messaged me and offered me $100 to give him a blowjob. he was mid 40s, overweight, and ugly..but i was desperate for some quick cash, and thats when it all started. so, from age 22, i've been sex work to pay for my dads nurses, specialist appointments, medication, rent and food. as well as my own life expenses. i'm now 26, so i've been doing this for 4 years. at first, just through grindr, i used my boyish appearance to my advantage and would message older men, asking for help. it was surprisingly easy, i would hook up with older men, ranging from $100 to 250, a few times a week just to stay afloat. after a while, i looked for other avenues - i signed to an escort agency, and started taking male and female clients out for dinners, casinos, shows, events etc, making a lot more money. i found this easy, i basically grew up super fast at 15, by 18 i had more life experience than most 25 year olds. i even made my own sex-work profile on a few websites, making $1500-2500 for overnight stays...$1500 pays for almost 4 nights for a private overnight nurse. before covid i was flying across europe for weekend work, high rolling with lots of rich men. those weekends were bizarre. i don't think i could ever get used to that.in terms of income, i have bad months, good months, and great months. ever since i've done overnight sex-work, i've always been ahead on payments. i average around $7500 a month on sex work, more than enough to pay for an overnight nurse twice a week, plus rent, bills and medical expenses. it also helps pay for my schooling, food, expenses etc. i even have savings now. on the nights i have a night nurse, i go to ""work"", making a lot more than they do. it's a struggle, and it's tiresome and hard, but the cards were stacked against me and i did what i had to. i suppose i could of made smarter and safer decisions, but i don't regret it. i don't hate sex work, but i don't particularly enjoy it either. it's gotten in the way with a lot of things. for the past 10 years, i feel like i haven't really ""lived"". everything i do is for my dad, i barely have any friends, i drank too much alcohol to mask my pain (sober alcoholic now), the one boyfriend i've had dumped me once i told him the truth. but except for him, and now you reading this, no one else knows. perhaps the nurses suspect something, but i think they presume my dad must of had endless cash, or i get government support, but nope...it's all me and various sugar daddies and older men. i worry about my future, i worry about my dad, but the nurses have countlessly told me, his doing great, and keeping him at his actual home, in his own surroundings instead of in aged care home has slowed down his alzheimers drastically, and for that - it's worth it. for my dad to remember my name 7/10 times, it's worth it....gosh this feels freeing to finally type this out. the biggest take-away here is, the public healthcare system is abominable, and serious measures need to be put in place to fix it. i'm currently taking a break from my masters, but i'm majoring in policy, and i hope to help reform it one day."," you rule. as someone experienced with relatives with dementia, you are the reason your father is doing well. the nurses are right, keeping him at home is the best thing for him as long as you’re able to keep it up. sex work is real work 👍",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/syhmml/how_i_really_pay_for_my_dads_medical_expenses_and/,,How I REALLY pay for my dads medical expenses and rent
"to preface this i feel extremely guilty about this and what it did to my family and i don’t think i can forgive myself. it all started when my grandma got alzheimers. this was back in 2011 when i was 10. she wasn’t that bad but she got to the point where she needed care constantly. my aunt is an incredibly wealthy lady and she got lawyers involved saying she didn’t have to take care of my grandma which still angers me. so she lived with us for a little. at first it was okay, but as time went on she became worse and worse coming into my room at night, asking me where her son was, constantly yelling at me. it was terrifying to my young self. my father worked full time and couldn’t take care of her so my mother was forced to always be around. my poor mother was forced to constantly care for this woman who wasn’t even related to her by driving her everywhere, giving her showers, spoon feed her like a baby and it just made me so mad. my mom became a nervous wreck and was always stressed and every time she asked my aunt to help she would tell her to contact her lawyers the absolute devil. it got to the point where i couldn’t stand this woman who was my own grandma by blood constantly forcing my poor mother with significant health issues to constantly care for her. so one day when it was me and my grandma in the living room i decided enough was enough. i bit myself on the arm as hard as i could until i was bleeding and screamed “grandma stop!” as loud as i could. when my mother and father came in i lied to them and said she had bitten me and showed them the mark. i had bitten myself so hard i had to go to the hospital. the last thing i ever heard my grandma say was “ i didn’t hurt him i love him!”. i still have the memory ingrained in my brain playing on repeat even after all these years. she was put in an elderly care home and no one wanted to visit her because they all thought she had attacked me. she died in 2014 alone with no one.the worse part of it was my entire family grew to hate her because of the incident. no one went to her funeral. i’ve lived with this guilt my entire life so far and it constantly eats away at me being the only person who knows the truth and how horribly i ruined the family. i can’t sleep, i have nightmares the guilt is getting to me. i needed to get this off my chest before it completely eats me whole."," my grandma had alzheimers but i never saw her do anything like that she always was tired and at night she used to talk to herself, she never yelled or did anything too strange, they talk to themselves to connect their thoughts without realizing it happening they don’t have the awareness and power to think silently, but every adult in the family took care of her, no matter what drama happened.i think your aunt is a bad person and you sorta, i get that you were young but you had a lot of time to make up for that lie and you chose not to. people don’t live long with alzheimers and im afraid my mom could have it since she’s approaching a big age, but i don’t think i’ll ever leave her even though she hates me and she’s homophobic, but if i have to throw my life away to look after her i will.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/sv9ur4/i_intentionally_got_my_grandma_with_alzheimers/,,I intentionally got my grandma with Alzheimer’s put in a home

"it has been a minute. i have this uncanny, almost alien feeling of elation and tears, depression and upliftment, sorrow and joy. the most strange feeling, however, is the feeling of coming home after a day of work, and sitting in silence with zero noise in my head. i dont know about tomorrow, but today, i am at peace. it has been a journey, i've lost more than i've gained, owing to the fact that i havnt been the best at being stable, or making pragmatic decisions. that, and shit luck, made me go through what i went.i am a 26 year old balding, obese man with a plain, chubby face. i have no long term friendships, no relationships and no coherent family members to share this with. reading it back, i've a voice in my head telling me to not write it, because people wouldnt think this is true, rather a joke. it is not. living like this is far worse than actually typing it out. but still, here i am, typing, confessing it all out.since 2016, life hasnt been easy. i had a decent family, loving parents and a decent childhood. my parents still love me, but they're a far cry back from what they used to be. in 2016, dad got diagnosed with lewy body dementia and parkinsonism like symptoms. i got this rude shock where he couldnt recognise my face in a public space, and for the first time in my life i watched my dad approach me with the eyes of a stranger. he cried later when he got to realise what had happened - but we both couldnt realise at the time there would be so many more tears.my mum - she loved my dad more than anything else. watching him deteriorate, struggle with basic tasks broke her. she's been a depressed, shell of a woman since - and though there are days when i see the light in her eyes, it doesnt remain there for long.in 2016 itself, i had graduated from school. didnt have much of a plan, but that was before misfortune stuck. one after the other, my life unravelled. people whom i'd known for ages went for jobs, for education - leaving me at home, tending to my parents. day in, day out, i didnt live like a 20 something guy. didnt talk to girls, didnt get out of house much, other than chores. lived like a hermit.in summer of 2017 i cleared graduate school std test (gre). scored enough to qualify for cutoffs at stanford business school. but my lack of personality, poor experience and a mediocre cv ensured i couldnt just get in. also, couldnt just leave my folks alone.i managed to join a semi-decent school - only to never really fit in with people. nobody wants to talk to a loner - particularly one who isnt really good at anything. cant say it didnt hurt when i used to stay alone during weekends, just browsing reddit and youtube. cant say it didnt hurt when i asked a girl out, but her friends laughed - right out of a movie scene, you'd think. cant say it didnt hurt when i would struggle to join study groups, because people had already sorted themselves out in the first few weeks. and it definitely hurt when i would call back home occasionally, only to talk to a father who wasnt really there and a mother who didnt want to be. i dont really know how i got through it. i remember wanting to drop out, but couldnt afford to make payments. i dont know where i found that will to survive. the will to not give up and fight my circumstances. the will to do whatever it takes, pull over a mask of confidence over the suicidal desperation i felt while interviewing for roles. i just know that i did. ultimately got a job with an insurance firm, and for the first time after a long, long while - i am not sad. as basic as that sounds, it is a very powerful feeling. i've seen enough of life to realise this isnt going to remain. i might end up being more miserable tomorrow - i might end up still having no friends, or partner. but today, i feel like i couldnt care less about yesterday or tomorrow!that's all folks.", good work.  keep your head down and your chin up.,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/oixhbb/first_day_at_my_first_job_and_i_just_need_to_say/,,"First day at my first job, and I just need to say this now."

"for the past few years my grandmother’s dementia has gotten the best of entire family. in the past, we used to get into a lot of arguments/screaming matches until her dementia diagnosis finally came in. she had an obsession with defecting and soon it included urinating. she refuses to use a toilet or a commode to urinate. she pees in various parts of the house and also wipes her feces along the walls of the house. she constantly stinks, her bathroom stinks, the entire house stinks. it’s been years since anyone in my family has had visitors or simply have been truly comfortable in their home. when we bleach the place, the neutral smell and peace of mind only lasts minutes. on top of it all, she is just as rude as she has always been throughout her life. she just had a urine soaked napkin in the hallway and when i asked her to clean it up, she started to scream and put on a show that made it look like i was killing her. this is extremely common. i screamed back at her and it made her cry.i screamed so loud because i couldn’t control my anger. it’s been about 4 years and i still haven’t gotten used to this life.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/k1jl0w/i_screamed_at_my_grandmother_for_urinating_on_the/,,I screamed at my grandmother for urinating on the floor
"around a year ago, my brother (30) began his startup and hired me (22) as an employee. i get paid a salary but what really incentivizes me is the equity stake i have in it as an early employee. as some of you may know, getting investors on board as a startup founder has become more and more competitive. both individual investors and members of vc firms only offer their money to a limited number of startups. meanwhile, they can easily get over 100 emails pitching one concept or another every day. without a flawless pitch, a compelling story, and most importantly, founders who exude credibility in every way, you’ll probably be lost in the shuffle. my brother has experience in his field but he’s competing against many entrepreneurs who actively network and go to meetups to build and maintain relationships with investors so they can invest in the future.in late 2019, i started secretly dating a closeted bisexual woman in her late forties. because of her career she has never married and says she doesn’t know if she’ll ever want to marry because she’s used to not having to make comprises in her home life. she also doesn’t want children. she is the head of an investment fund and weighs in heavily when making decisions. i encouraged my brother to apply to pitch with her fund and she told me she’ll take a meeting with him and his cofounder but there a lot of similar companies in his space and they have cofounders that have done more to progressively pitch what they are doing to members of her fund and have kept them updated on their progress before they pitch. after my brother pitched she said again that he should wait for a while and come back in and pitch again because investors really take on a lot of risk with early stage companies.i was upset and told her that she based her entire line of work 90 percent on trusting in the cofounders and believing in them. the next part made me feel bad because her mother was suffering from dementia and she confessed she was feeling more lonely than ever. basically i kept trying to get her to reconsider over the next week and confessing that i wanted to leave and move someplace else because she kept me hidden all the time and obviously my brother’s startup “ sucks.”after a week of telling her about how my brother would do more with her money and that he wasn’t asking for too much money she finally agreed to discuss it more with her other decision makers.finally she came back saying that they’d give what my brother asked for in exchange for a larger percentage of equity than he had offered.she warned me that she was passing up many similar startups many whom are pitching their firm for the second or third time.my brother doesn’t know that i pulled strings at all and was excited about getting an offer. i promised my girlfriend that she wouldn’t regret it. all in all, i don’t regret making my brother happy and helping his company reach the next milestone. i think he’s really capable and is only lacking in his network and perhaps his “ hustle.”but sometimes i do feel guilty when i slack off at work because i know that my brother’s new investor took a larger risk than she’s usually comfortable with because she trusts in me.and i honestly think that the other companies despite being farther along don’t necessarily have the better strategy than my brother does, and it’s all a matter of helping him get to the next step.", can i be your step-bro. i promise to give you full benefits...of a step bro. plus i can hustle,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/jzm5br/i_emotionally_blackmailed_someone_into_investing/,,I emotionally blackmailed someone into investing in my brother’s company over those with more qualified founders.
"when i was a teen, my lolo (grandpa) stayed with us. at that time, he suffers from early signs of dementia.  i'm actually very fond of him and we were actually very close because he took care of us since early childhood and he was present when i was growing up. i was not the perfect child nor am i a good person when i was a teen. i often lose my temper over the simplest things. since my grandpa was suffering dementia, he often repeat things, like topics, questions, etc.i was busy at something back then and my grandpa asks me for the 5th time when will dinner be ready. i easily lost my temper and yelled at him. i remember the words i said that i would regret forever. i remember saying ""lolo for the last time it's too fucking early? why can't you fucking understand"". i saw and felt the emotions he just felt and immediately said sorry. for the first time i saw tears in my granpa and he said sorry for having dementia.couple of months later his dementia worsened to alzheimer's and the first time i saw him again. i saw his repulsed look and reaction, the same one i saw that day. and everytime we would visit. i would always be welcomed by that emotion. i fucking hate teen self for being a self absorbed douchebag. my granpa died last year and i'm the only one he never mentioned by name in his will.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/iwcuc2/i_yelled_at_my_grandpa_who_is_suffering_from/,,"I yelled at my grandpa who is suffering from dementia, now it's the last memory he had of me"
"i need help. my father and mother adopted 4 severely handicapped people and me who is normal body. my parents where in their 50s when they started this journey. they said god called them to it. now first off let me start saying - i understand my siblings feelings. i understand they wish they were never born ""they said this to me"" i understand about everything they say to me.i have sometimes moments where when something bad happens or anything about the future regarding my family. my siblings pop up into my head. my parents have biological children but they are all in their 40s and i do not really like them what so ever. i've never really liked them at all. i pretend a lot. when they visit i put on my nice charming face but inside i have so much rage against them. i'm very glad i'm not blood related to them.  just thinking of them sharing my dna discusses me greatly.older siblings do not help us. my parents always had to help them with everything! they are pretty big losers in my book. one older sibling does help out some. though not to the extent i would think it should be. being herself a bio child. she pretends she helps a lot but she doesn't. even when you ask her to help my parents she makes a big sense and or says i'm too busy bye. another reason i dislike her is because shes always had help in life. her husband and his side of the family and my parents. and she still lectures me about not being where i need to be in life, and im trying i am really really trying but she will not 100% show sympathy or empathy towards me. there was a point she tried to kick me out of my parents house because she got angry with me because i stood up against her finally but it made things a lot worse. im in my 20s trying to get my career going. it is not easy for a young person to be fully independent as it was in early 2000s or 90s/80s/70s. and most of them did not come from a big family like mine or have disabled siblings and prob were an only child and got help like my older sister did. so i get angry when older people at work lecture me about it too when im trying. i just have a very sour taste for middle age people.my father is in his 70s and old and frail and still thinks hes 20 and will not give up or take caution to things. my mother who is also in her 70s has advanced alzheimer's disease and always has projects going around in the house and just idk. now i adore and love my parents greatly. just sometimes i feel when they adopted my disabled siblings they screwed me over. but i dont voice it or say anything.now my dad bought a huge handicapped van. it is humongous. i'm not 6ft tall and sadly i cannot reach the pedals until we can get the van worked on. we did have a smaller van where i can drive the siblings around and help them go shopping and to the movies. but father got rid of it. it was breaking down. im angry he bought something so huge. it is like a big buss.  how can i freakin' drive it. living in the south is awful and i hate it. people are not nice on the road in ga. everyone is pretty rude in the south. that southern charm people always talk about died in the 90s....anyway. so my old man takes the kids shopping when i was at work. he fell and hurt him self twice! hes frail and old and already has problems! so when i got home and was told about it. i got angry inside a lot and felt like crying but did not.i hate to say it but my handicapped siblings are a liability to my parents health and life. i've tried for years to get my siblings somewhere like a apartment or something that is funded by the government. but no! it always goes to those old bastards when they should be in a nursing home not apartments. they been on waiting list it never works out! what am i gonna do when my parents die?! i never asked for this!!!! god forbid my parents live until they are in their 90s! i worked in nursing home i know what its like and how they treat them. i rather eat \*\*\*\* and die then ever put my parents in a nursing home! you think those aids are all nice and lovely. pft!!!!!! the stuff they say about you and the patients when you're not around.... i hate them all. &amp;#x200b;now my siblings have aids but they been low class ghetto trash aids. and they do everything everything half butt. it gets on my nerves. because; now understand i did health care for 4 years because as a kid i wanted to help people like my siblings and i always made sure i went beyond to help and not half butt it like my middle age coworkers. the aids even refused to help them with some things or say in that ghettoo voice ""oh lawd no not my business cya"" freaking trash scum. when i was an aid/cna i did everything by the book and sometimes a little more! it was not hard it took like 3mins more of my time but i wanted to be a nice person! oh my gosh you think those home aids and business are there to help you?! f that they are there to take your money and make you run dry!  but for the past 3 years i changed and went into the trades field. i'm just so mad about everything right now and mostly worried.now my father was a doctor at one time and so the government never not once gave us aid or help us with my siblings not once. so dont think we got special stuff or money or anything from them. i was helping giving enemas at 13 or younger and doing stuff no person could ever ever ever handle. i'm just angry my dad got hurt today and sad. and i want to cry. theres a lot more but i need to stop. it more of vent  that i cannot say out loud. im just worried about my parents. sorry.", this is why im scared to have kids. they might come out as a liability and will be a burden once they grow older,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ggsobb/disabled_family_members_worried_about_the_future/,,Disabled Family Members.

"warning! this is going to be a long one. so today, i got up, got ready to go to work and when i was getting in my brothers car, my phone fell out of my pocket at the same time i was closing the door, i completely shattered my phone. i was so upset and sad because i know that i dont have enough money to buy a new one for a while. im still pretty sad about it. i thought of the odds of that happening to anyone and i hated life and the universe because of this. thanks to this unfortunate event i was able to really think about my life and the things that have gone horribly wrong in it. i wasnt born in america and i grew up with my grandparents for a good portion of my life (i only lived with them for that long because i was always moving around with different relatives prior to this.) my mom lived here in the us and was in the process of becoming a citizen which took around 11 years which is when i came to america.  anyways, i was always a very smart kid and person in general. ive always had the ability to know and understand people better. the reason to that is because when i was a kid, i would always put myself in people's shoes. i would put them in an imaginary scenario in my head and would try to guess what they would say or do. i understand this is a very weird thing to do but i just simply liked being able to know what a persons response would be when i was a kid. i wasnt anti social or anything, i had lots of friends and was the coolest kid in the world back then because it made me smarter as a kid. i did have a lot of conversation with grown ups and i was comfortable and confident enough  to be able to do this. my life took a turn for the worst in a way when i came to the united states though. i was 11 years old and coming to a completely different country certainly overwhelmed me at all costs. the way people thought and viewed things was just different. on top of that i had to learn a new language. my whole world completely changed before my eyes and it was to guarantee me a ""better and brighter future"". i felt stupid and dumb when i was in class all the time. it felt like my learning in school took a significant   pause because i didnt understand shit. and to learn something, you have to understand the language. i struggled making friends and in this country i came face to face with the most disgusting form of racism and inequality i had ever experienced in real life up to that point. those are problems i had and struggled with outside of ""home"".  at the apartment i moved in with the stranger mother, the stranger stepdad i had, and also my 3 siblings, things took a turn for the worst. in this apartment i have lived the saddest and coldest moments of my life. i never managed to get along with my mom. she was very abusive towards me. im the youngest and she left me when i was 1 for financial reasons. my stepdad has anger management problems and he screams at you very nastily when he is angry. they never physically abused me, but shit mental abuse is 100x worst because you feel like a complete waste of a life. i also had to work for every single thing i own since i was 11. i have paid for my food, clothes, phone, and pretty much even my bed. they never provided me with anything. they told me, in life you have to work and value the things you own. we are poor so i understood the reality and figured this will only help me become a better worker and make money. so i have been doing construction work since i was little. at first i began going with people to work and have them teach me. i realized painting was where i needed to go to if i wanted to make money so thats exactly what ive been doing since i was 13. it paid well enough and it maintained me alive this whole time. i really felt my life had completely 0 meaning to it no matter what the outcome of the rest of my life would be. this is just a short summary of the horrible reality i faced everyday for the last 7 and half years of my life.  i am 18 turning 19 in june. i began just going through the motions of life instead of enjoying lifr. i became obsessed with trying to live as much of a good life as possible. so that meant being good in school. being smart helped me a lot.  i was able to understand and communicate in english in 2 years. i was committed to succeeding in life so that meant doing well in school to get in a college. my hard work eventually paid off in the end bc i got myself a full scholarship and a dorm at a private college in ny. i could not feel a bit of slight happiness bc in my stupid head, this just meant more work.  it wasnt until today, that i decided to begin living my life more. i can literally change my personality to anyone i want to be. ive been doing it without realizing because i was so focused on trying to be perfect. i had lost sense of who i was as an individual and i was numb to the puddles full of pain that i have stepped this jungle.  my life is still shit though, my mom

to pay for my dorm at the end of this month.

"even typing that title eats me away inside and i hate myself for it, but i cannot help how i feel.i am 19 and my father is 68. he has vascular dementia. he was a funny, intelligent, fantastic man who was a great father to me and my siblings and a great husband to my mother who is 47. however i’d say about 5-6 years ago he started forgetting little things and losing things constantly, this was the first sign we noticed that he was going down the same path as his mother, who also had dementia. at first the decline was slow, but in the last 2 years especially, the decline in his cognitive abilities is staggering. he no longer has any idea who any of his children are, whether he knows my mother or not changes by the day, and it is a rarity for him to say a sentence that makes sense. every time i walk past him or make eye contact it kills me to know that my father is sitting there, totally unaware of who i am, and that to him there is a strange young man walking around his house, and it makes me feel guilty to live in my own home because i make him feel like that.to see the strain caring for him puts on my mother, (who also has to look after her children and run her high street shop to pay the bills) is heartbreaking. she deserves more than anyone to have a stress free life but since my dad is relatively young to have dementia so severely, i fear this is going to be a long, difficult road for my mum, and i am constantly torn between not leaving home and aiding her financially as much as i can, or taking her advice and carry on and live my own life free and be as successful as i can. there is a very real possibility she will have to sell the house to pay for his care if it becomes impossible to leave him unsupervised at all times, and i just wish more than anything he would just go peacefully now so we can look back on his life in positively and not have to watch him decline further and further for years until he eventually does go, and so my mum can have her social life back and go out and enjoy herself while she is still young enough. i remember vividly when my still fully functional father said ‘if i ever become a burden to you lot, bonk me on the head with that shovel’. he said it in a jokey tone but i knew my father and there was an element of seriousness in that sentence. the man who was my father would be destroyed if he knew what stress he is putting us under now.i realise this is probably very poorly written and i apologise, i have never been a good writer or speaker, but i just wanted to vent and this seemed the appropriate place to do it. thank you."," that sucks man, mostly for your mom. not sure where you live but in the us we really need better and cheaper care for seniors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ed135b/i_am_counting_down_the_days_until_my_father_dies/,,I am counting down the days until my father dies.

"real life: i am a female college student at one of the top public universities in the nation. i'm on the dean's honor list. i wake up every day and get to work with alzheimer's patients and contribute to autism research. my dream job is to be a physician assistant someday. my idea of a soulmate is my mom. i feel so at home whenever i'm with her. i don't have a relationship with my dad. i bond with my younger brothers by forcing myself to play minecraft and the new gears of war 5 because those are things they like. i think my friends would describe me as reliable, authentic, outgoing, and humorous. i'm overweight, and when i say that, i don't say it lightly. this morning i weighed myself, i am 224 pounds standing at 5'3 feet tall. i've actually lost 4 pounds since last week. i'm not happy with my body, so i'm trying to make some improvements. but we'll see how long that lasts because i think i tell myself ""you're going to lose weight"" at least 100 times a year. i'm not some super uptight gal. i do my occasional dose of weed, and sometimes i do that with friends. i like to hit the bars on the weekend, but don't ever allow myself to get totally hammered. this summer, i struggled with my mental health. wanted to kill myself. went to therapy. and now i'm fit to be and function normally in society again. i would say that in my day-to-day life, i'm cautious, but also laidback. this is how everyone knows me. online life: one word, ""e-thot."" this started about 4 years ago. i was on an app called whisper, where i joined it and immediately went to a group called ""dark fantasies"" where anonymous users essentially confess what their dark, sexual fantasies are. it started out pretty innoncent, i would say. just a little confession here, and a little confession there, maybe even joining another ""sexual"" group. then it transitioned from posting selfies of myself. innocent selfies that progressed to maybe a finger in my mouth, a little cleavage, nothing too crazy. before i knew it, i was posting pictures of myself where i was wearing see-through clothing, or playing with my toys, and editing it just enough so that the app wouldn't detect it as something sexual, but keeping it original so that the viewers would know what they're looking at. let's face it, i love posting pictures of my half-naked body online. i like showing myself performing sexual acts with my sex toys, online. in fact, i have my own reddit user where i dedicate my content to explicit posts of myself. i've used bigo live to fuel my exhibitionist yearnings. for any of you on bigo, you know that they don't condone sexual acts or anything suggestive, but that's what makes it fun for me. i like the challenge, i like teasing men. it's what gets me going. just typing this out, turns me on. i have earned money from sexual posts and livestreaming. online, my body is my temple and it's something i'm not ashamed of.  i don't see myself discontinuing this any time soon.", saaaame. wanna chat/trade sometime?,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/dibnxb/i_live_a_double_life_my_real_life_and_my_online/,,"I live a double life, my ""real life"" and my ""online life"""

"*i know i'm not coming out of this situation looking great. i'm in my late 30s, in terrible shape, horribly underemployed, beholden to a slew of mental illnesses and i tend to self-medicate with whatever substance is around to abuse. that is to say, i know i'm a piece of shit -- the financial failures, physical handicaps, and a healthy dose of bad luck may mitigate that fact, but they do not excuse it. i could be doing better for myself. i just don't care. and i'm starting to care so little, i'm one more bad day from giving up. but i am not, in any case, the hero of this story. that is my confession: i did this to myself. and, if you're not careful, you could too.* &amp;#x200b;**life is good(ish)**&amp;#x200b;in 2012, i was living in new york - i'd taken a high-paying job that didn't excite me much, but i'd lived in small towns for most of my life and the allure of the whole thing captured my imagination. i was doing well enough, had less complaints about the place than compliments, and my budding social life made up for the boredom of my career. &amp;#x200b;in 2013, i received a phone call from my mother, and through her sobs i understood she wanted me to decide if her dog was to be put down. i didn't feel it was my decision to make, but she couldn't do it, his quality of life was terrible, his disease incurable, and i felt the suffering needed to stop. from this point on, this is referred to as ""when \[i\] convinced \[her\] to kill ray."" she didn't want to accept responsibility for what the vet and i agreed was the necessary thing, and it now became ammunition against me when she was feeling especially petty. which didn't happen often -- yet. &amp;#x200b;later that year, she called again sobbing: she'd just been to the doctor, and she was found to be suffering from hepatic encephalopathy. this is where, i'm told, you've been drinking so much, so often, for so long that your liver fails to filter ammonia from your bloodstream and it just starts to pool up in your brain. every drink is another degree of self-induced dementia, complete with memory loss, troubles with motor function, personality changes and emotional instability.&amp;#x200b;she couldn't suffer alone, and though my brother lived only an hour away, she wanted me to come home. i tried to quit my job, and to their credit, they offered to let me work from home instead -- so i went from the city to the beach, and found myself in florida. good work if you can find it -- happy hours start early in beach towns, and most of them offer free wi-fi. yet, having broken a lease, finding a new place to live near my mother's, learning what it meant to need a car again, reacquainting myself with big-box stores -- i couldn't help but notice that my mother was not, in fact, acting very sick. &amp;#x200b;**life gets worse**&amp;#x200b;she was sick if you asked about it. she felt terrible if you inquired. if you remarked she seemed to be having a good day, she'd glance off into the distance and mumble something about nothing in general, and then complain she needed a wheelchair if we were going to stay at the mall. i began to suspect -- as did my fiancee -- that my mother's illness had less to do with her liver, and more to do with her ego. this became a point of contention with my fiancee, who i (now) do not blame for leaving. she was drinking a lot, i was drinking even more, and we were both coping with my overbearing mother's drinking-induced fatal disease. &amp;#x200b;my fiancee moves out; i drink more. my troubles with depression (how major is 'major' depressive disorder?) worsen, and i find myself as an inpatient in several psychiatric hospitals. i withdraw from society, speak only to delivery drivers and my dog, and my entire social life revolves around a now entirely-healthy mother whose new hobbies are redecorating what ""that bitch did to this house,"" and talking about how much happier ""we are now."" rather than deal with this somewhat inverted norman bates situation, i just stop taking my meds and drink more. &amp;#x200b;eventually, i began to rely on my mother for nearly everything. i didn't like being around people -- she liked being needed. i was acting as sick as she was supposed to be. i was having trouble working, paying attention to hygiene, getting bills paid on time -- and she was ecstatic to have someone to care for. her symptoms had totally vanished. she proposed that, given we spend so much time together already (she couldn't bear to not be around the ""baby"" -- my four-legged friend -- and had furnished the guest room to her liking), we should just save the money and move in together. &amp;#x200b;i was in no position to argue. i made enough money not to really care about money -- which isn't much if you're single, in your 30s, have no friends, no hobbies, you work 80 hours a week, and you spend so much time letting your mother run your life that you're asexual by default (as a funny aside, i did once buy a fleshlight -- and i was too lazy to open the box). we moved in together -- and though we'd found a house with a split plan, with her living in one half and me in the other, not an hour went by that we didn't converse. i worked from home, and she worked on me. &amp;#x200b;**my mother learns to weaponize law enforcement**&amp;#x200b;like most relationships that involve disgusting amounts of alcohol (we were both well into more-than-1-liter of vodka per day territory), there began arguments. i spent a long time in yet another inpatient psychiatric facility where i met a woman who tolerated me (and, conveniently, also needed money). the existence of another woman simply wouldn't do for my mother, the arguments between them grew bitter, and my mother began getting violent. she would strike me in anger, and say ""who are the police going to believe?"" &amp;#x200b;my girlfriend at the time thought the police would believe me. i did have bruises, cuts, a lot of my expensive things were broken, and my mother was no worse for wear. the police, of course, did *not* believe me. now my mother would add ""do i need to call protective services"" to her persuasion tactics if the lawn needed mowing or she didn't quite feel up to buying her own cigarettes. &amp;#x200b;so, once again, a somewhat healthy relationship ends, i somehow manage to drink more, and find myself, once again, in an inpatient psychiatric facility. at this point, i considered being admitted to these places vacations. i was still somehow employed, and carried good insurance, so they really weren't that bad. wear pajamas all day. get geeked out on heavy meds and try to play basketball. three hots and a cot. unfortunately, my employer would have appreciated being told where i was; eight days into my vacation, i was interrupted by a phone call stating my position had been terminated, effective immediately. i know nothing about new york or florida employment law, but i did know that i had been fucking around for months on the company dime, and the shoe was waiting to drop. &amp;#x200b;usually, i'd leave one of these facilities feeling good -- a long list of prescriptions to fill, a new lease on life, hobbies i'd picked up, friends i'd made -- now i was leaving worse than i'd gone in. i'm not sure i had it in me to escape my current living situation -- maybe if i'd saved some money, maybe if i hadn't alienated most of my friends through a decade of heavy drinking. instead, i got hit by a truck. &amp;#x200b;**yes, a truck**&amp;#x200b;yes, i was literally hit by a truck. and of course, i continued living with my mother. six months in a wheelchair, three months with a walker, three more using a cane, and i still walk funny. you don't get terrific medical treatment beyond emergency medicine in the states when you don't have insurance -- and any money you make in your pathetic lawsuit goes to the hospital bills first. &amp;#x200b;those prescriptions for the pain? they're great if you can afford them. you know what's cheaper? vodka. more and more of it. you wake up in pain, you drink until you can't feel it anymore, and you sleep until you're sober enough for it to return. &amp;#x200b;years have gone by, now, having my mother as a roommate. and she's getting sick of me. i don't blame her, i've been sick of her for years as well. but she misses the money i brought in -- i'm a terrific drinking buddy if i can slip her a few thousand a month, but if i'm asking her for help with the bills, it doesn't go well. i'm underemployed at the moment, too; my mental state (partly from the truck, mostly from the ongoing degenerative psychological illnesses) doesn't allow me to do much, my physical condition is.. well, i'd be swimming after a rum ham, that's for sure. i own next to nothing -- a computer, five t-shirts, some shorts, a few posters. &amp;#x200b;i walked into this trap -- my mother wanted control of my life, but she wanted control of the life i had, not the life i ended up with. sometimes the only thing that prevents me from trying suicide again is not allowing her to play the grieving mother -- i'm too spiteful for that. if it wouldn't earn her any sympathy points, i'd probably go put my dick in a light socket right now. &amp;#x200b;**the only winning move is.. not to play?** &amp;#x200b;i'm stuck -- mentally, physically, emotionally, financially. the psychiatric facilities for the under-and-uninsured are.. not pleasant experiences, and rarely do any good. i'm in the middle of a year-long process of applying for disability with no end in sight. it's been so long since i've held a respectable job that i'd have trouble landing an interview (i've tried), and while most men grow handsome and distinguished in their late 30s, i'm on the other end of that karmic see-saw.&amp;#x200b;and now, totally defeated in every way, having failed at every facet in life, my mother wants me gone. the pittance i pay in rent isn't worth it. the arguments we have (things like ""mom, we can please not watch matlock"" or ""didn't i walk the dog the last seven times"" or ""no, mother the 'blacks' aren't violent and they're not talking about you at the mailbox"") are more frequent and more inane. she's drinking more than i do -- no small feat, weighing half as much. she's recently called the police on me because i, in a fit of blind rage, decided i'd rather lock my bedroom door than allow her to strike me. &amp;#x200b;is she a terrible person? for the most part, yes. she has her moments. she's kind to animals. she's somewhat kind to children. she has decent taste in music. was she partially responsible for how my life ended up? not much, i don't think, but she made no effort to push me out of the way each time she saw the bus coming. was she always this controlling? i believe so. was she ever really sick? i don't know. and now that she's used me for every dollar, every social utility, every joke, every moment of companionship and every chore done around the house -- she's done with me. &amp;#x200b;that makes me a nearly-40, fat, alcoholic, unkempt florida man with bipolar disorder, a weird looking leg, no friends, no real job or prospects -- and soon, no home. part of me wants to kill myself just to ""win"" for once -- i made that decision. i did that. but then part of me thinks how many empty hugs she'll get at the service, and how many people will tell her she did all that she could for me, things like that -- and it makes me shiver. &amp;#x200b;maybe if i do go through with it, i'll get this confession tattooed across my back first. &amp;#x200b;post that one on nextdoor, mom, they'll fucking love it.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/cnt32r/i_got_myself_into_this_and_id_kill_myself_if_my/,,"I Got Myself into This, and I'd Kill Myself if My Mother Couldn't Milk the Tragedy"

"ugh, here goes throwaway account for obvious reasons. i’ll start by saying i feel absolutely terrible about this, even 16 years later.in my last year of elementary school, our class school trip was a week long vacation to a big city about 8 hours away, it was definitely a big deal and one of those things that you’d be a loser if you missed (grade 8 perception)to cover the costs, we use to sell chocolate bars,  let’s say the trip cost 500$, if you sold 400$ worth of bars, you’d only be on the hook for the remaining 100$. i grew up to a single mom, my dad was a piece of trash who left and never paid a cent in child support to my mom for me or my 2 siblings, even though he was pretty loaded. this is not for sympathy i just want to paint an accurate picture because while we were quite poor, i was one of the only ones in my class who wasn’t wealthy. i was one of the only ones who would have missed the trip if i didn’t sell enough, because for other parents covering those costs would be no problem, it was not a possibility for me.i had only a week left and had not sold enough, i was still short about 100$ (4 full boxes of chocolate bars). down the road from me was an elderly woman, the first time i visited her she was so nice and offered to buy an entire box. the next day i was walking by when she stopped me and asked what i was doing and i explained the chocolates, she offered to buy another box, but i quickly realized she didn’t know she was buying another box, she had alzheimer’s, and i realized that she thought she was buying one from me for the first time.  i didn’t stop her (ugh this is even hard to write all these years later)i did this the next day, and i did it one more time the next. i ended up selling enough bars to go on the school trip, and i hardly remember the trip....what i do remember all too well was selling that woman about 100$ worth of chocolate bars in 4 days.over the years i tried to make it back to her without ever coming clean, i would clean her eaves troughs, mow her lawn, things like that. it doesn’t in any way excuse the horrible acts i did,  but it helped me get past it tldr: needed to sell chocolate bars, kept selling to a woman with alzheimer’s who didn’t know it wasn’t the first time she bought them from me", maybe bitch just loved chocolate,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ci73pq/took_advantage_financially_of_a_woman_with/,,Took Advantage (financially) of a woman with Alzheimer’s

"i’ve been with my man for nearly nine years and six of these years and counting were spent taking care of his sick parents(mom is in her late 60’s, dad is late 70’s) by sick i mean being completely dependent. showering, dressing, cooking, cleaning up, washing their clothes, everything. i’ve never been compensated for my time other than living under the same roof, which i’m grateful. we live in southern ca so it’s not cheap. but i guess since i also work a full time job and we have two children i feel like our life is just on hold for the problems that could’ve been handled before we even came into the picture. my man is totally devoted to fixing her problems, which i respect, but he’s struggling. the problems are much bigger than i can write here so i’ll leave it at that. the last thing i want is for my man to have a heart attack. we have no help from him estranged sister who just up and left and blocked all contact with her mom and him. i can’t help but feel resentful towards his sister, as well as the actions my boyfriends mother refused to take before she became completely dependent. his dad on the other-hand is in a shitty care-home but he needs to be considering his alzheimer’s completely took over him now. if he was still living with us i don’t think i’d be alive. during my really low days i pray that it’s the day that his mother would pass. i don’t always feel this way. i cry a lot about this feeling. i broke down to my own mother one day about this and she said it’s because i’m burnt out. i just want to have some control over my life again. i feel like my man is controlling over me because he has no control over his life since i’m the one who leaves for work five days a week. he stays home with his mom and our kids(they’re not babies or toddlers). i really feel for my little family, especially our kids. i long for the days of the freedom to roam with them without caring how long we spent out. we used to ride bikes and spend hours upon hours at the park or the beach or anywhere. now i feel trapped. i can’t take them anywhere without feeling guilt. i’m just so tired of this. i know i need to make the best of the situation but it’s a dark, lonely, and difficult tunnel, which i feel the light at the end is just an illusion."," removed for violating submission rule #1op, we recommend /r/offmychest for posts like yours",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ceh6s4/i_feel_like_a_bad_person_for_thinking_the_way_i_do/,,I feel like a bad person for thinking the way I do...
"my dad and i have had a complicated relationship. while he always provided for my mother and i he was also a chronic alcoholic. he would go on week long binges, render himself complete helpless, and check out of my life regularly. the drinking made him verbally, and sometimes even physically abusive. i spent a good amount of my childhood and teen years feeling like i was more of a parent than a child to my father. thanks to some therapy i’m just now coming to terms with what being a child of an alcoholic is truly like. recently my father has been showing signs of alzheimer’s, and been incredibly concerning. this is my biggest fear. i cannot cope with the guilt i feel just thinking about not wanting to take care of him through the rest of his life. i’ve always taken care of my father. still, i get impatient, angry, and full blown triggered when he starts to “mentally check out”, or stumble, or forget things. it’s the drunk in him all over again, even though that couldn’t be further  from the truth.  he refuses to seek help, or answers, but it’s plainly obvious something is wrong if you were to meet him. it isn’t fair to either of us, i know this isn’t his fault,  but i’m starting to finally live my life outside of the “child of an alcoholic” narrative and i deserve to live my own life and look out for myself, for once.", are you sure it's not even partially his fault? i know a woman who has been diagnosed with alcohol induced alzheimer's,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/cbxx3v/my_dad_is_showing_early_signs_of_alzheimers_and_i/,,My dad is showing early signs of Alzheimer’s and I hate him for it.

"my cousin has lived with my mom, my dad, and i (19f) for about three to four years now, and she is aging to 26 soon. her job consists of part-times, of dominos and bars, which she often quits, comes back, changes to a different one, and shifts quite often. a huge alcoholic, comes home smashed each time she works as a bartender, thus the constant cycle of dropping in and out.she is a huge pothead, there was a time she picked me up from my highschool which is 10 minutes away, and just had to roll a joint while driving. she couldn't even wait, despite being allowed to smoke it in the garage, never in the house. though she does anyway, and i can smell that shit. oh yeah she gets creamed for it, but can't face confrontation so she cries, and says 'i'll move out,' and never does. my parents can't ever talk to her. weed is for that anxiety, but she can't maintain a full-time job due to the drug-testing, as my parents urged her to do. a warehouse my dad works would be a good start, even i'm working there for a while ($13 in my specific department) but she refuses to cut back.she used to pay rent, but stopped due to some emotional damage, but that was about 2 or so years ago. i understand people need to heal, but she won't see a therapist. i think she is fucking selfish and lazy, and enjoying this free lifestyle too much. grow the fuck up stephanie. she never pays rent, but often goes out to buy more weed, or the constant concerts she will go to. while managing to pay her own bills, previously she would have my grandma pay for her bills. she would take money without my grandma, with dementia, knowing. her side of the family, my aunt are a bunch of crooks anywho so probably should be blamed for the behavior.. as she is still on her mothers insurance, soon she will have to do that too, but i don't think she has considered that.her boyfriends are trash, one used to beat her, and the new one is 13 years older then her, as well as her boss. however he seems like an ass, as the first time i met him he tailgated me to my own house, and it took him a total of 2 months to apologize despite seeing him. he only did so because i went downstairs to the basement.oh did i mention how many times she snuck him over? my moms first impression of him was him coming out of our house to 'help,' and she immediately confronted if he spent the night. he admitted to it, and she often does this shit. my mom has a strict rule that everyone leaves by 3 am, unless there is a storm and/or drunk. it wasn't the first time she snuck him in. she can't go to his house, because he's illegaly living in a condo with his father that is specifically only for the elderly, as this man is going through a very intense divorce and fighting for his children. oh, by the way he can't be alone with them without supervision. weird, huh?but she has so many problems, like as shitty it is to say, who would date her? her emotional baggage is so much and she is super independent on people. her dad did abandon her, and her mother was a control freak who made a weed garage for her at the age of 13, so there is a lot of reasons. but holy shit, it's fucking too much. no one wants to, that's why she is always with shit-people, as no one decent would want someone who sounds 80 despite being 25 as she smokes a pack a day. coughs, like a dying person. refuses to admit her weight problem, and she isn't even that fat, she just doesn't want to admit she gained a few pounds and wears clothes way to tight for her. like she should be medium-large, but is wearing clothes in a size small.she steals my fucking food and doesn't replace it. admitted to it, and just laughed it off. sure i don't eat it often, but thats why i bought it, for me, as no one else but i eat it, so i use my own damn money to treat myself to those particular meats once in a while. damn it i'd like a sandwich without my fucking meat being stolen. she also eats my favorite chips, and while says she will replace it, never does. so i have to hide that shit in my own room, or god forbid the next day it's gone. same with soda, we'll have a whole case of it, and she'll drain it in about two weeks. my family doesn't drink soda except me and her, and i perhaps have two before the rest is gone.she'd drain that shit in a week if it wasn't for the fact she is gone majority of the week. when she is here i'm usually at work, and the rest of the days she leaves her mean ass cat. that cat is fucking mean and nasty, he beats up my poor cat so i have to lock him up for the day. she'll give him can food twice a day, on top of free-feeding, so he's obese. she used to be in my basement, so he followed along, and i was afraid of going in my own basement because he would chase me down and scratch the shit out of me. there was a time i instinctively kicked him because he scratched the hell out of my leg. i still don't regret it, and while nicer now, still a little shit.she was in the basement, but because the room was so cluttered, she would take the living room down there. i'd bring friends down and she would be passed out on the couch with all her shit there spread around and food all over. there are so many lighters underneath the fucking couch. there is mold in her room for she would leave water, and never clean it. she trashed that room. she couldn't even live in it so the family room down there was her room, so i had to bring friends to the fucking cat room, out of all places. i bring them what, once a month? not every day, once a month at the most. and when i got a boyfriend, there was no place to go, as he is strictly not allowed in my room. so we'd chill in the car.&amp;#x200b;i fucking hate her, sorry. it's been many years but i still consider her a stranger in this house despite moving in a main room. &amp;#x200b;grow the fuck up stephanie.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/cafn0m/i_hate_my_cousin_and_not_sure_why_my_family/,,I hate my cousin and not sure why my family tolerates her.
"i know it's not my fault and it's something that couldn't have been controlled by either of us, but i still blame myself every day for it and i don't know why.in december a few days before christmas, my 10 year old brother and i were at home alone while our mom was dropping something off at our dad's work. i was on my laptop, he was playing video games. it was super windy outside, the wind was up to 120 km an hour. i looked out the window and saw the tall and skinny trees swaying dangerously. i recorded it because they looked so flimsy like they could fall any second. i got scared one was going to fall and hit our house, so i went inside and told my brother we were going to walk to my grandmas house at the end of the road, as the trees there werent as sketchy. we walked there in the wind, all the trees were swaying hard and i had a horrible feeling. when we got there, i phoned my mom to tell her where we went. my dad told us to go home because it would be safer there than at my grandmas house, since the trees in her yard were rotting and were more likely to fall. we started to run home, and my brother was getting scared as the wind picked up more. he ran ahead of me and i was calling him telling him to stay with me. a tree fell in front of him, not even 10 feet away and hit a power line. the metal box on the pole exploded with white sparks, and i grabbed his hand and ran to the closest house. the tree was burning on the road and all the power was out on that street. we ran up a driveway and i knocked on the door and opened it, and took my brother inside. he was paralyzed by fear, his eyes were teary but he couldnt even cry. he just sobbed and stared at nothing as i explained to the woman in the house what happened, and she sat with my brother as i phoned 911. i immediately started thinking about what could have happened, if we had left just 2 seconds earlier he would have been right under the tree. my baby brother could have died and it was my fault for taking him outside in the first place. i called my mom and she told me to stay where i was, she sort of knew the lady whose house we were in (she grew up in that neighborhood and knew all the neighbors around there)we waited for her to get there, and she wasnt able to drive into the driveway because the tree on the road was in the way, so she drove us back to my grandmas house. she said we would walk down the train tracks behind the house to our house, which wasn't far. my brother and i both protested and said we wanted to stay at our grandmas, we had bad feelings about walking home. but she insisted, so we walked home. it was terrifying but we made it there. when we went inside, my poor brother was shaking and crying. i said i would cuddle him in my mom's room to calm him down, and right as we start to walk down the hallway, a tree hit the house. it wasnt even 2 feet away from us, and since we lived in a mobile trailer, it sliced right through the hallway and into the bathroom. i have flashbacks of it still, the hallway mirror shattering and glass flying everywhere, the roof falling in as i grab my brother and run outside with him. we ran up to the fire truck, which was still near the first tree that fell, and they let us sit in the fire truck. my brother, my mom and i all sat in the truck, and i went into a full panic attack as i realized all 5 of our cats were in the house. i started choking and couldn't breathe, so my mom got out to go back into the house and get me an inhaler (i have asthma and my panic attack caused me to have an asthma attack) i begged her not to go back in but she did anyways. i watched from the window of the truck, and told my brother not to watch the trees. he was so traumatized and i felt scared for him. as my mom came outside with the inhaler, another tree hit the house, slicing right through the living room, right where me and my brother sat before this all started. the tree hit the chair i had been sitting on with my laptop before this happened. my mom got back, and i watched 2 more trees fall in the neighborhood behind my house. my dad left work and came to pick us up, and at this point all the roads were closed, so we sat in our truck for around 2 hours. my parents and a volunteer firefighter, who happened to be my mom's childhood friend, looked for our cats. we got 3 of them, and the other 2 were seen but they ran and hid. we left them there for the night, they were outdoor cats and could find shelter for the night. we went to the fire hall to get emergency shelter, and stayed in a hotel for 3 days with our cats. we got our other 2 the next day, and my parents were trying to find a place for us to live 2 days before christmas. we salvaged what we could from the house, most of the christmas presents were okay. my laptop was on the chair that was hit, but surprisingly it still worked.we ended up staying at my great aunt's house, which was empty since she is in a dementia home. my parents still live there, but 3 months ago i moved away to a different city to live with my girlfriend (i am 18) my brother is still there with my parents, and every time it gets windy he stares at the trees for hours. i do the same. i still have nightmares and flashbacks to this day, and every time i hear loud noises i have panic attacks. after that happened i started to get sick every morning, i throw up almost every day. i always wake up in a panic, although that's gotten better since i moved in with my girlfriend. i try to move on, but i think i have ptsd. i was throwing up this morning, and i called in sick to work. i'm going in a few hours to the doctor, i've been there about my morning sickness but they couldnt find anything physically wrong. i think it's a psychological response to the trauma, and i found some articles about ptsd saying that it can cause digestive problems and stomach pains. i am irritable and angry all the time. i'm scared to reach out for help about it, because i have had a lot of mental health diagnosis in the past and i have never been on a medication that worked, and counseling has always been useless. i've been hospitalized long term 2 times, and i dont want to make it a 3rd. i am posting here because i just needed to rant about it, i cant help but feel that i am the reason my brother is traumatized, because i put him in danger. i can deal with my own emotions, but he is so young and it kills me that he is so pained."," instead of looking at how death almost happened,look at it this way. the choices you made kept you and your brother alive. you

"these are feelings i've been holding back my entire life.when i was little, my grandmother was diagnosed with early-onset alzheimer's. we'd started noticing her doing strange things, like driving the wrong way down a one way street she'd lived near for years, forgetting basic things, and constantly repeating herself.as a child, this was hard for me to cope with and i expressed it by being angry, sometimes even violent.people think alzheimer's is just forgetting or that it only affects the sufferer, but it's so much more than that. it destroys families from the inside out. it causes unimaginable suffering. i'd argue that at a certain point, this disease causes more suffering to the sufferer's loved ones than it does to the sufferer. alzheimer's isn't the bittersweet ending in the notebook. it's being embarrassed when your grandmother takes off all of her clothes in front of you. it's being horrified when she not only forgets who you are, but tries to hit on you.i remember the first time my grandmother forgot where she was and thought she was home. i was so sickened that i had to leave the room and nearly vomit. i've watched this woman go from caring for me as a young child to a shell of a human, barely able to string together a meaningful sentence and living in adult diapers.i feel evil for saying this but it would be so much easier on my family if she were to just pass away. no more anxiety attacks, no more crying, no more fighting. no more suffering. i feel like i've been holding my breath for 15 years and i want to know what it feels like to live again."," honestly bro, not really a problem. at this point you guys are caring more for a sack of flesh and meat rather than a person. it's not really your grandma anymore so i would just cherish the memories you had with her when she was healthy rather than focus on the shit shes doing now, because it's the alzheimers now, not her. her being dead would be like a hamster that you dont want to take care of anymore. i would feel the exact same way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bxo4o6/i_wish_my_grandmother_would_just_die/,,I wish my grandmother would just die.

"ive seen alot, from my brothers suicide, to multiple overdoses. it has fucked my head up completely. ive stayed strong though. but this:over five years ago: i moved in to take care of my grandparents, mostly for my grandfather when he got diagnosed with alzheimers. i took care of my family, went back to school, and got a great job in my field. about 2 years ago, when the disease really took its toll, i seperated myself from the emotional horror of the disease also while my stepmother was diagnosed with a brain tumor. i found myself distancing myself from the emotional trauma overall.  i literally just tried to leave the pain behind me. to the point i lost my job, girlfriend, and overall sense of joy. earlier this year: i was home and got a call from my grandmother that my grandfather had fallen while in one of his ""walk off"" episodes. i ran upstairs that connects into the kitchen, walked through the area into the dining room, and saw my grandfather on the floor, sitting up with a giant gash in his head, blood everywhere. all he was saying was ""im ok, im ok."" shortly after, he was put in a nursing home because he couldnt stop standing up and walking around while mumbling like a horror movie. two months later he was given a morphine shot from hospice that ultimately took him from this world. and i honestly think it was the most peaceful thing ive ever seen in my life. i watched him cry knowing he was losing himself, and i watched him struggle just to remember how to breath. i swear i just wanted him to go peacefully and without pain. and that was how he left this life.ever since then, ive never felt so comfortable of death. to the point that i wake up wondering why im not dead. i am truly scared, going to counseling, doctors, and trying to find something to take this feeling/urge away. i keep waking up to the nightmares of him covered in blood saying he is ok. i live my moments without fear and trying to remember that i want to live. yet, i am infatuated with the thought of myself dying, and am completely comfortable with it. my confession is that i dont want to live anymore, and im ok with it,  and thats the only thing im scared of.. . . being comfortable with death..", i imagine ppl wont even look twice at this.,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bvk1dh/ive_seen_so_much_death_im_comfortable_with_it_and/,,"Ive seen so much death.

"to place things in perspective, people say that i look exactly like my father. from the looks, to the mannerism, to how i talk, everything i do reminds them of my father. i am a carbon copy of my father. not to mention that my father passed away when i was young and from what i’m told he was a man to remember, everybody loved him and was devastated to hear the news of his death, i was only 2yrs old at the time. growing up my grandparents from the father side would always pay us a visit to check up on us and upon seeing me they would tear up and start to cry as i have mentioned i resembled my old man a lot. a lot of crying and stories would told through the years and i just wanted it to stop. i wanted them to stop being in pain when they see me and i did it by not showing myself to them. every time they would visit they’d look for me, asking where i was and my excuse would be i’m busy or i’m feeling unwell. i also stopped going to my grandparents house since i got tired of the crying and stories. i hated to see them cry and there was nothing i could do to stop them cry as my very image reminded them of their lost son. all of this would continue till i entered college. freshman year i got word that my grandfather was ill and was diagnosed with  alzheimer’s so i was compelled by my family to finally visit them after a whole childhood of avoiding them. i was finally able to see my grandmother and the first thing she does was hug me and look at me closely. all that was going through my head was if she was gonna start to cry and tell stories again. surprisingly she didn’t, she was happy to see me and asked me a question that i was too ashamed to answer properly “why did you stop visiting us?”  i froze for a bit as i felt ashamed that i stopped seeing them over my own selfishness and reasons. what kind of grandson deliberately avoid their grandparents? i wanted to say something just to fill the void that it took me to answer but my grandmother quickly shushed and told me not to answer as all she cared was that i visited them again. this lessened my shame for my self and got me the courage to talk to them again. my grandfather on the other hand was a different story. alzheimer had taken its toll on him, it had made him into a vegetative state confined to a wheelchair with a helper in tow his response was weak and fading remembering only a few. my sister was close to my grandfather would ask him questions to keep his mind active. when asked who we were he would say that he didn’t know and we’d have to say that we were his grand-son and daughter upon learning this he’d ask where our father was. we’d have to answer him awkwardly that his son is dead, hearing this he would pause then forget what we were talking about. my sister had an idea while taking care of my grandfather, she told me to take my glasses off and talk to him. i was uneasy with the idea but decided to do it anyway. upon going near and taking my glasses off and kneeling beside my grandfather talking to him for a bit and asking him questions. my grandfather looked at me as if he recognised me and began to call my father’s name “roy is that you?” moments later to our surprise he was restless and wanted to stand we asked him why his answer was heartbreaking for me “ i want to give my seat to my son, he has no chair to sit on”  everyone tried to calm him down as he kept trying to stand up and look for my dad eventually he forgot what was happening. my mom told me not to do that again. eventually i began to visit them once or twice a year, college prevented me from visiting them frequently. junior year mid terms  comes we get a call that my grandmother dies, we go to visit the funeral it was a small gathering only my grandfather was there but didn’t know what was happening, he spoke less and was always looking for my grandmother. few weeks later he followed her in her stead. a year had passed after their death and i’m here in bed thinking about how happier they could have been if i had visited them more often. i look back here and then of my action thinking was i right in not seeing them after all those years? did stopping my visits lessen the pain of the loss of their son? did my actions did them any good? was i a good grandson? my answer to my self would always be no. i will always regret not spending more time with them and that my actions were stupid and selfish as hell to deny them of seeing their son’s own flesh and blood.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/buxrfw/i_avoided_my_grandparents_on_the_fathers_side_of/,,[deleted by user]

"my dad recently passed away after a long bout with alzheimer’s. he’s been bed ridden for the past year and like a child for the past 5. why am i conflicted? let’s back things up a bit. growing up my father was a good provider and we always had the essentials but he had a terrible temper. he worked long hours for the bureau of prisons and it took a toll on him. growing up, if you made bad grades or angered him, we (my brother 4 years older and i) were whipped with a belt and/or beaten. mom divorced him when i was 8 but we still lived with him. if you got the belt, you had to drop pants and underwear and lay across the bed while taking uncountable lashes with a thick leather belt capable of holding his equipment while at work. as i got closer to my teenage years the belt came out less and i was slapped, punched and kicked more. and i’m not talking about pulled punches. imagine stepping into a ring with mike tyson in his prime and calling him “uncle tom”. (i’m white btw) thats how hard i got hit. a physically fit 40 year old man has significantly greater driving force in his arms and fists than a preteen boy. you might be able to deflect the first shot but you don’t have the stamina or reflexes to stop the rest.by the fourth grade i’d already learned to cover up the bruises and create the lies needed to keep the regular questions of the teachers unanswered. i regularly cried myself to sleep begging god, or the devil, or even death to take me if it would end the torment but apparently none of them wanted me. when my brother graduated and went to the army i was on my own and we’d moved out to a rural country home when i was 13. my father remarried a woman indifferent to his actions or my reactions so now i was trapped on a proverbial island with my abuser and the one witness who wouldn’t speak up for me. even when he wasn’t angry he verbally abused me, “n*gger” and “f*ggot” tended to be his standby insults. on one instance where my grades weren’t up to his expectations i was thrown into the garage and locked in wearing only a pair of tidy whiteys in january. i spent the night sleeping on the small square of carpet set aside for the dog. the worst beating came when i was supposed to dig a 10 inch deep by 6 feet wide by ten feet long trench across the yard so that a stone walkway could be laid. it was hot that year, raging temperatures and humidity.the one day i didn’t meet my quota for the day i was severely beaten until i went down and then kicked around the chest, back and head. i was 15 by then. that particular night is had enough of his abuse. he had a habit of sporadically waking up in the middle of the night to come downstairs and get a glass of milk and a cookie for some reason. so that night i decided to let fate decide what would happen. i loaded the 12 gauge he’d bought me for xmas with 3 rounds of double 00 buckshot and waited at the bottom of the stairs after bedtime. the stairs creak, so i’d have plenty of time to ready the gun and aim for he chest. i sat there waiting to kill him for what he’s done to me. the stairway is a chokepoint and nobody gets up from 3 shotgun rounds. after a few hours i fell asleep with the gun across my lap. my alarm clock was set to go off earlier than anyone else’s so when it woke me and i realized morning had come as that he hadn’t come down that night.  i unloaded the gun and went to school. a week or so later we were back to it with the punches and name calling. it was during these years that i found myself escaping to wander the forests after school or all day during the summer. anything not to be in or near the house. i let my imagination take me anywhere that wasn’t near the house. with a full canteen of water and a few cans of vienna sausages or deviled ham, you can stay away for days at a time in the woods. there’s always dangerous animals, but with a .22 rifle there’s not too much to fear. in the days that followed i used the large flat stones of the creek beds to dam the creek for swimming holes and used shovels and pick axes to build entire stone structures a place to be away from the house. i built shrines and alters to imaginary gods praying for them to send lightning to burn it all away but they weren’t listening either. in time, i was old enough to leave. because of my home life i couldn’t concentrate in school so didn’t even have the grades to get into college. i was healthy so i joined went to the military for a ticket out. i found the regimen to be simple compared to the scrutiny i grew up with. after 4 years i came home to my hometown, met again with the verbal abuse of my father on holiday gatherings. the first time he became angered with me for whatever reason he had the idea to lay a hand on me. feeling those sensations gain i snapped and beat him down until my brother and his wife pulled me off of him. after that i seldom visited and lived my life as i saw fit. work, college, marriage. life has been difficult as i have trouble connecting with others. in a way, my upbringing made me tougher than most and that rigidness has carried me when i think most might fail. i completely missed the middle school/high school years of basic socialization. i don’t have my fathers temperament and i try to be kind to everyone i meet because i know how it feels to be treated poorly. in time he mellowed and became more agreeable, but not completely.about five years ago when i visited my father i noticed his speech changed, he became absent minded. three years ago he didn’t finish sentences. it was around this time that he had another flash of his former self and tried to throw a punch at me. i easily dodged it and didn’t return for awhile. he became simple minded and ultimately had to be put in a home for awhile. i visited every week to check on him and i don’t think he recognized me. last year he went home to live with my stepmother who cared for him.   again without being asked  i checked in every sunday to offer to help. i fed him and changed him and carried him to bed. he recently died. his body just gave out. and when he did i held my stepmothers hand during the funeral and even have a eulogy to which pleased everyone.the person who made me not want to live is also the person who gave me the steel resolve to navigate the world with conviction and resolve.the imagination cultivated in tough times gives me the fuel to write novels for younger audiences, mostly science fiction (kind of starwars/harry potter/anime in a blender) but it’s one of the few things that brings me joy. it lets me escape when i need totldr:?so here i am. it’s a slow day in the office and i’m writing this on my phone. i’ve lost my father but also my most brutal abuser and i don’t know how to feel.  i’m sad but relieved and it’s really tough right now"," damn, i'm sorry. all i can say is that you've done a great job of not becoming like him and not keeping grudge. also, you have the right

i ran out of the house and just kept running until i didn't know the area i was in.  my parents were extremely upset with me because ""its his house, so its his rules"".  i remember the look in his eyes when i said that to him, he was shocked, as no one has challenged him for years on anything.  eventually my parents realized it was my mental health issues and not me just being an asshole for no good reason.  this happened almost a year ago and i still think about it most days. mostly the look of shock when i said that to him is what i picture in my mind, but just being out of control is the other aspect.  i know i'm not totally wrong in what i did, but it still makes me feel terrible to think about. its something i've discussed at length with my therapist, but i don't seem to get any closure or better feelings from our discussions on these topics. like they mostly treated me well, but i felt how they treated the women in my life was abysmal. &amp;#x200b;i should also mention, that my aunt called the police on me after this, so when i returned home they wanted to have me arrested for saying ""we hope he dies"" but the cops said it wasn't a threat and that we should just stop communicating permanently because if they returned i'd likely be arrested.  i only had one more week there before returning to grad school for my final year, so i just avoided him, but i would almost tear up if i caught a glance of him. &amp;#x200b;the thing with borderline personality disorder is you say absolute bullshit you'd never say otherwise and its extremely tough to get over things, where sometimes i'll be mad for hours about something others perceive to be minuscule. i also wonder if i would have just went along with his mistreatment for years if i didn't go off on him that day.  i'd appreciate any comments or support etc on this, as its definitely an odd situation.  best to you all my fellow redditors."," hindsight is 20/20, meaning everything is seen in clarity long after the event. your grandparents are not nice people. they sound like old school traditional set in their ways. and your parents are right. it is their house and they make the rules. the easiest way to put this behind you is to tell your grandfather you are sorry. don’t put blame on the disorder, take full responsibility. if you can’t do it in person, then send him a letter. whether he forgives you or not is not relevant. this exercise is to put this in the past once and for all and for you let it go once you’ve said it. we all do or say things we regret, but when we learn from them, that is the important thing. once you’ve made amends, you need to move on and be okay that you’ve set things right and formally apologized.  good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bl0wey/i_told_off_my_grandfather_when_i_had_an_intense/,,I told off my grandfather when I had an intense episode of borderline personality disorder.
" i was set to finish school last semester, but my dad got really sick and had three separate hospital stints, so i took a leave and postponed my studies to this semester. his first time in hospital was actually just before i was set to start classes, and the diagnoses (plural) were not good. my parents didn’t think i should retire from school at that moment, and i wasn’t sure that was the right decision either, so i went ahead for a couple of months. even before he went to hospital for the second time, i wasn’t doing well. i was only taking a couple of classes (including the final project) which didn’t require me to go to school often, and even when i was supposed to go, i rarely did. i did occasionally do research, but i never got around to writing, and i was even having trouble coming up with an argument to pursue.even before all of this, i’ve had trouble with anxiety and procrastination at school. i’ve been going to a therapist for a few years, and i take ssris. even so, it’s been a ride. the first time i went on birth control made me so depressed i failed three classes. ever since then i haven’t fully regained my footing. sure, i’ve stopped being depressed, but it’s very easy for my anxiety to get out of control. ive had some very good periods, and some not so good ones.back to today, procrastination and anxiety seem to be my new normal. at the beginning of the semester i was determined to write something i would be proud of, but i started putting it off. it was easy to read a couple of pages from an article and call it done for the day, or just say that the other two classes had closer deadlines and so were the first priority. in reality, i was just getting more and more lost and making things harder for myself. i started missing meetings and my anxiety of course got worse. i would talk to my therapist, we’d agree that i had to take control of the situation, and then i just… wouldn’t. while all of this was happening my family life wasn’t great, i wouldn’t say it was in imminent crisis but it wasn’t calm either. my dad decided to stop treatment for one of his conditions, so i’ve had to adjust to the ever more present reality that he might drop dead at literally any time soon. we had to put our dog down, and my grandmother’s alzheimers has gotten to a stage where keeping her in her own house even with a nurse no longer cuts it. my family is very small, and i’m the only young person in it, so i feel like all of this impacts me more than if i had at least one cousin.my family has been able to afford my schooling, but we do have loans, and my plan had always been to double major. i always talk about all this ambition that i have, about how i \*enjoy\* school, but i’m no longer sure if any of this is true. i’ve also thought i was doing well despite everything during all these months, and i’m no longer sure this is the case. my mum has been planning a small trip for us and our two best friends, and i’ve been wondering about that excited feeling you get when you’re about to have a great time, and i’ve realised i haven’t felt lightness in my chest in a very long time. of course, the situation i’ve put myself in only makes it worse. i don’t know what to do anymore. all i want to do is give up already, tell my parents i’m just not gonna make it, even though the backlash will probably sink me. i’m wasting a lot of their money, not to mention betraying their trust and confidence in me. how can i ask them to support me through a second major (especially financially) if i can’t be bothered to finish the first one? my therapist told me to just stick it out and get what i can done in this time, but i don’t think i can. i can’t bear to face my profs after all this time i’ve been absent from school doing nothing, and then show up with some half assed piece of work. i can’t bear to face my peers at the final presentation of this thing, and take criticism in front of them. i can’t stand myself and this hole i’ve dug for myself. and i hate that it’s so easy to say what’s the point.", what will your thesis be about?,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bi4d0s/i_have_two_weeks_to_finish_my_senior_thesis_and_i/,,I have two weeks to finish my senior thesis and I haven’t even started

"some background:my mom was a house cleaner. nothing fancy, but also nothing too terrible either: she was her own boss, worked 40-60 hours a week, had a car and a home, gardened in her free time, and took care of her cats. unfortunately, she didn’t have insurance and she had a pack a day habit, and it eventually caught up with her. she got breast cancer in 2003, then the chemo and radiation fried her arteries, and she had to have bypasses one after the other on all her major vessels. then stents. then she got a clot in her left leg, and in 2007 they had to amputate her left foot, and she went on full disability.then a bit higher. then higher. then the knee. then the other leg. all told, she had something like 150 surgeries between 2003 and 2018. she had her ups and downs, but it was always a slow, gradual, depressing erosion of her body, her spirit, and her finances. i gotta be honest: it was depressing as fuck to watch, and made worse by the fact that she was sharp-tongued and had a way of just...grinding away...any sympathy that those around her had. she was always asking for favors. little ones at first, but then they’d start...spreading. i called it ‘chore creep’: you’d be at dinner and you’d get up to get a drink and she’d ask if you could get her one too. sure, no problem. then she’d say, oh while you’re up would you mind taking the trash out?  it’s so hard for me to carry. ok, no worries. then while you’re out at the trash can she’d ask, while you’re out there, would you mow the lawn?now 40 or not i’m her only kid, so she can ask me. i don’t always like it, but hey; that’s what being a kid is. but she wouldn’t just do it with me. she’d also do it to neighbors, and acquaintances, and strangers in restaurants, and passersby on the street. it was very embarrassing, and she mortally offended some people without ever knowing it. anyway, about four years ago, she had one surgery too many and wasn’t really healthy enough to live on her own anymore. so she sold her car and trailer and moved into public housing for old folks. not a bad place: it was a converted apartment complex, where every apartment was private, but there was a nurse on call for emergencies. everything on the ground floor. she had an electric wheelchair to go get groceries and the like, and was in a good place. but i was her only family, and i lived six hours away. not much choice, i need to live and work too, and there’s no jobs in my old hometown. so she asked a good friend who is a nurse if she’d serve as her power of attorney. no problem. at first. as mom aged, she got copd, which meant she got pneumonia often, which meant she was in the hospital more and more. as this happened, her asks went from minor and annoying, to inappropriate and serious. things like, can you watch my cats for three months at a time while i’m in the hospital, on short notice, when you don’t have cats. can you pick me up at 3am and take me to the hospital, because i’ve called 911 so often for trivial stuff that they won’t send an ambulance anymore. she was in no way senile, but her incapacity just made her world...shrink. all she could see was her own immediate want or need, and no bigger picture. i did what i could to help, but there wasn’t much i could do beyond send her money every month. if i moved home i’d be working 80 hours a week in a menial job just to pay bills, and most of her needs i couldn’t help with. what she really needed was the money to go into a nursing home, and she didn’t have it. and she wanted to stay independent. i couldn’t blame her. once you move into a nursing home, you’re basically waiting to die. it seems like a last surrender of sorts, and i didn’t want to force her into that. but last november, the copd finally caught up to her, and she got a case of pneumonia she couldn’t shake. her doctor told me i had better get down there, so i dropped everything and flew down. sure enough, she was very weak, and ‘hospice’ entered the conversation for the first time. but her condition wasn’t terminal, just very serious, and mom still wanted to fight, and i don’t have it in me to tell someone they need to just give up and die. so i stayed there a month to help her, and her condition improved. in fact, it got better to the point that she couldn’t stay in the rehab facility anymore, and the discussion became, where do we send you? she couldn’t go live on her own, and nursing homes are very unpleasant when you’re poor and don’t have certain supplemental insurances. at that point, mom’s caretaker offered her a room in her house. it seemed ideal and fair: she and her husband are quite wealthy, she’s a nurse, their house is lovely, and they had a guest apartment set up from when her father had lived with them during the latter stages of his alzheimer’s. mom had babysat him every day, for free, for three years, and her caretaker wanted to return the gift as it were. my wife and i were delighted, but mom was oddly uneasy. she was grumpy about not going home, and didn’t want to pick a nursing home, but she also didn’t seem happy about going to her caretaker’s. then, the day before i was supposed to fly home, she took a whole bunch of laxatives, in an attempt to make herself too sick to leave the rehab facility. she had done this sort of thing before, so i thought she was just trying to keep me home, and so i told her i loved her and i’d see her in two months. then i flew home. the next day, i got a phone call from her caretaker, in tears. she had gone to drive mom to her place, and she had died in the car. the police were there now, i needed to come back, for the funeral. so i did. we mourned her, and buried her, and life went on.but now, over a year later...i’m pretty sure she killed mom. mom was 72 and had copd, so any adult could easily hold a pillow over her face. the autopsy would show nothing, and who would think anything of ‘very sick old lady on the verge of hospice dies’? her caretaker wasn’t getting any insurance or anything, so there was no motive. except not wanting to have to take care of mom anymore. and not wanting her under your roof. and not wanting to watch her suffer. so there you have it. i think my mom was murdered. i know who did it. i have zero proof. but i *know* i’m right. she killed her the way you’d put down a dog, and didn’t even feel bad, because she’s a hospice nurse. she sees old people die all the time. and i don’t know what to think about it. it’s obviously not something i can bring up. i’ve not even told my wife. but i gave to confess it to someone. so here you are, reddit."," what you're describing sounds like your mom did her peak before death. there's this thing that sometimes happens when someone is close to dying; so someone isnt doing so well and then they start to decline in health and such, then all the sudden seemingly out of no where they're better and they have all this energy and can do things (so in terms they ""peak"") and then with in the next few hours or sometimes day/days they pass away. i've seen it happen to a lot of people. for example i had this patient who came into the hospital i work at and she was declining in health rapidly, we put her in comfort measures and she became a dnr. then one day she was all the sudden better and talking again, her family was so happy they made her a full code again and started rehab again, then the next night she coded and we had to do cpr on a little old woman who's body couldn't handle it. body's work in mysterious ways. regardless:  i'm so sorry for your loss op",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/bb4rnv/im_pretty_sure_my_moms_caretaker_murdered_her_and/,,"I’m pretty sure my mom’s caretaker murdered her and got away with it, and I’m not sure I can hate her for doing it."
"i have only told maybe two people about this ever.  it is something i have pushed down for years, trying to make myself believe that it wasn't real, that it was some weird dream i had.  i'm pretty sure it was real, and that it happened.  the first time something of what i'm confessing happened, it involved most of my siblings.  we had this weird meeting in our attic, and i remember i was very, very young.  i think i had pissed myself and had just been changed or was about to be changed, and then there was *touching* stuff, if you get my drift.  the next time something similar happened, i was messing around on a bed and fell and face-planted my face onto my younger brother in some weird kiss thing.  now onto the meaty bits.&amp;#x200b;we had just moved to a new place and we were lonely, i think.  or my brother was at least.  so lonely he introduced me to sex.  which i didn't have a problem with, tbh.  i never had an ""it"" thing with any of my siblings before that.  i finally felt like i was apart of something.  one of the first times i remember was in the shower.  he slipped in, i followed some time after, and then we left in a similar fashion.  im not sure how long it went on.  i just remember we were kids, and i knew it was grown-up stuff, but i liked being included.  there was one time our little brother got involved somehow when the older siblings and our parents left, but most of that was we got naked around each other and me and the older brother did stuff.  it never really hit me until i started getting older that what we did was really weird.  i wish so much that i could take it back, or have a different childhood.  if i could smash my head against a wall hard enough that my memories disappeared, i'd be so happy.  i'm pretty sure it made me anxious and depressed.  as i matured i realized i didn't like sexual stuff, didn't like being entirely naked, and i gained body issues (courtesy of my mom, still love her though).  after high school i enlisted in the military and i lowkey hoped that i would die in a war.  certain demons came back to bite me, though, and i got out quicker than i thought i would.  i had severe depression and anxiety and wanted to die so many times.  other people had similar issues, yet somehow made it and that made me feel like shit.  ironic, though, because i enlisted to get away.  i hoped i could leave everything behind and become a new person.  instead i'm right back where i was, if a little different.&amp;#x200b;so those two people i told--my one and only bf, and my first therapist.  the bf i told because i felt like i had to explain to him (about four years older) that the reason i was mostly uncomfortable with touching and the idea of sex was because of that.  he told me that it happens to a lot of people and that my brother must have trusted me in some way.  it didn't help, but it kinda made me feel better.  the last night we had together before i had to go back to my duty station, i got super horny and he asked to have sex.  i said no, despite my body wanting to because it scared me.  i did let him jerk me off though.  he wanted to give me pleasure, but i didn't care about that.  i just liked kissing and holding him and talking to him.  he broke up with me the next month.  he never told me why, but i think it's because of the whole sex thing.  i didn't want to and he did.  i don't regret being with him, but i'm pretty sure i've decided that i'm ace.  i get horny and masturbate and feel shameful and guilty because i hate it so much but my body loves it.  i hate that my body likes it and i hate the smell it leaves on my fingers.  i hate that i watch porn now, and that it makes me want to be treated like that--like some sort of body puppet--or that i want so much to have something like that to own.  i hate that i can't tell people because they'll look at my brother differently.  he is a good guy, and we're good friends.  &amp;#x200b;i also recently found out that one of my grandparents has dementia and i really hope i get it too.  i want so desperately to forget because i feel like it's dragging me down and one day i'll just drown because my thoughts will get too heavy again.  i like to pretend that i am good at dealing with stuff, but i'm really not.  i hate myself and most everything i do nearly every day, despite the fact i'm taking meds and seeing a doc again.  my brain is supposed to protect me, and it kill me that it didn't want to protect me from that.  thanks for reading.  don't like talking about this shit so maybe this will make me feel a little better. or maybe i'll delete.  who knows."," life is really beautiful and wonderful, try not to let this consume you. i can't help but think that the more you talk about this, the better you might feel (especially if a therapist is involved). is it a possibility to have an honest conversation with your brother?

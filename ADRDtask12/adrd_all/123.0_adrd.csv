"my dad, who has had dementia over the last ten years, came over for the holidays. to help pass the time and to keep him occupied, my wife and i got a kid friendly jigsaw puzzle that he could play with our five year old. being that he lived abroad, i haven't had much time to see how the disease has ravaged his mind. i was completely unprepared to see dad struggle with the basics of solving the puzzle. i don't think he had any recognition of edge pieces should fit with edge pieces. he also had no idea you could rotate pieces around to see if they fit. in any case, it was hard seeing my five year old solving the puzzle in minutes where my dad was completely unable to put more than a few pieces together. he's seventy five and i am resigned to the fact that my dad has long gone and things will only get worse each year..what should i brace myself for the final years of his disease?", more of the same. good luck!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/adqbfy/what_is_the_next_stage_of_dementia_that_is_going/,What is the next stage of dementia that is going to take me off guard?

my nan has dementia. she keeps having these episodes where she’s remembering things from her past and thinking they’ve happened recently.for example the other week she thought that my grandad was still alive. i never got to meet my grandad because he died when my mum was 19. my mum is now 49.today she thought that her dog had only recently been put down. he was put down on the 27th november 2007.my mum keeps having to rush over to my nans house when she’s having the episodes to calm her down. because of this my mum has had to take time of work and it’s really stressing her out. i’ve gone with her a few times but i’m never really sure what to do.how can i help my nan when she’s going through these episodes? is it best to change the subject? or try and tell her all the facts and keep on the subject in the hopes that it will help her brain remember?also would it be time to start considering to find a home for her? no one on my mums side of the family seems to be able to cope with my nan and it’s not fair on my nan that she’s not getting the support she needs. she also told me today that she feels lonely so i feel that a home would be good for her as it would open her up to others her age who could also be experiencing a similar thing.," dementia is so tough, so individualized. there is no cookie cutter method. i am a nurse who oversees a 45 bed memory care unit and 120 bed assisted living/independent living community. i personally have no personal experience with my own family members going through this disease. when nan becomes distressed over events that are not happening, what i would traing my staff members to do is “join their journey”.  correcting someone with dementia may cause increased anxiety and anger as they can be truly living the events. if nan is speaking about her pup that passed remincse with with, talk about the pup. let her express herself and have her reminisce about the good times. another tactic is to redirect. ask her about her family, career, hobbies, interests or daily affairs-news, music, weather etc. this can “snap” someone out the anxiety driven episode. these are just things my staff and i would do in similar situations. regarding if it is time to look at other living arrangements my thougths is this. you and your mom are not alone. consult with nan’s doctor on recent events and her changes. if you do not feel she is safe being alone in her home i recommend changing her environment before a catastrophic event occurs. i have had new move ins to my memory that occured after a resident walked several miles in the middle of the night, freezing weather and fell-resulting in serious injuries and was found by passer-byers. this is not meant to be frightening or without compassion for you and your family, just want to be truthful and give experience. again, there is no one size fits all for dementia care.

"how is everyone doing? personally i find the holidays a very difficult time.my mother has had severe dementia for 3 years. alzheimer's. it was initially a slow but obvious decline for 5 years and 3 years ago my mom moved her to a nursing home (she has since moved because, although her dementia is severe, she is still very mobile and a bit of a liability). she forgot who her family were and who her husband was, but she remained the gentle, caring soul i had always known. during family get togethers (3+ years ago) she would get anxious and want to go home where she felt secure. she was always so gentle with her dog, and asked after ""the gentleman"" when my grandfather would pop out to the shops. when i visited her in her nursing home, she made a connection that she knew me, and when we visited her room she brought to me over a photo of my sister and i as young children and in private asked, ""how is the little one,"" and ""i'm happy to see you."" she squeezed my hand so tight. i am very aware it's easy to dismiss these comments as part of the dementia but i choose to believe we connected during that visit. my mom said as much in the car and i cried. happy tears. it was special. we call her ""mother"" because, when my mom has kids, she was not ready to be a grandmother. so sorry if there's confusion there (but, like, not really. i have my mom and my mother). her husband (my grandfather) is fortunately still with us and has all his faculties. i feel for him, really i do, and i have been told he loves her and visits her often. however, he has been in a relationship with a widow for over a year now and is spending huge amounts of time and money on his new lady, which my mom hates. we are happy he has found happiness, but there is a lot of resentment about how he has moved on to this new woman. she has a family of her own and very little time for our family, and is disrespectful to our mother - my grandfather's girlfriend wanted to go and meet her, before the family stepped in!i haven't seen my mother is a year and it tears me apart. i had a positive experience last visit, but my family have warned me not to visit her now. mother is functional but too far gone. i'm very torn. how are you all feeling with christmas coming?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/a7rlje/vent_xmas_with_my_grandfather_and_without_my/,"[Vent] Xmas, with my grandfather, and without my Mother"

"my mother has lived alone with in-home help for several years. she was never diagnosed with any cognitive deficits. we have suspected, but she is particularly non-compliant with the advice of medical personnel. i live more than 700 miles away from her.she recently had a fall that was very bad. she went septic and almost died. she was very incoherent when they found her. she made a recovery after several days in the icu, running iv antibiotics through an intrajugular central line and transferred to a rehab facility to strengthen her up. she attempted to sign out ama and was very non-compliant, but eventually we worked out an early discharge plan with home health services i arranged.she was home about two days and began repeatedly falling. she sounded drunk when she talked. she was unable to walk and i had to carry her to the bathroom. she had cigarette burn marks all over the house and her clothes. she had been urinating on the couch and defecating in a trash can. she sounded drunk, but mostly made sense. i had to call ems five times in 3 days to retrieve her from the floor. i made the 700 mile trip to retrieve her to bring her home with me.  the intent was to bring her home with me and get her stronger to come back to her home.during the trip, she hallucinated frequently. seeing little girls, thinking traffic lights were christmas lights, seeing pizza restaurants that weren't there. she attempted to eat the power window buttons stating they were her pills. instead of taking her to my home, i took her the hospital where i live immediately since this was definitely a change. she was asleep for nearly two days. she woke up still sounding drunk. her lab work was good. everything was good (acutely) and she was diagnosed with dementia. she was fairly calm, but continued to say she wanted to return to her single bedroom apartment. she was then transferred to rehab.she became irate, called my fiance a bitch, me a piece of shit, and seems to think we tricked her. she stated we tricked her by telling her we were ""adopting a baby"" and we haven't even remotely done such a thing. she began calling all her friends back home (700 miles away). she then had an episode in which she believed that everyone was being murdered at the rehab facility, and become so impossible to contain, she was then sent a psychiatric hospital.after a few days, she was diagnosed with dementia again. she refused to be discharged back to the rehab facility due to the supposed ""murders"". she hates me and my fiance at this point. the facility neurologist/psychiatrist thinks she needs 24 hour care.she has been calling her friends and states the nurses are stealing medicines and abusing staff. her friends believe her and are imploring me to sign her out of that place ama. they say she is caged like an animal and that as her son i need to remove her immediately. two people who are causing problems are her former home cna and her caseworker. they have lodged complaints with the state, gotten ombudsmen involved with official complaints, etc. they state she has been functioning for years without my intervention and that i have overstepped and need to return her. her family friends who begged me to come and help her because they were tired of getting her off the floor in the middle of the night are now telling me to basically sign her out ama and return her home.she apparently scored well on a memory exam, but the neurologist thinks that she needs 24 hour care due to delusions and hallucinations which seems reasonable to me. she definitely seems better to me now. i just know that my mom would not do well in a nursing home. her friends are tellingme they will take care of her, as well as this caseworker and aide, who have seriously been troublemakers for me. however, these were the people taking care of her when this whole thing began.so i guess my question is an ethical one: i think my mom would be very happy back at her home, but she has a very poor track record recently. i can't help but think that if she did well on a memory exam, and is just delusional maybe she could exist in her previous living situation?  i am currently on track to get guardianship and seek 24/7 care, but i'm racked with guilt over having to decide to put her in that environment. are these friends and her old caseworkers delusional? or am i just jumping to nursing home placement too soon. i did want her to live with me but i have small children and i am afraid her delusions and hallucinations place them at risk, especially at night."," 1. an elder of mine took a nose dive mentally following a bout with a brush-with-death respiratory illness.  basically went from what we all thought was mild dementia & not that much of a concern for living on their own to ""oh hell no, they need care yesterday.""  that level they were at while sick prompted us to get them in a home.  then, they rebounded close to mild dementia again for about 2 years before they reached that same more moderate-to-severe stage.2. if she's not able to care for herself, it's more think of your self as the parent or the adult in the room.  total role-reversal i know, but it sounds like she cannot evaluate her own situation.3. take care of yourself first.4.  if the current in-home care situation isn't working, it isn't working.  what's worked for many years may no longer work.  i had an elder couple that strived to stay at home until they passed.  one managed that.  the other wound up moving to assisted living a couple years before their death, realizing in-home care was getting too complicated.  5.  with the hallucinations she may have lewy body dementia.  just throwing that out there.  it presents differently than some of the other types and can have different medication indications.  >hallucinations—visual hallucinations—seeing things that are not present—occur in up to 80 percent of people with lbd, often early on. they are typically realistic and detailed, such as images of children or animals. nonvisual hallucinations, such as hearing or smelling things that are not present, are less common than visual ones but may also occur. hallucinations that are not disruptive may not require treatment. however, if they are frightening or dangerous (for example, if the person attempts to fight a perceived intruder), then a doctor may prescribe medication.

"the electric blanket has been on at night since the outside temperature has been below 70, so late september. the house is set for the most part 60-70 degrees.using the gas stove top to heat the house. we've had fights about this before. he's turned the thing on and gone to bed on more than one occasion, or i'll find him asleep in the kitchen with the flame at full. the fights and discussions must have gotten through because he doesn't openly do that anymore. now i'm not sure if he's having a coffee before bed or using the kettle to heat the house. i came downstairs an hour ago to a hot kettle and him in bed.watching tv all night and going to bed as the sun rises and sleeping all day. he's basically stuck in a cycle of waking up, voiding, eating (reloading), watching tv, and going back to sleep. he'll literally pull up a chair and start eating straight out of the refrigerator with the door open.not doing the dishes on the same day. he leaves the dishes in the sink to the next day so when it's his turn the day after he can claim that he did them yesterday. while technically true, he was supposed to do them the day before (the schedule is dad and i alternate days).the whistling will. not. stop. he'll be whistling for hours on end and if you stand in front of him and ask him to stop, he'll stop briefly and then start whistling again within 5-10 seconds, even if i remain in front of him - almost like i just disappear right in front of him.he does go to rehab three times a week but i feel from the way he is declining (recently unable to lift the coffee cup up to the microwave, for real?!) he's either going and not exercising or not going at all.thanks for letting me rant, advice is appreciated.", i got a baby monitor for the kitchen so i would hear when he was in there at night. this might help.  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/a0unb3/winters_coming_and_dads_already_ramping_his/,"Winter's coming, and Dad's already ramping his winter behaviors."

"over recent months my friend/uncle has had home carers 5 times a day. i've been coming in everyday, and noticed they fill out the care book sometimes about times when i know their not there. on some occasions stating they are there for times in the future. one day i suspected they filled out the entire previous days logs without ever being there.  my friend just recently came out of hospital for seizures, because a receptionist at the doctors cancelled his seizure medication because he failed to attend a review 2 months before he then has massive seizures. 2 months of no seizure medication which he has be on for a number of years. he has dementia/alzheimers for pity's sake he forgets to attend appointments, and how on earth was a receptionist even allowed, even by accident to delete medication from his repeat prescription.no one noticed this, the doctors, pharmacy, or even the carers who were meant to be giving him oral liquid seizure medication 5 times a day. these carers are a private company paid for by the state. his children who are my age live too far away to be there everyday. i live close by and try to visit everyday. i've noticed many discrepancies in the care package. yesterday another new person turned up who my friend had never seen, i was there. the carer knew nothing about his medication. new carers come in sometimes i've caught them just sitting on the phone watching videos. i've turned up at times to a totally new carer and they havent even recorded me being there, not even asked my name. i could be anyone.sorry if this all sounds strange im just a bit stressed from keeping an eye on my uncle and watching him not only deteriorate but have what i see as elderly abuse for lack of caring. i'd like for some suggestions especially if someone has already done this, for some sort of spy camera, it doesn't have to be ip/wifi enabled or anything. just good quality recordings, with time stamps. it needs to be able to record for 24 hours at least. hopefuly on an sd card that i can swap out everyday and go through the recordings to check the times of carers and whether they give him his medication regularlry. his children are all ok with the recordings, they are as frustrated as i am. btw i live in the uk"," i don't know about cameras specifically (brands, technology etc) though i would consider being more overt about this, putting cameras in plain sight with warnings will ensure the carers are doing the work they are supposed to do - then if you catch them doing otherwise, you don't have to address the ethical issue of informing them you have been secretly filming (as i feel like this could get you in trouble).  using the cameras as a preventative measure should be far more effective than filming in secret in ensuring your friend receives the correct care - if the problem is with a particular carer or agency, i'd go to them directly and look for a different care provider but otherwise, make it know that you are onto them, so to speak!

"i am the oldest of 3 siblings, and i'm retired. at the moment, my younger brother is caring for my mother, 86, who has dementia. he lives in her mobile with her and has a hired caregiver coming in twice a week for 4 hours each time, for bathing, etc. mother lives in another state from me and my sister (also retired). we all got together a month ago at mother's place and hashed out all the outstanding issues. i am the executor of the will, so my sister has offered to take mother to sis's larger house to live with her, but mother has steadfastly refused to go, saying she wants to die in her own home. mother is relatively healthy physically (other than incontinence issues). she refuses to use a walker, only a cane, and has fallen several times, no injuries though. her dementia is definitely getting worse, and this has been hard on my brother.here's the conundrum: sister says she can move in with her, but that she won't take mother if she doesn't want to go, and she won't force her to move. however, she also says that she won't take mother if it comes to a point where she doesn't recognize her as her daughter. to me, that is basically backing out of her agreement to take her. i called sis on this and she went ballistic on me and hung up the phone, saying, ""well, you take her then!"" my house is smaller than mother's mobile. what do you all think of this? i'm at my wit's end!"," that's rough. your sister is being selfish. she has to accept your mom's condition. there is a chance that her mind will progress that way. as caring children everyone should be helping out. it's hard on everyone mentally but you can make it work  if all of you cooperate. move her in to a bigger space, get the care givers, and take turns monitoring or whatever you need to keep her safe. remind her about her your mom  worked hard to benefit all you, now it's your turn as she  gets older.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/a048z2/catch_22_situation/,Catch 22 Situation
"so i have posted before about my father and his dementia and his gambling problem.  he totally messed up his pension and social security because he spent all of his money at the casino and of course he doesn’t remember that.  i finally got his accounts fixed and able to set an account for his spending money.  he’s always, dementia people do, always harping that someone’s stealing his money. i’ve been told that if they at least see it sometimes it will put that worry away for sometime. so i gave him his atm card 2-3 weeks ago. he forgot about it.  then this week, he remembered about it. saw his spending money and withdrew all of it. so now it is sitting in his hidey hole. thanksgiving he was itching to leave the house, but we got him to stay put. yesterday he said he want to go to his friend’s house. we let him, but all of us knows where he’s going. he took $100 to the casino. he never tells us where he’s really going (thank goodness for gps). so he’s not allowed to leave the house when no one’s going to be home. so this morning, he gets up bright and early gets dress and plans to head back to casino. he takes another $60 from his hidey hole.  so we try to stop him. he tells us that he’s going to philadelphia to see his best friend. we asked him if he bought his ticket. of course he didn’t. then he has a fit when we volunteer to go with him. this always deters him from going to the casino as he doesn’t want us with him. why the casino is bad? he gets there, spend his whole months allowance in 2 days and then for the rest of the 28 days in the month he has is accusing everyone that someone’s stealing his money. when he is there, he does not eat. he loses weight soo fast that 2 days he can lose 5-10 pounds. he comes home hagard and in a horrible mood.  there is one time i forgot to move his social security and he blew that money in 2 days. then we have to  deal with that personality for a whole month. he’s currently threatening to move out. he can’t be locked up like a prisoner. we can’t give him keys cause he keep losing them. that’s why he not allowed to go anywhere when no one’s home. someone will have to let him in house.  bit once someone is home he can go. however, when we hear the lie (going to play dominoes in queens, going to hang out with a friend) we try to deter him.  but this cycle is damned if you do damned if you don’t. most of his friends know there’s something wrong with him. his closest knows that he has dementia but some of the rest don’t know but can tell something is off but they humor him and take him so seriously. his sister has full blown alzheimers and he thinks 9/11 caused it.  he doesn’t believe he has dementia but just getting old with some forgetfulness. there has been only 2 incidents where he got turned about and couldn’t find his way home. someone had to get him. my father refuses to go to an adult daycare  service. we can’t afford a homecare person on his social security. my dad did nothing to prepare for his old age. i am waiting for his medicaid to come thru but it’s been a year. i am going to have to apply again. this sucks.  taking care of a dememtia person who has a gambling problem is the pits. thank you for listening. i had to vent."," nice vent!  sorry to hear about your situation.  it sucks and no mistake.  just a thought though... what kind of gambling is he doing?  could it be replicated at home?  you know, if it was a fruit machine obsession - perhaps try and source one.   definitely agree about the dead bank card & if possible getting power of attorney - those things help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9zzsya/dementia_fight_vent/,Dementia Fight Vent

"i''m wondering if people out there in redditland can provide some experience and advice on the transition of loved ones from private home to nursing / care home.my mother-in-law has been suffering from a form of dementia (tests are on going) for quite a few years.  she had been living alone since her husband died some 5 years ago and the disease has ever so slowly eating away at her independence and faculties.  a year ago my wife &amp; i moved her from her home in ireland into a small house a few streets away from us (in england) so that we could be on-hand to provide company, assistance and care.  over the last 12 months those three things have changed in order of significance.  we have nurses &amp; companions visiting two times a day to administer meds, food &amp; company and we visit in the evenings after work to walk the dog, stock the fridge, talk and provide evening meal.  at the weekends we can devote much more time and do shopping trips and family meals.it is strange and stressful as someone becomes mentally younger as they get older.  the loss of language and understanding of fundamentals of life such as time and functions of things like cookers, tv remotes, telephones, showers, dog bowls..   yesterday i did a small shop to re-stock the fridge and set about fixing a non responsive tv (usually a two second job!). i said ""how about a cup of tea?"" and asked if the dog had been fed...  simple questions but what a disaster!last week she could have easily fed the dog but not now. she: (coming into the living room holding some gubbins from the bin) ""is this the thing?"" me: ""no, that's not it"" (it is old pasta parcels taken out of the bin where i put it a few days ago). ""let me show you where the dog food is.  that needs to go in the bin - it is not good for the dog""  she: ""oh"".  the pasta shapes fall out of the packaging and all over the floor.  the dog leaps onto them and starts eating them faster than i can pick them up.  they are mouldy and *nasty!*   i salvage what i can and drop them into the bin again.she: ""there's no...  i don't...  where's food?""me: ""here's the dog bowl and his food"" (pointing to dog bowl &amp; food container on kitchen floor next to dog bed.)she: ""oh, but it is empty""me: ""no, it is filled with food"" (i open the lid &amp; show the food)she: ""oh""i know she can do this - i've seen it many times.  i go back to the living room to work on the tv and return to the kitchen after a short while to see the food in the bowl and the dog eating it.   phew.   i get back to the tv.  now, normally the tv is not functioning because of socket being turned off or some such simplicity but not this time.  we have sound and channel change but no visuals.  i get stuck into this and after checking cables, batteries, sockets, input device and running through a few re-boots i determine that the backlight has gone and the tv is done-for.  dang.  the tv is vital companion for the periods where there is no carer.i go into the kitchen to explain that the tv is broken and that i'll have to pop out and get a new one but i arrive to see a disaster zone in the kitchen.  she has taken out one of the ready meals i had bought (a rather large fish pie) and hand-scooped and squished the contents into the dog bowl.  there is food all over the place!  it's all over the worktops, on her hands and up to her elbows, on her face...  she is busy trying to wipe everything clean with a kitchen cloth but basically speeding fish pie everywhere.   i gasp and let out an involuntary cry of dismay.she: (angrily): ""what's wrong?""me: (deadpan) ""ah, oh, er.. no.  erm, ok.""she: (very angrily) ""i'm giving him his dinner.  there is no dog food!""me: (in dismay).  ""but there is! here it is (shows dog food)""she: ""no, that is empty so i've fed him this and now i'm cleaning""me: ""right, ok""meanwhile the dog is getting stuck into a massive pile of fish pie.  she continues to wipe and wash things.  i check the fridge and see that in fact the fish pie is not the only foodstuff that has been opened.  there is prawn curry too.  so the dog has had crusty pasta, dog food, fish pie and some prawn curry in the space of an hour.  this is going to have an impact...so, things have rapidly changed over the last few months, weeks and days.  her behaviour has become increasingly irrational and we have definitely reached the point where a home with other residents and 24 hour nursing has to happen.  the only alternative is for one of us to give up work to become full-time carers or get a live-in carer but what she really needs is company and a safe environment - not being closeted up in her own home.  not that she will see it that way.  i foresee tantrums and difficulty.as if by magic our preferred nursing home (nicest, friendliest &amp; they take pets!) advised a few days ago that our time on the waiting list is over and we can have a room next week.  we have said ""yes"" and will be moving her on on monday.  we know this will be a huge stressful event and are mulling over how we should announce it and perform it...  any experiences good / bad and advice would be gratefully received.    apologies for the diatribe - i couldn't stop it!&amp;#x200b;summary: dementia getting worse.  what are the do's and don'ts of transferring to a specialist care home?"," update:  we moved mother into the care home yesterday.  it was not easy.  she was furious. *livid*. i prepared the room ahead of arrival and we managed to cajole her into the car and then out of the car and into the entrance and then she refused to budge.   she did a sit-in on the porch but after coaching and coaxing and ultimately ignoring her she walked in by herself.we knew that if we had given her forewarning it would have made the move much, much more difficult.  we have a difficult week out two ahead but fingers crossed she will calm down and ultimately see that the community she is part of will be much healthier, safer and happier than being alone with this dreadful wasting disease (that she refuses to accept is happening).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9zpedk/advice_on_moving_from_home_to_care_home/,Advice on moving from home to care home.

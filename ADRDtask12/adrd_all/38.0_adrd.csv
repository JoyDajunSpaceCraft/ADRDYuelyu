"i care for my mother in law. early stage early onset. i dont know if the meds slowed it or thats wishful thinking, but she has declined alot slower than they prepared us for.anyways she has stopped washing her hands after using the toilet. when i am standing outside the door and know the water was never even turned on she will still say she washed already and fight me on it. any suggestions? "," thank you for all the suggestions. i went through this with my grandmother but moved away before the end. there were also many of us living in the house so there wasnt one person doing it all. it gave me breathing room to remember her as the woman before the progression of the illness. now with mil its just me and my two teenagers. i do everything to make sure my teens are not part of her care team, more than can you put a show on for mom or something like that. so its just me. i think i have forgotten some of the lessons i learned the first time around. for some reason i am having a much harder time seeing this young (relatively) and vivacious woman loosing things to the decease than i did my 80yo grandmother.

"not sure if catatonic is the right word, however i took my father to a new doctor today and every time i say alzheimer's or dementia he starts to get sick and wants to vomit.we have normally opened up the exam room door and walked around a little bit to calm down and then come back. today that did not work.my father basically laid back very slow and laid back into a state of complete inability. mouth open, completely rigid, and totally unresponsive with a very faint heartbeat.at first we were scared because it was a new thing, but he still had a faint heartbeat, and then he got rushed off to the er. by the time he got there he was awake and acting normal (for his stage).i'm kind of embarrassed to say that i wasn't that concerned because i feel this is just part of the disease, and no matter what i do, i'm not really going to affect it in those crisis moments.the staff took care of him just fine and he is okay fine in his managed care home now.as most of you probably know, he has no recollection of any of this.any advice on where this is going and what stage this might be in is helpful so i can help prepare my mother who is demonstrating very serious cognitive decline, and i'm certain it has a lot to do with this whole situation.tldr; dad went catatonic for the first time at a doctor visit. what is everyone's experience with where i may be, so i can prepare my mother?", ensure that you and your mother get a list of all medications they are giving him at the managed care home. they sometimes add stuff that isn't necessarily well tolerated.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7t2qml/took_dad_to_a_new_doctor_today_and_he_went/,"Took Dad to a new doctor today, and he went catatonic.

"usually he thinks he is staying in a hotel and sometimes asks if we are also staying there. we always gently tell him he's in a care center, usually using the term hospital, but of course it never sticks. well, tonight was definitely very different. he was crying through his dinner and was just overwhelmed at ""this nice surprise."" he couldn't believe we were there, even though we come every night. he was only diagnosed in october with mild alzheimer's. but a stroke in december took him down and now his short term is gone (and seems to be large swaths of his long term, although he is pretty clever at trying to hide it). we thought we still had years until we would get here, but here we are anyway.

"for the last several months, my 82 year old grandma refuses to eat. she has lost so much weight her pants keep falling down her hips. every single day it's such a struggle to get her to eat anything i just feel like crying sometimes.at breakfast, we give her a muffin or some toast with jam. she eats maybe half and hides the rest. we keep finding bits of half eaten muffin and bread all over the place. at lunch she says she's not hungry, that she'd rather tear out her eyes than eat, and plays with her food and swirls it around her plate and then declares she doesn't want anymore when she didn't even take a bite. after much prodding, we get her to eat, except not really. she just chews and chews and chews and then spits it out and never actually eats anything. the rest she tries to sneak to the dog. at dinner we repeat the same routine. when we insist, she gets angry at yells at us to shut up and leave her alone and acts like us wanting her to eat is because we just want to find a reason to get mad at her.i am at my wit's end. we've taken her to the doctor, there's no physical reason for her loss of appetite. i've looked up psychological reasons, but that's not it either. she never eats alone. my grandpa and myself always eat with her. my sister often joins us as well. she always has company. we try all sorts of different foods. the easiest thing to get her to eat is sweets but even that she's starting to leave.what gets me the most is that, if we take her out to eat, she'll devour the food. it doesn't have to be anywhere fancy, just as long as she's out of the house. we take her to a diner, she'll eat and ask for seconds. we took her to my sister's boyfriend's house for christmas lunch, she wouldn't stop eating.the only thing i can think of is that she's bored of being in the house. sometimes she forgets it's her house, maybe that's why, but most of the time she's aware. the problem is we can't afford to be taking her out to eat for every single meal. we've tried picnics where we bring food from home, but it doesn't work. she acts bored and won't eat. maybe it's the cooking she doesn't like, but it's the type of food she always ate and used to enjoy, and we've tried all sorts of different foods. if we bring take out she won't eat it either.i've tried asking her if she doesn't like the food or if she's bored of being in the house. i can't get an answer. she gets mad at me and tells me to shut up and stop pestering her and that she just doesn't want to eat. it's not like she stays locked in the house all day, we do take her out, but as soon as she's back home, she forgets she was out... i just don't know what else to do. i feel like i'm being forced to watch her starve herself to death.", get her some weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7s6unf/grandma_wont_eat/,Grandma won't eat

"hi all, thanks for everything on this sub. been reading a lot of helpful stuff. so my mom has been losing her short term memory for a little over a year now. a few months back she started having episodes where her entire left side would feel numb, and she would lose some muscle control. a couple of er visits confirmed it was not a stroke, we tried to follow up with mri’s, but she can’t handle them at all. a visit to a neurologist resulted in the need for more tests, and the doc said he thinks it could be something neurodegenerative, but no solid diagnosis yet. he prescribed 5mg of haloperidol twice a day, which seems to have done wonders for the episodes she was having.two weeks ago, my father died unexpectedly. he felt sick for a couple of days, then collapsed on his way back home from the store just across the street from their house. i am completely devastated, and feel totally lost without him, just on a personal level- but he was also my mother’s caregiver, more than we realized until he was gone. it turns out he was keeping quiet about how bad her memory and understanding was getting. without him now, my brothers, sister and i are finding out how badly she needs care. her long term memory is fine, in fact she’s pulling out stories we’ve never heard before from 30, 40 years ago that check out. her short term is declining though- she doesn’t remember why she’s taking the haloperidol, doesn’t remember the trips to the er. she doesn’t remember what day of the week it is, and forgets entire recent conversations frequently.a major issue with getting her the care she needs is her immigration status- she’s not a legal resident. in fact, i just found out two months ago that she and my father were never actually married. the house is totally paid off, and her name is on the title, so there’s that- but it seems like she’s entitled to nothing else at all. my siblings and i are able to pool together money every month to keep the taxes, insurance and utilities paid, and maybe pay someone out of pocket for some time with her every day- we still haven’t done the real math, but the ballpark figures seem manageable. i guess what i am looking for here is any sort of advice or information- how would i even start to get help for my mom? we’re in ny. i’m not sure yet if it would be feasible for her to stay home, my sister and i are taking turns spending the night there with her and leaving for work in the morning. the first two days were rough, she took the wrong amount of medication the first day, so from now on we know she’s only to take pills when we give them to her. we are planning on shutting off the stovetop and getting her a microwave (although she always hated microwaves, which is why she doesn’t have one already.)", check with an attorney  that deals with immigration and or an attorney that is familiar with elder care,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7r1ern/any_advicekind_words_appreciated/,Any advice/kind words appreciated!

"today i received a message that my great-grandma was taken to hospital. my great-grandma is in her early 90s. i'm not sure when or if it was diagnosed but i think she has alzheimer’s, in which she started showing symptoms for when she was around 86, maybe earlier. in hindsight it's clear to see why but i believe she started showing symptoms of dementia when she started to accuse my uncle and my cousin (his son) of stealing from her, which she adamantly believed happened. this may have coinsided with some home renovation carried out by the council, i'm not sure if anything was actually stolen but she seriously believed my uncle and cousin did it which led to friction and upset. fast forward a year or so later to the next time i saw her and it was clear that her memory was detiorating, she remembered me but she seemed struggled to remember the last time she saw my nan (her ex-daughter-in-law which visited her the day or week before). as i left in the car (with my mother and aunty) i  was upset as it was starting to set in that the grandma i loved dearly was starting to fade away, doubled with the news that my mum told me in the car that she also accused her of stealing several items.these accusations have upset my mum deeply and she has not seen my grandma since (i have since learn that accusing people of stealing happens regularly in those diagnosed with alzheimer’s and told my mum that it wasn't my grandma talking).fast forward another 2 or 3 year later to last september and i went to see her with my nan, which was the first time i saw my grandma since the prior visit (i was conflicted to whether i should  go to see my grandma anymore or not her and at the time i didn't know accusing family of stealing was connected to her illness). although i was expecting her memory to have worsened i thought she may she have still remembered me. but it wasn't until she asked who i was, who my mother is and how i was related to her did my heart drop. i had to contain my emotion as i was on the verge of crying infront of her and my nan.i haven't seen her since and i am constantly filled with regrets and emotions...would she still have remembered me if i saw her more often? i can't but help thinking that in her time of need i abandoned her and left her without a reason to why i stopped visiting her. what makes it even harder is that i can't even apologise for what happened and tell her that i'm sorry."," >fast forward another 2 or 3 year later to last september ... she asked who i was, who my mother is and how i was related to her ...>would she still have remembered me if i saw her more often?i'll answer you last question first and say that no, she wouldn't. she might have remembered your name and would have brought it up in conversation with other people, so it would have appeared that she 'remembered' you but it would have been hard for her to link the name to the person in front of her.my mil, who i see at least once a week, knows my name especially when she links it with my husband's name. when i'm in front of her and on my own she never refers to me by anything at all, although i think she knows she should recognise me because she knows she sees me regularly - i often wonder if she thinks i'm one of her carers. it's only when i'm with her son, my husband, that she seems to link the two things - name and person.she has other children whose names she mentions, always as ""x and y"". she hasn't seen one of them for over a year, the other visited almost two months ago after a twelve month gap. after they'd gone she did know she'd had visitors, didn't know who it had been. she never, ever, mentions her children's spouses names. she has grandchildren and great-grandchildren, she is muddling their names and ages, and muddling recollections of time spent with them - we never correct her, because she thinks we're being nasty or are 'bullying' her when we do so.the loss of language is a fickle thing and it can trick us into thinking they mean one thing when they actually mean something completely different.they say, ""i did it yesterday"" - but don't actually know when yesterday was, just that it was in the past. the word they choose to use is almost at random, and is interchangeable with 'last week', 'months ago', or 'ages ago'. money is another example and coins could easily be shillings, half crowns, ten pence, sixpence, two and six, pennies or pence. notes can be, interchangeably, a pound, ten pounds, twenty pounds, ten shillings. they are all money, but the nouns are just used incorrectly and is one reason why people with any form of dementia can be easily tricked financially. imagine somebody opening a purse or wallet stuffed full of £20 notes, and handing them all over for something that costs £5 - because they think they've got a purse-full of ten shilling notes (now equivalent to 50p). it can happen all too easily.>these accusations [of stealing] have upset my mum deeply and she has not seen my grandma since (i have since learn that accusing people of stealing happens regularly in those diagnosed with alzheimer’s and told my mum that it wasn't my grandma talking).we have been accused of stealing to our faces and behind our backs. she has told relatives, care workers, doctors, and social workers that we have taken her money. we have not been questioned by the police, we have not been locked up. it happens, it's quite a normal thing for people in the early/mid stages of dementia to believe.my husband and his siblings share financial power of attorney - she afterwards managed to convince herself that the visit to the solicitor to arrange it was so that we could steal her money.we have been told that 'he' (random man she reckons she knows) will 'sort us out' because she, ""knows what you're after"" (i.e. her money). our relatives have been told that we went into the bank, and were only stopped from clearing out her bank account because, ""a nice lady phoned and asked if it was alright for these two people to have her pin number"" (thank goodness she was savvy enough at that time not to fall for that telephone scam, and thank goodness the relatives told us about the incident). we have been accused of ~~taking~~ stealing items of furniture - that we agreed to store for her because her flat was overcrowded. we returned them, and she still complains that these items are in the way.we've had her screaming at us down the phone, accusing us of all sorts of ghastly things and meaning that we've spent hours talking things through and debating whether we can carry on - when we know the rest of the family can't, or won't, do a single thing to support her.each one of these things hurt, it hurt like hell. it still hurts when we go and help her through some medical incident/emergency, and she then tells other members of the family that we've made it all up - of course she didn't have a fall, and of course the paramedics didn't come to see her. she's fine!she still has occasional tantrums with us, and says she never wants to see us again, or wishes that i would die of dementia because i'm lying about her having it ... thanks to some stupid doctor sending her a report of an assessment.you have to take all this on the chin. it isn't them, it's their very broken mind talking and trying to make sense of things that they don't understand, because they have very limited memory.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7pl1gf/if_only_i/,If only I...

"my mother is 65. she has told me herself for about 10 years that she thinks she is getting alzheimer's, or something like it. she feels like she is losing herself. we have some family history of i guess what you would call dementia, but mostly after people had suffered from strokes. my mother has degrees in psychology and computer science. she is a smart lady who had a great career. but, she has changed.my mother repeats herself--a lot. she will say the same thing over and over in an hour, a week, a month. it's like a record that skipping. we always tell her, ""yes, you just said that."" she has been doing this for a few years now. she gets stuck in a loop, sometimes for hours or days at a time repeating the same stories that catch her fancy. she loses things and forgets things. but, she seems otherwise pretty functional and serves as a chairperson for a really big non profit. she writes emails and gives speeches and seems ok with a lot of responsibility. she watches jeopardy and does pretty well. but, then in day to day interactions, she falls into that skipped record pattern again of repeating herself over and over like she doesn't remember what she just said. if you tell her something new, it's like she isn't paying attention. she replaces what you just said with another memory. i can say, ""mom, i just got a promotion at work."" she will say, ""that's nice. i am working on this project."" not in a narcissistic kind of way. it's like she isn't processing anything i just said. she will ask me, ""how's work?"" i say, remember, i got a promotion? she says, ""oh yes, you did say that. did i tell you about my project?"" yes, mom, you did--several times. 15 minutes later she asks, ""how's work?"" me: i got a promotion. her: that's great. i am working on this project. and so it repeats.and, she is really moody. she goes from happy to angry in a heartbeat, and then back to happy again. the smallest thing will set her off. she can remember things from years ago in great detail, but not remember what you told her an hour ago.she also drinks quite a bit. she's not an alcoholic, maybe 4 drinks a day. but she has a cocktail at 4 pm and has a few glasses of wine after that until bed. she's not getting hammered, but it's enough to make her ""jolly"". i wonder if she isn't drinking to cover up her memory lapses. it certainly doesn't help. and it could explain some of the moodiness.she also used to have a job as an executive in computer programming, but she quit to stay home and take care of my brother and never really got back into the workforce. as a woman in her 50's, i am sure it was hard to try to go back to the technology field. i know that staying at home made her skills in the tech field obsolete. she tried to go back to grad school but quit for various excuses. i don't think her pride could handle going back and not being the best against 25 year olds. and, i think that she had a problem memorizing the work for the classes. so, she just started staying at home more and more, and she wilted. so, i don't know if this is just a case of depression. and my stepfather doesn't help. he covers for her and enables her. he works long hours but still comes home and makes her dinner. i have tried to ask him, ""don't you think that maybe there is a problem with mom's memory? have you tried taking her to a doctor?""  of course he isn't going to ask his wife, ""do you think you have early onset alzheimers?"" and i can't ask her. but, she thinks she does.i know this sounds like a depressed older middle aged lady who drinks a bit too much, doesn't listen to other people and maybe needs a hobby. but, my mother has changed.", she need to start taking medication now if she has dementia. if she puts it off she will decline faster. maybe that will get her to seek out a diagnosis?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7o9f6d/my_mother_things_she_has_beginning_stages_of/,"My mother things she has beginning stages of Alzheimers, or something related but my stepfather isn't doing anything about it, and they are both not doing anything to address it .

"there have been some interesting studies of reversing memory loss via osteocalcin- a hormone produced in the bones.osteocalcin is produced in the body via nutritional intake of **calcium + vitamin k.** *gamma-secretase cleaves amyloid precursor protein (app) to generate amyloid-beta (abeta) peptides, which aggregate in the brain in alzheimer's disease (ad). gamma-secretase also cleaves molecules that regulate osteoblast activity, such as notch and ephrinb2.....*basically, what that means is that amyloid beta plaques develop when there is a deficient supply of osteocalcin and ultimately leads to neuronal death involving an imbalance of intracellular calcium homeostasis via activation of calcium channels, intracellular calcium stores, and subsequent production of free radicals by calcium-sensitive enzymes. thoughts?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7gczlg/osteocalcin_a_hormone_reverses_memory_loss/,Osteocalcin - a hormone reverses memory loss

"hi all - this is my first post here, but i appreciate the advice and generosity others regularly offer on this subreddit. it's been helpful to me even as a lurker. my dad is 78 and was officially diagnosed about a year and a half ago (with symptoms a few years before then). it's been a gradual decline since the diagnosis, and while his short term memory is pretty much shot, he is still able to have a conversation, recognize everyone in his life, etc. i would guess he is in the early to middle stages right now. i'd also say the cognitive condition has been relatively stable for the last year.there has unfortunately been a corresponding physical decline. his neurologist does not think it is because of the alzheimer's, but thinks there is another neurological cause that we have not been able to identify yet. in any event, he stopped being able to walk about a year ago, and is in a wheelchair (occasionally he can use a walker). over the past few months, there have been a number of inexplicable accidents - he can't ever seem to explain what's happened, but my mom will get home and find some diarrhea on the couch. i don't live at home, so this all falls on my mom. but when i do go home, i find myself fixating on manifestations of the disease (like a mess on the couch) and i get either critical or depressed and can't stop focusing on it. we have a week-long family vacation coming up next week, and i am stressing about the process of getting him there (airports, transports, etc. are a huge pain), but then also worrying about how he'll be when we're there: accidents, doing stupid things, etc. but he genuinely wants to be included on these trips, so it is important to bring him.does anyone have any coping mechanisms for just enjoying the moment and being grateful for what i do have, rather than constantly focusing on the disease and getting upset / critical / depressed / grossed out? my reaction comes from a good place but it doesn't make anyone happy. it's almost like these signs shatter the image of what i want things to be like.tldr - i obsess about symptoms of the disease and just get critical or depressed. how do i enjoy the time i do have, especially on an upcoming vacation?"," you've had some brilliant responses about the holiday, so i'll just mention this one>my mom will get home and find some diarrhea on the couchmy mil goes to a day centre. they have 'covers' on all the seats in case of accidents. they're fluffy and washable. it might be worth getting some for at home, so accidents can be easily and quickly sorted out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7d0ytu/coping_mechanisms/,Coping mechanisms

"my grandfather and his partner (they are not married, and she is not my grandmother) both have alzheimer's, albeit different forms. in her case, she spends most of her days sleeping, and also wets herself all the time. my grandfather can keep the house clean, but cannot answer questions, says ""thing"" for pretty much everything and ignores hunger. currently, he has a driver's licence, but his doctor refuses to allow him to get a new one. this is kind of a big deal, because he lives in a town where everything is pretty far, and it is somewhat needed, because he doesn't remember the name of his bank.they are currently followed by a social worker (i live in québec, canada), and she's doing nothing because my grandfather is clean. for example, she noted that their kitchen is really clean, but that's normal, because he forgot that he's hungry and doesn't eat for days. his fridge is empty. she notes that his partner doesn't make trouble, but that's because all she does is sleep all day long. my grandfather is the primary caregiver for her, and refuses to allow anyone else help her because of his pride. he also gets really angry whenever someone suggests help/that he has alzheimer too.the social worker doesn't want to do anything about it ― ""technically"". all she does is offer help. we + my grandfather tells her that his partner wets her bed every day, and nobody cleans it, so the solution is when it gets too wet, she goes to the second bedroom until that one is too wet, where she goes back to the first room. she was also hospitalized for a while ― we're not allowed to know the details, because we're not blood-related to her and she's not married to my grandfather. her side of her family is pretty much non-existant, so we're the only ones who can offer help for her, but we cannot know anything about it. my grandfather claims that she was hospitalized because she didn't leave her bed for 3 days straight, but he also claims that she's 27. we also don't know for how long she stayed at the hospital nor why she was allowed to go back home. we have no idea of the condition of their bedrooms because they get angry when we want to go upstairs, and the social worker wants to respect their wishes, but we believe that there might be maggots.the social worker told us that it was our job to feed them and help them, suggesting that we should buy them meals that we could bring to them every week-end, and they will send a helper to heat the meals. now... i 1) don't have the money for a taxi for 2x90min drive weekly (neither do i have the time...) 2) my grandfather has a lot of money. while we understand that social workers are overloaded and that yes, family should help... it's just not an option. nobody in our family can afford to just quit their job so that my grandfather's partner doesn't spend her days sleeping in her excretions and force them to sit down and eat. my uncle is especially upset at the suggestion that he should pay for their meals when they had always been ungrateful to us, to the point that they would get upset when we didn't feel happy when their holidays gifts were a bag of chips or a tube of jam they got for free. now i know that we sound heartless... especially since it's money issues, but is the only option left for us is to wait for them to die? the social worker does acknowledge that my grandfather is melting, as he's now about 145 lbs for around 6' at 80y.o., she does know that they most likely don't take their medicine, as the helper just gives it to my grandfather and leaves, since his partner is always sleeping (she also told us that the helper sometimes forgets to deliver the medicine to their house). she's aware that his partner spent probably around a month in the hospital because she's always in bed, she did hear in our presence that his partner sleeps in her own pee for around 20h daily, but because my grandfather refuses help, she doesn't do anything.(as for the money issues; my grandfather is so rich, he pays $100 daily to have someone open the tv for him.)what can we possibly do? is there really no options as long as my grandfather refuses any help?", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7briyh/how_to_help_family_members_that_you_cannot_visit/,How to help family members that you cannot visit often?

"my father in law refuses to accept that there's anything wrong with him, and he's a danger on the road. the problem is that he's never driven much during his life (he always used public transport), so driving isn't really muscle memory for him. my mother in law is a much better driver, but he insists on being ""useful"" and driving us everywhere when we visit. he shoots in front of speeding cars (""that's what his brakes are for!), drives on the wrong side of the road, swerves, etc. at the moment we're ""jokingly"" commenting on his driving (""watch the pedestrian/cyclist, dear"" ""are we in england now?"" ""woah, look at that, we nearly didn't see him there!"" etc.) but we need him off the road before he kills himself/us/someone else. it's impossible to talk to him about anything to do with alzheimer's, he just gets very angry, and we have no idea what to do.", i'm going through this same thing with my dad. i had to move him cross country to be with me and when we got here i told him the truck broke and its in the shop. just put it in storage. he gets mad when i tell him he can't use my car and just nod my head when he says he needs to get his truck and drive back home. its tough and probably the beat  is going to be just hide the keys and say you feel like driving. if/when he needs to renew his license go with and let the dmv know he needs to be tested. getting a license pulled ia near impossible until they kill someone driving. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/77zy0a/my_father_in_law_can_no_longer_drive_how_do_we/,"My father in law can no longer drive, how do we explain this?"

"today i had to hear my nana cry twice over the phone. once in the afternoon about how lonely she was and then one in the evening after i had left from coming to visit her. it hurts so much to hear her cry like that, i thought seeing her would make her feel better. i can't tell if it made it worse or not. she's always been a rock in my life, someone i could always turn to and now i've become that for her. i know i'm trying my best and doing anything i can but it never feels like enough. there's only so much an 18 year old who can't drive can do. i never thought i would be doing this. i'm not alone in helping her but you know my parents are already busy as it is. i just miss the woman i grew up with on nights like these. i feel bad for that too, she's still there. i love her so much. i just needed to vent a bit, no one i know understand what i'm going through.if you read this through, thank you and i hope your day was a little brighter than mine."," being a rock for your grandparent at 18 years old is going to make you into an awesome person. things are not going to get better for your nana, but you being there with her is a wonderful thing. i don't know if you believe in god or that it was happenstance, but i guarantee this will make you a stronger person. it will make you a better mother/father, friend, employee, everything. i don't really have much advice or know if there is any that can make much difference, but i will say 2 things.  enjoy the time you have with her.  and that it's okay to cry. try to tough it out until after the call but let it out.  i'm not sure if i helped you or not but i had to write something because i am breaking down myself. you are not alone. 🤗",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/77bv2z/i_just_really_need_to_vent/,I just really need to vent.

"first, thank you to the moderators for accepting my request to post here to find beta users for our app.  my grandmother passed from alzheimers.  i currently have a son with type 1, and i have a friend who is caring for her mother who was diagnosed in 2015 with alzheimer’s. we both saw a need for a better way for us to manage communications concerning the care of our loved ones. this friend is developing an app that all families involved with caring for a loved one can use to help manage communications between family members and daily tasks to help keep our loved ones healthy and alive.  we were tired of communications through texts and emails, and hope this tool will help all of us better manage our loved ones' conditions by having their information in one place for family to access at any time from anywhere.  we need others like us (caring for family members with alzheimers and other chronic conditions) to help test this app to see if it really meets the caregiving needs of our users.  there will be no charge for this app when it is released, hopefully in january of 2018.  to participate as a beta user, you need to have an iphone or ipad, be involved in the care of a loved one, and able to test the app during the months of november and december 2017.  let me know if you would like to help!  thanks for considering.", i'm happy to test!  say when!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/75stzz/looking_for_beta_testers_for_an_app_to_help_our/,Looking for beta testers for an app to help our families.

"⚠️ warning: this story involves poop💩so my woes of today, as they often do, began yesterday.  yesterday i was tired.  that tired that is as much mental exhaustion as physical.  i have not been practicing good self care and it's catching up to me.  so i called in a favor and swapped a caregiver for the afternoon/ evening rather than helping me the following morning.  we had a dermatologist appointment the next day mid morning so the caregiver was happy to get more hours today than she could get tomorrow.  i spent the entire time sleeping as well as most of the evening.  it was amazing. the most sleep at one time that i have had in months.  in the exhaustion i forgot to set an alarm for the morning.  i normally don't need an alarm and i tend to set them up as more of a reminder than anything but my sleep of the dead had other ideas.  i wake up at 7am, an hour and a half before my so's dermatologist appointment. i think oh i really should reschedule that but it's with the va and takes weeks sometimes a month to get in and there is a scary looking spot that needs to be checked, so instead i rush into the shower and rush my so through his.  he is unhappy at being rushed and confused by it.  i have no one to blame but myself and alzheimer's so i soldier on.  as we are late i toss an ensure in the car for him to hold him over and resolve to have brunch after the appointment.  before leaving the house i ask my so if he needs the toilet, he replied ""no"", this is his stock reply to this question and has no basis in reality but because i'm late i accept it as reality.  on the drive (which takes about 30 min) he spills the ensure all over me.  again had i woken up early as usual it would all be fine, oh well.  i clean up as b st i can using wet wipes from the accident bag i carry in the car (has bathroom accident supplies for my so) and tuck it into the bag of the wheelchair we use when we have to go to the va (it's a massive complex that is built up over time so you occasionally have to go from building to building and it's a bit much for him).  we make it and check in at the kiosk about 3 mins before his appointment time, and sit down for the inevitable wait.  just as i'm starting to force myself to relax my so tells me he needs the toilet.  after finding the closest unoccupied toilet i get him settled.  after what feels like ages he says ""i guess i don't need to go"".  i'm sure at this point that they have called his name and we have missed the appointment and will have to repeat this process again soon, so i'm still rushing like an idiot and accept that it was a false alarm though he does not have these frequently.  he stands so i can help him get his pants up and he has a sudden bowl movement that is mostly liquid.  directly in to his diaper and the inside of his pants.  i sigh and think to myself ""if only i had set an alarm this would have happened at home"".  i charge in wipes at the ready (what was left after vainly using them to clean ensure off myself in the parking lot) and have with the use of the bathroom paper towels, wipes, have made things look more or less okay.  nothing is visible from the outside, and the smell is as gone as possible even though i catch a whiff of it now and then.  we leave the toilet and just as i sit down in the waiting room they call us back and we have a mostly uneventful visit to the dermatologist scheduling a follow up to check on the few spots he burned off and orders to keep on eye on the one that is concerning.  as we leave the va i let out a sigh of relief.  i pulled it off, even with oversleeping and a bathroom disaster i managed to forge ahead. i'm not having a bad day, i'm having a kickass day! i stop at starbucks and get my so a frappachino because he loves them and he has had a stressful morning too.  i pull in the drive and decide to check the mailbox before heading in the house.  i run into a neighbor along the way.  they type of neighbor you waive at but rarely have a ""real"" discussion with, but i like her well enough.  we chat and exchange niceties and then she says ""i think you have something on you, maybe it's mud"".  i look down and i have a splash of poop down the leg of my pants and shoe.  shin to floor unmistakable poop, we live in the desert and it hasn't rained since july.  both of us know the score but she is nice enough to call it mud.  i was so worried about cleaning him, i didn't notice or check myself.  i sat through the doctor appointment, wandered through the va, walked around starbucks and the neighborhood with poop down my leg😫.   even with more rest than i've had in months i'm walking around in a fog deep enough that i didn't notice this. of course i get us inside and showered again and get some food into us and things seem better.  i think i've learned some lessons out of this. 1. don't fight it, if things go wrong cancel. you will be happier in the long run. 2. one days rest does not make up for months of abusing yourself.  3. be mindful of splash-back", your story has the ring of truth. sharing real life instead of the fluffy stuff typically posted to social media makes a difference for other caregivers. thank you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/746fi7/i_set_myself_up_for_failure_today/,I set myself up for failure today

"i have never lost somebody close to me due to this horrible disease, nor has my wife. my wife worked for a few years as an activity director at an assisted living facility and is now a caseworker for a in-home care service company. in the last few years she has gotten involved with our local alzheimer's association chapter and is on our county board for our local association. 2 years ago we started getting in to kayaking. we were maybe making another three to four trips a summer. this spring she decided that her fundraiser for our local walk would be to kayak 66 miles, as i'm sure all of you know somebody is diagnosed with alzheimer's every 66 seconds. when it started she was hoping to raised around $500. it's not much but every bit helps. we started making trips it's on every nice weekend we could and inviting anybody who wanted to come as we have a few extra kayaks that we had access to. the first month or so of our trips we had a lot of people simply how neat was what she was doing. as the word spread people were coming out of the woodwork who wanted to participate in our 3 to 15 mile trips throughout the state. friends family and even people who we were not close with were taking notice and wanting to join and donate and sponsor the individual trips. as we continued throughout the summer. people started opening up and sharing their stories with with her. we got stickers made in remembrance of those who have been lost from this disease and put them on her kayak, we were continuously putting in orders for t-shirts with a awesome logo that a friend of hers it's made on them. our local walk is tomorrow and her team has managed to raise over $2,500 in donations towards the walk to end alzheimer's. i couldn't be more proud of my wife and the stories and hardships that people have opened up and shared with us has been incredible. earlier this week our local paper called and ran an article about her fundraising this year. although i haven't experience what you all goes through firsthand yet and i hope i never will, we are proud to stand with you and fight or a cure for this horrible disease. our plan is to continue our kayak trips and fundraising every summer from here on out.i apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes as i'm doing this on mobile.", you were fine. i couldn't judge gramatic wise because i can feel so bad how much it hurts. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/73b3r8/i_just_wanted_to_share_an_odd_way_that_alzheimers/,I just wanted to share an odd way that Alzheimer's has touched my life.
"i'm going to visit my nana for the first time in about 4 or 5 years this weekend. last time i went, she had to ask what my name was, and introduced me as her cousin. after that it was just too hard emotionally to go and visit her. earlier this year, she had to be moved to the alzheimer's wing of her assisted living home. she was forgetting to bathe and take care of herself. lately she's needed assistance walking because she's forgetting how to. this has been devastating for my family, although she is happy and doesn't worry anymore for which we are thankful. in the middle of last month, my mom called with bad news. my nana had a bad reaction to antibiotics and had to be hospitalized. while she was there, she had an xray done on her torso, and they found nodes on her lungs. the family chose not to do a scan because it involved a dye test, so we don't know how long she has. they've also opted to not have her go through chemo as it would just be too hard in her condition. i'm going to see her this weekend and i'm scared. i know she's only gotten worse since the last time i saw her. but i'm not sure when i'll get to see her again, and how much longer she has because of the cancer. how do i handle the feelings of dread, anxiety, and sadness about this visit?"," you're going to see your nana, but i'm afraid that you actually aren't and she'll have changed a lot in the 4 or 5 years since you last saw her. you're that much older and so is she, except she's going to be much more frail and you may be shocked by her appearance. don't let that show - you can do this, you're older and stronger now.you're going to visit an old lady who probably won't even know who you are, and she's unlikely to know that she should know you because that part of her memory won't be working too well - but she will know who she is, she'll probably know where she is, and she'll have some things to say to you because she'll want to be polite.all this might make it quite difficult and unsettling for you, so you're going to have to try hard to remember that she isn't forgetting you on purpose - it's her condition that's doing this, it isn't her and it isn't deliberate.when you visit just do the things you would do anytime you might visit somebody in hospital. maybe take some flowers or some chocolates or a drink you remember that she enjoys. if she once had a pet, maybe take her a cuddly toy like that pet because she may like something to holdsit and talk, tell her things you want to tell her, and let her talk too. respond each time she says something as if it's the first time - she won't know that you've already said that reply, nor that she's already said that thing to you.if she introduces you to somebody as, ""this is red_sky_at_morning, my cousin"" just say hello, and leave it at that. don't correct her because you'll end up getting frustrated and agitated.hold her hand, if you can, and give her a hug. contact is important for both of you.you can do this and you will come away knowing you've done something well.good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/739pwt/need_some_support_going_to_see_nana_this_weekend/,Need some support- going to see Nana this weekend

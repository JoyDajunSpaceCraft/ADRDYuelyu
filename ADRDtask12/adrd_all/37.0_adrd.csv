"hello, i'm new to this sub and could really use some advice from others about getting a family member to go see a doctor. sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. i want to add the disclaimer that i'm not an expert, but i've noticed some changes in my mother this past year that have been alarming and she hits all the 10 warning signs listed by the alzheimer's association. everything points to some form of dementia. the problem is that neither my dad, sister, or i can convince her to go to the doctor. not even for a regular check-up. our long-time family physician moved her practice elsewhere and now my mom absolutely refuses to go to someone new. she gets angry and defensive even with gentle suggestions to find a new doctor just so that she has one again. i've tried to speak with her friends from church, but they simply write it off and say she's just becoming forgetful because of age (she's 55), but they only see her once or twice a week, not what she's like at home. she really doesn't have any other friends than those from church. she's pretty withdrawn. my dad says his plan is to simply make a doctor's appointment *for* her and then drive her there (she doesn't drive anymore). i'm not sure if that's the best way to go. i am 29 and live 1000 miles away from my parents so i'm not really sure what i can do. these days, my dad has to take care of her like a child. even speaking to her on the phone to talk about almost anything is very difficult-- when she talks it's hard for her to stay on-topic-- she'll also change subjects wildly and vent about things that never occurred (e.g. she was upset that my sister changed her wedding date when no such thing ever happened). anyway, sorry for the long post. tl;dr: any advice on getting my mother to go to a doctor? thanks in advance!"," 55 is young to be having age related forgetfulness at that extreme. i don't have any real suggestions for you, but if you are based in the usa, you can call alz.org. they have a wealth of resources and you can speak to counselors who can guide you. i'm sure they've heard it all.my heart goes out to you.

"mom and stepdad lived next door for eight years.  i provided them their meals, and they would give their overweight dog about a third of their food.  they'd drop globs of it on the floor, or give him bites from their forks.  at first i asked them not to do that because at that time i cooked for ten adults, and if they did not want all of their portion, there were others in the home that would appreciate extra on their plates.  also, they had an awful roach problem in their home.  when i'd go over in the morning there would be a bunch of them around where they dropped food.  i eventually gave up.  i just shrunk their portions and kept their house as clean as possible.  well, stepdad died (87) and i moved mom (85) and her dog into my house.  when i bring her her meal, she starts to feed her dog immediately.  most of the time i pick up his 45 lbs and carry him into another room and shut the door.  i have three dogs, and they know that grandma will share her food, so then here they come.  we have asked her not to, and she sulks, or makes comments like it's a good thing she didn't starve me when i was small, or some such thing.  i suppose i could shut all the dogs away whenever food comes out, but i guess i'm just angry that it's come to that."," i must admit i feel somewhat conflicted about this.before my wife's alzheimer's had progressed as much as it has, she despised our cats. whenever they tried to jump on the couch or to beg for food, i'd tell them in spanglish ""no es por kitties"" and brush them away from her before she gave them a swat.nowadays, our more aggressive cat jumps on her lap and she feeds the cat tidbits. the cat, who she originally named ""ferrell"" knows the mealtimes and comes to her. she laughs and gives her a tidbit or two of whatever my wife is eating. she's forgotten the name of the cat, and calls her ""por kitties"".i have to admit i allow it because it makes me happy that my wife is finally accepting of the cat, who makes a point of snuggling with her when my wife is taking a nappy.i feel like, in this cat, my wife has another friend in the world, which isn't so bad a thing to have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8ioyxm/i_just_want_to_complain_about_mom_and_dog/,I Just Want to Complain about Mom and Dog

"since my youth, my grandfather has always talked about how he used to love taking the train cross country in his youth/ early retirement.now at 78, and an early form of alzheimer’s (can’t remember year, small little things like that, but has good conversation still about concepts - finance, house upkeep, cars, trains, etc) he wants to take a train cross country.i have the time coming up to go on one but my mother is refusing. she took him to the doctors, wouldn’t let me go to appt, and claimed they said it’s not a good idea because he’s on blood thinners for his diabetes and the sitting wouldn’t be good for him. doctors (not his but some i know) say as long as he gets up from time to time to walk around the train, watch his sugar intake, take his pills on time (which i would help with) that this trip is really a non-event.money isn’t an issue as he did well for himself. the goal was to get a full bedroom where he has a bed, bathroom, and there’s a second bed for me. maybe this is meant for r/relationships, but what is your guys take? i’m 28/m who’s been around all of his health issues (except for this latest doctor visit) and think this would be a great experience for him and something that i’ll always remember. trip would be chicago- denver (15 hours 1 way). stay 1 day in denver, then come home."," i love being able to get up and walk around on amtrak. tell her you'll take him to the observation car to stretch his legs. a large portion of the trip would be overnight with him sleeping, lying down, anyways. you could also potentially make it a multi-day trip and get off and spend a day somewhere in nebraska to rest or something.i haven't taken the california zephyr before, but i have taken the empire builder before and it was a wonderful experience. some day i'll be the little old lady having my great nephew take me on that trip again...edit: if you took the empire builder, you could stop off in minneapolis for a day and end your trip in spokane. i know that southwest airlines has reasonable flights between spokane and chicago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8deiyg/train_trip_with_grandfather/,Train trip with Grandfather

"my mom is 67 years old and is exhibiting signs of memory issues/loss. the basics: after quitting the job she’d had for 17 years, she got another job — but only lasted at it a few months. she could not remember how to do the cash register and other procedures of her job. she’ll ask a question again shortly after she already asked it, and she forgets common words and often confuses pronouns in conversation. all of her children are concerned for her, and we are realizing this is more than simply “forgetting” things. i suspect she has alzheimer’s or some form of dementia. she also has been pretty depressed, has noticeable mood swings, and has an incredibly low self-esteem — probably due, in part, to her mind. when i brought up to her that i felt she needed to see a doctor to figure out what’s going on, she 100% agreed. we made an appointment with her general practitioner, and it’s coming up next week.  i am going with her because 1) i didn’t want her to forget anything from the appointment, and 2) although she is aware of her memory struggles, i wanted to be there to make sure she doesn’t downplay what she’s experiencing. she has a tendency to do that. so, i don’t quite know what to expect from this. it’s her primary care doctor she’s had for years, so the doctor knows her. i’m not sure exactly what to ask the doctor or what to do in the appointment. i don’t want to step all over my mom, but i also want to make sure we get the ball rolling on any diagnosis/treatment.  any advice/stories from your own experiences would be greatly appreciated. :)"," i attend appointments with seniors for a living so here are some tips i use!1. talk with your mom before the appointment and have her practice saying out loud to you her concerns or questions about her health. you can simply be the doctor by saying, ""what brings you in here today."" semi-role playing helps people better advocate for themselves and succinctly talk about their health concerns (very improtant when you have a 15 min slot!)    1a. which also brings up a good question for her doctor office front office staff before the appointment happens...""i'm just calling  to see..."" what kind of appointment did they slot your mom? an annual well visit? a 15 min or 30 min slot? an established return patient? this helps prep the doctor to know your mom's needs (and your expectations of the doc's time).2. let your mom do a majority of the talking. i fully support and encourage your reasons for attending, but let your mom be the main talker. if you feel she is down playing symptoms, then interject with gentle reminders, ""but mom, remember how you had a hard time learning the new job working the cash register...""  if she gets tongue tied, try your best to get her talking and always redirect the doctor's attention and questions back towards your mom.  the doctor will naturally want to converse with you, but your mom is the patient and important for her to not be talked over.3. no idea where you live, but know general practitioners are just that...general. if in your gut you want better answers then push for a referral to a specialist for further testing.  my experience is some gps are stuck back 5-10 years in research so are not always the most up to date with diagnosing or medically managing dementias. advocate for your mom no matter how uncomfortable. there are so many different types of dementias out there though alzheimer's accounts for 40-60% of cases...knowing what kind helps with a future care plan.4.   depression imo is a chicken before the egg question.  i had one nurse practitioner address my clients depression more aggressively before adjusting memory meds stating depression can accelerate dementia like symptoms. also, depression can affect sleep patterns which is linked to worsening dementia symptoms. so, definitely make sure the provider understands #1 concern: mom's memory #2 mom's depression...you aren't diagnosing her but giving the provider lots of observationa and assessments to guide him/her down a path of how serious to take such symptoms and coming up with plan to diagnose.5. realize the most positive test to know what kind of dementia is a brain autopsy after you die. i say this to make people realize we have a long way to go in understanding how to diagnose and treat as well as prevent dementias.  diagnosis is based on a lot of observed behaviors and some various mental tests like the mmse. i know clients who would practice the mmse before to fool their doc. so, yeah, testing is not foolproof. if the provider does one and says she scored fine, do not settle and take ""normal"" aging as the diagnosis. push for a referral. so happy your mom has you. i do what i do as some 80+ don't always have a person. good luck.

"hi all, before i get into it i just want to say thanks to everyone in this community for their unbelievable insight and advice that i've found through searching on this subreddit. i've been a lurker for a while now, but its come to a point where i need help.my girlfriends father is 53. he got diagnosed with early onset at 49. lets call him jim. i've known jim for two years and over that time i've seen first hand the gradual decrease in mental capacity and awareness. its not terribly bad yet, he knows who i am and he can still take care of himself for the most part. his wife, lets call her karen, takes care of him full time. neither of them work and they essentially spend 24/7 together.karen is a wonderful person. she's extremely caring and is truly distraught at what his happening to the love of her life. my girlfriend, lets call her julia, goes home a lot (they live 15 minutes from us) as do both of her brothers (one of them actually currently lives with the parents) to spend time with them.the main problem with the situation is their lack of resources. they have a lot of extended family that help out a lot, but a lot of the time karen has to be around jim at all times. my girlfriend and i will go over and spend time with jim so that karen go have dinner with friends or get her hair done, etc, etc. but, anytime that karen is out of eyesight, jim freaks out, keeps on asking where she is, and says he wants to go home despite actually being inside his own home. karen essentially can't be without jim or else he will have a meltdown. now, karen realizes this and is ok with it for the most part, but she has a ton of pent up anger and sadness and refuses to see any therapist or professional about it. instead, she essentially uses my girlfriend julia as a therapist. julia gets extremely worked up about this, because she feels like she's actually mothering karen, who keeps telling her that jim is not the man she fell in love with and threatens self harm nonchalantly. i've told julia that jim and karen need professional help, but she said anytime she mentions it, karen says that they are not there yet, that they can cope with it on their own. her reliance on julia as essentially a therapist is evidence that they are not able to do this alone.how can i find resources to help karen and jim, specifically karen as the main caregiver? karen claims that she emails their doctor all the time, but he doesn't answer because jim is already so far gone that he won't be admitted to trials. karen is so adamant that they don't need therapy or even another caretaker to let her have some free time. her reliance on julia is really taking a toll on julia and every time i tell julia that her parents need professional help nothing comes of it. i've thought about talking to her brothers about it, but i don't want to overstep.we live in boston. are there any resources out there that i could provide to julia to mention to karen? its becoming a weekly occurrence that karen calls julia distraught and tells her things that she should not be confiding in her daughter. they need resources and i don't know where to look. any and all advice is appreciated, thank you."," though i didn't really know how to seek out or ask for help caring for my early onset spouse, i did eventually join a support group for dementia caregivers – wish i would have done it much earlier. it's been a great source of information and general emotional support. i highly recommend it. my group is general but some even specialize, such as early onset, spouse, children, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/8aa19a/caregiver_support/,Caregiver Support

"my mother has always been a pretty assertive person -- i've seen her ask to speak to the manager at various stages throughout my life. for a long time, she ran her own company in new york city, but she is now retired upstate with my dad. both of them spent their entire lives in the city, and living upstate in the woods full time has been an adjustment. to make things even more difficult, my mother has suffered from depression for years, and was actually committed to a hospital for observation a few years back. her memory has been deteriorating for years and the electroshock treatments she received during her stay in the hospital may have made this worse. she is currently taking a good deal of medication to help with depression and increasing memory loss.her memory has been deteriorating for years, and my dad has been there for her all the way through. the doctors don’t think it’s alzheimer's or dementia, but the symptoms match -- she will repeat stories multiple times, sometimes within a few minutes  -- “did you hear about what happened to kevin?” over and over again. and when you mention that we already discussed something, she will sometimes apologize or laugh it off, but other times she can fly into a rage or feel sorry for herself, like “i guess i’m just an idiot then, huh??”unfortunately, things have gotten so bad that conversations have become difficult -- her short term memory seems nearly gone, and a conversation can go in 2-4 minute loops indefinitely. she can still take a shopping list, drive to the supermarket, buy all the groceries, and come home and cook dinner, but new memories don’t seem to stick, and because she doesn’t remember all the stuff she is forgetting, it’s not always so easy to convince her that her condition is getting worse, or that she can’t be in charge of planning a birthday party because she’s going to end up emailing people about their rsvps over and over and over again.i think it’s very frustrating and scary for her, but she sometimes handles it incredibly poorly. she’ll down two vodkas or smoke a joint, forget everything that happened that day, pick fights, yell at my dad, storm off, or worse -- my dad said she even got angry and basically took a swing at him. and when she knows she misbehaved, her regret is fleeting. even if she understands why her conduct hurt my feelings or my dad's, within a few minutes she'll be defending herself, demanding that we explain _exactly_ what she did, denying she did anything wrong, or accusing everyone of ganging up on her. i know this happens because she's frustrated, or because she’s not even sure what she did, but it’s really taking a toll on my dad. he’s in the woods, getting yelled at, trying to calm her down, being blamed for “lack of patience”, just because he blows up after being patient _all day_. at this point, i’m not sure my dad is capable of caring for her on his own. she is belligerent, constantly arguing with him, and honestly not that nice to him sometimes. he’s retired and they should be relaxing, but it feels like she needs more help than he can or should be responsible for. i don’t really know what to do. she seems too capable to be in assisted living or anything like that, but i also don’t really think having a caretaker there is going to help -- it’s just going to be another person witnessing her outbursts and rage. maybe she needs new doctors? or maybe there are better coping mechanisms for her and my dad? ultimately, i think acceptance on both of their parts will go a long way -- he needs to stop losing his patience with her and accept that she is different from how she used to be, and she needs to accept that we all love her, but that her condition means things have changed. it’s just hard to get her to accept anything when the conversation you just had is completely forgotten 4 minutes later. advice, or advice about where to post this kind of thing on reddit much appreciate. tia."," ""the electroshock treatments she received during her stay in the hospital may have made this worse.""hmm, well, this isn't something that has been a standard treatment in quite a long time. it's still done very rarely and only with the patient's consent as a treatment for depression.it would be worth talking to her doctors about different medications. you'd likely need to see her neurologist and get a referral to a psychiatrist experienced with alzheimers/geriatrics.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7zt2gi/moms_memory_is_going_and_im_not_sure_dad_can/,Mom's memory is going... and I'm not sure Dad can handle it

i hope this the right place. if not just let me know. i proposed to my longtime gf two days ago. it was late so i just texted my aunt with the intention to call people the following day. i got a call from my grandma yesterday (my aunt spilled the beans) asking about it. i talked to her for over an hour about the details.  about an hour ago she called me and asked if i had proposed to my gf. i said yes and told her we talked about it all yesterday. she remembers talking to my aunt but not when. she told me she was scared and this is not the first time something like this has happened. i’m not really sure what to do. ," > i spoke to her doctor (also my doctor) today. it turns out my grandpa has been hiding it from me for nearly two years.> > they didn’t want to “worry” me.> > i now know all of the details and my grandpa has agreed to share all info with me.> > i feel better knowing what’s going on and that she is being treated but i still hope for help on how to deal with her condition. that's kind of them, but it's good that you now know.as for dealing with the forgetfulness and, probably, the repetition, just ignore it even though at times it'll make your head hurt.the 'nice' thing about having to repeat good news is to see the look of delighted surprise each time, then the best wishes etc..bad news - tell it once, job done.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7y2qzb/i_proposed_to_my_gf_and_talked_to_my_grandma/,I proposed to my gf and talked to my grandma about it yesterday.

"my dad has alzheimers and lives alone in another city. he struggles with dates and times. he seems to forget the purpose of things (like money, phones, watches) regularly. i'm trying to think of an 'orientation support system' that might help him out. for example: i could give him a notepad and call him everyday and tell him to write the day and date and important things. then, the next day i'd call him up and ask him what the first page on his notepad says. it will certainly be the previous day's. then i would tell him to throw it away in the bin and start writing the current days. he has to go to the chemist for his meds. i've arranged daily dispense but he keep turning up at 7am when they're shut. maybe i could tell him to write on his pad 'get meds' then have the chemist call me when he gets there and have him cross off 'get meds'. do you see the sort of thing i'm looking for? he has no social care support and no occupational therapy. there's an organisation which provided funding for him to write a 'memory book' or some such nonsense when what he really needs is practical support. any hints/tips would be welcome. thank you."," okay, so i've seen you're in uk.a notebook really won't be enough, even though you hope it might be. he'll forget it's there, will ignore it, anything but do what it says - and if you 'go on' about it he'll get angry and accuse you of nagging and bullying.he may want to be independent, but if he doesn't know the day of the week, can't properly handle money, is unable to tell the time, then it's unreasonable and unfair to expect him to 'cope', in reality he's at risk of self-neglect and at risk of being financially swindled. do you know if he's properly hydrated, do you know if he's eating enough, and regularly? him saying so isn't you knowing it's happening.who does his shopping, and who keeps an eye on his food stores - throwing away old/out of date/mouldy stuff from the fridge, etc..>he has no social care support and no occupational therapy.and he won't get it if social services listen to what he says to them - he'll tell them he's coping just fine and doing all the things he needs to be doing, and they'll go away to a more needy client. you have to get involved and push and push until they do what they're meant to do. it's utterly soul destroying and will take months of batting your head against the wall, but you'll eventually get somewhere - as long as you are with him when they 'assess' him and make sure they write down the truth.if he is a council or ha tenant he may be eligible for council-run extra care housing, but would need to have his name on a list to be offered a place when somewhere falls vacant. social services control these lists.has he been referred to the local mental health team for assessment and support? if not, then contact his gp surgery and tell them to get it organised.the gp surgery should also have a care co-ordinator, find out who it is and then contact them.his medication can be delivered - almost all chemists will do this free of charge, and it's a person calling at his home, which is a check of sorts. they will put it in a nomad pack, so each part of the prescription is in a separate blister. but, if he forgetswhen or if he's taken his tablets he'll need somebody to make sure he's taking it - and this is the main reason why we first got carers for my mil. she was taking tablets almost randomly, as and when she thought about her medication. i'm guessing that this is why he's going to the chemist daily, which is a check-in of sorts - but what would they do if he doesn't turn up? it is unlikely, and could be a breach of data protection etc., to expect a chemist to phone you when a prescription has been collected.look on the ageuk website (used to be age concern) and see if there's a day centre in his area, they're an absolute godsend because they'll pick him up and he'll have a day with other people of his own age - a bit like a grown-up playgroup. lunch is included in the fee. put the postcode into this page to find out what they might offer ageuk also have a befriending service, maybe he'd benefit from this?there may be admiral nurses in his area the alzheimer's society is meant to have some sort of support service, but it's as rare as hen's teeth. do you have any form of lasting power of attorney, especially financial? if not, then it's something you need to get sorted out whilst he can still talk to a solicitor and sign a form. you would need to be with him. you really don't want to have to go down the court of protection route, it's lengthy and horribly costly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/7xjjl9/basic_orientation_support_for_alzheimers/,Basic orientation support for Alzheimers

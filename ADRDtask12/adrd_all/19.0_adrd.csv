"so my grandfather has alzheimers which is quite bad honestly. he stopped recognizing me like 2 years ago and forgets my mom and aunt (who takes care of him) occasionally. but he is (was at least) able to stay on his own at a small flat, with us and my aunt being his close neighbours. he has a maid who comes five times a week, and my mom and aunt visit him at least three times a day.yesterday morning he went to have his flu shot with my aunt (he hadn't been outside for 2 months due to covid). they come back to his home, eat and my aunt leaves around 12. he then sends the maid home (he doesn't like people around, this happened before). around 4pm my mom goes to check on him with his dinner, finding the flat empty. his phone and wallet inside but not his keys.they call the cops, give them his pictures. watching the cctv footage of the flat, he goes out at 2.30pm, dressed up in his formal wear. then spent all night searching, nothing. a person saw him going towards the fields that night he got lost and when he asked what he was doing he said that he was looking for the treasure he buried. (which we think he got hungry and was looking for money and misremembering the concept of banks)now the cops are searching for him with dogs, its been 28 hours since he left his flat. what am i to do? i feel useless and my mom is a mess, she is at home crying silently rn. my dad and uncle are with the cops, searching the fields still. is there anything i can do? and i am very concerned for my mom too, she has mental illness, heart problems and some complications in her brain too. i dont know how to act."," hang in there buddy! my dad got lost a few times too and was found both times. get yourself some tea. you can go sit with your mom, keep her company and make her some tea and something light to eat so she's taking care of herself. make sure she's warm. hold her hand. you can assure her it's not her fault. to make yourself feel better, you can also write a letter to your grandad and your mom telling them how you feel, writing down good memories to share later. sending you a hug!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/k23g2k/my_grandfather_is_missing/,My grandfather is missing

"hi all. i've got grandparents living in florida in their own house (ie not any kind of assisted living community) and i just found out today that my grandmother has been diagnosed with alzheimer's. i'll give some quick context to our situation and would love to hear the thoughts/advice of this community.even getting to this point has been difficult -- my grandmother is extremely stubborn and independent, so while we were aware she had been slowly losing her faculties for some time, it took a concerted effort to get to the point of a diagnosis because of a combination of her own stubbornness and her long-time doctor's complacency. my grandfather is still sharp as a tack but wheelchair bound, so he is not in a position to care for both of them.it's clear they need to have more around-the-clock care, but the problem is that my grandmother will never agree to that. she insists there is nothing wrong (i could get into all the examples of how that is not true, but just trust me when i say she needs better help). the problem is she still has some level of lucidity, so we can't force her to do things she doesn't want to do (keep appointments, etc). it is important to mention that most of the family lives in pa, so while we've been trying to help care for things, it's simply not going to be possible for us to give her the level of care she needs. one of my uncles lives close by there and visits often, but he is simply wholly unprepared to deal with how complex the situation has become. obviously i don't think the right thing to do is to wait until she has an accident or hurts my grandfather to take more decisive action. what should we do in this 'in-between' period where she is lucid enough to have her own agency, but will inevitably be in a potentially dangerous situation soon? are there resources we can work with?thanks for reading and appreciate any guidance in advance."," just a quick thought - do you think one option in the ‚Äúin between‚Äù time could be to empower your uncle to provide some drop in, consistent care? if she‚Äôs not progressed into the middle stage and is still relatively early, your uncle could maybe learn communication tips and strategies and behavioral things to help the day to day. what specific care does she need? help in the bathroom? if it‚Äôs more daily chores, your uncle could possibly help (taking into consideration covid precautions). it‚Äôs also helpful for the whole family to receive that education - it will help you understand why she‚Äôs acting a certain way and you can learn to look for the triggers of some behaviors she has. you can get this through the alz assoc for free online right now through your local chapter. go to alz.org and click on find your chapter, or look at the information there - there‚Äôs a whole library in there.another thing is to do an inventory (best you can) of safety measures. what are the risks of falls (environmental factors like rugs, cords)? if you go to alzheimersnavigator.org you can generate a checklist for different safety (and other topics too) measures, including things like medication safety and wandering. this is a free service online, it happens quickly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/k0ixvl/new_to_alzheimers_and_looking_for_guidance/,New to Alzheimer's and looking for guidance

"as my dad sits at the hospital waiting for an mri, i wonder if the eventual diagnose will be alzheimer's.  my dad is 80 and has never routinely seen a doctor.  he only goes when he has injured himself or is very sick.  last week my mom called because she had called 911 due to my dad falling and not being able to stand.  paramedics used a portable ekg machine to check his heart, checked his other vitals, as well as checked his blood sugar.  everything came back fine.  after a while he seemed ok and the paramedics left.  2 days later it happened again.  this time they took him by ambulance to the hospital where they did more test, including a cat scan, x-ray, and another ekg.  due to covid, we weren't able to be with him in the er, which frustrated the hell out of my mom and i.  the doctor called after a couple of hours and said that everything came back fine, except his blood alcohol was at .075.  the doctor attributed his steadiness to the alcohol.  my mom believed the doctor, but i did not.  i picked him up and brought him back to their home.  immediately, my narcissist mom told him that he has to quit drinking bla bla bla.  shortly after, he began to tell us that his legs have felt ""wobbly"" during the day, at night, in the morning etc.  i knew this wasn't drunkiness causing this issue.  since neither of them have primary care physicians, i told them they need to get some asap.  however, i wasn't naive and knew the chances of getting one quickly was near impossible.  yesterday morning i spoke with my mom to see if she had called the doctor i recommended and she had not.  she told me that dad woke up early this morning and was confused at where the bathroom was.  she helped him to the bathroom and then he couldn't figure out where the bedroom was (they sleep in different rooms).  it was odd.  over the last 10 years he has been forgetting things.  he also has a history of retelling the same stories from the past.  unfortunately, both his mom &amp; dad died of alzheimer's in their 80's.  the last week or so mom says he has been forgetting a lot. one other detail.....he still works full time!  we have tried to get him to retire, but he doesn't want to and my mom seems like she doesn't really want him to.  in my conversation with my mom she said he was still wobbly.  i asked if she had called the doctor i recommended and she said that she hadn't yet.  i decided to call for them and they told me the soonest they could see him would be december 14th.  the nurse i spoke to recommend i take him back to the er, but explain to them that he can't speak for himself so i can stay with them and explain to the doctors what is going on.  being with him all day yesterday, i feel like i'm losing my dad.  he seems weak and slow to do certain task....like undressing himself, peeing, etc.  i feared this would happen because it happened to his parents and i think it's happening to his brother and sister as well.  since i had a lot of time yesterday in the waiting room, i decided to pull my dad's credit since my mom has a history of obtaining credit cards under his name and emotionally spending.  i confronted her about it 10 years ago and told my dad.  they filed bankruptcy 20 years ago and then lost their house 10 years ago.  i knew my mom was still up to her ways, but i didn't realize how bad it was.  i was trying to figure out why she has been so hesitant about him retiring and why she said they would have to move somewhere cheaper since they would bring in about $3k a month in social security.  well, to my surprise they have $35k in credit card debt.  i added the 21 accounts and the min payments alone are almost $1100 a month, which explains why my mom has been scared about my dad retiring.  i'm afraid after what is going on that he will have to retire because i don't think he should be driving with his current condition.this all happened so fast and i'm sorry to ramble.  my sister's live 6 &amp; 12 hours away and i live 10 min away.  obviously, i am the one right now that needs to be there for them.  in addition to all of this, their townhome is 2 stories and the bathroom is on the second story.  i'm looking for a different apartment that is single level and need to get them in that yesterday.with wobbly legs and forgetting small things that happened 10 min ago, but remembering things that may have happened 2 days ago, could this be a sign of alzheimer's?thank you"," update, he had a number of test today and they confirmed he had a stroke.  he is was admitted to the neurology dept. where they will determine the extent of the blockage in his coradid arteries.  thanks for the comments!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/k039z4/possible_early_stages_of_alzheimers/,Possible early stages of Alzheimer's

"hello, i am trying to figure out the best way to help my mother and was hoping someone on here might have some ideas. to give a little background this situation is a little more unique and complicated then others. i don't want to go too much into detail but i think a certain amount of context is necessary.1. my father in his life has been an ok person but is without a doubt a narcissist.2. he has been emotionally abusive / controlling in their relationship before he got alz.3. this caused my mother to be angry with him often / hold resentment.4. my father is currently in about stage 6 and it happened rapidly.5. my parents have about a 20 year age difference and my mother hopefully has many years left to live after my dad passes.now my mother is feeling a tremendous amount of guilt and is very self critical of her anger / resentment towards him because she can no longer really differentiate the manipulation / rage / gaslighting from him being a narcissist and him having alzheimers (an awful combination by the way).she is already doing counseling however she used to be a teacher and is a chronic under-sharer so she doesn't really express non ""politically correct"" views to anyone that isn't really close to her. as a result she dramatically under reports her distress and doesn't *really* get the help she needs.has anyone experienced a situation like this? does anyone have any ideas of how to help her through this and get her to stop being so self critical?"," good on her for accessing a counselor, even if she's taking her time getting comfortable with sharing. have you researched any virtual caregiver support groups, ruckin? i know there's some out there, and both you and your mom may find that really helpful. my mom is on hospice and they do one each week that i've been attending.has she sought medication assistance for your dad? when my mom hit the rage stage my sister and i thought it would pass quickly. uh... it didn't! we reached out to her doctor, specifically a geriatric psych doctor, who helped us choose a medication, and worked with us on dosage times and amounts. meds won't completely alleviate the anger and lashing out, but it made it manageable for us. the rage stage lasted the entirety of 2019 and has slowly been dissipating this year.good luck to all three of you! it's a tough journey in the best of situations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jznd1f/helping_mother_with_father_with_alzheimers/,Helping mother with father with Alzheimers
"for the past few months, my father has been obsessing about getting on the nearby commuter train and traveling into a major city - i think his original reasoning was that he wants to visit his childhood home, but he can no longer articulate that point. i think he feels like he is somewhere other than where he should be, even though he‚Äôs in the house he‚Äôs lived in for 35 years. my parents live only a few minutes from the station by foot, and he‚Äôs made a break for it once already. luckily my mom and his part time aide were able to stop him from actually getting on a train. my mom will call me when he starts asking her when they‚Äôll be going down to the train, to get me to try and redirect him, but that doesn‚Äôt seem effective anymore. i‚Äôm not sure he knows who he‚Äôs speaking to when she puts me on the phone anyhow. i try to focus on the fact that it‚Äôs not safe to go outside because of the pandemic, but it‚Äôs really not sinking in. right now, this is just a stall tactic while she waits for his antipsychotic medication to kick in. i still have a lot of trouble with the idea that logic doesn‚Äôt matter with him, so my redirection tactics could probably use some work. has anyone experienced something similar? i know that wandering being a common issue, but this is a more dangerous variant. he‚Äôs lucid enough to know where the train is and, to some extent, where he wants to go, but it‚Äôs scary to think about what would actually happen if he made it on the train."," you can get him a monitoring device put on his ankle, it might be worth it in this case.  it would also be wise to get him a medical alert bracelet so if found wandering, police could contact you guys.other redirections besides mentioning the pandemic would be ""we're going to catch the train after your snack.""  he might forget all about it by then.  or, ask where he wants to go to on the train.  when he tells you, make up a story about needing him to drop something off when he gets there, and can you put mom back on the phone?  etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jzek04/father_obsessed_with_getting_on_the_train/,Father Obsessed with Getting on the Train

"my father is not missing.  but that's not the reality that my mother lives in.we started noticing little issues with mom's memory in the first part of this year.  by october we had documented a couple of pages of little incidents of repetition in conversation and forgotten details.  any one on its own could be dismissed, but all together... then she started struggling at work.  within a three week span we went from talking her into seeing a doctor, to a diagnosis of early onset alzheimer's &amp; forced early retirement from a 27 year career. all by her 59th birthday at the end of october this year.dad has been amazing through all of this. coordinating doctors visits, getting her through a retirement process, disability, getting her legal documents updated, and getting her interviews with clinical trials.  but she's lost him.  it started with little spells in conversation.  4 over the course of 5 weeks.  dad suddenly wasn't her husband anymore.  he was someone else in her husband's skin.  dad would walk away from her for a few minutes, then come back and she'd ask him where he'd been all day.  two weeks ago a spell started and never ended.  mom lives in an alternate reality now, where there's a strange man in her husband's skin.  the strange man is sometimes an asshole plotting to sell her husband's tractor &amp; their house.  most of the time he's a very nice man who she's been friends with for years and takes care of her.  they would make a perfect couple.  all of these different men work at the same place my father, drive the same work van, even has the same name.  she recognizes her husband in photos from my wedding 3 years ago.  she doesn't recognize her husband when he gets home from work or cooks her dinner.  mom sends my sister and i messages, asking if we've seen dad and when he'll be home.  she hasn't seen her husband in weeks, and every time she calls his phone (when she can remember how to find her speed dial) she gets one of the impostors or her new boyfriend.  i wish she could come back to the reality we tell her about.  the one where her husband will be home from work soon. this is the most brutal thing this disease could have done to either of them.  i cannot imagine the depth of his heartbreak. or hers missing her husband of 40 years, the man who is living with her and taking care of her.  i wish it were my face that she didn't recognize.  my sister has told me she'd prefer it were either of us instead of dad.  but that's not the reality that we live in."," damn that‚Äôs so tough. sorry to hear about this. my mom has similar ‚Äúdelusions‚Äù but fortunately for me i just play along. she‚Äôs divorced and so husband to forget. she just makes up random things like they‚Äôre true and i simply play along and let her indulge. in this scenario you obviously can‚Äôt do that. so sorry to hear that. one day at a time. ‚Äú you can try the best you can, the best you can is good enough‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jxy4cv/looking_for_dad/,Looking for Dad

"my dad is advanced stage and is cared for at home. his wife is running the show and has found various people to help out. none of them are certified or professional but do this out of the goodness of their hearts and have some experience with caretaking. i‚Äôve always had my concerns in that i wish licensed professionals were caring for my dad, but his wife won‚Äôt spend the money. other than myself and the hospice nurse, nobody wears a mask around my dad, not even his wife. this seems grossly negligent and it scares me, but i don‚Äôt have any control. am i out of line for thinking this is dangerous? i just don‚Äôt understand putting someone so vulnerable at risk. does anyone have a similar problem?"," you do not have to be a certified professional to be a caregiver for this disease. i am an art school grad with a sculpture degree and right out of college started caring for a man with alzheimers full time. the other two caregivers were both registered nurses. they were both kind and good to him, but i believe i was objectively a better caretaker than them. he had bad falls twice with one of them, improper bandaging from the other, and never had any issues while with me. no piece of paper is going to guarantee better service with caregivers. however, this was pre-covid and i now do care work for a mentally sound man with a spinal injury. none of his other pca‚Äôs wear masks in his house, where both him and his wife are wheelchair bound and at risk. i find that incredibly unprofessional and wear a mask constantly while there and frequently change rubber gloves. your solution: politely ask each caretaker individually to wear a mask any time they are in the house with your father. provide a box of disposable blue masks if you want to be extra cautious. stock the house with boxes of rubber gloves and ask them to wear clean gloves while prepping food or doing anything physical for him (bathing, dressing, anything with contact). if you have any reason to believe they wont follow that instruction, discuss with your mom about installing a camera or two in the house (good to have anyway for a ton of reasons with alzheimers patients) and inform them of the cameras. dont say its to watch them, just let them know its there so you can keep an eye on your dad and make sure he doesnt wander or whatever. if your mom lives in the same house as him you cannot and should not expect her to wear a mask around him. its her house too and theyre already in close enough contact that it wouldnt matter. but make sure shes taking necessary precautions when she leaves the house. if you are in an area thats a hot spot, i dont think it would be unreasonable to request your caregivers get a test once every two weeks or so if it can be done for free. i might just be spoiled having easy access to free testing where i live though, so thats very circumstantial.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jwyngl/covid_from_caregivers_worry/,COVID from Caregivers Worry

"hi everyone.just like the title says, i'm looking for some tools and advice to helping, redirecting, and calming my grandma. she was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's several years ago. at first, i think most of us were in denial, but as the disease progressed, we came to terms with the fact that it had taken hold of her. earlier on, it was easily dismissable things, like misplacing items, or forgetting if she had said something to someone. later, it became telling the same thing multiple times in a conversation.now, it has progressed so much, she's more often ""lost"" than she is lucid. it seems like, within the past few months, her disease has revved up and progressed much faster than it had previously. she doesn't remember where she keeps her dishes. she'll put the cups in the drawer with the casserole dishes. you'll be engaged in a conversation with her when she'll suddenly walk off and wander around. she's confused so much of the time. it's gotten to the point where she can't remember many of my family members' names. she refers to my grandpa (her husband) as ""this guy"", and often doesn't realize who he is, or where she is.every morning, my grandpa has to walk around and show her pictures on the wall to bring her back and help her feel comfortable and recognize that she's in her home, however, it's not working like it used to. last week, my grandma was distraught and called my dad, angry and asking him when he was coming home. she thinks he's still a teenager, not a grown man. then, the other night, my grandma woke up, walked out into the garage, came back inside, and asked, scared, and angry who the man was in her bed. she wouldn't accept that it was her husband, so my grandpa moved out onto the couch. later that night, she came back out and asked him if he was coming to bed, as she forgot what had just happened. things are being put in motion to get her into a home. grandpa has been an absolute saint with her, but it's too much. i want to know what are some things that i can do when i am around to keep her occupied and happy. puzzles, coloring, etc. how can i calm her down when she gets confused or if it escalates, how do i redirect her attention to something that will keep her calm? she has been such a wonderful grandma to me. it breaks my heart to watch this disease slowly chip away at her. i want to be for her, everything she has been for me. any advice is truly appreciated.&amp;#x200b;tl;dr: this disease has progressed to the point where she is often confused, doesn't recognize her husband, and is upset. what tools or advice can i use to keep her happy and occupied?", [removed],https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jvvmep/need_tools_advice_for_grandma_with_fast_advancing/,"Need tools, advice for Grandma with fast advancing Alzheimers"
" hello everyone!looking for some directly related opinion for something. the company i work for is pitching an app idea to help people that are suffering from alzheimer's.we are pitching a memorization app - an app that can help people remember who they are by using their device‚Äôs data - photos, memories, messages or even music - either the family provides the music that the patient used to enjoy or maybe just the music that was very popular doing some important phases of his life. just remind the person to take a short quiz, ask them basic stuff and correlate the data to watch for any progress, notify them from time to time to go through some of the quizes. we were thinking about splitting it into three phases - if the patient is at an earlier phase he gets notified to do them at himself, after the results are not as good, he can do it together with the family or nurse and in the end only someone else can do it for him.we are still at the phase of evaluating the idea but we would love to hear any feedback - would it be useful, would it feel too intrusive, is there something out there already that serves the same purpose, even furhter reading might be more than useful.thank you and take care!", my opinion costs money. you don't get advice for a for profit company for free,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jvtnxl/evaluate_idea/,Evaluate idea

my dad (80 yrs old) was diagnosed with alzheimer's a few months ago.my parents decided to sell their house and move to a much smaller property. the new place is much easier to look after and is in a community block for old people. there is a warden on duty 24/7.ive been trying to help clear out the house as the new place is much smaller.dad has been a hoarder all his life but it seems to be getting worse.everything i try and throw away he will take out of the trash and put back in the house or try and find a use for. from little bits of rag to large items of furniture.at this rate they will be moving at the end of the month with all their belongings and end up living in a cluttered manner.any advice?i had another question.he has a brother (in his 70's) who lives in another country. historically they haven't been that close and apparently fell out over some minor thing a decade ago.they exchange christmas cards but that's about it.i get on well with my uncle and speak to him a few times a year.he always asks about dad.i was thinking of mentioning dad's diagnosis and state to my uncle. i don't know if this is a good idea but if i was in the same situation i would want my brother to know so we could have a chat before the alzheimer's took over too much.would my actions be seen as meddling?i suspect my dad would be upset and angry with me.dad is very much in denial and hasn't mentioned his diagnosis to me or my siblings. he knows i know and i think he asked mum to tell me.from my understanding at some undefined point in the future his verbal reasoning will diminish alot. i was hoping he would also see that and take the time to spend time with me and discuss it frankly and say anything now before it's too late.thanks," my mom showed hoarder tendencies. when we moved her, we had her pick out her favorite items. the rest we said would follow in another truck. we did the clear out after that. that worked. she's never asked about anything that we didn't put on a truck. i do suggest that when you clean the house out, think outside the box. my mom had hidden items in the weirdest spaces. things in the freezer didn't see too unusual, but one of her hiding spots wouldn't have been discovered if it hadn't been for my husband spotting a random scrap of fabric. my mom had somehow (still not sure how) used a screwdriver and removed the panel that accessed the bathtub piping. she'd stacked bras in there and they put the screws back in and hid them in there. he happened to see a tiny bit of bra strap at the bottom and removed the panel to see what it was.as for family, when my dad died, we learned that he'd never told anyone on his side of the family. they were shocked. my mom hates that they know and doesn't want anything to do with them visiting. i needed to tell them so that they knew why she was moving and not to pop in for surprise visits anymore. her family knows, but they don't think it's that big a deal so i try not to be that involved with them. when i started getting the ""you're making it sound worse than it is"" comments all of the time, i opted to go quiet. none of them have seen her in over a decade, so they have no clue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jr32um/dad_80_diagnosed_recently_house_clearing_and/,Dad (80) diagnosed recently.

"hello! thanks for taking some time to read my post and thanks in advance for any advice!my mom is in early stages of alzheimer's, we only got official diagnosis early this year. she's had gynecological issues for a few years and after consulting with an ob/gyn we think the best course of action is to have her get a hysterectomy. other option would be to use a diaphragm that would need to be changed monthly and she is not capable of doing that now (for personality reasons, not memory issues) and we know it will only become more difficult as her condition progresses. we think this is the best long term solution for her mentally and physically. however, she is terrified of surgery and thinks that if she does it, she will wake up and all her memory will be completely gone, or at the least she will lose the good progress she's made in the last few months (in terms of her care and with the new medication). after my sister worked hard to help my parents get on the path and timeline for surgery, she found out they just cancelled everything.we are hoping some firsthand knowledge or advice on having any medical procedures or surgery while dealing with the early stages of alzheimer's will help relieve her fear and also looking for advice on best practices to improve outcome. we know that disorientation and possibly delusion are side effects immediately post-op but hoping that since (1) this is a relatively simple procedure - as opposed to heart surgery or something, (2) we are working with her drs to reduce impact, like not using gas for anesthesia, and (3) plan on being there 100% to help her pre and post op, it won't be too damaging to her mental state. we want to support her and make her feel taken care of, but walk the line of pushing her to do what's necessary for her own health and what she wants (which often don't align). thanks again for reading!"," not sure what the issue is - is it uterine prolapse?   if so, a hysterectomy might cause even worse prolapse.i would consult with a specialist in geriatric psychiatry.  general anesthetics can often cause really bad problems for people with dementia - even death.  i'm sure there are drugs that are better and others that are worse in that way, hence the consult.edited to add:  i mean cause worse prolapse of the pelvic floor, impacting on urination and defecation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jeyg49/any_experience_with_hysterectomy_for_early/,Any experience with Hysterectomy for early Alzheimer's?
"my 87 year old mom had an appointment with a neurologist recently. he gave her an oral test,  asking who the presidents were, stuff like that. he also sent her for an eeg and a mri. in a follow-up visit, he said she has alzheimer's and is depressed. he recommended two medicines, one for the depression and one for her memory.  he really didn't talk much in front of her and i will admit that i was woefully unprepared for this conversation. he didn't prescribe the medicine yet as he said it was up to my mom if she wants to take them. i need to call him to follow up on the medicine and to try to better understand her current situation but i do not really know where to begin. what questions should i be asking him when i speak to him? should i take my mom to another neurologist for a second opinion? thanks for the help. i just feel very overwhelmed and uninformed.", i doubt it's worth getting a second opinion. it sounds like the doctor had lots of information on which to base his opinion. i agree it is worth ensuring that no urinary tract infection is occurring as this could have a negative affect on her functioning. do a little reading up on the subject and write down a few questions for your next conversation with the doctor. the drugs suggested sound quite reasonable. good luck!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jeprmb/mom_recently_diagnosed_and_im_completely_lost/,Mom recently diagnosed and I'm completely lost.
"my grandma is almost 80 and our family was advised by her doctor that she either needs a care taker or to live in a nursing home. however she thinks she can take care of herself and dislikes a stranger in the house and following her everywhere. my grandfather (her husband) lives with her currently, and the rest of the family lives close (a 10 minutes walk away), but we have work/school so we can‚Äôt watch her all the time. i imagine she would feel abandoned in a nursing home, as she‚Äôs now very confused after being hospitalized (with restraints) for a few days. she claims that somebody is trying to kill her and her family, and even refuses to get her insulin shots and medications because they would kill her. she suffers from diabetes and depression and has panic attacks sometimes. any advice would be very helpful. thanks!"," try having a chore worker/support person come in a day a week to help with chores (wash floors, start supper) and also to do some simple activities with her such as looking at picture albums or playing cards.  or a monthly nurse visit to come in to ""check her blood pressure.""   the point is to develop trust and a comfort level with helpers.once she's used to that, you can gently increase the number of hours.  have help with washing hair, maybe with bathing.  another ploy is that it will make things so much easier on her husband to get help with stuff.  if he's mentally competent, enlist him to talk her into it.make sure she's getting treatment for depression and panic attacks.  sometimes those are not adequately diagnosed and treated in the elderly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jeoa15/how_can_i_convince_my_grandma_to_accept_a/,"How can I convince my grandma to accept a full-time, live-in care taker?"

"my mum is 62.she has diagnosed depression and several other ailments. shes on a lot of medication as well as sleeping pills that tend to make her very confused (she once started baking brownies and then went to sleep forgetting shed started. this happened about 6 years ago)she also doesn't sleep well due to restless leg syndrome and phantom pains in her amputated leg. two nights ago she didnt sleep at all as she didnt have a lot of her medication. we got her the medication yesterday and she slept most of the afternoon and all through the night.this morning she cleaned the entire fridge, did a whole bunch of other cleaning and then weny to go have breakfast. after breakfast she went to clean the fridge again and was shocked to find it clean thinking someone else did it. she didnt remember doing it herself.she doesnt normally forget whole events. more just small conversations etc and mostly only at night when shes taken her tablets. could this have been a result of the stress from lack of sleep and then taking all her medications or could it be dementia or alzheimers?", it could be a combo of a few things. but it definitely sounds like signs of alzheimers. do you see her behavior getting worse in the evenings?  i would definitely take her in.  there is no cure but there is medication that can slow down the process.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jdztou/could_this_be_alzheimers/,Could this be alzheimer's?

"so my mom is in the end of her alzheimer. tuesday we agreed to stop offering her food and water. she is sleeping most of the day, and in a bad place when she wakes up. it's hard to tell if she is in pain or whatever, but she is very tormented. last night they gave her 40mg morphine (i'm told that's a lot). the nurses say we should expect her to die within the next few days. it's been 7 years since she got diagnosed. i thought i was ready to let her go, i thought that i had found my peace and that i could accept the circumstances, but it's just so hard watching my mom die in front of me.the hole family is together, but somehow i still feel alone all the time. she is 57 years old.i don't want to sleep or be away from her. the thought of her dying alone is making me feel sick."," i‚Äôm so sorry for your loss, you are going to be ok, you‚Äôre mom is a peace üíú. i will be praying for you and your family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/jbrbnu/i_thought_i_was_ready_help/,I thought I was ready - help

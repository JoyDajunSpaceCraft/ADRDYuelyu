"hey reddit i am basically the sole caregiver of my great grandpa who most likely has dementia, severe. he doesn’t retain very much for longer then 10 minutes. what he does retain, he obsessed over. he’s very angry and picks fights. he’s right no matter what. he forgets to eat, and he eats very little. if he forgets to eat, it’s worse. i’m only 21, and i have my own problems physically and mentally. and i’m recognizing this is way worse then anyone told me, or will believe including himself. so my question is; what are the end stages? what are the signs that i need to absolutely do something? right now, i don’t know what to do. he won’t listen to me if i say his memory is fucked, and i can’t say it without breaking my own heart, i think."," sounds like behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia to me.  if you haven't researched that, i recommended that you do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9zap86/end_stages/,End stages?

"this sunday my dad (83m) fell, hit his head and was found by emt’s. (he pushed his button, but not right away).  we don’t know how long he was down.   by the time the helicopter got him to the hospital, it had been 2 hours after the emt’s called me.   there are no signs of a stroke or a concussion.  however he is fully in dementia. right now he has no idea who he is, who i am, or who anyone is. the first day he was like a 3yo in a hospital bed with nothing to do.  yesterday he got violent and injured 2 of the 1 on 1 nurses.  eventually haldol was given, which slowed him down, but he was still aggressive.we had known he was slowly going into dementia, and up until last week, he was doing fine living alone at home.   last year i had arranged seemingly random visits from his friends to check on him given how secluded his home is.   i live 4 hours and a ferry ride away, so visits usually aren’t more than once a month.  i have full poa i believe (medical yes, didn’t bring the rest of the packet because i thought it was another fall).  his supplemental insurance is good, so is there any tests we should have done?  the doctor has said he doesn’t expect the hallucinations to stop for at least another week maybe longer.  this doctor has been the best that he has had in a long time; completely willing to listen and answer questions anytime.   i don’t know what is specialty is, however i am been told by the nurses, he is their ‘specialist’ for dementia patients.  here (in a nutshell) is what he told me last night:  the medications are almost out of his system, however he is getting progressively worse.  it’s his belief that the head hit is what the definite cause of the onset of dementia (initial thoughts were alcohol or od).  if there is a break in the hallucinations, it won’t likely come for at least another week.  and his new ‘normal’ will still require him to be put into a home.  i hope i got that right....it has all been a blur.  dad and i have had a difficult relationship most of our lives, and right now i am his only family.   other than waiting, finding all the documents (i have them at home) and eventually, finding him a home, what is next?  what do you wish you knew at this stage? what do you wish you had at this stage?  my support system is 1200+ miles away and could fly them in if i must...thanks (52m)"," you need to bring him to your support system. i thought my father would kick and scream taking him from his house....but the reality was he did not even remember it. my father became violent as well. i think it’s frustration and confusion lashing out. my mother was his care taker, and when she passed away we relocated him to a nice facility by my sisters house. he needs twenty four hour care. this is. rey difficult to do. the last summer in the house my father would get up in the middle of the night and start working on the house. fixing door knobs, etc. when he was in the home he would wake up in the middle of the night, shower, and go the cafeteria to find it closed. the nurses would prompt him back to bed,...btw my father lasted two years in the home. he had a decent end of life there. good care.

"hi all. last summer (july 2017), my step-dad was told that he most likely had dementia, and a few months later, we got a confirmed diagnosis of it being frontotemporal. my mom had been noticing signs for years prior to the diagnosis, but as i'm only in my mid teens, i didn't really remember a time without him acting the way he did. as a result, i didn't really know how to deal with this information - i understood what dementia was, but i guess i couldn't absorb what was really happening on top of the incredibly hectic year i had started to have. at that point in time, my parents shouted at one another constantly. my step-dad would say hurtful things to me and then repeat them after forgetting that he had said them. he also didn't want to admit that there was anything wrong - he was convinced that his memory issues stemmed from being stressed out by work. then, over the course of mid 2018, he mellowed out. now, he instead follows my mom everywhere, has no idea how to google anything/do many independant tasks, and has had his driver's license taken away. he scored 15 out of 30 on (what i believe was) the mmse test after only a few months of having the diagnosis, which is much farther along then most people should be for that period of time. throughout this, however, i thought i was okay with what was happening.for some reason, this past month has been horrible for me - it's as if all of the feelings i should have felt last year are now all crashing down. i can't concentrate on anything without thinking about how this disease isn't just about watching someone become more forgetful, but that it's about watching my step-dad eventually forget how to eat, speak, or recognize people. i've cried at school so many times because i'm just so sad and frustrated with the fact that i'm mourning someone that is still in front of me, and yet i have no idea what that should look like. i'm also trying to help around the house as much as i can to relieve some of my mom's stress, but i feel so helpless. why did the reality of this only just hit me? do any of you have experience in feeling this way? any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.&amp;#x200b;\-anneliesse"," you are in the middle of the grief cycle.  it's very normal to go through this.  you are experiencing a traumatic series of events and as you continue to process the facts and reality that you are faced with, you will continue to go through many bouts of emotion.  i'm 36 and my dad has bv ftd and alzheimer's.  my mom recently left him and my brother died at age 33.  needless to say, i want to cry everyday for many reasons.  talk to someone...a friend, counselor, these message boards, and know that you are not alone.  read up on the aftd network and look at possibly getting involved as an advocate.  although you are young, you may be able to help others in similar positions as you.  good luck.  be strong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9ypfz4/problems_coming_to_terms_with_frontotemporal/,Problems coming to terms with frontotemporal dementia

"a great deal of attention has been paid to microglia activation in alzheimer's disease, but this article suggest that activation may not be as great as once believed and that at the end stages of alzheimer's disease microglia may become dysfunctional.[the following provides a similar pattern for t-cells that may also apply to microglia in alzheimer's disease.[[the following point may be a critical one for understanding alzheimer's disease: oxidative stress both precedes, causes, and mediates the effects of amyloid oligomers and activated microglia.  once the oligomers are converted into plaques and microglia become largely deactivated--it is oxidative stress that continues to damage the brain.&amp;#x200b;"," lane, the review you posted actually was a very enjoyable read, i think most researchers don't truly appreciate the stark differences in microglial biology between the human disease and rodent models.  this needs to be a higher consideration for many people as microglial-targeted therapeutic strategies are tested in animals and advance to clinical testing.  however, in no way can we conclude that oxidative stress is the primary driver of damage in ad - the authors of the review (first link) admit that their work raises more questions than it answers. also in this review, phosph-tau is the killer of microglia, not peroxynitrate. from my evaluation of this paper, i would wonder if these microglia could be classified as senescent, which opens up a whole other can of worms.&#x200b;in the second paper, on t-lymphocyte activation, you of course see only what you want to see.  in this paper, they show that peroxynitration very specifically mediates apoptotic cell death via activation of cd3, and when the peroxynitrate-treated t-lymphocytes are treated with other stressors, they are absolutely fine.  while microglia are basically immune cells, they are not very similar to t-lymphocytes (according to my limited understanding), and don't express cd3. this paper is also nearly 20 years old.&#x200b;the second paper (which is almost 25 years old, wow!) merely states that microglia depend on tyrosine phosphorylation for their signaling and activation. almost every cell type in the body has primary signaling pathways that depend on tyrosine phosphorylation.&#x200b;as usual, you have taken square pegs (these papers) and tried to ram them into the round hole that is your quixotic quest, the peroxynitration theory",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9xngn9/microglia_in_alzheimers_disease/,Microglia in Alzheimer's disease

"hi everyone.  i'm 36 years old and smack dab in the middle of the the biggest challenge of my life.  in 2013 my brother passed away from an undiagnosed enlarged heart.  we all took the loss hard but dad (age 63) really struggled to cope.  i knew from the moment that we found my brother deceased that something broke in him that day.  fast forward to 2015.  dad's behavior progressively became more erratic, violent, and lacked any sort of empathy for his actions.  his wife (my mom) left him after 43 years of marriage due to his behaviors and he often reportedly lacked insight into how any of his behaviors may have contributed to the separation.  i always thought that he behaved in a narcissistic manner and just chopped up his lack of insight to his narcissistic personality.  in 2016 dad was arrested for the first time in his life for showing up to a football game intoxicated.  he was put on diversion and as part of his punishment, he was required to complete a mental health exam.  upon completion of the exam, the psychologist recommended that dad complete a physical exam and a cat scan.  in 2016 a scan of his brain was done and sure enough....frontotemporal dementia and an alzheimer's diagnosis.  after meeting with his newly acquired neurologist, dad (age 63) was demonstrating symptoms associated with frontotemporal dementia, behavioral variant type and alzheimer's.  so not only were his days a major struggle behaviorally, but every day is a new day and he doesn't have any recollection of the previous day.at first i was unsure about his diagnosis but the more i learned about the disease and observed his behavior on a daily basis, the more it was evident that the neurologist was spot on.  now that mom has left him and my sibling is no longer living, i am his only family and sole support system/caretaker.  to add a wrinkle to the story, his mother (age 90) is still living and was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's as well.  her symptoms progressed rapidly and due to dad not being cognitively able to manage her or support her, i became her poa and recently moved her into an assisted living facility.  dad lives in grandma's house and he even still drives.  most people gasp when i tell them about him driving but part of his ftd is routine and he drives the same routes every day (40-80 miles per day), to the same 5 spots in town, over and over and over again.  he eats the same food each day, doesn't attempt to cook at home, and i track his every move through gps software.  i ride with him weekly to monitor his speed, distance, decision-making, etc.  he's still an excellent driver....unless there is a distraction such as a ball or tangible item that may seem misplaced on the side of the road.  he stops and picks these items up every time and that worries me.  i'm trying to promote his independence as much as possible knowing that there is no turning back once the keys are lost but i also don't know at what point that decision should be made.so here i sit....a 36 year old male, who owns and operates 5 businesses, poa and ultimate caregiver to dad and grandma with progressing dementia/alzheimer's, and i have a wife of 13 years and 3 children...ages 8, 5, 4.  i'm trying to balance everything but undoubtedly this caretaking role is taking its toll on my mental and physical health, my marriage, my ability to be the best parent possible,  and my effectiveness as a business owner.  i'm in the acceptance phase of this process.  i know it's going to get worse and not get better.  but i feel like i am on my own island here and i could use some advice, direction, resources from people that have been in a similar situation.  i'm open to any questions, feedback, suggestions, or input as to how i can continue to navigate this without sacrificing everything.  thank you in advance.brian"," i'm also 36 and my dad has ftd, and it's the hardest thing that has ever happened to me.  i don't have a lot of advice except to recommend you try to do at least one thing each week just for yourself, something that you love. i find that goes a long way.  will be thinking of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9xibjw/frontotemporal_dementia_journey/,Frontotemporal Dementia Journey

"this is one of the best explanations for alzheimer's disease that is out there: i'm a non scientist who has reviewed research into non-communicable diseases, including alzheimer's, for 30 years. almost all are being caused by chronic, aberrant activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa beta (nf-kb). this includes alzheimer's.   nf-kb has multiple functions, but a principal function is the control of intracellular pathogens that establish long term latency inside cells, such as those mentioned in the article. such infections often contribute to damaging over activation of nf-kb, but are not essential for the initiation of the disease process. many other environmental and lifestyle factors contribute, such as gut microbiota, pro-inflammatory 'western' diet, exposure to environmental chemicals and metals, lack of immune challenge in infancy, lack of vitamin d, sedentary lifestyle, food/chemical allergy/sensitivity/intolerance, chronic psychological stress etc. important genetic factors include polymorphisms of the immune system, receptors and enzymes.   the nf-kb driven immune response combats cellular infection by causing reactive oxygen species to be produced inside cells. these are damaging to microbes. it also downregulates the receptors used by microbes to enter cells. this can take the form of reduced expression, desensitization, or receptor blockade by 'antibodies'. in alzheimer's, the acetylcholine nach and noradrenaline receptors are downregulated. these receptors are involved in learning, so chronic downregulation results in the earliest symptom of short term memory impairment. when this situation becomes chronic, cells die, leading to advanced disease symptoms.  [&amp;#x200b;my response:in reply to wullydavidson, this is one of the best explanations for alzheimer's disease that i have read in my fourteen years of researching alzheimer's disease as a non-scientist.   to amplify a bit on some of the main points. when nuclear factor-kappa beta is overactivated in alzheimer's disease it produces inducible nitric oxide. the simultaneous overactivation of nadph oxidase results in the production of superoxide anions. when superoxide anions and inducible nitric oxide combine they produce peroxynitrite.  &amp;#x200b;peroxynitrite damages receptors involved in the release of neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness and dampens the effect of growth factors on receptors needed for the regeneration of neurons and synapses in the hippocampus. peroxynitrite in part through dna damage also contributes to neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death.   the key to understanding alzheimer's disease and its treatment is likely the following:   these results suggest a dual-key mechanism, whereby glial inos \[inducible nitric oxide synthase\] or microglial nox \[nadph oxidase\] activation alone is relatively benign, but if activated simultaneously are synergistic in killing neurons, through generating peroxynitrite. this mechanism may mediate inflammatory neurodegeneration in response to cytokines, bacteria, atp, arachidonate and pathological prions, in which case neurons may be protected by inos or nox inhibitors, or scavengers of no, superoxide or peroxynitrite. [  various peroxynitrite scavenging compounds have stabilized early stage alzheimer's disease and slowed its later progression.   [   [  &amp;#x200b;if all or most of this is correct (and it is not just non-scientists reaching this conclusion), then the ability to treat this disease is already there (although it likely could be improved upon)."," how does this theory make sense of the amyloid connection, and in what way does apoe4 tie in as a risk factor?any comments on the contrasts between this account and bredesen's recode protocol?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9w53xj/a_better_understanding_of_alzheimers_disease/,A better understanding of Alzheimer's disease

"i understand that those with this disease won’t understand reason, or the fact that they already asked where their husband/wife/son is today 10 times. or the fact that they feel they need to go somewhere. but how is lying to them any different then telling them the truth? i’d feel so dirty and rotten if i had to lie to my parents several times a day. do they feel safer with the lie? truly interested in the psychology side. thanks for helping me understand."," my father was visited by ""sexy aliens""  there was no convincing him that they didn't exist and he got angry that we were calling him a liar if we even tried.  it's almost impossible to explain the struggles to someone who has never gone through this painful experience with someone they love.  you have to join them in their world and recognize that as they live only in the moment they are in, all you can do is make that moment as pleasant as possible.  a dementia patient who is angry is looking for an explanation for that anger and an outlet.  almost anything you say will result in rage. if throwing a plate and glass makes them feel better, you clean it up and are glad that they have been able to express and relieve that emotion.

"hey guys. my aunt (63) has started acting a bit strange within the past year or so. it started as her losing her train of thought in the middle of a conversation, but she laughed it off as getting old. however, last christmas things started to go south. she ended up showing up to christmas dinner 5 hours late because her and my uncle got into a fight about missing presents, even though none were missing. when my aunt finally showed up, she appeared confused, agitated and could barely stand. she is on several medications for migraines, depression, diabetes etc, so we thought it might’ve been a bad mixture of meds. my uncle promised that he was going to take her to the doctor as soon as they got home to get things situated. my aunt went to the doctor shortly after christmas , and her medication dosage was adjusted. things started to appear better, but shortly after, things began to go slowly downhill. she became increasingly paranoid. she thought that every conversation that she wasn’t apart of was about her. she forgot basic things, and got easily agitated if something in her routine went wrong (shower curtain fell down, laundry is wrinkled etc). my uncle has been doing his best to keep her calm and comfortable, and things once again just kept getting better, and then worse over and over again. fast forward to a few days ago, and things have escalated. she now thinks my uncle is hiding money from her (he’s not), and has been tearing apart the house and the car in attempts in finding the missing cash. my mom and my aunt are very close, so she went down to be with my aunt. my mom more than likely did not help the situation as they tend to feed off of each other’s anger, so my uncle decided to stay with his brother for a few days to give my aunt some space. my mom is stays with her. today, i got a call from my mom. my aunt woke my mom up from nap, and started screaming at her about the laundry. my mom got up, and followed my aunt to the laundry room where my aunt proceeded to throw laundry at my mom yelling at her to hang it up. my mom refused to tell me the rest of what had happened. my mom was hysterically crying - almost hyperventilating. i asked if there was something i could do. she said no. i then asked if she was safe. my mom said “i think so”. i asked what can we do to help my aunt, and she replied with “i don’t know”. my mom then said, “i have to go. if your aunt sees me on the phone, she’s going to be furious”, and then hung up. the conversation worried me, but my mom texted me shortly after saying that she was going home tomorrow. i’m worried that my aunt is going to be alone (not sure when my uncle is coming back), and i’m incredibly worried about my aunts health. i know this could be something else, but my brain keeps on coming back to dementia. my grandma had it, and this is all looking too familiar. my aunt has been refusing to go to any doctors for the past month or so as she doesn’t trust them, so we can’t even figure out what is really going on. is this her meds, or something more serious? i don’t know what i can do to get her the help that she needs, dementia or not. sorry for the novel, and sorry if this is not the right place. i just hate seeing my aunt like this, and i feel helpless. any advice on what i can do will be greatly appreciated. sorry for words or formatting. i’m on mobile."," it could be lewy body dementia. your aunt would need to be seen by a neurologist to be diagnosed. the problem with lbd is that often, the sick person is convinced there's nothing wrong with them, so getting them to go to the doctor is a battle. if she refuses to go to the doctor, unfortunately, your only real option (at least in the us) is to wait until she is a danger to herself or others, and then call 911 to have her taken to the emergency room.the symptoms you describe remind me of what i went through with my mother before she was diagnosed. i couldn't get her to go to the doctor either. we had to wait until things escalated when she started wandering out of the house in the middle of the night. she also started calling 911 herself around that time because she was imagining intruders in the house.something that was helpful for me was to keep a journal of incidents that occurred, and the dates/times that they occurred. that was helpful in getting her diagnosed.incidentally my mom was also 63 when her dementia finally became noticeable to people outside of our immediate family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9uah7c/undiagnosed_but_concerned/,[deleted by user]
"forgive me if this question comes off as a little naive, but i am a media-addled layman who has witnessed this trope a number of times in film and television over the years. the most prominent example that juts out in my mind would be in the first season of shameless. this has always seemed to me like a bit of creative extrapolation on the part of the storytellers to make for compelling drama and not a factual symptom of dementia.  i have some cursory experiences with dementia myself. my great-grandmother-grandma-grandma, as i called her-had been stricken with it in her later years. when i was younger, i saw her quite often, but by the time my grandmother had transferred her to a care facility, she had little recollection of who i was. by this time, i was a 14-year-old boy who had just recently grown his hair out to shoulder length. whenever we would go to visit, she would comment on what a pretty girl i was. this memory has always stuck with me as the first real instance of understanding what dementia actually was, but i didn't get too many more like them.  from what i do understand about dementia, its effect on more recent memories is much graver than more historical ones and given that i was undergoing puberty and major changes in my physical appearance-such as blossoming into a young woman-it would make sense that her memories of me, the newest addition to our tribe, might be scrubbed away by the advancement of the disease.   i recently began working on a project that hinges on the concept of an elderly individual no longer being able to recognize members of their family, and because of my brush with dementia, it was first to my mind. however, i'm not particularly satisfied with taking sweeping creative liberties and misrepresenting this affliction. i figured that if i kept close to my own experiences that it would allow for a more personal exploration of the story, so i want to know if i am barking up the wrong tree before i move forward and find an answer more rooted in reason.  so, can anyone confirm or deny? thank you all in advance for reading my post and providing your insights!"," dementia patients lose the ability to learn.  while they may mistake a person for someone else one time, they would not learn a new relationship with that person based on that.  yes, this is an essential misinterpretation hollywood does.  dementia isn't something that can be expressed in a whimsical way.

she's obsessed with islam and offers more prayers than is deemed compulsory in the islamic faith. her sleeping pattern is extremely messed up due to jet lag and her having to wake up every few hours to offer prayers and read the holy book. she'd purposefully wake herself up by setting an alarm to not miss a prayer. we've tried disabling the alarm but she'd wake up regardless. it's impossible to get anything through her head and i'm 100% sure it's only getting worse. she has her bouts of anger and long silences. it's devastating seeing her like this and all i ask from her right now is to get some sleep. logic and reasoning only agitates her.," this isn't an instant solution but i would try and help your aunt stay awake during daytime hours and try and limit the amount of coffee and tea, if she drinks those, in the evening hours to help with proper sleep.   if family members can get her out for a walk or two during the day the exercise might help her to return to a proper sleep schedule, although with people with memory issues they can be up at odd hours no matter what you do.  but it's worth a try.would it help with her anger if you offered to read the koran with her in the early morning hours, to help her feel that you support her faith connection but not during the night?a distorted sleep schedule throws my relative off and she can get angry, too.  in her case it was late night phone calls to a friend who also has memory issues and the next few days were so bad she had to be hospitalized for a day because she was presenting like she might have had a stroke (she didn't).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9u2f7x/how_do_i_deal_with_an_aunt_with_severe/,[deleted by user]

"hi,[tldr] is it safe for a vascular dementia patient to take thorazine (6.25mg 1x every night) for intractable hiccups?would be so grateful to get your advice on this. actually, i'm at my wit's end, desperate for a resolution to this painful problem which is causing so much pain to my whole family since feb 2017.it took almost one and a half year to get a (hopefully) accurate diagnosis of neurogenic hiccups (earlier almost all experts were treating it as a gastro/vagus nerve related problem).and now finally when we got the drug for it [thorazine], it came with that bold boxed warning of ""use of antipsychotic medications increases the risk of death among elderly patients.""even after reading much research online, i'm unable to get a solid answer as to how much of a dose is unsafe for vascular dementia patient.and it's taking too long to get another neurologist's opinion, which we definitely will but might take 2 to 3 months and current hiccups have become even more brutal, especially after stroke in may.though a cardiologist said this dose of 6.25mg or 1/4th of 25mg 1x every night thorazine might not be a problem, but i want to be sure and hence asking selected experts online to see how many will agree with the treatment.i know it is difficult for you to advise about this, but i just want to know how unsafe such low dosage would be for my dad [vascular dementia patient, diagnosed 6 months ago] to weigh the risks/benefits.thank you for your time and concern, it means a lot to us.my father is suffering from intractable hiccups [currently 16-20 hours daily] for over 18 months.it is really painful for him and for us as well.he is unable to eat or sleep or even communicate adequately. they became more intense after stroke in may [more details later]. 4-6 times, often after a nap he encounters a kind of hiccup that makes him breathless for a few seconds and it takes some moments to recover from it. but most of the time they seem normal but the duration and nonstop nature make them very painful.fda warningwww.canhr.org/newsroom/newdev_archive/2009/fda-alert-on-antipsychotics.pdf 1gill ss et al. antipsychotic drug use and mortality in older adults with dementia. ann intern med. 20072risk of death associated with the use of conventional versus atypical antipsychotic drugs among elderly patients.these are the two studies fda warning is based on.unfortunatly none specifies exact dosage and cause of death [most ""assumed"" cardiovascular or numerous infections but not clear afaik]will appreciate if someone more knowledgeable will interpret the results.he was prescribed number of drugs [details in the end], mostly gastroenterological related but none worked. but last mri [july] showed his hiccups are central neurogenic in nature. he was diagnosed with vascular dementia in mid of may 2018.the neurologist who diagnosed both conditions has prescribed thorazine/chlorpromazine(largactil). but we are very concerned about the main fda boxed warning on the first page that warns it's not suitable for treatment of dementia patients. it increases the risk of mortality in elderly dementia patients.the neurologist says he is only trying to treat intractable hiccups and that too starting from very low dosage i.e 6.25mg or 1/4th of 25 mg thorazine daily once at bedtime.the fda website and other resources also recommend not giving antipsychotics to dementia patients [links in the end]. but afaik no resource states if it is unsafe for vascular dementia patients or how much dosage can prove dangerous.   so we want to be sure if 6.25mg thorazine daily once at bedtime is safe to test for 1 to 2 weeks?--------------details--------------***************** current health problems *****************-vascular dementia-chronic high blood pressure, -stress and anxiety -type 2 diabetes -obesity -gout [uric acid currently controlled in 6-7 range]-high cholesterol**** conditions that have happened/diagnosed since april 2018 *****-father was hospitalized on 22nd april 2018 mainly due to not being able to pass urine for many hours. they were admitted to cardiology ccu due to high bp [220+/120+], given lasix injections etc to lower bp quickly. -central pontine myelinolysis-hyponatremia [lowest = 101, corrected in 7-9 days after 2x 3% hypertonic saline solution, now stable in 135-138 range]-stroke and previous mini strokes [mostly on left side]-silent heart attack [probably in late last year, but not sure via echo., ef=45-50]-multiple lacunar infarcts-urine and blood infections [hospitable acquired, now gone after tanzo injections and removal of catheter]-currently can walk only 70-80 steps with the help of walker two times daily.-loss of appetite, current diet = less than 1500 calories-physiotherapy 30 minutes 5 days a week since mid of june. - with reference to fluid loss, how much fluid to take during treatment?

and how long before that did you start noticing the symptoms?you've mentioned his diet and listed some supplements he takes. qalsan d is pretty suitable for daily use to get calcium and vit d, but i've gotta say sunny d is pretty awful. it barely has the vit c he needs, if any at all, and it's just pure sugar. ::which if he has type ii diabetes you need to be careful with that::but vit c is highly recommended for proper absorption of calcium and vit d. cranberries are an excellent source of vit c, and i see you've listed cran max. i've tried looking up the nutrition info and all it says it provides is cranberry concentrate. for the most part it has decent reviews, and it's pretty harmless if it is actually just cranberry concentrate, but since it's not listing any actual nutritional daily value information or anything i would be careful with it. especially if he's also on maxflow (also, i'm thinking that's what it may be called where you live, but i assume you're talking about tamsulosin). is there a reason you alternate the cran max and maxflow? and does he still have urinary problems leftover from the infection or is he taking this more to prevent fluid retention?gaviscon is suitable for stomach upset. i would just recommend to take it separately from other medication -if possible. it is an antacid so it coats the stomach in order to relieve symptoms (basically), so other medication taken within around 15-20 min will not be absorbed as effectively. to be clear, there is not really any kind of drug interactions with gaviscon and what your father is on. the meds will still work, just maybe stretch them out if he takes this. i had to be mindful of the same thing taking pepto bismol and antibiotics one time.also, is there a reason he's taking both glucerna and nepro? i would understand one or the other but usually not both. considering his kidney function i would favor nepro over glucerna since he's taking medication for his diabetes and diet helps with diabetes as well, which is what glucerna is mainly marketed for. and idk exactly what type of kidney problems he has, but it's common to keep an eye on his potassium levels to make sure they're not too high. however, if he's not eating then honestly it doesn't much matter, as long as he gets something in him.-and as a few others have said, i think the doctors decided the reward outweighs the risk for taking the thorazine. it's a matter of what diagnoses has higher priority at the moment. sorry this response was long, i couldn't help but notice a few things about what you listed so i just wanted to mention some insight along with your question.one last thing. idk what kind of insurance you have, but please try to take the time to see a therapist (or find someone here or even r/kindvoice to talk to). taking care of yourself is equally as important as taking care of your father. everyone here understands the battle you're fighting and how emotionally taxing it can be. unfortunately with dementia, it only gets worse and i'd love to see you spend the time you have left with your father being happy together. let his doctor be the doctor, you be his kid. it's not easy, but your dad is unimaginably lucky to have a child like you to care so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9r61kc/please_reply_asap_concern_about_prescription_of/,[PLEASE REPLY ASAP] Concern about prescription of Thorazine (6.25mg 1x every night) for Intractable Hiccups for a Vascular Dementia patient

"my dad (57) has behavioral variant ftd, which he’s been officially diagnosed with about a year ago. it’s a mapt imputation tauopathy, so obviously i have a 50% of developing the disease in my 50’s as well, which routinely scares me. i’m currently 20 right now. he had been acting a bit weird two years before officially being diagnosed. right now, he has huge social inhibition: not making much deep conversation or interest of it in any way, lack of insight in general, some short term memory problems, and is extremely obsessive compulsive. he’s convinced spitting makes him less likely to have to pee as much rather than swallowing it, he’s obsessed with getting 10,000 steps a day, and has to eat at 5 pm every day. he likes to talk about himself and will often tell the same stories. he’s very warm as he’s always been but often can’t read when someone is uncomfortable with him.the presentation of his symptoms, like his father, have sort of heightened the already overtly-social and extroverted personality he’s always had. he is still warm, loving, and kind. he is not aggressive (his father never laid a hand on his mother during the 12 years he suffered with the disease) and is just mainly often very confused and more quiet in general. he still asks where i’m going if i’m going out and what time i’ll be back like he’s always had, and still has that fatherly instinct in him. he makes his own breakfast and cleans up after himself perfectly well. he gets the paper, does the laundry everyday and dishwasher (compulsively). he asks people every day if they’ve had their showers so he can do the laundry and will ask us this frequently despite us being not in our pajamas and already telling him we haven’t.my biggest fear is that his progression at some point will affect me deeply and cause me to be suffering with anxiety and depression to the point where i can’t work and graduate uni with the degree classification i want. i’m not scared of him progressing, as i already seem to (at least intellectually) accept his inevitable decline and eventual perishing of his soul and personality. right now, i’m fine. i’ve thought it through a lot over the past year, have a fucking kickass mother and family, and my friends are there for me for all of it. my biggest help is my dad himself, with his unrelenting smile. he is living a happy life, albeit confused. like a puppy or something.however, i often worry my contentedness is merely conditional. that, at some point, once my dad’s condition interminably progresses, his decline will truly become cognizant to me. perhaps his relative similarity to his old self is what is making it seem like it’s not fully real to me yet. but i’m scared once he does decline, my personal goals and ambitions will be put on hold. that this fucking degree i’m going for will be elusive, as i become unable to do anything but be miserable over him. that it makes me unable to pass a year, and not have enough money to make up for it and force me to drop out. tl:dri guess i’m just wondering if you guys have an experience of not really feeling affects of your loved one’s illness for a time in the earlier stages of the disease, to suddenly truly understanding what it means at a certain point of progression. and if you think that it becomes too difficult to be happy or pursue one’s dreams once this happens. i guess i’m also looking to make contacts with young people like me who are similar situations to at least be able to talk to."," i just graduated last year. i'll give you *my* experience as the sole caregiver to my mom at age 26 with parkinson's dementia. it wasn't easy, it wasn't fun, and  i had (still do) a hard time coping with things.it took me 6 years to graduate - i failed many classes and had to drop out of a lot of classes as well. not only from missing school but from anxiety/depression mostly related to taking care of my mother. i juggled work, school, and my mom. now that i'm done school, i'm still stuck at my shitty part time job, stuck in thousands of dollars of debt, with no real future in sight for me. i regret going to school because i'm just wasting everything i did.so yeah, it will affect you. but you decide on how much it will affect you. how much support do you have at home? are there other people to help you? these things matter. i can't sugarcoat things because it's not fair. hope everything goes ok.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9qouyt/father_has_dementia_while_im_at_college_scared_of/,"Father has dementia while I’m at college, scared of it affecting my work ethic"

"hi. my name is ben. recently my mother has been diagnosed with alzheimer's at the age of 55. i myself am 21. i'm not used to redit at all, so i apologize if this post is completely inappropriate. in all honesty, i really struggle to open up to people close to me. it somehow seems easier to do so online.i also want to mention, i certainly don't see myself as a victim of circumstance. i feel like i may have caused my mothers condition. i am very uneducated in alzheimer's but from what has been explained to me, it was somehow caused by her having many small strokes as well as extremely poorly managed diabetes.  i have added to her stress and poor quality of life. i would like to explain for my own benefit below.when i was 14 my dad passed away from cancer and my mother was devastated by this. she fell into some kind of depression and stopped caring for me and my brother who has a mild form of autism. i resented her for this, something i now feel terrible and unjustified in doing. as time went on, my mother kept finding herself in financial trouble as she had no energy to continue. it got to a stage where i had to pay her mortgage and other debts to keep the house over our heads. i made the excuse that i couldn't go to university because i had to look after my mum and brother. in reality, i probably would have preformed poorly in university.  between my brother and mother always getting into money issues, i was under a lot of stress. eventually i started snapping at them any time some cold caller would sell them something or my mum went into hospital (i thought she was doing it because she couldn't be bothered to take insulin for her diabetes.) when i say snapped, i mean horribly so. i was a bully. i didn't mean to make her cry or feel like a bad mother, i was just so angry at her and falsely blamed my own faults and problems on what i though was her abandoning me.this has been so much longer than i thought and i thank you for reading this far. i know i am undeserving of any peace of mind, but where else am i to find it if not the internet? in short, all i want to know is, did my actions contribute to my mother's condition? should i report my abuse toward my mother to anyone, such as the police?"," hi there. first off, i do not believe that you caused your mother’s dementia. i do feel that emotionally jarring events such as the death of a spouse can facilitate dementia. it’s possible that you contributed in some ways to a process that was already underway. when you say you were a bully and abusive, what do you mean by this? were you physically beating your mother and brother? if so, then you may be more directly linked to the disease she now has. before you think i’m throwing in the towel on you, consider this: your father died when you were 14. did you ever even get to properly mourn his death? also, adolescents between the ages of 14 and 21 are still developing. your brain is not yet fully developed. notice how now, at the age of 21 you are more thoughtful about how your mother may have been feeling in her state of mourning. your 14 year old self is not the same person as your 21 year old self. maybe you were selfish (side thought: who was comforting you during your grieving? and it sounds like you lost mother when you lost your father), but you also needed to grieve and be comforted. maybe you were selfish, but what percent of 14 year olds aren’t? your 21 year old self is recognizing how you could have been a better person. decide to be that better person. instead of continuing to beat yourself up and tell yourself you do not deserve peace of mind, forgive yourself! yes, you were a jerk. now is the time, in light of this recognition, to be thoughtful. take care of your brother, who needs you. i bet your mother would want this. channel your mental energy into a career that will help you to financially provide for your mother and brother, without (very important!) making yourself miserable and destitute in the process. don’t punish yourself. forgive yourself. take care of you, then take care of them.remember: you are 21 now and your father died when you were 14. that was only 7 years ago. and given your mother’s age, it seems that there might be a genetic component to it. has she been genetically tested for early onset dementia? i am no expert here, but that was a thought that came to me.what family support do you have? aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins...? tl;dr: no, you are not to blame. accept that you were a jerk of a teenager like the rest of us and move forward. forgive yourself.

(we seriously try to accommodate her in every way we can).  but we simply don't have the funds to do so. in fact, we rely on her ss income just to help pay the bills.does anyone know good ways to deal with a loved one with dementia who becomes increasingly hostile while still being able to provide care at home?  we really just try to be nice to her, take her for drives or give her hugs (when she'll accept them).","   kinda not what you are asking about, but one thing i wish someone had told us about 3 years ago was do some research and talk to a lawyer if you can afford it to start planning ahead for that inevitable day when you can no longer care for her at home.  qualifying her for medicare or whatever to be able to get her in a facility , however many years down the road that might be,  will be much easier if you start planning for that now. there is  some financial stuff that you will kick yourself for not doing at some point, especially if you are at a point of relying on her ss income right now. more to your question, i think there are some common things that  maybe some others have commented about but i think it comes down to the bond you have with that person and how you deal with those angry outbursts more than her. you can't change that or stop it completely but personally it's taken me 3 years to be able to calmly neal there and talk my dad down when he is yelling at the top of his lungs. i tried just agreeing with him, i tried showing him pictures of people and places to convince him of reality, i lost my temper and yelled back a few times.  now i just kinda go into that mode whenever he gets like that and i just tell him it's going to be ok and touch him if i can and try and speak calmly and slowly in a soothing manner. i don't know man. i'm winging this just like y'all are. hope that helps and good luck and hang in there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9o0rq5/my_mom_getting_angrier_every_day/,My mom getting angrier every day...

"good morning everyone! (its 8am here) first, im sorry but my english its not that good(im from romania), and my story is long and maybe different. im trying to find the courage to talk about this! i feel like nobody understand my situation. my grandpa has dementia(i think is in the last stage) and i and my grandma are taking care of him. he is very agressive, all of the time he wants to leave the house. he hits us so many times, especially my grandma. she is ill too, has some problems with her heart and her feet are always swollen (its water, and when the water will arrive to her heart she will die) . my narcissistic mom, my grandpa's daughter, doesnt take part in the caring process. long-short story : my dad died 2 years ago, at 49 y/o from an heart attack, and after 2 months(!!!!) she moved with new( yes, new) boyfriend and left us alone with my grandpa. we are in the process to get his ""special pension"". he has regular pension and the government will give us another one because of his disease. after we will receive that money i've talked with my grandma and we are going to put him into an asylum (this is the term here, we dont have nurses who could come home and help us with him). the problem is that my mom doesnt want to do that. mostly because she borrows money from us, and the asylum would be expensive and we would not have money to give her more. so she mostly says that he cant go into asylum because he will not know where the toilet is and he will want to leave 24/24. i really dont care about her opinion as long as she isnt involved in his caring.i just cant cope with this situation. i just took my bachelor degree and now im on master. i should be searching for jobs but i cant. im planning to move in another city with my boyfriend, but after i arrange things at home. i have no friends, no one to talk about this struggle, except my bf. the only reason that im staying home is my grandma. i love her so much and i cant let her alone with this man. even when he was healthy, he was a bad man. an acoholic abuser, so i hate him with all of my heart (im sorry to say this but he beat up my grandma so many times, and made hard days to me and my dad). i feel like my life is passing near me. im 23y/o,i should be working, making my own family but im stuck here. how do you deal with the agressive part with you beloved ones? what should i be doing? i feel lost and sad all the times. most of the nights we cant sleep because he wants to leave the house and start breaking things. any advice, anything you want to say to me, good or bad, is welcomed. thank you if you had the patience to read my story, but i have nowhere else to tell this. if anyone wants to talk throu messages, im more than greateful!"," if your grandfather is violent he has moved beyond you and your grandmother's ability to care for him and it relieves me to read you both want to send him into your country's equivalent of care. honestly i think you are doing the right things. you know long term caring for your grandfather is not viable. after reading about his violence, his attempts to leave, your grandmother's health problems and your misery i am also convinced of this. steps for getting him into an asylum as soon as possible should be taken and i am glad you are in the process of getting money to assist with this. regarding your mother not wanting this, why is it a problem? is it a problem because she has the power to prevent or make it legally difficult him going into an asylum, or is it a problem because her complaints and tantrums will make life difficult for you and she will turn relatives against you, or is it a problem because you naturally crave the approval of your mother? i am assuming not fear about her legally stopping it as you said you really don't care about her opinion, which is a healthy attitude to have. considering she thinks her need of money is more important than the mental and physical wellbeing of her daughter i would consider stopping lending money to her. does she see you as a daughter first, or as a moneylender first? if you have to pay her for her to like you, she isn't much of a mother.you are not wrong in wanting to stay with your grandmother to protect her from the worst of your grandfather, and you are not wrong in wanting to leave, find a job and start a family. is your grandmother aware you plan to move to a new city after your grandfather goes into the asylum? i would tell her if not, so she is prepared. after you have moved, i would personally call your grandmother regularly. this will help her feel like she hasn't been abandoned by all her family. (don't feel you are doing this by moving to another city. you can't sacrifice your own happiness just to make someone else happy). this will also allow you to monitor her health, check to see your mother hasn't taken financial advantage of her and that she is not being manipulated into taking your grandfather out of the asylum and caring for her at home. is hiring a regular cleaner viable? cleaning will get harder for her as she ages, and a regular visit may be able to spot her health declining and get help. i can't offer any help in the violence part. my grandmother is not violent (yet anyway) and my non-verbal autistic brother does have his moments of violence but i think it is a different situation to yours. thinking: ""we know he can't help it so we forgive him"" is ever so much easier to do when you actually like the person and he doesn't have a history of being violent when he could help it. neither apply to your situation.

"so i don't really know where to ask, i live rurally and the dr feels other health issues are the priority. so i'll ask you guys.i have a family member in their 50's suffering from various memory failures. including the common ones like forgetting words (and sometimes unable to even describe what we are looking for), forgetting names, people, events. remembering things happening that never happened, but maybe were talked about. most of it is short term problems though they have lost a lot of their ability to recognize things from the past (though we can recall fine on our own at a different time).the most striking issue though i can't find any information on because i can't think of how to phrase it so a search engine gives me relevant results. this family member frequently (multiple times a week) swaps their memory recollection of recent events. for example i might say ""it's cold outside"" and they might say ""no it's not cold at all"". but an hour later they will ask me why i told them it's not cold outside. when i tell them i did tell them it was cold outside, they will tell me that they said it was cold out and i told them it wasn't. this has even happened with things like ideology. maybe they say god is a woman, i say god is a dude (this is just an example i'm agnostic lol), the next day they will ask me how i can possibly believe god is female when clearly he is a dude. no matter how much i explain that they said god is woman they recall it reversed. even though if they stop to think about it they should be able to recognize that it's not something they would ever say, they can't. even if it's completely at odds with everything they know or believe. the false switched memory is dominant.it's very weird. does anyone have any ideas about cause? it seems to be a very specific problem that i haven't seen before and i have experience with alzheimer's and dementia. any help would be great so i can take something to the doctor to use as a jumping off point to deal with this. my family member keeps arguing we should record the conversations, which i have considered (they refuse to believe they are remembering it reversed). but i don't particularly think it will help (it might hurt) to shove it in their face they are wrong, so for the most part i have just started conceding and telling them they are right because i don't want to fight about it. and even if i played a recording back they would just remember it as confirming they were right the next day even though it wouldn't lol.", is this person a drinker? or have they been a heavy drinker in the past?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/9kf8x0/possible_health_causes_for_memory_problems/,Possible health causes for memory problems?
"both the praise and some of the criticism of the bredesen protocol are deserved.  because it is a multi-pronged approach, approval for a clinical trial was impossible to attain, so we are left with a series of case studies.dr. bredesen partially moved the dial in the conversation of what causes alzheimer's disease.  instead of searching for one cause (such as amyloid or tau) he found multiple risk factors for alzheimer's disease.  did he find them all?  not likely.   and that may in part explain why some people respond better to the protocol than others.  secondly, may of the triggers for alzheimer's disease end up through oxidation and nitration damaging the receptors by which they caused the damage in the first place.  so as the disease progresses, removing the triggers becomes less and less effective.the protocol also includes the use of several antioxidants (whether they are the best antioxidants is an important point of discussion).  this too is likely a key to treating alzheimer's disease.  oxidation and nitration are partially reversible processes although perhaps more so in the hippocampus (where neurons can be regenerated) than in the cortex (where neurons cannot be regeneration).r/&amp;#x200b;"," the diet, if it is working, is most likely working via modulation of blood sugar, blood pressure, and vascular health. peroxynitration and oxidative stress are often downstream of pathophysiological processes in neurological disease. most experts agree they are not the cause. op has already been banned from another scientific blog (derek lowe’s in the pipeline blog), frequented by experts much smarter than myself, for repeatedly posting his fringe theory of alzheimer’s disease and refusing to listen to reason. lane, as dr. lowe said in his comments: i’m not trying to silence you - this is just not the place to post unproven scientific theories. you are misrepresenting your pet, unaccepted theory of ad as fact to suffering patients and caregivers. start your own blog, or post on r/biology, r/neuro, or r/science.

"hello!first time poster in this subreddit but so happy to have found it. my wife’s mother is in her seventies (adopted my wife when they were in their forties, so my wife is only late 20s). my mil’s sister is getting more and more confused and delusional and is refusing help and lying to and about her caretakers. backstory (there’s a tl;dr at the end) *all names changed for this story* my mother-in-law, rhonda, had two sisters growing up, linda and marlene. they’re all in their seventies. linda died last year and was a textbook manipulative narcissist. marlene lived with linda for 15 years and was deeply codependent and believed she could not live without linda. marlene is what the family calls “a little slow”, but based on her symptoms i’d bet money that she’s on the autism spectrum. she won’t get diagnosed with it and leaves doctors who suggest testing for it because she just needs to pray harder to feel better. she briefly complied with antidepressants but stops taking them whenever she gets it in her head that it’s her fault linda died. now, my mil rhonda briefly lived with marlene and linda when she got divorced a few years ago and it was a dramatic mess. linda kept 15 cats and was a doomsday prepper. she also accused both marlene and rhonda of abandoning her and not praying enough to heal her. when linda died, it sent marlene off the deep end. marlene believes that she didn’t donate to charity enough and the hospital killed linda. she believes my wife is dead. she believes she has no money, and the bills are getting cut off because she refuses to pay them and insists she’s poor. she won’t let anyone else pay them. and then yesterday, she tried to choke my mil to get her credit card away from her when my mil tried to pay the bills. last time marlene had an episode, she got halfway in rhonda’s car and then refused to get in or out so rhonda could leave. she told rhonda that everyone was going to die, that she couldn’t drive because she would die and never come back, and that rhonda was trying to send her away because she killed linda. rhonda had to call the cops and have her committed. the psychiatric hospital recommended marlene go home with a caretaker and escalate that to a home if it gets worse. she was diagnosed with early dementia but marlene refused that diagnosis and said the doctor was trying to assassinate her. so.. marlene wakes rhonda up every half hour or so every single night to make sure she’s still breathing and cries and screams that they’re all alone and everyone is dead. she insists my wife is dead. she’s tried to choke rhonda and won’t let rhonda leave the room or won’t even speak to her all day, just glare open-eyed at her. rhonda can’t even lock her bedroom door at night or marlene will stand at it hitting it and screaming. marlene also wakes up at night screaming at someone in her room. marlene’s behavior has escalated each episode and we’re really worried she’s going to hurt my mil. i’m not sure what to do here. i think it would be best for everyone if marlene went into a home and had round the clock care but that takes away my mil’s last surviving sister and my mil can’t financially handle living independently. we plan to move into a house that is accessible for her but that can’t happen until next year. my mil also thinks that’s abandoning her sister, and that she owes it to marlene to take care of her until one of them dies. oof. tl;dr my mil (rhonda) had two sisters (linda and marlene). linda died last year and mentally abused marlene, who lived with her, for 15 years before she died. marlene is disabled and traumatized and is experiencing psychotic symptoms and increasingly severe violent outbursts and paranoid episodes. she is easily angered and confused. my mil and my wife are the only surviving family she has (and marlene insists my wife is dead every few days). we don’t know how to go about exploring our options and my mil feels like she has to be the one to take care of her, but we’re worried about her health as well."," from what you have written it sounds like marlene is possibly both a threat to harm either herself and/or your mother in law. these episodes could be dementia related or could be rooted in other underlying neuro/psychiatric disorders. for the safety of all involved i would suggest having her ""titled"" (title 36 in my state is a legal measure to temporarily commit someone who appears to be a threat to harm themselves or others, and places them under psychiatric care and observation) if she can then be kept under care long enough for anti-depressants and/or anti-psychotic medications to take hold she may the be well enough to live with your mil for an extended period. financial issues not withstanding your mil in her 70's seems to be in no condition to care for her sister. if this continues your wife may quickly lose both her aunt and her mom.

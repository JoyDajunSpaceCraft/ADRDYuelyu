"we are in the oregon.  my parents had gifted us some assets about 2 years ago so we still have 3 more years before we can apply for medicaid.would it be a mistake to talk to a social worker right now?  i want overall big picture help.  want to understand if i should be doing something now to help make sure my dad can get into a good care home covered by medicaid when he qualifies as i understand the waitlists are enormous.  want to know if medicare or some other funding source can help in the meantime.  want help knowing how to best take care of my dad in general.but i’m afraid, if i’m open about the assets we transferred that since she works for the government, we’ll be disqualified even after waiting another 3 years to be out of the look back period.  am i concerned for nothing?"," i'm in oregon too and i second the recommendations to seek an elder law attorney. social workers most likely don't have the information you are looking for  -  at least i haven't found any who has financial experience in regards to long term care. contact your county department of aging for a list of all kinds of resources in your area from housing, to respite, to elder law referrals. i got a lot of info from the clackamas county department when we were just starting out on this journey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j1qzhq/can_i_and_should_i_speak_with_a_social_worker/,Can I and should I speak with a social worker?
"i've never lost anyone real close to me before last year. my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia in 2015 and lost that battle in 2019. throughout those years, there were so many ups and downs, so much frustration and love, so much anxiety and fear of what we didn't know. she luckily had no serious comorbidities so she was able to pass at home. but it doesn't feel real. even almost 1.5 years after her death, the journey, the diagnosis, and her passing feel....traumatic. i never truly thought i'd have to bury her and that sounds insane. i knew on a surface level of ""yeah, i'mma out live my grandmother"" but i never really sat and thought about it happening and i certainly never pictured her being diagnosed with dementia. even thinking about it makes me tear up. i don't know if this is just grief or what, but part of me feels as though i'm processing trauma too and i feel guilty because compared to so many here, our journey was simple. but damn it, i lost my grandmother twice-both times slowly. i don't know if i'll ever get over this and i hope i never have to see another family member take that journey."," harsh reality of life. everyone goes up to the chopping block, but often not before the suffering of losing everything we loved. the knowledge of being at the precipice with all that grief and loss is enough to push an old brain over the edge into dementia. that's what i believe from what i have seen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j1gyys/trauma_from_living_through_a_family_members/,Trauma from living through a family member's dementia journey?
"i live at home with my wife, mother in law, and my grandmother-in-law. my grandmother-in-law has severe vascular dementia, like she is in stage 6-7. she can't sit up without help, she can't suck from a straw, she can't remember how to swallow, she hardly says any words that are actually words anymore, she can't control her bowel movements, she can barely walk... it's even harder than having a baby because she doesn't even have baby reflexes anymore like sucking. i try to give her sips of water by holding it up to her mouth and getting some in and tilting her head back and rubbing her throat but it still sloshes out half the time. she can barely chew. she never likes anything that she's capable of eating. just last night she used mom's bed as a toilet- just dropped trou and let loose right on the mattress. i spent hours with bleach and a toothbrush trying to make it to where mom could sleep somewhere other than the floor. grandma's room smells like dog shit and death, and i spent another few hours this morning trying not to gag as i saturated every surface with pet febreze, disinfectant, and lavender oil so hopefully she goes to sleep at night. we found grandma stealing knives, scissors, and even nail clippers. she has threatened and attempted to kill mom in the past. my wife and i stay up until 5am to make sure grandma doesn't get up and fall, try to escape, steal knives from the kitchen, or try to hurt mom. she can barely walk, but that doesn't mean she's stopped trying. we wake up at 10am every morning to help mom with grandma and the chores. we're fucking exhausted but we really don't have a choice. we need to watch the house, but we also need to help. she's wasting away even though we're trying our best. this is a living hell and i'm not sure how much more we all can take. mom has already had a breakdown. wife and i are only holding on so she doesn't have to.  we're all so tired. how much longer can this possibly go on?  *when will it end?*", i’m so glad to hear you are getting the help you all need. this sounds exhausting and so hard. take care of yourself.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j1g8lt/its_so_hard/,It's so hard.
"i'm sorry if this is a bit messy. i'm a bit of a mess right now. today, my grandmother passed out while being washed with a washcloth. we put her on the couch. she kept fainting and stopped breathing. we were able to wake her up several times again when we were trying to wake her up by yelling, nudging her, massaging her chesr or gently hitting her. when she was unconscious, she regularly stopped breathing or had a very shallow breath. whenever she woke up, the first time she'd do is scream, as if she was in extreme pain. she'd try hitting and biting everyone and everything around, definitely  more aggressive than usual. and she was insanely strong when she did this. she didn't actually say anything though, just scream. when the paramedics arrived, she was of course trying to hit and bite them too, but they managed to rehydrate her with an iv, that really improved her condition. she started talking again, told the paramedics that we broke her arms. they aren't broken, as the paramedics say, but she still can't really lift her right arm, which is probably why she thought we broke them. aside from that she's okay. she's still home with us, as we agreed with the doctor that taking her to the hospital would do more harm than good. we've had this happen several times over the past few years, even though it has never been this bad before. she usually didn't stop breathing before, and except for when she had a stroke her limbs were fine. every time this happend it was because she was dehydrated. but it's so hard to get her to drink. drinking together with her has worked for a while, but she's not drinking a lot anymore even if we do it. we've tried giving her juice and hot chocolate, which sometimes works. it also sometimes works to tell her that she must not drink it, so she drinks out of spite. we tried soups, but she hates them. no matter what we do, she never drinks enough. usually she drinks less than 0,75 l per day. so if anyone has an idea of how we could get her to drink more i'd really appreciate it!sometimes, at days like these i just wonder if what we're doing is right. she was in pain, she was scared, she cried, she clearly didn't know what was going on. i felt incredibly sorry for her. it was so painful to watch. and now i wonder if what we're doing is the right thing. she still lives at home with her daughter and a caregiver that lives in the house as well, i live nearby and come for a few days to help pretty often. and sometimes she really seems okay. she's usually relatively alert, even though the dementia obviously shows. she can even go for walks every now and then.but then she's also very aggressive from time to time, in a very testy mood, like she's constantly angry for hours at a time, or hallucinating strange things. and then of course what happened this morning happens every few months. it's just so bizarre: she can be almost like a happy little child, happy and cheerful, joking and playing with her favorite stuffed animal, and suddenly for no reason she turns into what would be called extremely abusive if she didn't have dementia. it's almost like two separate persons living inside her mind.it just makes me wonder if what we're doing is right. to me, her life seems painful, especially in those moments. i personally wouldn't want to live like this. but then, my will to live never was nearly as strong as hers, so maybe that's just me.to me it doesn't look like she's happy now. sure, she sometimes is. but most of the time she's weak, angry, aggressive or in pain. she's in her mid ninety's, so she also has a bunch of health issues aside from the dementia. sometimes i wonder if the her from the past would have wanted to stay alive if life is what it's like for the her from the present. sometimes i wonder if it wouldn't be better if she died. but thinking this makes me feel like an extremely cruel human. it makes me feel selfish too, because while i truly believe that dying would be somewhat better for her, i know that if you'd just look at the facts it would also make my life easier. it's just so hard sometimes, to hear her insult all the things i'm insecure about anyways, to have her try hitting or biting me or spitting on me, or grabbing my privates. but that's honestly not why i think she might be better off if she was dead. it just was so sad to see her this morning. it was like she was barely even human anymore. the way she screamed... it was so full of fear and pain. i honestly wouldn't wish all of this on my worst enemy. of course i don't actively want her to die. i'll still call the paramedics every time. but sometimes i wonder if it's really the right thing. i just feel like all choices we could possibly make are either wrong or even wronger. she always was scared of going to a nursing home, plus the nursing homes in my country aren't good at all. but having her here... she's not living a happy life either. it's probably the best choice, but it's still awful. there is no way that she will ever live a happy life again. it's always getting worse and worse with her. i had to quarantine for two weeks about two month ago so i couldn't come see her.  and after those two weeks she was so much worse than before. it's like watching her die piece by piece every single day. it will never be better. it will only become worse until she inevitably dies. and if death is anything like what happened today, she will die in an awful way. and i feel cruel because there is nothing i can do."," she has a progressive disease and will never get better. it will only get worse. it's a horrible feeling to stand back, but it's okay to let her go next time. her stopping her intake could be a sign she's just done, and ready for that next

"hey everyone,writing this post mostly out of a little fear and concern over some cognitive issues i’ve been having as of late.     i’m a 40 yo male who did his fair share of drinking over the last 20 years but recently have abstained from it. to be more accurate about the time frame, about 3 months ago is when i quit. other than that, no hard drugs, not any hard knocks to the head, no family history of dementia running in the family. no childhood trauma etc, only thing i’ve struggled with in my life since childhood is anxiety which usually stems around social settings. other than that a rather healthy adult, only complaint is allergies for the last 5 years which seem to clear up in the winter and are pretty common for people to have where i live. okay, so on to what is my causes for concern.i feel like the last 8-12 months have been like living in a fog. i figured quitting drinking would help clear that up a bit but it hasn’t.withdraw from family and friends, mostly out of fear that they will notice something wrong with me.i feel like i am on autopilot, at work, at home etc. nothing seems to reach out and interest me. total loss of sex drive. i am single however, i’ve been single for a couple of years and that status was a cause for lack of driver before. i’ve never been a good sleeper and lack of sleep seems to compound all of this. difficulty reading. i’ve always had a hyper mind and often would skim read in school or just pick enough info out of a paragraph to get the idea. so i can imagine developing a habit of filling in words where i think they would make sense and comprehend it. now i find myself mis-reading a word here and there then correcting it (it’s almost instantaneously because i know it doesn’t make sense the way i read it). also, when reading out loud this doesn’t happen. on to some positive notes.i took the mini-mental state exam and passed with a 30. there is a app which i will not name that i took it on and from what i understand neurologist and programmers created it. you do not grade your own test.i still have my sense of humor and sarcasm.i took a iq test which scored me at a range of 124-132. i know dementia doesn’t discriminate against smart or average people, however i feel like if i am declining i wouldn’t be able to make sense of the patterns they use on the test. i am still decent with names and faces. i could name football and baseball players, some actors(not a movie buff) etc. i even tried remember street names the last few weeks that i never paid attention to before to see if i can recall them before they come up on my route to work and back, i can. overall i feel like my biggest concern is the brain fog, lack of interest, lack of sex drive and the dyslexic thing going on if that’s what you want to call it. although i’ve never been clinically diagnosed with anxiety or depression i’ve struggled with anxiety as mentioned earlier, and had depression (loss of family member, breakups, etc). but never felt like i was chronically depressed. sorry if this isn’t well written or a jumble of thoughts, i feel like i am more less just speaking out loud and trying to somewhat write it out in a organized fashion. also, not looking for a diagnosis, just thoughts on it and if anyone else is going thru something similar. thanks for reading everyone!"," you damn near told my story. anxiety quitting drinking and drugs etc. i stopped drinking about seven months ago and stopped smoking weed about 3 months ago. i was a heavy drinker for about 25 years, quit for 5 years before, another time for a year another time for 2 years. i'm 49. i've recently gotten into a few hobbies, but it's hard to find motivation to keep doing them sometimes. it's getting better. but there are other issues with cognitive decline that i am experiencing. i have good days and bad days. sometimes i can't remember names other times i can. some days i can't remember how to do things that i used to know how to do without thinking about it, other days i can. there are other things too, but this started probably in my early forties around 41 or so. i'm afraid any doctor that you see right now would also write it off as depression, or tell you that your brain needs more time to clear up than 3 months, which it actually probably does. i've had experience with stopping drinking for more than just a few months and it did take that long for my brain to clear up. this time however, i think i've done too much damage with the drinking and the drugs. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/j0h3mh/early_onset/,Early onset?
"hey everyone! this is very long and may be hard for some to read because i mention some past traumas to help give a better understanding of the situation so read at your discretion. **************************************************************************************************so i’m not sure if i’m way out there for thinking  this but i’m going to eventually get as close as i can to getting to the bottom of this. my grandmother is 93 years old and had dementia a few years now. my uncle joe lives around the corner from her and take care of her with her home care worker. my mom has told me my grandmother has been saying that she is scared of him (uncle joe) because he molest her when no one is around and beats her regularly. my mom is sure this isn’t happening and the doctors have never found a single bruise or any piece of evidence or clue that any of this could have happened to her.        we got a camera that lets us keep an eye on her in the living room and the entry to her bedroom where she watches tv and she is there all day so we know for sure when our uncle is there nothing is happening. yet, she is still fearful that uncle joe is going to hurt her and “touch her privates” again or molest her. now uncle joe has become kinda bitter and tries to push his role to any family member visiting her or in a close enough proximity that he could guilt them into doing his job. so then my cousin ron stepped in to help. he’s a sweet guy the type who had a hard life and had to struggle but loves his grandparents   and really respects and takes that seriously. he’s been driving two hours every sunday to take care when she is alone most of the day and spend every sunday being there for her. except until recently. my grandma called my mom again and said out of no where she is very fearful of her life and doesn’t know what to do because ron keeps coming by(on sundays) she said he threatened her and that he is from the mafia and told her that if she opened her mouth about it to anyone he would bring his mafia buddies to get her and hurt her and possibly kill her. i know there are some other examples like this my grandma has been accusing males. she even yelled at my dad saying it was all his fault he shamed the family. all his fault because his daughter me had a son out of wedlock. kept going on how could he disgrace the family like this no idea why she is putting it all on my dad for some reason. another thing is my son loves his grandparents my parents and got to spend the summer with them because it was the first summer they had off cuz covid shut down work so they had the opportunity to enjoy my son this summer( with me visiting of course) anyway my grandma saw me and gave me this look of surprise that i came over and thought i had abandoned my son and wasn’t supposed to come back and that my mom had no choice but to adopt her illegitimate grandson out of wedlock. my mom stressed very hard it was not true my dad even got upset she was talking like that. i tried to stay calm and assure her nothing in this world could stop me from being a mother to my son and that i have no plans of giving up that role and left it. so now that i gave you some tidbit of what has been going on i can go further. everyone has sort of brushed it off and linked in there minds that it’s a symptom of dementia without really digging into it and wondered why her symptoms are so terrifying and horrible i can only imagine what she may be going through if she really is believing these things are currently happening to her. i tried googling these symptoms so i know it’s not common thinking every man is raping or threatening you or babies getting abandoned. so i started linking these things to what i know about my grandmas past. my grandma herself i know has kept a lot of her past a secret whether it was the feeling of shame of fear of disgrace i know my grandma did her best to keep it from everyone which i think is worse because it meant she never dealt with her trauma and ended up playing apart of future traumas because she just didn’t know any better. i’m sorry this is long and thank you if your still here. so here’s some stuff i do know from other family members. grandma never admitted to being taken advantage of before dementia but: her mom became a widow after her tenth child was born in the early 30s. i know she ended up having a child out of wedlock that my mom said grandma used to feel shame that her mother had a child out of wedlock being raised catholic. after her dad died her some old men from the church came to help her mom and married her two sisters 15 and 14 so they wouldn’t have to be taken care of by the mother(they said) and they were 30-40s. i don’t know yet for sure if anything happened to her or the rest of the siblings during that time but later on after my grandmother had all seven kids including my mom her brother molested everyone of my grandmothers kids including my mom and the youngest who was a toddler who later  commited suicide on her 15th birthday. when my mom told my grandmother she immediately hushed her and told her to keep quiet in fear that if my grandfather heard about it he would have killed him and he would have. my uncles told me they too were molested and my thought is only a person with some twisted trauma would hush her child knowing full well all of her kids are being abused and thinking it was more important to keep the family name and protect her brother then her own kids. like i don’t care if it was my identical twin if that happened to my child i would protect my child( but i know i never had experienced anything like that and that’s why i would respond differently) also her other went to prison for years like i believe it was 15 years i was just a kid but i know he never made parole and they made him do the full time. i still don’t think i know the full truth what happened but i know it’s related to something between him and stepdaughter and my grandma always made it seem like he was wrongly accused and they used him as a example and gave him a harsh punishment but i feel like she was hiding the real story. and she got me and my sister to send a letter to him and sent our picture of us we were little girls because she said he was lonely until my brothers found out and yelled at us and put a stop to it but still baffles that my grandma was so lax and never thought about us in that situation. i also recently found out another brother the one out of wedlock got in trouble for the same stuff. so my feeling is it is very likely something happened to my grandma because they say offenders are usually repeating the cycle that’s been done to them and her three brothers all seem to have repeated the cycle of what happened to them. i’m sure my grandma would have been to ashamed to admit it resulting in a lot of un dealt with  trauma she never had closure on. another thing i found out when i was younger my great or great great aunt was married to a dude high up in the mexican mafia. my uncle remembers her always drenched in gold jewelry and them kicking the kids out of the room whenever they came by. so there’s that tidbit that i feel is worth mentioning. my grandma also had sent all of her kids to live in a orphanage once when she had tb for a year and a second time for two years when my grandpa just got up and walked out and didn’t return for a couple years. again i’m sorry this is long....so knowing all of this i felt like there could be a possibility she is reliving some of her secret past and what everyone is brushing off as a part of dementia is actually her sharing apart of her past she kept hidden all the way to her pre dementia days. so i feel like there’s more to it when she is saying this and a lot darker then what everyone else has been translating it as. could this be possible? do you think it’s possible she is telling a glimpse of her own personal trauma and that’s why she thinks every male she’s around is doing harm to her? she wasn’t like this before this is all very recent. what do you think about this now that you know the back story could it all be related and connected some how?i read up to learn more about dementia but came here because i’m hoping you guys might move more of a understanding of dementia and what’s possible or not in this case. thank you for taking the time to read this"," my grandma started reliving my grandpa's suicide- something she never before discussed. however, she also conjectured many other stories that i'm 100% sure were never true. her memories and stories were triggered by her surroundings, so we did our best to surround her with things she loved and pictures of happy times to quickly redirect her to

"my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia/alzheimer's about 4 1/2 years ago. she was living alone about an hour away from us prior to moving in with us. after a pivotal incident, we had her move in with us since our home is fairly large and could acommodate for her hobbies as well (she was an amazing quilter- so she could have her own sewing room). when she first moved in with us, both my parents and myself were working full time jobs (mom working an altered schedule to make it home frequently). she was able to stay at home and essentially function normally with us gone for a few hours. fast forward to today, she is a shell of her former self. she needs constant supervision around the clock. my dad (60) is no longer working and my mother (58) is working full time. i am currently going through hiring processes for my dream job. so my dad and i are able to stay home during the day and take care of her.  my grandmother currently requires significant care due to wandering and confusion. any list of dementia related issues i’ve researched, she suffers from. she is having to be constantly reminded that she lives here. at least every other night she puts her sweater and shoes on, waves good bye, and tells us she is walking home. every night she seems to only sleep an hour or less and wanders through the house. there have been a few close calls. one night she climbed on top of the kitchen counters to get something from the top shelf. she slipped and fell falling at least 6 ft onto the hard tile. another night she wandered downstairs and fell asleep at the kitchen table. she ended up falling out of her chair and slammed her head into the desk next to her. how she did not injure herself is a miracle.i am so scared for her safety. my mother absoluetly does not want her to be in a nursing home. i believe she is reasonably afraid of covid and emotionally scared of not having her mother with her. my dad and i believe she needs to be in a nursing home. not only is this due to her safety, but with only one parent working finances have been hard. it’s getting to the point where my dad is needing to get a part time job. this will leave me as the sole caregiver during the day. i am glad to do this, but in a few months i could be shipped out for 3 months for training if i get this job. which will leave my parents in a rough spot. my question for you guys is when did you notice your loved one needed to be in a nursing home? or how did you talk to your spouse or family member about seeking other forms of caregiving?"," doesn't matter where they are, they always want to go home. which planet though is uncertain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/izm2br/scared_for_my_86_yo_grandmother/,Scared for my 86 Y/o grandmother.

"let me preface this with i am not looking for medical advice, just advice from other people who have loved ones with dementia. so my mom is 58 and she’s always been a little “spacey” (i think it’s just part of her personality) but since i’ve started living with her again i’ve noticed some things that have me concerned.1. she’ll forget things that happened a day ago or conversations we had earlier in the week - not often but sometimes. i.e last night i got a case of water bottles out of the car and brought them in and she saw me bring them in but today she came into the kitchen and said “when did you get these water bottles?” or we’ll talk about something like let’s say what days i’m working and a few days later she’ll ask me “do you work today?” etc.2. she’ll zone out on pretty much anything she’s reading or looking at, be it a game on facebook or this morning, her new toaster manual. we’re sitting in the same room and she’s looking at her new toaster manual and i’m asking her something and she just doesn’t respond and then she laughs at something she read in the manual (apparently some setting that she didn’t know about) and when i got really upset and said “mom, i was just talking to you” she’ll just get offended and say something like “what??? i was reading.” her personality, overall, has been the same, she’s driving fine, she’s working at her part time job fine, it’s just these little things that keep happening that have me concerned and since i am really the only family she has it has me doubly concerned.appreciate any thoughts, thank you", i was able to get my folks to set up an online account with the hospital. it shows their upcoming appointments and their medical records.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/iyzn0c/are_these_warning_signs_mother_58_gets_offended/,"Are these warning signs?

"my mil (66) is the one with some form of undiagnosed dementia, as well as what appears to be untreated mental illness. she has always been the sort to distrust medicine, instead believing she can cure herself of whatever ails her by manipulating the spirits of plants. she's always been off kilter in regards to reality, and her dementia is making everything worse. she has hallucinations, delusions, extreme paranoia, hoarding behavior, poor nutrition, poor hygiene, you name it. it has gotten to the point where my partner got durable power of attorney, in order to manage finances and help ensure his mom get medical treatment. after a huge power struggle, he finally gets her in to see a doctor. here is where things are really frustrating us. he attends the appointment with his mom, who if course downplays her issues, assures the doctor that she feels happy and safe in her home, and that everything is totally fine. this of course goes against everthing she says to us on a daily basis. we anticipated this, which is why my partner contacted the dr. ahead of time to let them know of the various issues going on. what we didn't expect is for the doctor to essentially go along with the downplay of issues - and to just suggest to focus on calming down and getting more sleep. on top of that, she is not being communicative with my partner in regards to his mother. while we understand that his mom is the patient, he is her carer and we really need to know what's going on medically with her, or what the doctors gameplan is on how to approach things. the conversation cannot end with just suggesting she gets more sleep, when the reason she doesn't get more sleep is because she thinks a dark figure is peering into her room every night. we would try to get a second opinion, but it was such a battle to get her to see this person that we are afraid it would never happen. so i guess my ask is this - how the hell do you get the doctor to listen to your side and work with you. is this basically impossible unless he has guardianship? i should also point out that my partner is 27, so i suspect there is less respect afforded to him due to his age. we are just so frustrated and honestly scared - this was the light at the end of the tunnel for us and we don't want to be told to just turn around and walk back into the darkness.","  i'm not sure that it's possible to find a doctor who pays attention to elderly patients or their caregivers no matter how much legal authority the caregiver has.i had both durable power of attorney and medical proxy in husband's advance directive and it didn't make a bit of difference to any of the providers seen.first-line failure was primary care doctor who declined to investigate medical problems unrelated to dementia, symptoms shrugged off as dementia related. also declined to seek imaging which would have confirmed caregivers' ignored listing of behaviors specific to a particular type of dementia.skipping these details, doc's next stop was sending patient to dementia psych units to 'establish regimen of behavioral therapy drugs' which means drug the patient into submission. appears to be a 'one size fits all' treatment plan since two different dementia facilities did the exact same thing.neither were interested in patient medical status or history, meds were started, switched, doses raised and lowered without informing the caregiver of anything. the covid pandemic was utilized to the utmost to block caregiver's ability to monitor progress. in both facilities doc/staff failed to recognize or address serious adverse reactions to medications.so, seek an expert? good luck with that.  maybe it's the luck of the draw - my experience has been that no matter how nice they talk they do the same thing.outcome may have been better had husband been suffering from any type of dementia **except** lewy body. they can't tolerate psych drugs. i tried to tell them but none would listen.lewy body dementia confirmed at autopy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ivp3r0/how_to_get_medical_professionals_to_take_you/,How to get medical professionals to take you seriously?

"i just felt like i needed to share this story for anyone who may be struggling with family members that have been diagnosed with dementia. my grandmother was always a lovely woman, a school teacher years ago who taught at an elementary school in a tiny little town in the middle of nowhere. we would go out as a family to visit her every week. at one point my parents sold their home, and with 7 children, they didn't have much of an option at the time other than move in to her home. we lived with her for a few years. about the time i was in high school she was diagnosed with dimentia which was about 5 years before she passed. at first i didn't notice anything different about her, and don't think i was even told about it for a year or two. she got to the point where she couldn't care for herself, and we moved her in to live with us. it was one of the hardest things to watch as she couldn't shower by herself, my sister's would have to bathe her. she would eat everything we give her, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but everything included napkins, paper towels, anything that was on her plate she ate because she didn't know they weren't food. the hardest part to watch, was the day she looked my dad in the eyes and had no clue who he was. i could see my dad's eyes tearing up knowing that the woman that gave him birth doesn't recognize him. that part still hurts me to think about. in all of the hard times in helping care for her, there is still one thing that has never left me. she did the same thing she normally did, she would grab one of us and start asking questions. she had no clue what was going on and all of us knew that, but after having the same conversation with her multiple times a day, some of us had just gotten to the point of halfway listening and giving short answers to carry on with our day. which is the biggest thing i regret doing now that she's gone. now that day was somehow different. she grabbed me and i expected her to ask me something simple, but not this time. she looked at me, called me by name, which she hadn't done in a long time, and started telling me a story about when she was in her 40s, as a school teacher. telling me all sorts of things she would do in her classes, and funny stories about some of the children. this conversation lasted about 20 minutes, and then as quick as it all began, the stories stopped. from then on until she moved in with my aunt, i payed alot more attention to what she had to say, even though back then i didn't think that her story ment as much to me as i know it does now, but sadly that was the last time she had those kind of memories pop back. to the people who are struggling with family members who have dementia, hold on to those moments while you have them, and don't get yourself to the point where you're not actively trying to listen to them and answer questions 100 times a day. that one question they might have, might be the one story that will stick with you forever. i don't know how many moments like that i missed out on due to my ignorance in not putting 100% effort into helping her understand, but i wish i could go back just to hear one more story from her life."," wow, thanks for your story!  bless you for being there listening to her, and bless your grandma up in heaven!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ivhqvm/my_grandmother_who_passed_away_8_years_ago/,My Grandmother who passed away 8 years ago
"i've posted before, my mom is 78 and pretty far gone mentally, especially with hallucinations and delusions as well as long standing anxiety. we're in the process of getting a diagnosis from a neurologist but i'm wondering how much i should even tell her. i don't know that she can really understand what it means, and at this point i wonder if it really matters. maybe it's best just to continue tweaking her meds to hopefully reduce the hallucinations and anxiety, rather than stress her out with what's an (eventual) terminal diagnosis. how have you handled this with your loved ones? i feel like if it was in the early stages it would be important but now it's just one more thing for her to be fearful of."," telling people about a diagnosis is really hotly debated. a lot of people feel like even those with dementia/alzheimer's deserve to know at any point, but i personally feel like that can be dangerous, especially in later stages. it's one thing to go to the doc because your mom stopped bringing her cell phone out and they catch it early, it's an entirely different thing for someone who is already beyond comprehending more than a few words at a time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ivh5fy/how_much_of_a_diagnosis_should_i_share/,How much of a diagnosis should I share?
"before i say anything, i just want to point out that i'm not exactly an expert on this topic and issue. i've never had to care for or knew anyone with dementia or any of the related forms of it. there are plenty of things that i am blind to and am not knowledgeable about, so if i say anything that's false please correct me so i can edit.i'm very worried for my mom. she's 57 and over the past maybe 2 or 3 years i've noticed that her memory is pretty spotty, both long term and short term. her twin sister remembers a lot of stuff from their childhood, like the stories of them and the things they did with their friends, but she doesn't remember any of it. she remembers some stuff from long ago but that's it. short term, she forgets many things. one minute she will ask me how life's going and my job, and then 5-10 minutes later she will repeat the same question as if she didn't just ask it. my dad thinks it's selective memory maybe because he said that he told her about lawn care coming over in 2 days at 3pm, and she remembered and called him saying that they didn't come at 3. also her arms are pretty shaky, but i don't know if that's because of her high blood pressure or maybe it's related to this.she's out of work at the moment so hopefully soon she'll be able to get a job (she plans on retiring in 3-4 years) and be able to get insurance so she can get a physical and get tested. all i know is that it is worrying me. i guess i just posted this here to get it off my chest. thank you"," sorry to hear that!  it's impossible to know, your mom really needs to see medical professionals soon as possible - sooner better than later, with health issues! good luck to y'all!.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ivfd5v/i_think_my_mother_is_developing_in_the_early/,I think my mother is developing in the early stages of dementia
"i'm really struggling, i'm not sure this is even the right place for this, but i have no idea where to start and maybe someone has a similar experience.my 65 year old father in law has lost his mind, i don't how else to describe it, but it was there one day and now he's suddenly delusional.everything was perfectly usual and we were speaking to him regularly on the phone through lockdown. in april he started mentioning run ins with a neighbour, that this neighbour was gossiping very loudly and rudely to other people in the street about fil. this escalated over a few weeks until fil called us upset that the neighbours had threatened him and were sending another person (margaret) round the local area claiming fil was a pervert and he'd been harrasing margaret. the police got called, did an excellent job and started an investigation. fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you see it, it turns out none of this is true, the neighbours have no idea what's going on and margaret doesn't exist.obviously distressing for all of us, but it's put down to a mental health episode presumably brought on by isolation and stress during lockdown. fil moves in with his sister for now and nothing else weird or out of character happens.lockdown ends and fil moves back home so he can be near his church group again (fil is deeply religious), fil's brother visits him often and we're in phone contact every day. after about a week my husband says he's talking about fucking margaret again; 'margaret was outside preaching earlier', 'margaret is coming round later' (margaret is a benevolent figure now). noticeably, he can't describe margaret properly, just vague 'oh she's in her 20's', 'your height' and he thinks he knows her from a religious organisation he hasn't been a part of for 10/15 years. he also isn't hallucinating her, she's never in the room, always been or going to be. everything is very vague and my husband has been trying to get information from his kind but very resistant to change family. around this time there was some tests done, but we have no information about who ordered them and what they're looking for.then about 2 weeks ago, we got some frantic calls from a family friend who lives very near to fil, saying fil had burst into their house demanding to see margaret and that god had sent him to find her. the margaret talk has gotten more intense and this evening fil rang the emergency services claiming she had been kidnapped. luckily there is some sort of file already and the police know there is no margaret and contacted my husband. the thing is my husband spent today with his father and there was no margaret talk, how can he go from being completely lucid in person to the kidnap of an imaginary person in an hour or so?we're at the beginning of this but everything is taking so long, it's weeks between appointments. so far the doctor has ruled out a uti and uncontrolled diabetes, he has had some kind of physical but no results yet, and he has had some input from a mental health team, i think organised by the original police investigation, but all the information we are receiving is second hand and vague.i feel we need to prepare dementia-wise, but i cannot wrap my mind around this sudden turn of events.", you can reverse it. read this book called. the end of alzheimer's. everything you need to know is there .,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ivf9fx/sudden_onset_of_symptoms/,Sudden onset of symptoms
"at some point in the last few weeks, my dad (82) has become very aware that he misplaces things. of course, his conclusion is that ""they"" are stealing things from him. i don't know who ""they"" are, he never has a coherent answer.so his solution to forgetting where things are is to carry everything around with him at all times. he's packed a small bag with papers he considers important, a change of clothes, and all sorts of other random household things like the coffee filter (lol). he is always fully dressed with his wallet, phone and keychains in his pocket. he carries around a flashlight everywhere. in his room, i've found that he keeps extra food, plates, cutlery, even tupperware containers and kitchen towels. he's even taken some small family pictures off the walls and hidden them somewhere. he's also storing things in the car. if he has to leave the room, he has to bring it all with him, the bag and everything. or i have to make sure to watch it like a hawk. he sits on his couch packing and unpacking his bag constantly. this is common, right? how do i help him? conversations with him turn into futile circular gibberish and he doesn't understand more than the most basic surface of what i say. i get where he's coming from, he doesn't want to lose things, this is a comfort thing that reassures him. but i also don't want him to fixate on this imaginary thing, which i also realize is a losing battle.any suggestions or ideas that might help calm him?"," it's a rather amazing adaption he's made. i've never heard the like before. most people with dementia have no initiative, but he has. good for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/iv7yfj/hoarding/,Hoarding

"my mom (72) has mild to moderate dementia on top of her depression and alcoholism. her primary issues are with executive functioning, problem solving, and mood swings/paranoia. in other words, she can do her adls with no problem—it's her iadls that she has trouble with. she's fully ambulatory and can walk a mile to the store and back with her shopping. however, she has major issues trying to work an ipad or iphone—it's like she's completely unable to learn new things anymore. my mom also has major issues keeping her medications straight, to the point that she was only taking half the dose of her antidepressant that she's prescribed. or not taking her blood pressure meds because she couldn't tell which pills they were or what the right dose was. lately, she's starting to get episodes where she can't tell dreams from reality—she'll wake up and think that the people who broke into her house in her dream were real. or she'll see a draft e-mail on her ipad that she wrote, and think that somebody else must've written it. she also gets really agitated when people park in front of her house, and puts notes on their cars telling them to move, even though it's a public street.along with these new symptoms, i've noticed that her cognitive functioning has steadily worsened since the pandemic began—social isolation is a big trigger for her depression/alcoholism. she ended up falling off the wagon and went to the hospital for alcohol withdrawal about a month and half ago—her third such hospitalization in the last 5 years. spent three weeks there, then to a skilled nursing facility for another three weeks. she's in respite care right now while i—her son and only family member who will talk to her left—try to figure out the best path forward for her.a big part of me feels like it's way past time for my mom to go into assisted living—she can afford it and it would be great for her—but she's adamantly against the idea and always has been. i think she would really benefit from being around people, and it would be harder for her to fall off the wagon again in a facility. i tried to have the talk with her when i saw her last, a couple of days ago, and told her, best case, that she would have to have a carer come around to the house at least a few days a week, but she was absolutely not on board with that either. the respite care place where she's at right now is clean and safe, but probably not a place where she can stay long-term. however, another part of me feels kind of guilty about putting my mom into a facility, even though it's the best move for me and her. i'm feeling really burnt out from putting out all the little fires that have started to crop up more often as her dementia has progressed—from, for example, having to try to negotiate with her when she sends an e-mail to me in a panic because she can't work something out on her ipad and wants me to drive an hour and half to fix it. stuff like that. she also has a really narcissistic personality and was kind of emotionally abusive to me when i was growing up, and if anything, i think her dementia has only intensified those parts of her, which makes it really hard to be around her and enforce my boundaries. and i've blown up relationships before trying to hold things together during her previous hospitalizations, and i am sure as hell not going through that again. plus, i have a phd that i need to finish up on top of all of this.the pandemic makes it really hard, though, because i feel like i likely won't be able to see my mom again if she goes into an assisted living facility. so i feel like she could at least ride things out until the pandemic improves—but her dementia is just going to get worse, and given that there aren't any guarantees that the pandemic'll be resolved any time soon, she won't be safe in the meantime at home. with that in mind, it feels like assisted living is really the only option for her—otherwise, in-home care will just leave her isolated and open to another relapse, on top of it being unsafe—but as much as it feels like the obvious decision, it's a really hard one to make. has anyone else had to make a similar decision during the pandemic? how did you manage?"," if you can, get her into a day program that can show her it can be fun. unfortunately, that was our plan but covid has it shut down. it shut to newbies right after we found it in the spring.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/it01hw/how_do_you_know_when_its_time_to_go_into_assisted/,How do you know when it's time to go into assisted living?

"treading unfamiliar territory here and trying to understand all these new terms. i hear these words a lot: poa, guardianship, &amp; conservatorshipim trying to help my mom figuring out the best way to deal with my dad's condition, we've been suspecting he has dementia. my mom is 55 and my dad is 85. i am not yet fully equipped with knowledge about dementia and elderly care, but even more so my mom so im trying to do my research myself so i can explain things to her in a way that won't overwhelm her.pardon my ignorance of the law but id like to better understand how a low income family, in this case my stepdad and my mom can benefit from getting guardianship/conservatorship when my dad's condition worsens. i could be wrong, but based on what ive been reading so far, im under the impression that those who get guardianship/conservatorship are mostly the upper class, wealthy family, with lots of properties or those people with will and testaments.my stepdad doesn't have a lot. he's retired and he has his pension which is 700/month, and then his house which theyre still paying mortgage on and that's pretty much it, they don't have properties or businesses. my mom works a job that pays $13 an hour. and as much as i want to help them, i am not yet in the position to financially support them either. i would if i could, no doubt about that.so i understand that poa is a lot cheaper than the two. we plan on getting poa granted to my mom. my dad has been exhibiting symptoms of dementia. she's always been so reliant and dependent on him ever since. she has always let him do all the financial stuff. however, right now the rest of the family just agrees that he can no longer oversee/take care of their finances. ive been encouraging and motivating my mom to take action, and step up. constantly reminding her that the rest of the family is here to help her throughout this whole thing.i guess my question is how is guardianship or conservatorship beneficial/useful to those low income families? can my mom just get the poa and if my dad states hed like the poa to remain active even after he's no longer capable of making his own decisions, will that be better choice than getting the other two since it is a lot cheaper?i guess im trying to know the reasons why we should or why it is still necessary to get guardianship/conservatorship eventually for my dad despite it being so expensive. does my mom need it still even if theres not a lot of ""wealth"" involved?does the government offer any assistance at all when it comes to the expenses getting these arrangements made?thank you so much. i really appreciate everyone here."," everyone’s answers here is correct, poa is goodthere are 2 types and sub catagoriesour focus is on medical and financial poa, contact your local notary for the financial one i cannot stress this another, you need to get this done before the dementia advances, for financial poa a notary has to stamp it to be effective, a notary cannot grant poa on a client mentally handicapped, please don’t waitmedical poa only requires 2 witnesses for it to be valid outside of immediately family, you can get that document for the notary office as well they usually provide both if not a social workeranother suggestion is start researching for at home hospice care, i have a nurse check on my great grandma once a week and helps us with medication it’s usually covered if they have full medicare or just part a send me dm if you have any questions, iv been in the later stages now for over a year and had to really make changes, i can help with advice",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ipxp4j/how_is_guardianshipconservatorship/,how is guardianship/conservatorship beneficial/useful/worth-getting to low income families?

"hi guys, so i was wondering...this whole thing is so new to our family and in an effort to help him, we want to make sure we aren't doing anything wrong or illegal. he's fallen for so many scams thru phones, and thankfully i have been able to set up selective call acceptance on his phone. so for now, temporarily, only his essential contact can get through. most days, prior this this, all his calls come from these scammers and no matter how many times we tell him not to engage, he still does and in fact, he seems to even love the interaction with these scammers :c but he ends up becoming a victim each time. and i feel bad for my mom, who's the sole working spouse and their money ends up in the hands of these scammers. i decided to finally step in and help her as she isn't that savvy when it comes to these things, researching and technology.anyway, so we managed to find a temporary solution to the spam calls, however now... we have the mails. like actual letters. but most of the letters my dad receives are junk/scam. from letters saying he won millions of prize, to medicare stuff, charities, offers... apparently he's been writing checks for all these charities that ranges form 5-10 dollars but there's a lot of them and they add up each month.my question is, is it illegal for us to sort out his mail, stash away the junk ones from him?i eventually want to report all these junk mails and its senders.do we need to get poa first to sort out his mails?sorry if its a dumb question, in an effort to help my dad, i just don't want to get into trouble for it.thank u."," i think, scams are illegal, therefore, it's not illegal to dispose of scam mail.  as for legitimate charities & whatnot, if the same ones sending mail again again, which they will do once they get donation from you (and some of them even share that information), contact them politely and *firmly tell them* to please immediately put the name and the address on the ""no contact"" list due to elderly vulnerable relative *on a govt pension*. we had a few charities that ignored that, i contacted them again and told them politely and firmly 1. they'd already been notified by us to stop, therefore,  if they continued to ask for donation, 2. *our lawyers would be in contact* (we don't particularly ""have lawyers"") and 3. *i would tell every newspaper & elderly organisation* that they are trying to trick money out of vulnerable elderly *on govt pension*. they stopped.  i sort of felt bad threatening charities, but the thing is, some charities have contracted with sort of private companies or something, to gather donations for them. plus, they ignored after we already asked stop.   i had to be very firm!  in our country (australia) there is a phone line you can call to put your name on the national ""do not call list"", that legitimate businesses have to observe.  therefore, anyone else who calls or sends mail, is scammer. the conversation about poa, just the truth - ""actually, most people over middle-aged have already done the paperwork with lawyers, due to *if someone has an accident or sudden illness and is unconscious, then it's too late to do it*.  *lawyers, doctors and hospitals prefer people to have it done already*. it's foolish not to.""  in my country, there are 2 - poa & pog. power of attorney & powers of guardianship.  poa for financial stuff, pog for personal care-related issues (if they need operations, procedures, therapy/treatment/medications, which facility, etc) my mother had not done that when she got the diagnosis already.  her doctor plus the specialist both provided us with letters for lawyers stating something like ""whilst this person has diagnosed memory loss issue, i am of the firm opinion that *at this time* they still have faculty enough to fully understand poa & pog and to make those decisions for themselves in this matter.""  the lawyers accepted.  we had to do it within a few *weeks* of those letters though - in fact, like immediately - not months later.  sadly, because we have one relative who is very extremely difficult (and mean and greedy) & wants to control everything. check out all the resources online at alzheimers org & dementia org for your country.  they also have telephone helplines.best of luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ipk9iv/is_it_illegal_to_sort_my_stepdads_mail_before_he/,"is it illegal to sort my stepdad's mail before he gets to them? he is 85, vulnerable target of scams."
"hello, all :) so this is something that has been going on for years and years. my grandma is 88 years old. she lives downstairs in her own house, because we have an addition. when she goes to bed at night, she is safe and sound. all of a sudden, she hears knocking that wakes her right up out of her sleep. she gets up out of bed, grabs her walker, and goes to the door to see who is there. (the door opens to her living room. couch, tv, chairs) nobody is ever there. ever. she is so adamant that someone is knocking on her door. even when i tell her nobody is there, and it is quiet as a mouse in her living room. “believe me when i tell you”, she says. i tell her nobody was knocking. “well i heard it, and it was loud!” she refuses to listen, and is so insistent about this. that someone knocks on her door, then when she sees nobody is there, it is peaceful and quiet. does she think someone knocked and ran? you enter the living room to stillness and calm.i have told her that i can hear over the intercom any noises. plus trying to reassure her that nobody can gain access to the inside into her living room. and that i am able to see and hear from my room upstairs, and that she is safe. but that never works, because she says “someone was there, they knocked really loud” but then opens her door to no one in sight. you cannot reason with dementia. she is so serious about this, someone being there and knocking, you cannot change her mind. no one is ever there, and trying to give her that reassurance is hard when she does not believe you.", maybe say you had the a/c (then furnace) checked and it’s what’s making the knocking noise?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ipjhuz/hearing_knocking_at_nighttime/,Hearing knocking at nighttime

"this is my very first time posting here, and on my phone. not sure if it will come out funny. hello, all. i am 22 years old and take care of my grandma. she lives with us, and is 88 years old. she has dementia, and it is rather apparent. does not remember eating, even though her plate is in front of her empty. talks about the possibility of it snowing in august. just a ton of confusion with so many things. after she got out of the hospital in january due to being impacted, i became her caregiver. it all happened naturally. i do almost everything for her. laundry, dishes, prepare her all three meals and snacks, clean the house, etc. she is very, very appreciative of it all. she has the dementia and one other thing against her here. she hardly uses her legs, and because of this, they constantly kill her. the walk from the bathroom to the kitchen (which is not very far at all, a few steps at most) is too much for her. they ache so bad, and she has to sit down. she spends the whole day watching tv. from afternoon until bedtime at night. she never gets up. her legs look very thin, and it has to be her muscles experiencing atrophy. i am downstairs with her for quite awhile during the day. she calls me over the intercom when she is ready to get up, as her using the telephone has become much too confusing. i could be downstairs with her from 10:30 in the morning until 2:45 in the afternoon. a couple hours later, she calls me down to sit with her for awhile because it is “so boring down here”. which i never once mind doing. today, for example, i was down there from 12:00 this afternoon until 2:55. at 5:00, she called and wanted me to sit with her for awhile. she said she hates sitting down here alone. i told her i had to feed my dog first, and then would be right down. have been down here ever since. she really loves the company. i guess i just wanted to get people’s thoughts on this, and if they have also experienced the same thing. also to “vent” but that is not the exact word i want to use. thank you :)"," hiya!  oh, yeh, that sounds hard, for you both.  you are doing fantastic job, taking care of her! sure it must be very lonely for her, and get boring for her, since she can't move by herself, and down there alone for some hours.  but it's difficult for you to stay all day with her.  so, do you mean you live in a house?  or apartment building? i guess physiotherapy would be good for her, but that's for professionals to advise about.  sounds like she needs a wheel-chair! so she can go outside, can you push her outside the door?  is there a garden she can look at, or a street with people passing by?  you can put a small table beside her, with idk, bottle of water, snack, newspaper, magazine... you would need to check on her every half hour, take her to toilet every 2 hours, even if she says she doesn't need to go.  go for a push up the street sometimes, to get her out of tv world all day.  the mental stimulation is helpful for general condition, to go out. or, do you have a car, can you drive?my mother is lucky - she is 87, but still very mobile. also can't remember if we had dinner yet or not (we had it half hour ago), but she can walk a lot - slowly but... we go out to parks, beach-side, have picnics. when it's cold or rainy weather we picnic in the car, i park it at beachside or a park, near a toilet, where there is some view & people passing by walking dog or whatever.  we take newspaper, magazine, crossword puzzle book, thermos hot tea, etc... sometimes she naps lol... i take my laptop and play on internet... it's a good change from at home.  often we throw a ball (or a balloon) - she often can't catch it & spends more time picking it up but she throws it, it's good exercise.. it's a great job you are doing, good on you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ip3sa6/needy_grandma/,Needy Grandma

"i am not sure if this is the right support group for my question as my grandmother (85) also suffers from schizophrenia. hopefully some of you kind souls have some advice though or could point me in the right direction. my grandmother over the past 5-6 years has developed a serious stealing issue. at first we thought as a family we were misplacing things but it came apparent with time that it was being taking by grandma. the things she takes have zero value to her whatsoever. we have read that this can be due to her dementia. she will take things like spoons from the kitchen, laundry from the dryer that is my dads (shirts that are 4 sizes to big for her), car keys, cups, mail, remotes, dog toys etc. we have tried discussing with her before but as expected she denies and gets very upset. so we have not asked her about the missing items any further and instead just replace things as they go missing and try to hide things we don’t want to disappear. it is difficult living in your own house and having to constantly hide your belongings or lock them away. we don’t want her to feel as though we are creating a sterile environment but it has gotten to the point where nothing can be left out. we simply can’t replace things like car keys or remotes every week. my mother (her daughter) is concerned it might be time to consider assisted living or a at home aide. grandma is very upset at the thought of this. (she also has heart issues and a pacemaker and we are always worried about working her up when discussing these things.)i am looking for advice on how to deal with the topic with grandma. anytime we discuss it she gets so upset but we also don’t want to blindside her and bring in an aid or take her to an assisted living facility as she would most likely react similarly. she tells us if she goes to a home she would rather die. it just seems there is no win. she does not seem happy living in the home anymore and we don’t know what to do. we love her dearly and just want her to be comfortable as she ages but it seems we can’t win. any advice is appreciated."," get a safe. 100% your best bet.set one by the tv for remotes, phone chargers, whatever. set another one as a catch-all, and maybe another in your room for glasses and personal items. sounds crazy, but really your last bet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/iouj4q/looking_for_advice_for_grandmother_with/,Looking for advice for grandmother with dementia/schizophrenia.
"our grandma has a dog- bella. i hate the little fucking thing, but grandma worships the ground she walks on, and vice versa. bella is in heat. bella won't stop licking her vagina because she's a disgusting dog and that's what dogs do. grandma for some reason loves to give the dog kisses and lets bella just lick all in her mouth. i'm gagging just thinking about it. every time i discourage her and tell her it's yucky and that her mouth is dirty she just gets mad at me and does it again the second the words clear the air. i even tried to be funny and say ""hey, your dog is licking her pussy and then kissing you. how would you feel if i licked my wife's pussy and then gave you a big wet smooch?"" and that grossed her out, obviously, but it didn't work.what do i do so she doesn't die of some flesh eating disease or something?", fire cleanses all.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/iotvub/how_to_get_gma_to_stop_making_out_with_the_dog/,How to get gma to stop making out with the dog?
"my grandma is 71 and has dementia. she had a very dirty sense of humor and was always self centred before dementia got bad, as well as having hoarding tendancies but she was always the life of the party and i knew she loved us lots. she still drives and can ""keep it together"" around friends or strangers but seems to unleash when its just family around. besides forgetfulness the biggest symptom i notice is her lack of ability to handle any negative emotions. when nursing wouldnt come to her house anymore because of its messiness and too many cats, my cousin moved in with her to help make sure she is taking meds and staying on track.im 8 months pregnant with my first baby ( 27f) which will be her first great grandbaby. when i showed her ultrasound pictures she said ""ugh, how could you love something so ugly!?"". yesterday she made fat jokes to me about 20 times and after laughing it off the first 19 times i started to get a bit irritated so i gently told her id had enough of that joke. my partner reiterated what i said in a very kind way and said she should stop with that joke because it was hurting my feelings.well, she flew off the handle at my partner and said he had ruined her whole day. that she was not to be spoken to so disrespectfully. that im (op) ""not retarded"" so i shouldnt be offended. that she has ""never been spoken to like that in her life"". it seemed like a huge reaction compared to what happened. she tried to get in her truck and drive away but couldnt find the keys so she proceeded to try to walk home on the highway with her dog ( would have been a 4+ hour walk). eventually she was convinced to get in the truck and driven home, but it was a nightmare. the rest of the extended family reassured us that we hadn't done anything wrong and what we said certainly didnt warrant this reaction.right now i dont feel like i want to visit her or have her meet my baby. not because i want to punish her for this event or anything, but because i find visits so emotionally and mentally taxing. she always has something mean, inappropriate or rude to say and even though i know its dementia, i can't help but feel hurt. i want to enjoy my new baby and be surrounded by positive energy and visits with my grandma seem to always end on a negative note.i also love my grandma and know she will be hurt if i don't bring baby around to meet her.dementia is so hard.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/iotszg/i_dont_want_her_to_meet_my_baby/,I don't want her to meet my baby
"my 44f wife came to the conclusion we needed to sell our home of 15 years and have a new house built that has independent, pseudo separate quarters for her momher mom is 81 and has memory loss over the last few years everyone has noticed.  wife took her to the doctor a few months ago and she started aricept but the doctor thought she could still drivewe sold the house and are moving out.  the new house won’t be ready until november.   wife’s plan was to live with her for 3 months, move in to our new house, then mil would sell her housethe move in went badly.  my mil has a 4 bedroom house for just her and a dog.  she has baseline ocd/ neat freak.  she doesn’t have the best social skills but has always been very loving to her daughter and grand daughter as well as nice to me.  my daughter 13 and wife moved in and i have been living in our original house- leaving in one weekour original house is 8 miles from my mother in laws house and the new house being constructed is 400 yards away from where mil lives now my wife says her mom has been mean, accusatory, extra stubborn, called my daughter foul names.  she thinks people are hiding her keys and screwing up her tv.  she doesn’t like the extra stuff in her house.  she has changed her mind about wanting to live with us.  she helped pick out the new build.  my wife can’t seem to take this very new mean streak as anything but personally my wife broke down and is now moving herself out and my daughter out to a friend’s home.   we couldn’t back out of the sale and are moving anywayit cost us a lot of money to make this move out of our house and a lot of stress and chaos to move.  my daughter is angry at being called bad names and her grandmother hurting her momat this point my mil shouldn’t be driving in my opinion what i thought would be a easy transition for power of attorney is likely not going to be amicable. mil,s mother (wife’s grandmother) had bad dementia and died at 95. mil is very healthy otherwise i have tried to encourage my wife to learn about the illness and support and coping.  she is somewhat open to it but the stress of full time job and all the moving have her worn outi knew when they moved in the extra clutter, bodies, dirt, changes would not be good.  this move in plus time have set my mil backmy mil told us she was taking aricept but stopped (or never started).  my wife’s sister lives 45 min away and is unhelpful and one of the least friendly people on this planet i didn’t want to do any of this.  i wanted to keep our very nice home- make it her home too with any modifications necessary and let her move in when she was ready or had to.  i went with this alternate plan as it was important to my wife when she arrived at this- two months agoi am spewing all this out as i was looking for advice and don’t have anyone to talk to who understands all thisthank you"," that is a lot. first off you and your family are to be commended for the sacrifices you’ve made. caring for someone with dementia is difficult and quite possibly one of the most thankless tasks one can undertake. that being said your instinct seems right on the money. getting more information about how dementia affects a person is going to be crucial for tour wife and daughter. even the kindest people can become very hurtful, paranoid, negative due to the disease. knowing that will help with taking it personally. it won’t eliminate it because we aren’t robots and the lashing out that a dementia patient does because of the disease will still sting in some fashion. i would recommend having a conversation with your wife and daughter, to cover the expectations going forward. there can be some really good moments even amidst the awfulness that this disease creates. those are the things that see us as caregivers through. cone up with a game plan that works for all of you. i’d suggest trying to keep with the original plan as much as possible despite the hiccups that have already occurred. also make sure to remind yourself wife and daughter that what they are seeing in your mother in law is not their mother and grandma, but the effects of the disease. hurt feelings, anger, and sadness are all part of the bag with this disease, especially for caregivers. but, there will occasionally be those moments where your wife and daughter and yourself will see the woman you knew shine through and it will help ease those other bleaker times. and lastly, know your limits. there may come a time where circumstances change and you might not be able to care for tour mother in law in the way she needs. when tabs if that time comes realize it for what it is and do tour best to support tour wife so she doesn’t plunge into guilt.i wish you all the very best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ioqe7z/wife_is_struggling_with_her_mom/,Wife is Struggling with her Mom

"hi guys!my dad was diagnosed with an atypical alzheimer's three years ago, he's still there but we're of course noticing it, and family on his side has slowly been checking out of his life. brother, sisters, my cousins etc.every time we randomly bump into them, they never ask about him and just goes on and on about their life. my cousin asked him for help with fixing up his new house, and the last time he went over to help sort through some rocks, my cousin just refused to come out and say hi and just watched through the window so my dad decided he didn't want to help out any more. he felt uncomfortable and unwanted. i have no idea if anything has happened to warrant this, but he usually tells my mom if he has any arguments with anyone, so she can help him sort through his thoughts. it's also weird to not let my mom know if something happened to warrant this.his only remaining brother has usually been very good at calling to check in and have him over. i will admit that it can be a hassle to hold a conversation with him at times, because he can be very scatterbrained when he's tired, but he's never mean. his brother has said he's too tired to keep up these days, but always seems to have energy to be there for others.i feel like i would like to confront them, just let them know that while my dad might still be physically around for many years, there is no certainty about how long he's gonna be here mentally.just you know, we are all aware of how draining it can be to have to jump back five minutes in a conversation because he fixated on something, but since our family usually have been very tight knit, i find it horrible that they just chose to cut him out.i also feel it's such a double standard going on, as whenever some of his siblings has gone through disease or tough times, they always seem to band together and support each other, but now they seem to be more than happy to just let him have his years still lucid knowing they couldn't be bothered.i feel like for me the relationships are beyond salvageable, and the same goes for my sister (and i also suspect my mom), but my heart breaks for my father. he deserves to have his family around him, or at least call to check up on him.i guess it's probably a common theme unfortunately, and this also is mainly just for venting, but if anyone has dealt with a situation like this in a good way i'd love to hear some tips."," oh, that's very sad, i feel for y'all!  it hasn't happened to me, but i wonder - here in australia, the alzheimers / dementia organisations have a lot of printed info sheets & booklets for everything.  they have a specific one for ""family & friends of memory loss issue person"" for them to have info & tips 1. about the condition 2. how to still socialise / communicate with them.  sadly, it is a common theme many folk encounter.  i wonder if you could get some of those pamphlets/info sheets, give them to the various families.  you can surely even download them from the .orgs.a lot of folk just don't know how to deal with it, have odd ideas / stigma about it, so some info might make them more comfortable, & encourage them to communicate with yr dad.  it's horrific, that *they* don't feel comfortable about it when they're not even the one having it, but, just how it goes sometimes.  same as for folk who have cancer for eg - many friends / family don't know how to deal with it, so they don't, they avoid contact. sucks.  best of luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ioj6df/family_checking_out/,Family checking out

"so i have been caring for a friend who has dementia. she is 88 and has been a lifetime vegetarian. i’ve started to notice recently that for whatever reason , even when it’s requested, she will not eat green vegetables or other green things like spinach pasta. i’m not vegetarian so i’ve had to get accustomed to her dietary needs. green is a big color for a lot of vegetables. plus in general just good for fiber and so forth. i have been asked to make green beans , broccoli and tonight i made spinach tortellini and she just looks at it, smells it and sets it aside. i have had a difficult time with her diet because she went from healthy eater to wanting to put veganaise on food or she won’t eat it. this is usually with the green food. like gobs of it. she also craves high calorie and high carb foods constantly. or sugar. i can curb some of these habits , but the green thing is really making me curious. i know their perception changes so it doesn’t surprise me. but just wondering if anyone else has encountered this type of change?"," i read somewhere that with dementia, your tongue starts to decline in recognizing flavors. the last to go is sweet taste. so dementia people love sweets bc they can still remember that one bc it is not yet gone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/iohs1c/anyone_else_have_loved_one_who_now_wont_eat/,Anyone else have loved one who now won’t eat certain colors of food?

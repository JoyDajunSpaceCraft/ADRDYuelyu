[removed]," i am going to private message you with my contact information. my mother was diagnosed at 44 when i was 24. my brother was also diagnosed at 44 - i was 40. i have learned so much & would given anything to talk to someone when my mom was sick. no one can wave a magical wand & make this go away. however, having support from someone that understands what its like to take care of a parent with early onset - it can be helpful & good for your sanity. there were so many times when i screamed, when i cried - at times i pleaded with my mother to not ask me that same question over & over again. it wasn’t the fact that i had to constantly repeat myself- it was episodes like that where i saw how sick she was and it freaked me out!! feel free to reach out!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q4syke/mom_has_progressed_so_fast_and_its_unbearable/,"Mom has progressed so fast, and it's unbearable"
[removed]," until your lo becomes very incapacitated (such as walking around naked down main street in ten below weather), you can't force treatment on her.  you can get her driver's license taken away, if she's still driving (phone her doctor's office or the dmv).  don't worry about the grandparenting thing.  you will never leave that baby alone with her, but she can certainly look on from the sidelines.  you can't prevent your mother from drinking (but you don't have to enable her getting the alcohol).  contact the aging and disability resource center for your area for a lot more help.you didn't state your mother's age, but she probably could take advantage of a senior center for your area.  they may have music, art, exercise, and social programs that she could surprisingly enjoy.  you might take her there for lunch one day (if they offer that) and sit and enjoy it together.  or home-delivered meals (such as meals on wheels) might appeal to her.good luck.  it's so vexing when someone refuses help.  maybe as she becomes more disabled, she will be less resistant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q4ny41/my_mom_has_early_onset_alzheimers_and_never_told/,My mom has early onset Alzheimer’s and never told me

[removed]," i suspect your mum isn't acknowledging this, because it's scary for her - and if she doesn't acknowledge it to herself, she can still feel a little in control. i suspect your dad is also somewhat aware of his behaviours, and they probably terrify him.  your parents are doing the equivalent of burying their heads in the sand - understandable, but not helpful!speak to your dad's gp and/or give them some written examples of things that are concerning you.  in australia, a parent's doctor can meet with you to hear your concerns, so long as they don't breach any confidentiality - i suspect most doctors around the world are the same.look into any local dementia organisations - they may be able to offer suggestions.  they may also be a great source of support for yourself.  if you have siblings or close relatives, get them involved either to help you or to talk to your parents.  i think another poster mentioned that it's hard for our parents to see us as anything other than children (no matter how old we are) and it's easier for them to dismiss our concerns.  this is where your parents' friends or close relatives can be helpful.you mentioned va - check with them to see what support or help they can offer. if something is available (maybe a gardener, or cleaner, or whatever) try phrasing it to your dad as 'help to acknowledge your service'.it's also very important for your mum  (or you) to get a power of attorney and an enduring guardianship sorted out as soon as possible.  there may well come a time when he is no longer competent to manage his affairs, and it's much less stressful if all the paperwork is already in place.from a purely practical perspective, i would suggest the following:1. spend some time researching dementias, so you have a general knowledge of what is actually happening, what you can generally expect to happen, and very roughly in what time frame.2. contact va and find out what services or help they can offer.3. contact local dementia organisations and find out what services or help they can offer.4. once you've done the above and have it all relatively straight in your own mind, arrange to speak to your mum alone. gently, but firmly, present her with your observations of your dad's behaviour, tell her that you believe he is unwell, probably from dementia.  ask her if she recognises any of the behaviours you have mentioned.  tell her you've made some enquiries into helpful organisations, and you're happy to share those with her when she's ready.  also talk generally about her needing to secure a poa and that you know how to go about that, if she wants to hear it.5. if your mum still refuses to acknowledge what's happening, then it's time to call on friends or family - explain your concerns, ask if they've noticed anything similar, and ask if they'd be willing to raise them with your parents.6. if the above doesn't work, or isn't practical, go see your dad's doctor and explain your concerns.  the doc can then ask your dad specific questions at his next appointment, which may lead to a referral to a specialist.if all of that doesn't work, then you may just have to keep on watching from the sidelines, and supporting your mum (and dad!) until they are ready to acknowledge the problem.  that's really, really hard to do, because you want to help and protect them as much as you can.in among all this, you really need to take care of yourself, too. watching your parents age and decline is challenging for us all, and you will feel a whole range of emotions from frustration to anger to grief.  you will need help and support through this time - look for it and use it.i really wish you the best of luck as you move forward - the road ahead is going to be a challenging one, so remember to enjoy the moments with your dad when he's himself; and also remember that when he's not himself, that's the disease acting out, not him.god bless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q3lniw/how_do_i_get_them_to_admit_something_is_wrong_and/,How do I get them to admit something is wrong and seek care?

"what is your experience dropping a family member off at assisted living? do you lie to them? my dad will most likely be moving into a facility in the upcoming month and i'm not sure what to expect. i am sure it will be unpleasant as he almost threw a fit when he thought he would have an overnight stay in the hospital. &amp;#x200b;although he is only 58 he is rapidly declining. he does know who is family members are, recognizes all of us when we come visit and is aware of where he is. however, he is in adult diapers and not aware when he goes to the bathroom, and often screams when it is a bowel movement and screams in the shower. he also will take the diaper off and go to the bathroom on the floor or couch and sit/lay in it. he has problems sitting up and back down as well as laying up and down and leans to one side when standing and falls often. that is why it has been hard to make the switch because although his body is declining, he still knows us and the house. &amp;#x200b;my mom is paying out of pocket for a caretaker when she is at work but i know she is up all night as he wakes up every half hour even with an increase in medication that is supposed to calm him and let him sleep. also, do we bring furniture/items as if we are going to a dorm room? we thought we would tell him its like a rehab to make himself stronger and help physically. not sure what to expect. should we not visit right away? how long/often are your visits?"," your father is sundowning and it's one of the phases.   if you move to an assisted living some people do well but from the sounds of it the structure of the family home and your mother is what he's depending upon to maintain himself.  you have to anticipate that having that removed and the adjustment might or might not be good for him.  i've seen people sink very quickly at the assisted living phase into full memory care.  when my father was in the facility, he became friends with a former high level (international brand and advisor to a us presidential admin)  and i saw him decline sharply.   i was able to sit down and talk to him about business, government inner workings and some of the decisions he was involved in.   he couldn't describe things in detail but he lit up when there was a question that i phrased the right way and he could confirm with a ""yes!"" or a short statement. that's when he first went into the assisted living... a few months later he was full time in the lockdown memory care and needed assistance with everything.    if you ask me it was his structure he had with his wife that helped keep him afloat.   that's why i moved my father to move and live with me.  the family structure is something that they lean on heavily and it keeps them going.  now your mom can't be allowed to be brought down by the weight of this.  she'll need a lot of help and i strongly urge you to seek out whatever and every resource you can to help you with this.  his sundowning will pass and it can be helped by setting the circadian rhythm by direct exposure to sunlight during the day.   i had to go through this with my dad, it's a hassle but they can't help it. (you just have to remember that)  i strongly urge people to look into various cognitive enhancing supplements to help aid what is prescribed as well as nutrition.   **those do make a difference and should not be expensive at all.**  vinpocetine + ginko biloba is one such combo that helped my father with his ""presence of mind""  and speech and is quite safe. (check with your doctor before adding to their routine)   but ime putting them into a facility at any point causes a serious decline and once a person is inside the system (usa) it's hard to get them out.   the entire industry is being bought up by corporate interests and needs greater regulation.     i'll be keeping my father with me till the end with hospice, he's not going back in there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q1vgpb/assisted_living/,Assisted living?

(it's good that she can still have conversations, though.)  when she starts vocalizing that way, try to divert her attention to break the rhythm of her repetitions. if she's able to eat, give her a treat she enjoys, sort of an oral trade -- a popsicle to replacs the babbling. (and btw, i learned it helps to hand the treat to her physically as you offer it so she can see and feel it. patients have a difficult time comprehending and making a decision when asked something verbally. they need other sensory cues as well.as u/rudderusa suggested, music is amazing as a diversion and for some patients, it changes the atmosphere like magic. the ability to enjoy music and recognize familiar tunes remains with patients long after other brain functions shut down. it's a gift.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ptf5xm/grandma_speaks_gibberish_nonsense_and_we_dont/,Grandma speaks gibberish nonsense and we don't know how to handle it

"i'm currently living with parents, father 61yrs and mother 66yrs. my mother has dementia and parkinsons. my father is the primary caretaker. i help my father becuase due to the lack of my mother's physical mobility by dad needs help. he had back and knee issues. either with changing her and bathing her.i am the one that goes out to shop for groceries. and  i am honestly afraid of contracting covid, having no symptoms and infecting either dad, mom, or both. i'm doing the best to limit the space between my father and mother when i get back from groceries, i wash my hands. yet my father still gets close when i have to put away groceries. a day after groceries i had to help bath her and carry her. i am honestly afraid, paranoid, and anxious about all of this. i'm not sure if i'm doing enough."," what do you go out for? heres some ideashave groceries delivered, set on the porch. anything that can, set it in the garage for a day. everything else wash thoroughly. chances are pretty slight of catching it from a bag or box or can but best to be safe.  after you put food away yes wash immediately and change clothes, dont let your dad help put em away.if you go out to get meds see if they can be delivered, if they have medicare set them up with optumrx and do 90 day supply on maintenance drugs and get it delivered.if you need to make any check deposits? see if they can be set on auto deposit. if not see if the bank has an app, use it to deposit checks by taking a pic of front and back in the app. doctors visits, whenever possible use online visits.need other supplies? what can you get on amazon?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fycyxf/i_am_one_of_my_mothers_caretakers_and_im/,,I am one of my mother's caretakers and I'm concerned about contracting covid
"mom (72) &amp; dad (77) moved to pr 20 years ago. throughout those years i would visit at least once a year and they would come here maybe every other year or so. it could get expensive when you have kids and job obligations. i tried my best to be there for them and when i had better financial standing i’d send money or buy things for their home. i’m far from being financially stable now  and before the covid-19 came along i was looking for work because my soon-to-be-ex and i are parting ways. i need to get my life together. right now i am torn. my parents are there basically alone except for my younger brother who has not been able to work due to mental illness. he doesn’t drive or do much around the house. i worry constantly that should any of them get sick with the virus they will be done. dad has early dementia and mom is diabetic. i have crazy scenarios that play in my head of them getting sick and no one to help and just dying alone in their house. my mom said she knows it’s not fair of her to ask me to go there and take care of them. which is basically her way of saying, “when are you gonna be here to take care of us?” my husband thinks i should go now because i’ll regret not spending their last days with them. i do not like pr and the past few times i went i got sick every time. my parents don’t have air conditioning and i can’t take that kind of humid heat. the mosquitoes love me and i got so bitten up on one trip i had to be put on antibiotics and the doctors were afraid i had zika. maybe i’m just a crazy person but i feel like if i go now i will never come back. i’ll die there. my adult kids are here in the states and even though they are independent i want to be where they are especially during this stressful time."," altho i am in favor of honoring you parents if you can, you must do the right thing for yourself as well. your situation is full of doubt for now. you are about to be on your own? will you be getting any financial support from your soon to be ex? do you have reasonable expectation for employment that can support you? would you have reasonable expectation for employment if you went back to pr? it sounds like you have some life decisions to make. if you go can you get ac put in? if they have a small home maybe a couple window units.  if you dont is there anyone who can check on your folks every day or every other day? church, govt assistance or can they afford to pay someone? i know that medicare here in the states helps pay for some assistance. i know you dont want to go. i cant say that i blame you. its a very tough decision. but you cannot act so that you have no life left when they are gone. i dont know what kind of work you'll want but if there was a company that had offices here and there maybe you could start there and then come back.whatever you decide  take good care and be at peace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fvdbnz/feeling_extreme_guilt/,,Feeling extreme guilt
"probably just grasping straws and sinking but im wonderingmy dad 93...stroke 2 years ago, dementis mild and parkinsons. he has tremors in his arms and hands and at times head and body upper. he uses a walker and has been steadily degrading over the past 2 years. his biggest issues are tied together, sleep and strength. he has a sleep med and a parkinsons med and an alzheimers med it goes in cycles usually and varies in severity and i cant help wondering if theres anything that can set it off.  usually theres a down day or three followed by a string of good daysm maybe a week or so. but i think its getting worse. last sunday/monday he was so weak he couldnt get out of bed or get around. all tests at the docs were ok. starting tuesday he rapidly recovered and was stronger than ive seen him in a long time. he even walked without his walker for two days. but last night he didnt sleep and today hes been very weak. he did nap some this afternoon and this evening but it doesnt seem to help. his sleep med im sorry i dont remember the name but his parkinsons one is pramipexole (sp?). what struck me is that he was strong all wekk and wasnt taking his pramipexole, he started that again last night and didnt sleep and is very weak.  probably no correlation but any chnace reasonable that the pramipexole  is messing with his sleep or making him weak? i know hes had same issue for longer than hes had the drug but odd to me he cant tell a difference when hes not taking it then he starts again and the floor drops out. sincerely hoping he can come back cause that too weak to get out of bed and get around may see him go into a home. neither of us want that",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fv7bx6/med_conflict/,,Med Conflict
"my dad is 71 and has been diagnosed with dementia for about a year and a half. he's always been an anxious/ocd type and ruminating was always a thing for him, well before getting old. his rumination on particular topics is quite full on and it gets very frustrating explaining the same thing over and over, despite having a laminated a card with all the info!!my question is for those that have had experience, does rumination get worse and stay as a symptom for the course of a person's life? is there a point it gets better? i think once the person doesn't have their capacities anymore the ruminating would stop which is sad. he just stresses himself out so much.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fv3zym/ruminating_and_dementiaold_age/,,Ruminating and dementia/old age
"my mother will be 68 in july.  i'm 30 and an only child.  my father is 76 with alzheimers and starting to slow down severely.   ever since she married my father she never really had to pay bills.  she always had an obsession/addiction with spending money and shopping since i can remember.  she has been on social security for the last 6 or 7 years.&amp;#x200b;i have another post describing my backstory in more detail, but the main issue is that she is absolutely obsessed and fixated on attempting to get a 'loan' by any means necessary.  my parents still have a mortgage of around 190k on their home, which is in somewhat rough shape, and probably $50-150k in credit card debt for the two of them combined.   last year she started doing gift card scams and basically throwing her social security check away every other month to these scammers.  she continued on through the rest of the year and even convinced (and one month straight up took money from him) my father to give him money so she could get her big payday, totaling to $4300 (in 3 months time) and they missed 3 mortgage payments.  i feel awful for my parents because these people now call their home phone all day, every day, according to my elderly father with dementia; he is very fed up with it.  and they call mom's cell phone non stop it seems like.  everytime i am with her these people are calling her.&amp;#x200b;i have control of my father's ss benefits now ($\~1600), they go to my bank account and i have control, and we can slowly catch up on the mortgage ($1050).  but the problem is that she is getting \~$800 a month that she has been throwing away.  in january she gave it all away, in february the scammers cashed a check for around 500 and she closed her account with that bank and got $200 out and then immediately bought a gift card, and this past march she sent her whole check away in a money order to some guy.&amp;#x200b;i have durable power of attorney and healthcare power of attorney for both parents. i have sent my healthcare poa to her doctor and now have the ability to talk to him about her medical stuff, but when i called last week the nurse wouldn't let me speak directly to him and the only option i had was to make an appointment.  i think this week i'm going to call back to the hospital where he doctor works and just tell the nurse everything i was hoping to tell the doctor over the phone in hopes they understand how dire the situation is.  because i have asked my mom the past few days if she will go with me to talk to her doctor and she is very hesitant because i think she knows where that path will lead.    she also wanted me to put the payment for her timeshare \[that i'm not even sure she will be able to go to\] on my credit card ($900) and at one point told me to 'just do it' and i knew i had to put my foot down, so i didn't pay it.  i told her i would pay it if she signed over her ss benefits but she refused.&amp;#x200b;what the fuck can i do?   i'm almost certain she has some form of mental regression or mental cognition issues, i don't know what to call it really.  she has been on ambien for at least 10 years and i think that has caused some issues.  she has a terrible memory and often tries to tell me that things i know are true, aren't (like her taking $4300 from my dad for her scams).&amp;#x200b;the only other option i know of is contacting adult protective services (social services) and hoping they create a case for her.  she told me about 2 weeks ago that someone had already contacted her from social services because someone else had called in about her anonymously but i don't know if that gained any traction.  if you met her you wouldn't think she is that bad but she is 110% obsessed with these scams and it is making my life so much more stressful and difficult.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;i am covering their electric bill, groceries, car insurance, health insurance, and other things here and there for my parents, with a high interest credit card.  i know this is a terrible choice financially, and the interest is starting to kick my ass, but its my only option unless i go no contact and go back to social security and tell them i can no longer manage my father's funds.&amp;#x200b;i may also have to take out another loan to purchase them a new car at some point. they both drive older cars and i'm not sure how much longer they will last.  my mom drives about 25 minutes to take care of her elderly mother (98) once a week for two nights).&amp;#x200b;lastly, they always talk about how they need to 'sell this house' and pay off the mortgage to then move and have some money to work with, but the house is 4k square feet, needs about $50k in repairs roughly, and they can't even get it clean enough to a point to have it shown. they're home almost every day but both so depressed i think they never get anything done. the house is pretty disgusting by most peoples standards.&amp;#x200b;can i go to a lawyer and try to have her declared as incompetent or something? i was reading an article earlier and it somewhat confusing about these things.  because you have declarations of 'capacity' coming from the healthcare side, but on the legal side you have 'incompetence'.   [&amp;#x200b;thank you if you made it this far, i'm really hoping to find some help."," about 4 years ago, when i visited my mom, i brought my laptop and started a spreadsheet of her creditors (utilities, insurance, credit cards)--she owed $50k and had burned through over $100k in 5 years playing bingo.  yes, bingo.  gambler.  she didn't go online, so i got a yahoo email in her name and online access to every account.  i'd oversee things, make sure bills got paid.  then she had a car accident (no more driving >> no more bingo) and was in rehab.  i went through every paper i could find at her house and updated the spreadsheet.  i began paying the bills--her money, now she had enough to reduce her debt if managed--and in 2 1/2 years, i got her out of that debt plus $20k plumbing/bath redo on the house she rented out.  a year later the tenants moved, the house needed major work, and had to be sold--which i had to handle.  all this while living 250 miles away.  and i got power of attorney.  got a cleaner arranged, to come to mom's every 2 weeks.  a part-time companion.  my useless nephew living at mom's house and sponging off her (did not pay a penny and moved in his girlfriend!) and i got into many arguments.  his mother, who lived 20 minutes from mom (as opposed to my 4 hours) was barely helpful; brother was/is 3000 miles away.  the companion had been mentioning/encouraging me to get her into assisted living.  then...  my mom would have ""dehydration episodes"" when she went out--not all the time, but 6 times over 3 years.  this last time, last november, was the last straw.  kaiser said ""too many.""  i jumped on this to get her into assisted living near me, funded by her income and the rental's sale proceeds.  kaiser sent a social worker, who agreed with me (and the companion) and also agreed that her house was ""unsafe"" for mom (""deferred maintenance"" is a polite way to put it--clean, empty of junk, but no heater and decaying wiring).  she's doing okay in assisted living.  i *was* visiting at least twice a week, about 5 hours a visit.  she wouldn't leave her 850 sq ft apartment without me there, though.  and now they're in lockdown with no visitors and no leaving their apartments.  but she's safe.  she's as shut in as she was at home, but she's safe.  and she's being fed.  and if she falls, there's someone there, 24 hours a day.  **tl;dr:  get power of attorney (which op has).  make a spreadsheet for their finances, email, online access, accounts to all creditors--and info/numbers about health plan/medicare/socsec/funeral.  monitor and start taking over their finances--but do not put your name on their accounts or contracts (not cable, not phone, nothing).  my mom's accounts are in her name; i sign checks [my name, poa].**",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fth8e5/elderly_mother_no_longer_has_the_capacity_to_make/,,Elderly mother no longer has the capacity to make financial decisions-- please help
"my parents are both their early 70’s.  my mom has early stage dementia.  both are relatively healthy physically.  because of what’s going on, i’ve severely limited my visits.  before this i visited with my mom several times a week.  i call daily, or sometimes several times a day.  i bring over things that they need so they don’t have to go out in public too much.  i have two older sisters.  they hardly ever call.  they don’t help at all.  this isn’t new to the situation, but because of the situation the lack of communication for my mom has made my mom an emotional wreck who calls me crying that she wished she had just died last summer (she had a small stroke and spent 17 days in the hospital) and asking why they let her live, that she feels useless and that no one loves her, etc.  i asked my one sister if she could call mom once a week and let her know she is ok.  my sister works in a hospital, so my mom is sick with worry.  my sister lashed out at me and told me that with all the pressure she is under she doesn’t need a guilt trip too.  she got nasty, so i ended the conversation.  i called my other sister and asked if she could call mom or at least answer the phone when mom calls or respond to a message and i got a load of excuses and false promises.  my mom was a good mom to us, so there isn’t any reason to be like this.  no bad family history or anything like that.  i will say that my moms filter has dissolved quite a bit and she has a tendency to “say what she’s thinking” a lot.  i’ve learned to basically ignore that or change the subject.  but it’s the dementia talking.  last week my mom called to wish my nephew a happy birthday, but she was a day early.  she got her dates mixed up.  my sister said “it’s not his birthday, it’s tomorrow” and my mom said “oh, i’m sorry, i’ve got my dates mixed up.  i’m having a hard time remembering what day it is” and asked to wish him a happy early birthday.  my sister said “i’m done with this conversation” and hung the phone up on her.  my mom called me sobbing,  my dad confirmed this conversation.  i’m taking all the emotional load here, and soon it will be a lot more, as you don’t recover from growing old.  i need help, i need someone to occasionally tap in so i can tap out.  i can’t just ignore my mom as i wouldn’t do that to her.  how do i get my sisters to help?  i know some of you will do the “not my job to facilitate a relationship”.  i’m not trying to, i want them to take their share of the care of our aging parents."," i'm in the same boat. i have a sister and two brothers who do nothing to help. my dad (88) moved in with my husband and i last year (hubby is awesome for this imo). my sister lives about 5 hours away and is currently battling lung cancer so i give her a pass, although she could call occasionally. oldest brother is a jerk. enough said about that. other brother lives an hour away but is so self-absorbed he can't be bothered. it's like my siblings think ""dad is with deb now so we can get back to life"". thankfully i don't work outside my home. the downside is the reason i don't work...i have had anxiety and depression my entire adult life and was forced to retire 15 years ago due to it.why don't my siblings understand? why don't yours? i don't know. i wish i had help but i'm not going to beg. it's just a shame for all of us who have to do this with no help. especially from people who should help. i definitely feel you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fsp90i/siblings_that_wont_help_how_do_i_handle_this/,,"Siblings that won’t help, how do I handle this?"
"right now i'm terrified for my father, sister, and mother (they all live together) because of covid-19 and my father's stubborn refusal to exercise basic hygiene. this has been a problem long before the corona virus reared it's ugly head. but it's especially bad now because my sister has to yell at him and endure a huge fight simply to get him to wash his hands before eating dinner (he'll argue that he already washed them just an hour ago). and he complains about being ""ordered around"" when my mom and sister insist on him washing up when he returns from an outing to the doctor (thankfully, that is the only time he leaves the house because his physical condition makes going out difficult). so now i'm afraid to even go to their house because i'm pregnant and scared of catching the virus.&amp;#x200b;i had been mulling over finding a way to see if he needs to be committed due to his issues long before the covid-19 risk (i suspect that some of his behavior might be the early signs of dementia and/or other mental decline). but i wonder if i should try to get it done asap because his childish refusal to wash up regularly is putting himself and others at risk (my mother has a lung condition and is cleaning like a madwoman with ocd to compensate for my father's carelessness). and, if i did seek out resources from somewhere like adult protective services, will they be too overburdened by the covid-19 crisis to help?&amp;#x200b;i honestly don't expect anyone to have a clear answer. i just wanted to vent and see if anyone else here was struggling with an elderly relative who is refusing to adhere to basic hygiene/safety protocols in order to protect themselves and their family from this virus"," i don't have any suggestions since my parents are the opposite, which is stressful in its own right, but wanted to send hugs. i do agree about pursuing some sort of guardianship, power of attorney. you'll want to protect your mom and sibling(s) from him, should he become dangerous. everyone's emotions are running high right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fqy178/struggling_with_fathers_hygiene_issues/,,Struggling with Father's hygiene issues
"i know ive posted more than my share but one more, because things are strange. i know its probably because i dont understand. from my perspective...i havent been living near any close relative who passed away. then a couple years after i moved back my mom passed. she was 93 and always very energetoc until the two weeks before she went. i think she somehow knew her time was short. the last week she napped all afternoon every afternoon. i didnt see any of the signs. my dad is 93, had a stroke a few years ago and started going downhill which has increased . he has parkinsons and dementia and is a narcissist. which i mention because it means he thinks he knows everything and better than anyone, even the doctors. thats part of why he is where he is. he walks now with a walker on good days and a wheelchair now on bad days. he insists on being over his own meds and gets offended if i try and help with anything. that said i have caught it a few times before he has mistook his meds. we made a trip to his doc a couple weeks ago and the walk to the garage had him gasping for air. halfway down the hallway to the office he had to sit on his walker and rest, i pushed him the rest of the way, all very abnormal for him. normally he sleeps til 11ish, watches tv all afternoon and crashes after the 10pm news. there was one day, maybe friday that he tooks a bunch of his meds rt before dinner on an all but empty stomach. messed him up bad. his tremors were the worst id seen em and he was very weak. the next day he was normal again and told me what hed done. he wont be doing that again. sunday and monday he was so weak he couldnt roll over or get out of bed. good that we had his wheelchair. he also didnt have bladder control. and he had pronounced brainfog. no fever or throwing up .  i talked to the er doctor and she set up a urinalysis for next day at his docs. took me 3 hours to get a urine sample from him and then got him a rush appt, urine and blood no issues, we then did a lung xray and it was clean. tuesday he was better. i walked thru his morning and evening routines and he was ok. buthes sleeping almost all day. sun-wed only awake for meals and get ready for bed. sun/mon he also either had a couple very lucid dreams or hes startin g to hallucinate. this morning he swears he was in the bathroom and he got a call from a house maintenance company he uses. no voicemail so i have no clue how he heard anything. tues and wed progressively stronger. today stayed awake all afternoon, i think, and walked across the house on his own, went and sat on the porch. is now at 8:30 snoozing. bad thing is i have no idea if hes taken any meds.  and standing rule since he does have trouble sleeping is dont wake him up. i dont understand why sun/mon he took a deepdive on his health and his brain went loopy, tests were all good. a few days later he was the strongest ive seen him in a long time. i know life/health is all ups and downs but the swing is bizarre. im afraid of another downswing where hes incapable . and im afraid that since they found nothing else that his heart is wearing out, im afraid that since hes is suddenly sleeping so much he is about to pass. i went thru all this with his doc but since his tests were all ok she is satisfied.one other question....my dad has had throat issues since the 4 years ive been back. he does cough alot, claims drainage, has allergies. when he eats or drinks he often will cough and at times choke and he passed it off as drainage. he will not admit to a weakness or problem. ever. i always notice he doesnt drink enough water, his neurologist says it could contribute to his weakness. then says hes just old. i am beginning to think that the prevailing attitude of medicine in us as regards seniors is not to care. theyre just old. anyway, he may get 2 glasses of water a day, needs 4. when i took his urine sample in it was dark yellowy brown. def dehydrated bad. we talked about that monday night, he was really out of it so i think he told me the truth but i can never tell with him. he said he drinks water until hes full. i asked how he knew he was full. he said he drinks until hes full and he knows cause if he drinks any more it comes out.couldnt quite understand cause thats not how things work. he said if he leaned over right then water would come out. thats when i put it all together. he has swallowing issues. he drinks and eats but it may not always go down. but where is it going? hes not coughing and choking on phlegm, hes coughing and choking because the food and water didnt get swallowed and pass down into his stomach. it gets caught somewhere. but where. this also could explain why he wheezes alot and sometimes makes gurgling noises when he breathes. even his doctor noticed and wondered yet that all she did. but the problem is he wont admit he may have an issue. ive brought it up and suggested he get it checked out but as he doesnt understand how that could be then its false and he wont see about it.he also has sleep issues and with the sounds he makes when he breathes i thought maybe this interferes with his sleep or he has apnea. he wont get that looked at either. anyway, sorry for this mess. am kinda numb after this week, really dont understand. but will see if he sleeps on thru the night and how he is when he wakes up. one thing i can guess, he didnt change his adult undies so will be doing laundry tomorrow. ok i will stfu now. you folks take good care and stay healthy."," i also had a parent who suffered with parkinson's for many years before passing away. the swallowing became a big problem in my dad's last year of life, he would choke and get food down into his lungs as others have described below; turns out that more parkinson's patients die of aspirational pneumonia than anything else. anyhow, once the swallowing problem became more pronounced my mother had to add this thickener to everything he drank, and mash up all of his food. he hated it, hated living like that, it really took away a big pleasure of his life, one of the last things left, eating and drinking!  i felt terrible for him but told him that it was unrealistic to think that any of us were going to stand there and watch him choke to death because he couldn't swallow his food, so he was just going to have to accept it. with parkinson's, people have to give up one thing after another in a humiliating cascade, and it's really heartbreaking to watch. i still tear up thinking about all my poor dad went through in those last couple of years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fpoi6w/confused_and_fearful/,,Confused and fearful

"hi, i want to apologize for the wall of text but i truly am lost, i am drowning and struggling to keep my head above water. (trigger warning for death.)i grew up with my grandparents, they took me in as a newborn because my mother didn't care to take care of me/was responsible enough to take care of me. they were in their 50s by then. growing up was fine and things were easy until my grandpa got a blood cancer diagnosis in 2011. it was manageable since he was in his 60s by then; i was still in high school but this is when i started taking my first steps into caretaking. i had to watch out for temperature spikes, i had to watch out for signs of pneumonia, blood clots, and other general things the more his disease progressed. in 2017, things took a turn for the worst and his health decreased more and more. 2018, i was officially in full caretaker mode; i didn't go back to school to finish the handful of credits i had left, i left the comfortable job i had there in order to be there to make sure he was okay which i never minded. my grandpa and i were closer than anyone in my family, so i felt like it was only right that i do this for him. in october 2018, i went on a short trip out of town without knowing how unwell my grandpa was, and he told me i should go, even though i desperately wanted to stay. but i bought the plane tickets and the person i was going to see in not so many words didn't want me to cancel the trip. four days into my trip, my grandpa went to the hospital and died of kidney failure as a result of his cancer. i feel guilt over this every day and it's hard to forgive myself; what do you do when a seemingly routine hospitalization turns into the last time you'll see them? this is where my grandma comes in. we've never been close, and she's been mildly abusive to me my entire life (verbal, emotional and sometimes physical) but the death of my grandpa made me feel as if i needed to reconcile and put the past behind us in order to make sure she was okay. she's turning 80 this december, and while i love her things have gotten exceptionally hard, even harder than it was dealing with my grandpa's frequent hospitalizations and incontinence. she went into the hospital august 2019 very sick, and i didn't know with exactly what until the doctors told us she needed to have emergency gallbladder removal. after her surgery, they moved her to physical therapy rehab to help her regain her movement since she was in a hospital bed for almost a month. it's at the rehab/long term care facility that the doctors told me she's in the early stages of dementia.while in the rehab, i tried to help the doctors and physical therapists with making sure she did the exercises (physical and mental) that she was supposed to be doing; but if she wasn't ignoring and yelling at the doctors, she was ignoring and yelling at me and it reminds me too much of my childhood. they wanted to send home help in the form of weekly physical therapists and cognitive therapy and medication except once she was home, she yelled and ignored them to the point they stopped coming with no notice all together. i felt too guilty after that to make her take the pills; i regret this, because maybe things would've been better. so now, it's just me taking care of things like cooking her meals, making sure her medicines and doctor's appointments are tended to, making sure she's keeping herself busy instead of staring at the television except she still fights me. she refuses to eat when she's upset with something i've said, she doesn't sleep normal hours, she won't let me ask the other family for help because it's gotten to the point where my health is finally plummeting. i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was 11, and living with her without my grandpa around to talk to has made my mental health worse. i can't see a therapist or make appointments for my health as often as i'd like because she has separation anxiety when i'm gone, and i can't talk to her about how i'm feeling because she takes it as personal attacks, calls me crazy or sometimes downright turns her head away from me in an obvious show of ignoring me. we argue more and more until it's gotten to the point i can barely get out of bed for fear of what she'll say that day to make me feel terrible or to make me cry, but it's the guilt of my grandpa and knowing he'd want me to take care of her that keeps me here. i feel guilty that i don't want to do this. i'm 24, i was only two years into my degree and now i'm not sure if i can even go back because i've forgotten almost everything in the midst of death and grief. i don't have any friends, and the only people i can talk to are people on twitter but. no one wants to hear about something so depressing all the time so i slap on a mask and pretend i am coping but i'm not. i haven't felt this unwell since depression first stepped into my life and not since my first suicide attempt (that my grandma initiated). i have two aunts, a mother and even an adult cousin that all have more resources than me except they're the ones taking trips, going to work and living their lives without any regards to us. they only call her to make sure she's not dead, they never call me. i've never gotten along with them either, except for one of my aunts but it still feels so unfair that this is all my responsibility. i hate the bitterness i feel, because you're supposed to do this for family, right? except i feel like a shadow of myself, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't recognize myself anymore. i don't feel pretty anymore, i don't feel like i have worth anymore. and it's hard trying to take care of someone else when it feels like they hate you every single day but cry and say they need you when you want just an inch of space. i'm not sure what to do anymore. i need help but we don't have the income for home help i don't think. any advice would desperately be appreciated because i feel like i'm failing her and my grandpa, and myself. thank you to anyone listening, not many do lately.", danghey tell your family she's their grandma too they fucking better step upguilt them into ityou did right by your grandpa you were present as much as possiblenowwwww it's a bit much. got to get a caregiver to hang out sometimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fh5i36/taking_care_of_my_grandparents_fell_on_my/,,"taking care of my grandparents fell on my shoulders, except i'm getting crushed under the weight of loss and grief."

"hello fellow carers. i have a question that up till now i have not been brave enough to ask out loud to anyone about advanced parkinson’s. i am caring alone for my father who is 19 years into parkinson’s, and recently developed associated parkinson’s dementia. it is pretty clear that he is at the advanced stage by now. it goes without saying that this is emotionally and physically just horrible.i am just wondering (please excuse any insensitivity) how long the advanced stage can last before the inevitable end? crikey i hate even writing that.....i have not posed this question on any parkinson’s forum, because i am aware there are those suffering from parkinson’s who read and post on there and so do not want to hurt or scare anyone.however, this has been playing on my mind a great deal. as much as i love my father and don’t want to lose him, i hope it’s not unkind to not wish him to be suffering much longer like this. some days he is doing ok, but other days like today, he is lost and bent double shuffling and all that comes with this bloody awful disease."," sorry i don't know the answer, but i just wanted to tell you i'm in the same boat. my mother has not suffered from pd nearly as long (she was probably diagnosed about 4 years ago, but symptoms were showing many years before that), but her decline has been so rapid. it's absolutely heart wrenching to watch and have no control over it, especially when you care for the person who is suffering and you knew how they were... before. it really sucks, and i wish you the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f90an4/how_long_can_advance_stageend_stage_parkinsons/,,How long can Advance stage/End stage Parkinson’s last?
"whining and crying with frustration and self pity just drives me insane! i can take the middle of night diaper changes, bathing and feeding, medication management and frequent doctors' appointments, cooking and cleaning and laundry, whatever whatever whatever... but please! don't fill my ears with whining and crying!mom is usually so easy to take care of. she is generally cheerful and cooperative and pleasant to be around. but, every now and again she will get a uti, get very weak and her dementia kicks in, then she gets so frustrated that she can't feed herself, toilet herself, get up from her chair without help, and the crying and self pity begin. i remind her ""mom, you have an infection, you are on antibiotics now, you should feel better in about 2 days. this has happened many times before."" that helps for a bit, but then the crying, and to top it off it drives me so nuts i lose my temper (tell her to ""stop it!"" in a firm voice and walk off) and i feel so guilty :(.i know this isn't that bad, i should forgive myself, we all have triggers. but i snap at mom for crying when she is frustrated and i feel like a little shit.any advice? i know we all have triggers... how do you keep from reacting?"," well, i found a solution last night. i am not sure it is the best answer, but it is the best that i have found so far. since others confront the same issue, i am sharing in case it is something useful to you.mom's crying reminded me of when my kids had temper tantrums: born of legitimate frustration, perfectly understandable, and sets me on edge. when the kids were little and tantrumed, i didn't judge or shame them, but didn't give them attention or energy and removed myself from them as much as possible until they played out. so i thought i would try the same, see if it would help.when mom called me to help her to the bathroom with a voice full of whines and tears, i quickly came and in a kind and even voice i told her she was having a hard time, so rather than struggle with the bathroom i  would help her into bed and change her. she wasn't too keen on the idea, but since i change her once or twice a night when she needs it she was familiar with it, and knew it required minimal effort on her part. she let me help her onto the bed, urinated into her depends, then i changed her quickly and with no fuss. i then told her to rest while i got her dinner.when i came in with her dinner, rather than her sitting in her chair with her table in front of her, i kept her in bed and i hand fed her where she had no struggles and no reason to fall into frustration. after a few minutes she asked if she could get up and feed herself, and i told her she could if she thought she could do so without having so much trouble she cries. she agreed, and when she was seated with her food in front of her she calmly, slowly (and somewhat messily) fed herself. i sat near her and kept her company and helped her with anything she needed.a little later she apologised for giving me ""so much trouble"", and i told her i loved her and i was happy to help her, always, with whatever she needs.so, yeah, brought back the methods i used to raise my kids (who are now outstanding citizens, btw). i don't like treating mom like a kid, but it worked, was still full of love, so i guess it is the best that i have, so far. putting it out there, in case somebody else can benefit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f7n35d/cant_take_the_crying/,,Can't take the crying

"i graduated my bsn with a minor in gerontology in december 2018. i have had my cna for over 7 years by that point that i figured i should just study for my nclex in the coming months. living in the bay area in ca became too expensive i had to move back in with my folks in the greater la area. health issues flared again and money ran out, so of course my procrastination kicked in. i had to pick up another cna job. no hospital would hire me despite all my experience!! maybe my recent degree scared them as i would only be there for short period of time. so nursing facility it is... but then the cna license expired last summer. only other jobs available were home health. took the first one... woman running the agency said “oh she’s a sweet lady but has vascular dementia and alzheimer’s with recent stroke in june 2019 but is in a outpatient rehab recovering but she’s a catholic nun that’s starting to hit.” nothing against them. their community has been great. long story short new blood clots formed in her legs and she stopped being able to walk, so now she’s home hospice and bed bound now. this was back in august 2019.i am still here. i was working 12 hour shifts with her 3-4 day’s a week with her but her aggression and agitation was just becoming so bad i hated going to work. i burned out. i now just so 6 hour shifts a couple of times a week. my first cna job was hospice but at least we kept our residents comfortable. they don’t do anything for this poor woman. tylenol that’s it for her pain! she’s got severe arthritis/inflammation in her knees you can feel the warmth radiate when your hand just hovers over her. she screams every time i reposition her (no pressure ulcers yet. she still eats 3 meals a day with my help).i don’t take things personal. i worked in a major county general hospital ed with an interesting population and was told every degrading word in the book. she tells me to go to hell and shut up all the time. she tells me she’s going to kill herself and she wants my foot to kick her in the head. and she tells me she’s in pain her legs and back hurts. i tell her “main” nun/sister all this stuff but she says “oh that’s just part of the disease.” ummm no shit? i went to nursing school and worked in multiple units of a hospital... i know what i’m working with but just because she can’t tell you doesn’t mean she isn’t in pain. she grimaces all the time and she’s been literally laying in bed since august so i have no doubt she is very sore and in pain. the pressure on her pelvis and back must be so terrible. i do rom often but she is soooo stiff. i have yet to see the doctor come to do an assessment on her. only an lvn comes out. i voiced my concerns but he doesn’t listen. i reminded him 3 times to get me dicloflenac gel for her arthritic knee. she is prescribed 1mg xanax but of course the nun in control of her medication cuts in half so she doesn’t get her full dose. she claims it works for her but i’m the one with her most of the day and i’m the one that gets the lashing all day by this poor frustrated catholic nun. i need to get my nclex asap so i get out of this place but it’s just so hard to watch this lady essentially suffer. i’ve worked in a phenomenal hospice/palliative care facility and i feel we are failing at providing comfort to this women. i come home so agitated and helpless. i’m in no mood to study. the agitation, restlessness, loud vocalizations is just getting worse and the nuns that live in the house with her just close the doors. she apparently had a possible small tonic clonic seizure before my shift started this morning but i do see any signs of post ictal or high bp. though i know she’s very risk for it. sorry for the long post. i actually go on and on! i’ve been trying to watch teepa snow’s videos for some more resources.", why don't you take the test already??????,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f2xels/so_overwhelmed_with_my_11_demented_nun/,,So overwhelmed with my 1:1 Demented Nun
"i want to start this off by introducing myself and explaining my situation.i have been a caregiver for members of my family since i was 20? or so years old.it started with my grandma, then both of my grandparents until my grandfather died. i went on to help my grandma until she was eventually placed in a home where she currently resides. they both have/had severe alzheimers/dementia and my grandma is a diabetic. i would cook, clean, and administer meds for them both. because of my experience with this, it was naturally expected of me to be there to help my mom adjust to taking care of my dad after his 3rd stroke. his first was in 2015 and his third and final was in march of 2016.i had been living with a friend for the past year and would occasionally visit my parents. up until the 3rd stroke, they were doing great on their own and they actually had a healthy dynamic. now some backstory: my parents have an extremely toxic relationship. my mom was a lifelong alcoholic until last year (explain later in post) and my dad was almost never home while i grew up. i am the oldest of 4, 3 girls and 1 boy as the youngest. i was expected to take on many responsibilities from an early age because of my mom's alcoholism. i constantly got into verbal fights with my mom while trying to defend myself. i would get in trouble for stuff my siblings did, i would fight back about how unfair it was that my youngest brother and sister were never made to do chores or clean. this affects their adult lives, with my brother only learning how to do basic things from his gf and my sister turning into an unchecked ego. ithere was a lot of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse that happened pretty much my entire life. my parents constantly fought and would refuse to divorce because they wanted to stick together for my brother. long story short about my brother: he is the christ child and can do no wrong. they worship him. standard sexism in the family unit stuff. my mom would bend over backwards to make sure my dad and brother got everything they ever wanted, while myself and my closest sister were treated like the help. i was the only one that was ever hit and anytime i did something that upset my dad, he would spank me and blame the pain on me, saying stuff like this hurts me more than it does you. i would get my behind shredded for making a b in 3rd grade. stuff like that. the one time i told a teacher about it, she contacted my parents and told them everything. i was having trouble sitting at school because my dad had beat my behind the night before for not cleaning my room in a timely manner.anyways, i will move on to the current situation. a few months after i moved back in with my parents to help out, my mom broke her back. burst fracture if her l1. turns out if you have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis, and you drink heavily every day for 30 years, you make your bones so brittle that a sneeze could break your ribs.who knew right?so i was suddenly not just helping, i was taking care of both of them.now keep in mind the emotional abuse i had experienced in the past.my dad's emotional filter in his brain was basically destroyed. he lost his left side to paralysis. he would verbally lash out at me and my mom for little shit and on a few occasions he tried to hit us with his cane.he could have actually killed my mom if he had hit her but thankfully that did not happen.fast forward to now. i have become their full time caretaker and take care of literally everything.i could go on and on about all the shit that has happened in the last 4 years but this post is already too long. now i am completely burnt out. i can't be around my dad without being triggered violently and i have to stop myself from blowing up. my mom is a narcissistic guilt trip master and i literally cannot leave the house unless it's to take them to doc appts or to buy groceries. the few and far between times that i can leave the house, they both guilt me and make me feel terrible and treat me like a child. i'm gonna be 30 this year. i have no life. i have one friend. i almost never leave the house. we are living off of my dad's social security disability check which isn't enough to actually survive on. my mom is waiting to get on disability but they are taking their dear sweet time. we haven't paid rent in the last 2 months because if we did wouldn't have any money for food or for medicine and that's a whole other bag of dicks right there. both of their meds together cost roughly 800 a month. and that's even with my dad now being on humana and medicare.i don't know what to do. i desperately want to escape and get on with my life. literally everyone i talk to tells me to get out and i know i need to.but here's the thing...i would feel so guilty, despite everything. i would feel like i'm abandoning them. i have tried to reach out for help. nothing is working.both of my parents are technically capable of taking care of some things themselves but they won't do it and when i try to explain how it would help me greatly, it turns into a ""you're so ungrateful and selfish"" argument.i have to make phone calls for them that they could make themselves. fill out paperwork they could do themselves. i even have to talk to their docs for them because if i didn't, they wouldn't care and wouldn't advocate for themselves. there is an extremely unhealthy attachment going on here and i just wanna hear from anyone who is or has experienced something similar. i just need help. i am so fucking tired and i'm scared that i will send myself into a cardiac episode or worse because i'm under so much constant stress. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'm sorry if i have posted in the wrong area.

"when your mom or dad’s [dementia]( or [alzheimer’s]( care requires more than you can reasonably provide, it might be time to start thinking about transitioning to a [memory care]( community. [a variety of memory care levels]( exist, from providing simple medication reminders to full care communities assisting residents with bathing, dining, and ensuring they won’t get lost. before considering a move like this, be sure to verify your loved one matches behavior associated with [the early signs of alzheimer's and dementia,]( and consult a trusted physician.## transitioning to a memory care communitythe first thirty days can be the most difficult as you and your parent work through the shift from independent living to a memory care community. in many cases, your loved one may not always remember why the move is a good idea and might become upset or argumentative. being patient but firm, and leaning on the staff and administration at your chosen community for help, can aid you through this process and make your mom or dad feel at home.## explore before the movetaking your mom or dad to enjoy lunch or recreational activity at their chosen memory care community can help give them familiarity with the building, grounds, staff, and other members of the residence. associating positive feelings and memories with the community can make it easier for them to feel at home once they move in. you can also discuss various alzheimer’s care options with the staff, and see how other residents enjoy their lives in the community setting.## share information with staffthe caregivers at your loved one’s chosen senior living community should have as many questions for you as you do for them. be prepared to tell them as much as you can about your parent’s life and interests. knowing which foods they like and dislike, what things they were passionate about when they were young, and other personal pieces of information about your mom or dad can help staff personalize your parent’s care.## initiating the actual movethe chaos of moving can be even more confusing and disorienting to a loved one living with dementia or alzheimer’s. having one friend or family member spend the day with your parent while the rest of you arrange the setup of their new room can help.choose belongings carefully to create a space that feels familiar as well as offering staff insight into your parent’s personality and interests. focus on items with personal value and sensory input, like a soft quilt or family photos.## take time to visit frequentlyyears ago, the standard recommendation was for family and friends to stay away for the first week or after transitioning to a memory care community. at the kensington falls church, we encourage family members to visit our[ memory care communities]( frequently, and even have a pet-friendly policy so you can enjoy time with the entire family while your loved one adjusts.by planning visits for a specific time of day, you can create a defined routine helping your mom or dad get used to the idea of you coming, leaving, and reliably coming again.## adapt your interactionsunderstanding memory loss can help you learn how [alzheimer’s]( and [dementia]( affect behavior.you may need to adapt the way you interact with your loved one. if they insist an impossible event took place, or that a fact (like the year) is different than what you know to be true, realize that this is their reality. arguing may only lead to unnecessary unhappiness. instead, enjoy listening to their stories and find small, meaningful activities to do together, such as sharing a meal or going for a walk around the grounds.## practice self-careit’s important to take care of yourself to make the most out of your time together. if you are experiencing grief or frustration, there is a good chance they will also pick up on your emotions and become upset. you may want to consider talking with a friend or therapy professional about your feelings as a way to work through your role in the transition.the better you care for yourself, the better you’ll be able to help take care of your mom or dad.## know that it gets easierthe initial transition into a memory care community can be challenging, and at times your loved one may say or do things that are hurtful. but remember, it isn’t personal.they are coming from a place of uncertainty, confusion, and frustration. accept that their unhappiness is temporary. they will have good days and difficult days.by attending to their care with compassion and love, you are ensuring that they are safe and will continue to have every opportunity for a fulfilling life beyond dementia.find out more about how the kensington falls church can help your mom or dad transition to the

"i genuinely don't know what on earth to do anymore. before i get into everything, let me give you a little background on myself. i'm 18 years old living in a household with my mother, my father, four cats, and recently my grandmother. i'm in my last year of highschool so i've been super busy with school and basically getting ready for college. but besides that, i'm having a problem that i literally have no clue how to fix. my grandmother has been diagnosed alzheimer's for a little over 5 years now, and she's only been living with us for about 9 months. she hasn't been too bad or anything, she actually has been doing amazing lately, but my dad sees her as this burden. he always makes it seem like my mother and i never help him out with her (even though he leaves me for a day or two while he's hanging out with a friend at a brewery or something) and he constantly says how he is frustrated with life. the worst part is that it is now influencing my grandmother, having her say ""i want to die"" and ""no one wants me around"". what am i supposed to do in this situation? i know i'll be leaving for college soon, but i don't want to leave my mother in a toxic environment like that. how do i make him see that he is effecting the whole house with his attitude?", i suggest you contact the alzheimer’s association. they will be able to direct you to support groups in your area as well as what services are available for your grandmother.i hope this is helpful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/dqbmt6/my_dad_is_making_everything_worse/,,My Dad is making everything worse.
"typing this out just to vent. it's been a hell of a day. quick background. my dad died suddenly almost 2 years ago and we found out mom was farther along with alzheimer's than we'd known. i've spent the last two years helping as best as i can, and we finally got her moved into assisted living a month ago. but i feel terrible. i've taken here out of a familiar house (~45 years), taken her dogs away (she really couldn't care for them properly) and the new place is great with awesome staff and good food, but it's just not what she's used to. the transition is not going well. today we've been called by nursing staff twice. first time, i was already on my way up with her dog and we had a great afternoon. she seemed in great spirits and we walked the dog, talked, everything seemed good. late tonight we got a call again. she's upset, bad headache, talking about wanting to kill herself. i feel like i had to get her out of a 'living alone' situation. but i can't help feeling like i've messed everything up. we've sunk like 15k into the assisted living so far. i'm trying to sell her house to help fund things for the next several years. but if it's not working then i have no idea what to do. part time home care, live in home care, moving in with me or siblings, me or siblings moving in with her... all these options were weighed and i thought we made the best choice.how do you stop yourself from despair when the plans you make don't seem to work out? i feel like i've messed everything up and there is no hope. what a terrible disease. it just eats up everything and everyone. i can't believe how few options there seem to be and how bloody expensive it all is. most days all she wants to do is end it all and we can't even help her go out on her own terms. i feel like i've tried my hardest and failed spectacularly. how do you all do it?", i don’t know but perhaps at the two month mark things will be better? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/a6lyhr/what_a_rough_day/,,what a rough day
"tldr: mums getting further into alzheimer’s and i have no family to ask for help - what steps do i take? ps it’s awkward cause mum and i aren’t that close...so i’m 24 female and my dad past away last year. mum’s (62) been developing early symptoms of alzheimers in the last 3-4 years but is now getting worse. i don’t have any family i can contact to help me - i don’t know what to do in terms of getting her assessed or anything! i’ve been trying to research but i’m scared off because if i act too soon she might rage at me and threaten to kick me out. my parents were in a domestic abusive relationship for my entire life - my mum being the abuser - i cop a lot of the shit now that dads passed but what use to be cruel is now just bizzare behaviour coupled with really bad memory loss and basic functioning on the decline - so i’m not so much being abused as i am concerned for her own wellbeing and sanity. she has plenty of money so she’s been able to get by with just sitting around for years doing nothing - meaning no outside pressure or responsibility for her condition to be tested by others. i’ve got no idea what to do, it’s so awkward and weird considering my relationship with her is only just started to improve. she can’t even remember core elements of my teen years or things she use to do everyday in routine! she can’t remember big holidays we went on, no memory of visiting other countries or birthday parties we had. some days she will say “was it yesterday that you walked the dog or today” when i walked the dog only two hours ago. she’s extremely negative, will constantly look out the windows and verbally judge the neibours in a very creepy way. a few days ago she told me she waited till the neibours left home so she could go have a “sticky beak” at their yard - she hopped their fence to get in.... then explained how horrible and dirty their house was. the next day she went up the back of our property and said she was looking down into their house to watch what they do at night....she also mentioned watching the man of that household leave to go do groceries asking suspiciously “where does he go that idiot”.my mum has always been negative and horrible but she has never been this stalkerish...sigh i feel like this is crossing the line into a stage that i need to get checked but i really don’t know what to do or where to start :( p.s. she does this really strange thing where she laughs for 10mins at a time really loud and it doesn’t even sound like a laugh. when i ask her what is so funny she won’t tell me...it’s scary :( i hope what i have written does not offend anyone - i’m not trying to be insensitive i’m just feeling really alone and helpless in this situation. i’m dealing with someone who has never really been a mother to me so it’s hard to connect to her in good health let alone bad. thank you for reading.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/9y3ka7/mum_seems_to_have_alzheimers_and_i_dont_know_what/,,Mum seems to have Alzheimer’s and I don’t know what to do!

"i (single mom 47f) am a caregiver for my gammy (96f).  i moved her into my house after my divorce 10 years ago, as she was just lonely after my (step)grandfather passed.  i have 2 teens (19f and 17m) that help when they have to, but not often, and a respite caregiver for 3 hours a day mondays, tuesdays, and fridays. my mother(68f) (this is her mom) can not help out with her care as she is a full time caregiver for my father (71m), but she does all the.errands and shopping for gammy when she is.able and handles all the financial issues and has medical poa for gammy.  gammy has 2 other kids, bill (75) and rich (62).  they don't want anything to do with her, as there was a lot of alcoholism and abuse from their father against them.but mostly her.  when she left her husband, she left the kids with him and i believe that is the reason.why they don't want to deal with her.  but i.digress... so, those are the players involved.  in the last 8 to 10 months, my gammy's mind has slipped.  she has always been mentally sharp and showed no signs of dementia or any other neurological issues until recently.  when it all began, we had her checked and the diagnosis was ""rapid onset dementia"" and the doctor warned that she may swiftly deteriorate.   well, she was right.  my sweet, loving, nurturing gammt has morphed into a screeching, insulting, verbally abusive harridan.  we have had the police show up to our door 2 times in the last couple months, because the neighbors her her screaming at me and call the police on her.  she insults me, throws things, she even told the respite caregiver that i ""physically attacked"" her when all that happened was i shook my finger at her (not even my middle finger!)  she is getting progressively worse, and i am.nearing.my breaking point. before she got so bad, i would take my kids on a summer vacation every year.  friday early am to sunday late pm, i used this.vacay to rest and unwind, and it is a much anticipated and appreciated respite from my normal duties, and return from it with a renewed sense of purpose and energy.  but!!!  this year, we may not be able to go anywhere at all!  not even for a single day!  she refuses to leave the house at all, and my mother has offered to have her stay at her house while we are gone, but no dice. my best friend has offered to stay here at my place and care for.gammy, but my friend is a lesbian and married and my gammy is.horribly homophobic and refuses to allow ""that sodomizing lesbian"" to infect (?????? ) her with her lesbianism.  yeah.  i laughed a but when i heard her tell me that, too.  especially since i am bisexual myself!  so there is no one that can help!lately she has been a lot worse then before.  so this.vacation is not just ""for fun"", but is greatly needed so that i can come back to my duties feeling more. . . charitable?  dedicated??  not like i am about to snap???  she is absolutely dead set on this issue too.i am at my wits end here.  i can just take her to my mother's house and they can just keep her until i get back . . . . but that is taking away her autonomy and i would feel horrible about that.  i can have my friend stay here with her, but that is taking my friend away from her wife and her son and putting her into a situation where she would have to constantly hear homophobic comments and snide remarks from gammy, and i would hate for her to have to deal with it.  and we can not afford more caregivers or an adult daycare program.  i know i need this time out/vacation badly, and my kids need this time for just the three of us to be together and have fun.  they have been awesome, putting up with how much of my time is given over to gammy for her caretaking. but they still need their ""momma time"", and to be honest i need some ""kidlet time"" myself!i am also worried about burnout.  i feel like i am getting close to it, and my bipolarism is getting worse the more tired i am. . . .and since gammy keeps getting up and down all night, i am getting 3 to 4 hours of sleep a night , on average.  i an mentally, emotionally, and physically drained and done, and the best way to ""fix"" it is some time off.sorry for the (almost literal) novella  i am just so exhausted and stretched too thin here, and don't know what to do next. that is why i am reaching out/ranting here.  any suggestions?  any ideas or work-arounds that you have tried?  i have no clue and no one else to ask, as most of my friends aren't in the same situation, and have little to no experience with caregivertl;dr. help!"," i would say it may be worth looking into finding a psychiatrist that specializes in dementia. they can give her meds to stabilize her mood and behavior. we did this for my mother and the difference was night and day. she went from being paranoid, violent and aggressive back to her docile self within days. there are some risks to these medications but i'd say it's worth it. typically these psychiatrists will accept medicare. often your local university or medical school will have an associated clinic that offers these services. contact your local office on aging and/or associated health care social worker. they can point you to the programs, clinics and state sponsored resources available to her. also, look to see if your state has a visiting nurse and/or physicians service. that helps in that her basic medical care will all be home based and medicare will also cover for a home health aide to come out every week (1-3x) and at least help with bathing, feeding and associated light chores.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/w4qlqu/need_a_vacation_but/,,"Need a Vacation, but . . . ."

"hey yall, i’m gonna try to summarize my current circumstances and explain what’s going on because i’ve found myself in a heck of a situation very suddenly and i need support/advice/whatever. i’m 18 (19 on july 30) and my nana is 79 (80 on august 31). nana has been having severe and ongoing health issues for as long as i can remember, but about 4-5 years ago, our family built an apartment connected to our house to be closer to both of my grandparents. they moved out of their beautiful house 45 minutes away into their little apartment, and the stress of moving must have aged them like 10 years because things are bad. my gumpa (83 on august 8) got diagnosed with dementia a couple years ago, and he is literally completely unable to help out my nana anymore &amp; needs help of his own. this is really bad because my nana has severe scoliosis, osteoporosis, awful circulation, basically everything under the sun that could have gone wrong has gone wrong and she needs a hip replacement now. she can barely walk on her own. a few nights ago, nana fell and broke her wrist. like shattered it. so yesterday i was with her at the hospital all day waiting for surgery. surgery went well, she’s back at home now, and i stayed overnight to make sure she had everything she needed and i’m going to be staying all day today too. this is going to be a looooong recovery process because she needs to completely rest her wrist for 5 weeks and then needs to go to physical therapy for a couple months after that. like i said, she also can’t really walk anymore and doesn’t have any help from my gumpa, so taking care of her has all fallen on me. they’re both my mom’s parents and she spends a lot of time over at the apartment helping them out, but she also works a full time job and can’t be there as much as someone needs to be there… so considering i’m currently unemployed and not in college, but i drive a car and am generally responsible, i’m the perfect candidate for the job. i was actively interviewing with a potential employer immediately before this happened, but this is way more important. caregiving is challenging enough work as it is, but there’s more important context to this; my nana is a very difficult person to be around for extended periods of time. she has so much completely unhealed trauma and untreated mental illness- her entire existence these days is suffering, because she’s completely trapped in her own head. it’s not her fault obviously, but she is literally the most obsessive, anxious, and pessimistic person i have ever met in my entire life. this is particularly heavy on me because i have the same hereditary mental illness as she does, but i’ve been treating it all in therapy since i was like 11. i still struggle plenty on my own. fortunately, my presence seems to lighten my nana’s mood a lot and she is really appreciative of having me around and having my help, but oh my god. this is getting draining and i’ve only been doing it for a couple days. i love her dearly and i will help her with anything she needs ever for the rest of her life, and she keeps trying to compensate me with money and whatever because she feels so guilty, but like… i’m not doing this so she rewards me, i’m doing this because i love her and she needs someone to take care of her right now. my parents and my brother have been awesome in terms of being supportive and getting me off the hook when i need it these past couple days. i’m just anxious about the fact that i’m gonna be doing this nonstop for a while. i know my nana feels so bad about stopping me from living my life and taking care of her, but her guilt really isn’t helping me out here. basically, i just want to know what some of you guys have done and how you felt in situations like this that were out of your control. i feel like i got thrown in the deep end, but i really need to keep myself and both of my grandparents afloat, preferably without any of us losing our marbles. i want to be able to do my best but i’m very new at this and i need help from pretty much anywhere i can receive it. tl;dr my elderly grandmother destroyed her wrist but she also can’t walk and my grandfather has dementia and can’t do literally anything, so i’m suddenly taking care of them pretty much full time until my grandmother gains some independence back, and i’m afraid i’m gonna actually go insane. pls for the love of god send me some encouragement or advice or literally anything that could possibly help bc i need it", it is an insane situation to care for 2 people at the same time. one is already hard.   you definitely need to ask your parents n your brother to help or hire someone.   you are young n i'm sure very capable. but it's alot emotionally to be this responsible for 2 people's lives at your age.  just bc you're free doesn't mean you're it.   definitely speak up.. get a schedule made where you get time off.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vzmmoa/suddenly_thrown_into_caregiving_situation/,,suddenly thrown into caregiving situation??
"not sure where to post but i just need to talk...my dad is a caregiver for my grandmother who has dementia. he currently has some health problems but is having trouble getting care for himself because he's a caregiver. my grandmother had an aid but the company has been terrible and the last aid gave them covid and that was the last straw. he had made some progress but had to reschedule because of the covid. now he has to either wait months to get care because everything medical is delayed due to covid (and probably other ""events"") effects in the country or get admitted to the hospital asap for the same care by the same doctors that can treat him immediately. this was a last resort because he will have to put my grandmother into temporary hospice and he will need help from family while he's in the hospital.fast forward to now, he is starting to get plans in place but i'm nervous, scared, and frustrated because the only family that can help is me, my sister, and a cousin and we all live in other states.  this will be financially tough for all of us. i'm a last resort because i'm farthest away but i still don't know how i'm going to get through this. what if my dad finds out he will need more care which means more help? what if my grandmother is neglected while shes away? travel is expensive. also i can only imagine how expensive my dad's medical bills will be if he needs more care and just for the hospital bill in general. even with insurance, my dad already doesn't have alot of money.  i'm frustrated with us healthcare and i'm overwhelmed and scared for my family and myself. how has anyone gotten through this kind of situation?"," idk what kind of medical procedure your dad needs but, in general, hospital stays, even for major surgeries is surprisingly short. you could consider taking care of both gma & dad at home. with 3 possible caregivers, maybe y’all can take turns, say 2 week shifts to care for both. you could hire a temp caregiver to come in 2-3 times per week to help with showers. i took care of both my parents and sister post op recently (3 people) by myself this a few months back. my parents’ caregiver walked out for 4 days, my sister, the primary caregiver, had knee replacement surgery, and my brother died from covid. i was there for 2 weeks but it wasn’t too bad if you plan for everything in advance. the 4 days without the other caregiver where i took care of all 3 people and made burial plans for my brother were pretty crazy. but i survived and so will you.personally, i’d keep gma at home bc short term environmental changes are really hard in dementia patients. y’all three possible caregivers can take turns taking care of gma or gma & dad. this should give them almost 6 weeks. (i’d stagger it where each caregiver stays 2 weeks, with 1-2 days overlap to get errands done.)my sister’s surgery was outpatient and came home that afternoon.here are some tips:1) whoever is doing the grocery shopping now, presumably your dad, have him give you a list of weekly groceries and find out if you can have them delivered to the house. or, stock up on non perishables. plan on not being able to leave the house very much, if at all. if possible, ask a friend or neighbor to pick up fresh groceries weekly. non grocery stuff were ordered from amazon for delivery to our front door.2) cook as much food as you can before your dad goes into the hospital. freeze a lot of cooked proteins & veg. pasta & rice can be cooked daily as needed. meals should be kept simple. you might have to eat the exact same thing for days on end for simplicity’s sake. you can also order meals from rest for delivery, if your budget allows.3) showers are the biggest issue, requiring 2 caregivers. for this reason, we only shower my parents once per week, up they’re feeling up to it. in the winter, they’re usually too cold and we towel bathe them. we usually towel bathe them every other day or so. my sister’s surgeon said that she’d be moving around well within 10 days and i was skeptical but his estimate was accurate. she was able to go for a walk down the block and back before i left. so your dad would probably recover quicker than you think. ask his doctor.so no worries, it’s doable if you plan ahead. good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vz0el9/frustrated_and_scared/,,Frustrated and scared
"over the past 3 years, my gf has been a caregiver for a 91 year old grandmother with dementia. she has been very passionate, has gone above and beyond, and sees her as family. her employer, the daughter of the patient is a doctor and has always paid in cash. i can attest that my gf truly loves the grandmother like family. she has spent weekends there before watching her overnights. last wednesday, the employer said she needs my gf to watch her mother friday-monday. told her she could come and go as she pleases and that she will pay her $900. this was all agreed upon over a phone call. in order to make these accommodations, my gf paid $200 to board her dog for the weekend as she couldn’t bring her dog to the house. she canceled plans to go to a concert with her best friend that lives out of town and was coming in town for her birthday. she got there at 8:00 am. she first left the house at 9:00 pm to get food with me. we were gone for 2 hours and came back to the house to sleep. her employer does not like me, so i remained in the living room and never left the couch. the next morning, she cared for the patient until 4:00 pm, doordashed food using her own money. we briefly left for 30 min to run to get food. in that 30 min, a family friend came over and panicked when nobody was there. instead of contacting anybody, he rushed and woke up the patient who had just laid down to nap and gave her an extra breathing treatment which she had just received an hour prior. he called the employer to report what happened and said that an unknown car was there. the employer then calls my gf accusing her of negligence and putting her house at risk by my being there. for the rest of the weekend, my gf didn’t leave a single time. come tuesday, the employer began texting my gf making a slue of baseless and untrue accusations. made many claims saying she was negligent and that she had her dog there. we all know she was really just mad that i was there. sure my gf was wrong by bringing me there, but there were no problems that came from my presence. she now made a facebook post saying that her mother’s health is declining due to “a negligent caretaker”. she is now making increasingly baseless claims and accusations and is really bullying/gaslighting my gf. with each conversation, my gf fears that her employer isn’t going to pay the $900. regardless if the employer is upset that i was there for 12 hours, my gf still performed all her duties that they had agreed upon. my gf is heartbroken at the treatment she’s receiving from those she saw as family. but she spent roughly $350 to make that $900, so she’d be out $1250. the details were discussed by phone, so nothing is in writing. she is a fresh graduate in student debt and can’t afford a lawyer, especially considering her employer is a well off doctor. is there anything that she can do to make sure she gets paid the $900 that had been agreed upon?"," she can tell the ""employer"" that she will report her for tax fraud.  pretty sure ""paying in cash"" means that employer is not contributing to social security, paying unemployment and workers comp taxes.  employer may let her go but she sure as shit will cough up the $900.having a loved one in dire straits does play crazy games on people's emotions, i will say.  it is easy to get irrationally irate at caregivers for any slight.  your gf should only take the steps recommended above if the $900 is not forthcoming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vyz7xp/is_my_girlfriend_entitled_to_her_compensation/,,Is my girlfriend entitled to her compensation?
"i'm sorry this is going to be pretty long, i just need somewhere to release it all. i've (32f) have been a caregiver since i was 16 years old. litterally half my life. my mother was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's my freshman year of high school, by sophomore year she had already forgotten my name. junior year i quit school and started to take care of her full time. my father had left us (my mom and my siblings) because she cheated on him before she got diagnosed but i know that, it was probably caused by her mental illness. in 30 years of marriage not once did she even look at someone else. i became the new defacto mother. taking care of my sisters (who are the same age we're triplets) and my mother. i found a job that would pay me under the table, and i was lucky we were already in government housing.by 17 my mother was a total care, couldn't speak, couldn't feed herself but damn could she excape from anywhere. she went wondering for the first time on my 18th birthday, it was a very cold, snowy december 1st. i spent hours outside looking for her with neighbors, i can't even remember how long it was when we finally found her. i do remember crying in my bed that night unable to sleep listening to the lightest noise that she may be getting out of her bed.my sisters and i grew up, me being everyone's mom, and them i let them grow up, finish school. they eventually got married and moved out leaving me and my mother completely alone for the first time. that's when my father came back gone for 4 years leaving basically children to fend for themselves and their mother. but he was hurt, a broken foot and needed someone to take care of him. i don't know why i agreed but i did. adding yet another who required my care. my sisters come around... but are already busy with new family. old doesn't matter anymore. by 21, i had gotten my ged and attempted to go to college online, while working from home, and taking care of both my parents at the same time. i was doing great until my father got really sick. he couldn't keep food down, and was swelling up like a balloon. doctors appointments later kidney failure. he'd have to be on dialysis for the rest of his life. his doctor chose a newer method called peritoneal dialysis. it would just require me to set him up on a machine every night. which i agreed to. 28 years old and i've never held a job for longer than 6 months, something always came up. i've had loved ones leave me because i had too much responsibility, not enough free time. i didn't and don't want kids because i've been taking care of someone else my whole life already. mom's no longer eating anything i make, she'll chew it up and spit it right back out. her doctors make the decision to put in a peg tube and teach me how to feed her. the second week feeding my mother through her belly, she coughs, and coughs, and then can't breathe. she vomits and gasps for air. i call the ambulance and in less than an hour i'm told.... she might survive the night. i call my family. my sisters show up and so does my brother. they come in for a couple minutes then leave after the doctor says it won't happen for a while. less than 5 minutes after they leave and it's just her and i again, and she's gone. i listen to her ragged, rattle and then the final sigh. i feel... light... a weight is lifted from my chest and i could breathe for the first time in years. 29 years old and everything is going great for the first time in a long time. i've been in school for a year, and working at the same place for just as long. i still have to hook my dad up at night, but i've got free time in the mornings for just me. i had been going to the gym and lost the 60lbs i gained after my mom passed away, and was looking forward to the vacation i had lined up. it was just a staycation at a local hotel but it was more freedom than i had ever tasted.on march 6th, 2019, i got a call from my father. he's frantic saying he fell and he couldn't get his legs under himself. i call the ambulance and rush home, he's lying on the ground can't even lift his head up, his speech slurred and left side limp. i'm comforting him waiting for the parametics, but in my head i'm just screaming not again. it was a stroke, one that he might not recover physically from. days in the hospital they bring him back home... incontinent, unable to feed himself, and unable to walk. but still all there mentally. i call my siblings... and they come and see him.. and just as quickly leave again. alone again, with my father.once again unemployed, quit school. a full-time caregiver once again.july 12, 2022, my fathers amputated toes, from a wound that wouldn't heal, legs like a skeleton. mentality he's gone, i've known it for months. nothing of his 6'3 233lbs left on him. hasn't ate in weeks and now refusing a ng tube. a peg tube on his dnr as a never. tomorrow i find out if i take him home and watch him go just like my mother, or if he qualifies for hospise (which he won't.)i now sit... in bed again wondering who i'll be once he's gone too. if you read this... thank you for letting me share my thoughts with you. tldr: caregiver for half of life now wonders what it'll be like once she isn't one."," my heart is with you. i’m sorry you have to be, but you are a strong ass woman! remember to take care of yourself,

"hello, i would like some support. i'm new to this sub so i don't know if any flairs or abbreviations should be used. also, i'm on mobile so please forgive any formatting issues.i (23f) am a caregiver for my maternal grandmother (83f) with dementia. we don't know what kind, because her previous primary care provider wasn't of highest quality. i really struggle to navigate this health system.at home are my mom, (49f) dad (59m) and younger sister (16f). before any comments on my living at home appear, my family is traditional, and since i am unmarried i am expected to live at home and give care.my family is dysfunctional to say the least. i'm not sure if i should say this, but my father definitely has narcissistic tendencies, history of abuse, anger issues, addiction and a host of other problems. but most of all he does not help out. at all. i took the initiative to hire a home health aide and he kicked her out three times because he doesn't like ""somebody in the house,"" but my grandma's conditioning is worsening and we are not equipped to deal with it.we are all working too. full time for us three adults, and my sister got her first job this summer. mom and dad don't tell us their work schedules so sister and i are often left to our own devices to figure out when we need to stay home. we rarely get the option to have a social life or even just relax. couple this with our upbringing and you'll see that we are always arguing about our grandmother and how to care for her. it doesn't help that my mother is unreachable by phone most of the time. when i try to talk to her, she is so passive that communication is impossible even though we live together.okay, i could go on, but i'll stop ranting. thank you for reading this if you made it here and i appreciate your support."," hey, i read your post and offer my sympathy and support! \*online hug if you're ok with it\*ranting and venting are ok things to do! and your feelings are totally understandable.i can relate, being a 32f and have very dysfunctional parents. my father seems to have asperger's and my mum seems to be a covert narcissist. i don't throw these 'psychological' labels around lightly, but those are the only explanations i can come up with that explains their consistently dysfunctional and self-centred personalities. my mum had a stroke recently so i'm caregiver to her for now and it's totally draining. my dad is useless and my sisters are too busy with their own lives to help. like you, i feel sad and anxious a lot.know that you are allowed to do whatever you need to do to protect your mental health and care for yourself every day. taking breaks. if it's too hard to go out, do something at home that makes you feel better or least distracts you, etc.i'm sorry i don't really have more or better answers. but i have learned that knowledge is power, and it sounds like not knowing how to care for your grandmother with dementia is a big issue. i'm sure there are resources online that could help give some clues or advice? in any case, at the very least, this is a tough situation that you and your sister should not be totally responsible for solving, while your parents are being so unhelpful. the burden should be theirs, not yours. know that at least your grandmother is safe at home so people are around her if an accident should happen and she is clothed and she is fed. whatever minimum you can manage to do in a day for her, that has to be enough. you are doing enough. you are being strong, even when you don't feel like you are.my best wishes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vqxzkt/caregiving_within_a_dysfunctional_family/,,Caregiving within a dysfunctional family
"hi, i'm rue. i am currently in a care-giving position for my step-grandmother, who is blind and hard-of-hearing with dementia. i am not the only caregiver, but i feel as if most of the burden is put on me. (i previously cared for my mother, from ages 11-16. so, taking care of my grandmother now is bringing up residual trauma from that part of my life). i feel guilty even writing this post, but so far nobody i know irl can relate to the struggle of caring for family.   currently, i am in school (summer break!) and caring for my grandmother 4/7 days of the week. i cook every meal, clean the house, basically everyday stuff. i cannot leave the house at any point, as she is too afraid to stay alone. for context i am neither mentally or physically well, and struggle with staying calm to try and care for her, and i was just curious is this is a normal thing when dealing with dementia patients?    i've heard comments about 'sun-downing' where dementia patients are worse at night, and in this case it's true, as she won't even let me sleep, anymore. she is too afraid to go to sleep and will constantly wake me so she feels better sleeping. obviously this whole situation has a detrimental effect on my mental health, and i had to go back on anti-depressants, and go back into therapy. it's to the point where i do not feel human anymore, and have been disassociating from life. once she goes to bed, i stare at my bedroom wall for 3 hours until i go to bed, and wake up and repeat.   tonight was like, a final breaking point moment, where she came into my bedroom and asked to sleep with me. i told her we weren't allowed to do that, as a rule placed by my stepmother. she started crying, and called me useless, over and over. i sat beside her bed for an hour until she went to sleep, and then i went to my bedroom and couldn't stop crying. i told my father about it, and he just excused the behaviour, and that it isn't her fault, which i know. i know dementia is horrible, and this happens, but i would have felt better if someone even acknowledged my feelings for once.   i'm not sure about anything anymore, and just wanted to know if anyone felt similarly helpless in their situations. thank you for reading, x.", you might find some helpful content from teepa snow. she is on tik tok & youtube,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vq8ka4/struggling_with_dementia_ranting_i_guess/,,"Struggling With Dementia - Ranting, I guess"

"that's it.  there's not much more i can do.  my wife and i have essentially provided assisted living in our home for my 89yo mother for the last few years, and her total lack of mobility plus dementia means she can't even really feed herself any more.  and she's getting beyond what we can do.hurts.i've felt pretty good about taking care of her.  it was an opportunity to give back.  it wasn't that hard, just kind of a constant background requirement taking up a total of a few elapsed hours a day.  couldn't make any trips together, but my wife or i could go away for a little bit, leaving the other to take care of my mother.but now i'm calling nursing homes.  not proud of it.  on some objective level i know it's necessary.  i know my wife and i need it, too.

"this has been on my mind for as long as i can remember, and i have never been able to say a thing about it to anyone i know. here's to hoping my friends/family don't recognize my username and learn this stuff. this is the first time i've ever put words to my thoughts.\], so let me just dump my whole life story on a bunch of internet strangers in a long, rambling rant that no one will read or truly care about like the absolute idiot i am. you'll probably read this thinking you can prove i'm not a hopeless case and ""everyone can be helped uwu!"" you're wrong. here's a prime example as to why:my life is great. i have two loving parents and two siblings (older sister and twin sister). i have an adorable 5-year-old dog and a 4-month-old bearded dragon. my best friend and i have known each other for 10 years, almost 11. i go to a great school, my family is financially stable in a comfortable house, and i've never been bullied. i'm a 15-year-old male who 2 years ago in march came out to my parents as transgender (and gay). i have a huge family besides my immediate relatives since both my parents and grandparents have divorced and remarried. not a single. person. in my entire family was hateful towards me in any way, shape, or form. everyone accepted me and moved on. my friends accepted me. hell, even my school accepted me. most kids knew i was trans and didn't treat me any differently (they didn't talk to me more or less than they usually did--i only hung out with my twin and 2 friends but was kind to everyone). i got started on testosterone shots fairly quickly, and plan to get top surgery when i'm 18. i don't think i've ever faced any prejudice for being trans. and even the results i got from the t were great compared to ""normal standards""--my voice deepened quickly, i didn't get acne at all (and still never have), my hairline is not receding (yet), and my periods have stopped. anyone in my position would be happy, right?i fucking hate myself and my entire life. i'm a stupid, entitled, attention-seeking brat who wants to use mental illness (i've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety) as an excuse for my actions and i hate myself for it. my dad is arrogant and thinks he's always right. my older sister is loud, self-centered, makes it her mission to hate anything and everything, and argues with/yells at my dad all day, every day. she gets scared at horror movies and decides that that means she has anxiety and must bring it up in almost every conversation (even i don't do that) and complains about her job every. night. at dinner. my mom is a pushover with about 80 autoimmune diseases, and my twin sister is so indifferent to everything it makes me want to scream. at the same time, my dad is confident and successful, my older sister is social and outgoing, my mother is kind and caring, and my twin is a genius and understanding. i hate myself for thinking so poorly about my family because i know it can be so much worse. they accepted me, cared for me, and my dad once broke into tears at my temple (my family is jewish, though i hate religion) because of my rabbi's willingness to accommodate me at the summer camp i've been going to since 2012 (it's become such an ingrained part of my life that i can't imagine going a summer without it). even there, most kids knew i was trans since my family is very well-known at the camp (my dad was president of the board of the temple and headed the search for a new camp director--everyone at my temple knows my family) and i got no flack for it. my family should mean everything to me.but i hate them a lot of the time. my friends, too. i hate anyone who is close to me. i'm trapped, wishing that i could just completely start over fresh and get rid of the person people think i am, but unable to do anything because of the expectations set in place for who i am and how i act. i doubt i'm going to kill myself--it's too scary and final a decision for me, and god forbid there be consequences for my actions. plus, i would never do that to my family or friends or even people who just barely know me. the thought of being the reason for someone else crying makes me want to rip my brain from my skull. most people think people like me think ""nobody loves me"", ""nobody understands me"", or ""i'm alone."" i know my family loves me. i know there are people out there going through similar things. i know my family would go through hell and back for me. i know i can reach out to them any time i wish and be hugged and loved and helped. i hate it. i hate the thought of going to a person for comfort. i tried therapy; never worked. i hate it so, so much, and i really tried to get it to work. if i don't know you, i don't trust you with my feelings, and once i begin to know you, i'm scared to share them because i don't want to jeopardize what you think of me. and i know in reality my family and friends won't care. they'll help me (or rather support me; i still don't think i can be helped). but no way am i ever going to voice any of this to them. it's like i'm physically unable to. i wish my family and friends would hate me; i wish i could just vanish from their thoughts so nobody has any expectations of me and i can go off somewhere else and start a completely new life. for example, when my dad cried at my temple, i was shocked. he's not an emotional person. seeing him cry made me want to cry (i have since seemingly lost the ability to do so). my family doesn't think of me as someone who cries. i constantly hear whenever we're watching a sad movie or something ""oh yeah, mom's going to definitely cry. but (my name) doesn't cry. he never cries."" thus, i think to myself that i am not allowed to cry. i rarely feel the urge, anyways. my mom saw me covering my mouth and said: ""(my name), don't laugh at your dad!"" i wasn't laughing. i wasn't really crying either. but the thought of me crying is so foreign to my family and friends that it seems an impossibility, and thus, it's become a foreign concept for me, too. no matter how much pain i'm in, how sad i am, or angry, i can never cry. i want to. i want to be able to cry. but i can't.this isn't even the brunt of what i want to really rant about. the big problem is my seemingly complete polarity in thought. it makes me so angry, hating what i'm doing but not stopping it. i feel like my brain is splitting, trapped between who people think i am, who i really am, and who i want to be. i'm angry, sarcastic, and incapable of any emotion besides anger and humor. i can't remember the last time i said ""i love you"" to someone non-ironically. any pleasantry seems to die on my tongue; ""thank you"", ""you're welcome"", ""sorry"", etc--i swear it's like it's impossible for me to get the words out. i can't even fake it. saying anything sincere or serious out loud is an impossibility. if my mom needs to talk to me about something important (like, for example, when my testosterone levels dropped and my periods started up again), i'll tell her to go into the other room and text me. i can tell it annoys her just a little, but i don't care. i feel no empathy for others. yesterday my sister had some strange drive-through graduation ceremony at our school because it was closed. she's been so upset that her graduation and everyone else's was practically ruined. this time i managed not to say anything because i was in one of my weird silent moods, but i didn't want to go. i couldn't care less. i can't seem to care about anything in real life (specifically real life; i'll get back to that later). i hate having to be on a call with family members to wish them a happy birthday; i refused to hold a sign i'd (begrudgingly) helped my twin make for my sister at her graduation because i thought i'd look stupid; i complain whenever i'm dragged to important services, even though my dad tells me it means a lot to my family to come (especially for high holidays); anything that inconveniences me, no matter how important for others, i hate. and don't think i think i'm in the right on this; i hate myself so much for being like this. i curse myself in my head for being so selfish while continuing to be an asshole on the outside because i have zero self-control. it's stupid, right? hating what i'm doing but not willing to put in the effort to change it. seems like a pretty hopeless case, right?do you wanna know the worst example of this? my grandma on my dad's side. she used to babysit me and my sisters a lot; we'd play uno, watch a movie, eat ice cream, and play club penguin on her tiny old desktop computer. ever since late 2018 or early 2019, she's been bouncing from retirement home to retirement home because she, to put it simply, can be an asshole. she started to get dementia and, since she and my dad weren't too too close, he left it to my mom to take care of her. and man, it weighed on her. she already has a tough life, what with her autoimmune diseases, growing up practically raising her siblings, and this shitshow our once-kind family has become. every day we'd hear something new on the way home from school about my grandma and what trouble she'd gotten into that day; insisting that her caretaker was abusing her, throwing fits before bed, threatening other housemates' lives, then sobbing to my mother because she couldn't remember any of it. i started to wish she was dead. it would be so much easier for my mother if she were dead, and then i wouldn't have to go out of my way to visit her. i hated myself for thinking that, but i assume at this point in my rant that's already a given. ""hate"" seems to be pretty ingrained in my life. she cared for me, accepted me eagerly even though she's very religious. with her dementia, she could never remember my new name. but she would always refrain from saying my old one because she knew it was wrong. she'd say to my mom ""i can't remember his name, but i know he's a he."" that just made me hate myself a whole lot more for wishing she was gone.so, finally, the day came. she was in the hospital for one reason or another (and has been in and out of hospitals all year), and they took her to hospice care. family flew in from all over to say goodbye. i felt nothing but relief that i didn't have to keep visiting her and that my mom didn't have to deal with her, as well as anger at myself for not feeling sad that someone so close to me was dying. my sisters went to see her. i didn't. i didn't want to, and in the end, didn't have to. i jumped on the bandwagon one of my uncles when he said he couldn't bear to see his mother in that state. that wasn't really true for me, but i pretended that it was. she died 3 days later. my mom woke me and my twin up at 4 in the morning to tell us that we didn't have to go to school that day. i took her offer, because why not? when the funeral came, i was very cold and distant. i didn't cry. my sisters did, my mom did, and of course, my dad did. everyone did. i didn't until later, alone on the floor of my bathroom with the shower on so as to provide an excuse for my absence. and i didn't even cry because she was dead. they weren't tears of sadness. they were tears of anger. i was so, so angry at myself for how selfish i was being, and how little i cared. i cried for myself, not for her. how pitiful is that?my mom chalked my coldness/distantness up to relapsing slightly since my grandma died. my doctor upped my dosage of citalopram (depression meds) since it wasn't enough to keep me 'stable' during mentally trying times. i don't remember if i cut my arm more because of this, but i definitely did for one reason or another, can't remember why. i started cutting before transitioning, and i don't even call it that. i was too scared of pain to really cut. i just wanted to do it because that's what people like me do, right? also, i wanted the scars. i wanted the attention that would come from them (and then shy away from any attention that might have consequences). i took a mechanical pencil and took the lead out so it was just the sharpish metal bit at the end and just dragged it on my skin over and over again until it was deep enough to scab (never really bled). then i'd pick at the scabs over and over and over again until they scarred. so, no razors for me.i don't think i've cried since then. it's just casual inner hatred that sometimes flares up every now and then. oh, also, i'm a toxic friend. i've got 2 friends i actually care about that go to my school (one who went to my camp, i'll talk about her in a second), s and e. e is really more my twin's friend, but she's outgoing and social and we're close, though not close enough for me to talk to her even over text about anything wrong with me. i don't consider her someone i could go to. s, on the other hand, is the friend i've known for nearly 11 years. her family life sucks, too. when her dog got put down (a dog she'd had for as long as she could remember), of course, she got sad. and i'm her best (and at the time only) friend. i should comfort her, right? well, not wanting to talk about my emotions goes both ways. i don't want to hear about them either. i don't want to hear about your problems, and no way on earth am i going to know how to fix them. i want friends (or a boyfriend) who is fine with dealing with my shit, but i don't want to ever have to deal with theirs? what kind of messed up shit is that? my mind tries to make up an excuse saying i'm not mentally stable enough to handle anyone else's grief, but i've learned to call bs on my mind's excuses long ago. i just don't want the attention off of poor old me, the angsty side character with the tragic backstory that all the readers fall in love with. my friend from camp, m, is probably the sweetest and most empathetic person i know. but she's never even touched a mental illness with a 5-foot pole. she's happy-go-lucky, perky, friends with literally everyone (and when she and a friend fall out, give it a week and they'll be friends again). every time i see her i have to hear ""are you okay? you look sad."" those are my two least favorite sentences on the entire planet. i'm not sad, i'm empty and angry. i'm not smiling because nothing funny is happening at the moment, and i guess i have resting-suicidal-face. and who honestly replies ""no"" when someone asks if they're alright? i've heard those two sentences so much that they're just white noise at this point. anyways, m wants to be a therapist. i'm sure she'd be great at it. i went to her once at camp, back when i hadn't closed my emotions off completely, to talk about s and her family life (pushover dad, verbally abusive mom, but she and her older brother have gotten closer, which is sweet). she had good advice. we sort of used to date, though i don't count it. i'm gay, pure and simple. i thought i was bi because of her and s (i'll get into that in a sec). she liked me, and i liked the contact. yes, she's pretty, but still. i'm gay. i didn't love her like that, i loved her closeness. we got together over text and broke up in like 3 months without ever seeing each other in person or changing our mannerisms at all. we're still great friends and text multiple times a week. i'm a very touch-starved person, similar to the reason i can no longer cry. before transitioning, i was dysphoric and didn't want people touching me. that's become a sort of reputation now. i do hate it when my family touches me though, no idea why, but i thought i loved m and s (and for a tiny bit, even e) because i loved it when they touched me. and not sexually, i couldn't care less about sexual shit. never done it, and likely won't trust anyone enough to do that for a while. just a simple knee brush, hand-holding (i've never done that in my life), head resting on a shoulder. i thought i had a crush on s and m (at different points in time) when in reality i just craved closeness and physical contact. though i don't like touch half as much when i initiate it (and if i get a boyfriend, i'd probably be too shy to). sometimes when trying to fall asleep i yearn for some warmth there to just hold me and hug me without zero expectations to talk or do anything besides lay there. i think i'll probably burst into tears the day that happens, which never will with my personality. even now, writing this, i feel like i haven't come into physical contact with anyone for years. but i digress. back to me being a toxic friend. before we upped my meds, i'd go through what i like to call asshole hours. i was such a jerk to my friends and family (but never to teachers, peers, or friends i didn't have too close a connection to, because oh poor me what would happen if i actually had consequences for my actions?). it's been a while since my last asshole hour due to my meds having been upped in november, but i was harsh and rude. s is a pushover and an enabler, which probably stems from her never being able to make a decision in her life because her mother is a grade-a helicopter parent. and she's the type of person to text ""are you okay?"", ""i'm here for you &lt;3"", ""i love you, you know that?"", etc. fuck, i hate that. i'd call her out on it too during those asshole hours. i guess my thoughts are ""i know this stuff, so why do you have to say it? it's implied."" but who knows. i've since stopped coming to her with my problems, which is kind of the straw that broke the camel's back. family is too close for me to share shit, so if i've closed myself off to the person i'm closest to, what hope is there? i'm closed off to everyone now unless i'm anonymous, i suppose.so i said i'll get back to the ""i can't seem to care about anything in real life"" so here it is. i'll admit it's a bit of an over-exaggeration. i do love some things. i love animals more than i love myself, which isn't hard. if i live past 18 i want to become a wildlife rehabilitator, though they don't get paid shit. i love music, though only songs with lots of drums and guitar. i used to love to read and write but barely do so anymore. i just watch youtube because reading and writing takes too much effort and i'm a lazy piece of shit. my twin sister got me into anime--oh boy. for some reason, i only seem to feel things for fictional characters. i think they're more attractive then real people ( you fucking weeb), cooler, kinder, etc. i get genuinely angry over truly evil villains and hate them to my core. and for characters i like, that's a whole other can of worms. i won't name specifically what character/what anime they're from, but one look at my icon and it's not hard to guess. i only watch the anime, since my twin and friends have read the manga, so i'm like the test dummy and the only person who doesn't know what's going to happen (which i'm fine with--i think it's fun). the anime just introduced this character, but i've known about him for a while. he's immensely important in the manga and my twin told me about him because she knows how much i love people with wings (which he has). bad idea to tell me about him. i learned he's in some deep shit in the manga and people think he's going to die, which truly, genuinely terrifies me. let that sink it. i'm more upset over the fact that a bunch of lines resembling a person drawn by some dude in japan might die over my own grandmother. i almost had a panic attack over the thought of him dying. why the hell do i feel so much for a fictional character and so little for real-life people?also, here's the obligatory the-world's-gone-to-shit paragraph. i hate the world (how corny), i hate people, and i have no hope for us. take a guess at what country i'm in and maybe you'll see why i feel a little justified for at least these thoughts (here's a hint; guns). i don't care about the big bad you-know-what as much as i care about the absolute thick-headed idiots who either think it's fake or are proudly protesting it. i want them to die, and i suppose that makes me a bad person. i like watching those instant karma videos of assholes getting beat up or put in jail or crashing their car. and that goes for any of the dumbasses of the world. any asshole who's an asshole just because they can be. there's too many of them and not enough kind people. the world will not get better in my lifetime, and i don't care about the future as much because i like seeing results. i don't donate money to charity since i don't see the results--i'd rather be there handing out food or building a shelter for homeless people or whatever. the world sucks, it's not gonna get fixed anytime soon, and if i wasn't so goddamn scared of consequences i'd probably become a homeless alcoholic or druggy (i really do have very little self-control) once i move out, if i ever do. i have intense monophobia, which means i'm scared of being alone. funny, right? and by alone, i mean without someone i know. so i can't go out in public, or go to college, or live alone, which is something i really want. i'm going to get a service dog when i'm 17 for this (i don't need one now since i don't do shit and when i do my twin comes with me, but my doctor said my anxiety/monophobia qualifies as a disability). so it's kind of funny that i'm tethered to what i desperately want to get away from.i'll boil this whole post into a simple tl;dr. i'm a selfish, lazy, entitled, angry asshole who wants to use his mental illness as an excuse to be a piece of shit, and, while recognizing that i'm a horrible person, i don't want to put any effort in to change that and just want some magic swish of a wand to make it all better or else i'd rather do nothing but sit in this shit and fester. i don't want to die but don't want to live as i am now, so i'm stuck in a limbo of my own making with no desire to get out, crying to a bunch of internet strangers who, after reading this and maybe replying with some inane ""it gets better, you're not alone!"" bullshit that just goes in one ear out the other, will go about their day without truly caring because they don't even know so much as my name. you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped, right? that's the saying. so try telling me i'm not a hopeless case now. wave your wands, reddit. prove me wrong. or call out my blatant attempt at attention and pity and how stupid i am for complaining about my life but not be willing to change it. i don't know what i expect from this. words can't seem to reach me now. but hey, maybe one of you can surprise me.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/gimmod/how_do_i_even_begin_to_explain_how_much_of_a/,,How Do I Even Begin to Explain How Much of a Hopeless Case I am?
"my husband (33m) and i 28(f) bought a house 3 years ago with a down payment provided by mother (55f) with the intention of building her a wheelchair accessible back house and taking care of her for as long as possible (she has early dementia, ms, non mobile, and a history a small strokes) she was living with her 80 year old parents and it wasnt a good situation for anyone. it took us a year to build the back house and then a year of her stalling to move out here until i was 7 months pregnant with our first child then she pulled the trigger and finally moved out in december of 2018. fast forward to july 2019 i’m a new mom of 5 month old, exhausted from months of caring for her and a new baby. and while i’m at a drs appointment my husband finds her wheeling around the backyard naked, crying for help because of (later learned) a delirium caused by a uti. we realize that it is unsafe for her to live with us and be taking her own medications without 24 hour care (that we can not reasonably provide) and we hunt for her forever and find a super nice (but pricey) assisted living facility, that will take a 55f with me, with a dog, a lot of places wouldn’t take ms patients or someone as young as her. i finally slept good and felt relieved for the first time in years the first night she was there.anyway, she’s been in assisted living since july 2019 seems to really like it there, but it is expensive, she’s paying it out of her savings (dads life insurance) and we’re renting out her previous back house to at least cover 1,000 dollars of her expenses a month. but i just have this constant mix between extreme guilt, that we have this house because of her down payment and i failed her. and also this exhaustion again of being the only caregiver (family member?) trying to do anything. i’m pregnant with our second child and i just so badly wish i could be like any other young mom with doting grandparents that could watch the kids and who i could talk to, and instead i’m just a caregiver who is sometimes the enemy. i just don’t know how to feel anymore. besides constantly upset. i just got into a stupid pointless fight with her over the phone because she she doesn’t know she has memory problems (i mean of course she doesn’t) and thinks she’s in assisted living only because i couldn’t deal with or as punishment for her uti. i’m so sorry, i know no one will probably make it to the end of this. and maybe i am a horrible selfish person. but if you made it here thank you for reading and letting me get some of this out."," hi, i just wanted to reach out and say no, you are not selfish at all. i am the same age as you, and our situations were similar. i have moved home, to help my mum care for my father with ms and dementia. it is very very hard, and a specialised facility is truly sometimes the best option. as you no doubt know, both ms and dementia are very complex, and take a very high care load. if you ever need someone to talk to, hit me up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/gfo6o5/i_just_need_to_vent_if_thats_okay/,,I just need to vent if that’s okay
"i'm really glad i found this place. i haven't been able to find much in the way of irl support groups, and it's been a rough time.me: my dad has lewy body dementia (lbd). my mother (72) is his primary caregiver. she's physically ok but emotionally overwhelmed. i'm living there to take care of everything else while she focuses on dad, as well as to keep a close eye on the situation. i work full time, though, so can't keep an eye on things 24/7.the issue: my mother has news/talk radio on 24/7, and it's making dad crazy. what tends to happen is that, due to the lbd, dad will get confused about something he sees or hears and then form a delusion around it. the lbd has made him very anxious, so generally these delusions are upsetting. examples: a few weeks ago the news was covering tornadoes several states away but dad became convinced that they were talking about here, so he was pacing the house, wringing his hands, shaking, pulling us away from doors and windows, demanding we get into the basement, etc. a while before that he became convinced he was a whistleblower who was in trouble from the government for revealing state secrets and now they were coming after him and he had to go into hiding to protect us. just today he became convinced that some russian guy called bernie sanders hacked my parents' bank account and stole all their money and was coming after their house next, and i needed to call chuck schumer to get it back. and so on.it's pretty clear to me where these delusions are coming from. not only is it upsetting to see him get so upset, it honestly gets exhausting for the rest of us to deal with, since he gets really fixated and cannot be calmed or redirected once the delusion takes hold, and sometimes he'll obsess over them for days. i know that, due to the nature of the beast, i can't eliminate all of his confusion and anxiety. but i think it's reasonable to, having identified one source, eliminate that source.thing is, i have tried to get mom to see the connection and limit dad's news exposure (or at least wear headphones), but she won't. she says she needs to watch/listen to her shows to stay informed. i just don't know what to do short of blocking those sites, but if i do, she'll have a meltdown, and that'll upset dad, so i'm afraid i'll actually make the situation worse, not better.has anyone been here? what do i do?  what can i do?", im going to be honest. being a caregiver sucks. if listening to the news 24 7 makes its easier on her leave it be. you cant cater to bim while stepping on her toes. if its not the news his mind will latch on to something else. and he still going to have a fit. you cant fix everything. and you dont want resentment. let her win this one,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ge1np4/how_to_persuade_my_mother_to_limit_dads_news/,,How to persuade my mother to limit dad's news consumption?
"hi. i used to work for a family who had two kids, an autistic toddler and maybe daughter, and a young bedridden father with good humor. i also did housekeeping. i was 18 with no education and it really opened my eyes to a new environment i was not used to. i worked for them for 6 months until the son was sent to a special needs program and the mother was done with school. it was fun, stressful but i did enjoy the company of the kids and parents, kept busy, and was pretty happy. i cleaned, bathed, and fed everybody. i was woefully underpaid.                   ————————————————————————-in february (i’m 19) i picked up (my current) job doing part-time home healthcare for a lady with parkinson’s syndrome. plan was i come, clean a bit, make food and company. the other  hha that comes at night was having a lot of health issues (during the start of the pandemic) and her husband suddenly asks me if i want to work full-time. i say yes. why did i say yes? —————————————————————————i’m the caveat in this story, i realize now this is a very emotionally taxing job built for the certain few (not me). i should’ve just stick to babysitting. she can walk, with a cane and can mumble words. i come in and clean the house, give company, showers, etc... she then starts asking me to clean the pool, pull out weeds, and help her sneakily throw away her family’s belongings (i refuse). being older now i do not want to do more than my job for the pay i am getting! the pool does not work but i’ve been cleaning it everyday just so i can be outside of the house. i’ve grown very resentful of her.  it is so depressing here compared to the other family, i feel more stressed at nothing and lonely and i don’t know how to communicate properly to her, she doesn’t take “no” for an answer. —————————————————————————i stopped taking care of myself (i am prone to depression). i carry no hope here. i try to understand where she is in life and see where she is coming from. her mother had dementia and is dead.                                                                                  im sure i’m here as a placeholder because obviously the husband knows i don’t have the education or experience or character for this. i can’t help feeling like a fraud. i informed him of my leave date mid-may and have a retail interview scheduled later this week. —————————————————————————now i am just stuck in the present. thank you for reading my story, i know most of you have had to deal with your situation for much longer if not harder with actual family members but i really really really needed to write this out. my dream is to be a better, un self-centered person and i can’t do that here. i’m simply going crazy. toodles"," you sound like a wonderful person. so not a fraud, but honestly accept that you have gotten in over your head. not a thing wrong with taking a step back, and realize it is time to do something else.i'm not sure what country you are in, perhaps uk or usa?in the usa we have [parkinson.org](  in the uk is [ for the usa the ""[aware in care kit]( is a wonderful help for those times we need to go to an er or hospital. very least make sure she keeps all her medications in a clear ziplock bag in the original pharmacy bottles.

"👋 hi. first time posting. i will try to make this easy to digest.... but it might just be a long vent. im sorry and i will delete this if it is against guidelines. i am 30, female, ft student, ft work. i live a half hour from my 87 year old grandmother, and my drunk/drug addict/hoarder uncle who lives in her basement.the rest of the family (her actual children) live out of state. they have written her off because she won’t kick out the drunk filthy/dangerous uncle. my father has medical poa. he is out of state and busy running his business.my aunt has financial poa. she is also of state, comes 1-3 times a year for a day or two, and won’t relinquish any financial information. i have been taking care of my grandmother for over a year. i have pleaded for help and they have all ignored me, belittled me, and derided me. my grandmother has been showing increasing signs of dementia for years, no one will believe me. she’s also deaf and now fully incontinent. i have had to drive to her house in the middle of the night multiple times to call ambulances because the drunk uncle called me to inform me she was “lookin real bad” —to which i have recently found her suffocating in her bed, covered in her own feces.there have been so many specialists. it’s one thing after the other. i had her cataracts removed. then she developed a tooth abscess and didn’t tell me until it progressed to sepsis. then the uti’s because she didn’t tell me she wasn’t cleaning herself anymore. then all the cardiologist appointments. getting meds right. she won’t take her meds on time. she won’t use an alarm clock. she won’t get up and move. she won’t wear clean clothes. i often find her with food mess on her face. she has false memories. and will often refuse to answer you when you challenge her in direct conversation. or she will change the subject. or she will just tell you she is confused when you try to ask her serious questions. she’ll say really weird things out of nowhere when you spend enough time with her. i mean— weird. for instance, out of nowhere she informed me “yeah, she just thought i was god,” and after she went on for a while i finally realized she was talking about an old hairdresser of hers from 30 years ago- completely unprompted. however otherwise— she can appear very, very sharp. she’ll make conversation about current events. make jokes, seem jovial and enthusiastic. and she also lies. she lies about everything. she will cough for 3 minutes and then tell you she doesn’t have a cough. she labors for breath between sentences, then tells you she breathes fine. she lies about cleaning herself or feeling well. she fools everyone into thinking she’s “doing great!”i think she has early onset dementia. i think she presents with full personal neglect. i think she needs full time care.my family is fighting me on this. they refuse to visit her and have not taken her to a single doctors appointment or er trip in the past two years, only me. yet they tell me she is of sound kind and if this is the way she wants to live, so be it. they say i am too emotionally invested.i disagree. these are my values and my morals making me act. i want her in full time care. i want someone to wash her so she doesn’t die in her bed, covered in filth. i want someone to feed her and give her medications at the right times. i threatened to call adult protective services if changes were not made by those wielding the ability (poas). my family has stopped all communication with me, (and i them) except for my father, who is now working to get her home cleaned out, my uncle evicted, and to get her a 24/hr nurse or into assisted living. i think he may only doing this because if i call adult protective services, he is the one on the hook. but whatever. at least he’s finally doing something.i cried all day yesterday after my uncle called me a pest. but i refuse to believe that trying to get my grandmother into any semblance of humane conditions is wrong. and she has plenty of money in retirement and investments— it’s not a money issue. i’m pretty exhausted. i don’t even know why i’m writing this. i’ve just felt so alone for a long time. and now i have cut ties with all family members who refuse to help me get her care. it’s draining in a way i can’t word.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/g9y2p4/family_fallout/,,Family fallout

"hi everyone,i'm brand new here, and honestly haven't even had time to read any of the other posts just yet, but you were the first subreddit that came up when i typed in carer support, so i'm really hoping that this is the right place.i'm really struggling just now. i'm very new to caring for someone and i just need to vent for a little bit. thank you to anyone who reads through this.my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago but managed to live on her own with the support of her three local adult children. my family had moved to a different country when i was a child. the family had decided that she was no longer coping on her own, and decided it was time to move her to a nursing home just before covid struck, but this clearly was no longer an option. as my university course became remote-learning and i had a little of the theoretical knowledge of how to cope with patients with advanced dementia (i am studying medicine), the best idea seemed to be for me to move in with my grandmother and become her full-time carer. this also allowed for fewer people to be in and out of her house all day, reducing her risk for coronavirus. i have now been living with her for the past two weeks.i love my grandmother to pieces, and we were always incredibly close. i am her eldest grandchild and i have frequently stayed with her for long periods before. i know that right now she is scared and confused. we had spoken years ago about how the one thing she feared in life was losing her memory (long before her dementia started) and now her worst fear is coming true. i want to be there for her and i want to be able to help her to stay in her own home and as independant as possible, but right now i'm finding it difficult. when at university, i live a fairly typical student life. i'm probably a little more restrained than your average student (no wild parties or frequent flings), but i'm not always the neatest and probably live off slightly too much ramen. having said that i am a fairly good cook when i want to be, and given my grandmother will insist she isn't hungry unless you put food in front of her and eat alongside her, i've been much more regimented with making sure i'm cooking two or three varied meals a day.

"hi, i want to apologize for the wall of text but i truly am lost, i am drowning and struggling to keep my head above water. (trigger warning for death.)i grew up with my grandparents, they took me in as a newborn because my mother didn't care to take care of me/was responsible enough to take care of me. they were in their 50s by then. growing up was fine and things were easy until my grandpa got a blood cancer diagnosis in 2011. it was manageable since he was in his 60s by then; i was still in high school but this is when i started taking my first steps into caretaking. i had to watch out for temperature spikes, i had to watch out for signs of pneumonia, blood clots, and other general things the more his disease progressed. in 2017, things took a turn for the worst and his health decreased more and more. 2018, i was officially in full caretaker mode; i didn't go back to school to finish the handful of credits i had left, i left the comfortable job i had there in order to be there to make sure he was okay which i never minded. my grandpa and i were closer than anyone in my family, so i felt like it was only right that i do this for him. in october 2018, i went on a short trip out of town without knowing how unwell my grandpa was, and he told me i should go, even though i desperately wanted to stay. but i bought the plane tickets and the person i was going to see in not so many words didn't want me to cancel the trip. four days into my trip, my grandpa went to the hospital and died of kidney failure as a result of his cancer. i feel guilt over this every day and it's hard to forgive myself; what do you do when a seemingly routine hospitalization turns into the last time you'll see them? this is where my grandma comes in. we've never been close, and she's been mildly abusive to me my entire life (verbal, emotional and sometimes physical) but the death of my grandpa made me feel as if i needed to reconcile and put the past behind us in order to make sure she was okay. she's turning 80 this december, and while i love her things have gotten exceptionally hard, even harder than it was dealing with my grandpa's frequent hospitalizations and incontinence. she went into the hospital august 2019 very sick, and i didn't know with exactly what until the doctors told us she needed to have emergency gallbladder removal. after her surgery, they moved her to physical therapy rehab to help her regain her movement since she was in a hospital bed for almost a month. it's at the rehab/long term care facility that the doctors told me she's in the early stages of dementia.while in the rehab, i tried to help the doctors and physical therapists with making sure she did the exercises (physical and mental) that she was supposed to be doing; but if she wasn't ignoring and yelling at the doctors, she was ignoring and yelling at me and it reminds me too much of my childhood. they wanted to send home help in the form of weekly physical therapists and cognitive therapy and medication except once she was home, she yelled and ignored them to the point they stopped coming with no notice all together. i felt too guilty after that to make her take the pills; i regret this, because maybe things would've been better. so now, it's just me taking care of things like cooking her meals, making sure her medicines and doctor's appointments are tended to, making sure she's keeping herself busy instead of staring at the television except she still fights me. she refuses to eat when she's upset with something i've said, she doesn't sleep normal hours, she won't let me ask the other family for help because it's gotten to the point where my health is finally plummeting. i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was 11, and living with her without my grandpa around to talk to has made my mental health worse. i can't see a therapist or make appointments for my health as often as i'd like because she has separation anxiety when i'm gone, and i can't talk to her about how i'm feeling because she takes it as personal attacks, calls me crazy or sometimes downright turns her head away from me in an obvious show of ignoring me. we argue more and more until it's gotten to the point i can barely get out of bed for fear of what she'll say that day to make me feel terrible or to make me cry, but it's the guilt of my grandpa and knowing he'd want me to take care of her that keeps me here. i feel guilty that i don't want to do this. i'm 24, i was only two years into my degree and now i'm not sure if i can even go back because i've forgotten almost everything in the midst of death and grief. i don't have any friends, and the only people i can talk to are people on twitter but. no one wants to hear about something so depressing all the time so i slap on a mask and pretend i am coping but i'm not. i haven't felt this unwell since depression first stepped into my life and not since my first suicide attempt (that my grandma initiated). i have two aunts, a mother and even an adult cousin that all have more resources than me except they're the ones taking trips, going to work and living their lives without any regards to us. they only call her to make sure she's not dead, they never call me. i've never gotten along with them either, except for one of my aunts but it still feels so unfair that this is all my responsibility. i hate the bitterness i feel, because you're supposed to do this for family, right? except i feel like a shadow of myself, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't recognize myself anymore. i don't feel pretty anymore, i don't feel like i have worth anymore. and it's hard trying to take care of someone else when it feels like they hate you every single day but cry and say they need you when you want just an inch of space. i'm not sure what to do anymore. i need help but we don't have the income for home help i don't think. any advice would desperately be appreciated because i feel like i'm failing her and my grandpa, and myself. thank you to anyone listening, not many do lately.", danghey tell your family she's their grandma too they fucking better step upguilt them into ityou did right by your grandpa you were present as much as possiblenowwwww it's a bit much. got to get a caregiver to hang out sometimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fh5i36/taking_care_of_my_grandparents_fell_on_my/,,"taking care of my grandparents fell on my shoulders, except i'm getting crushed under the weight of loss and grief."

"whining and crying with frustration and self pity just drives me insane! i can take the middle of night diaper changes, bathing and feeding, medication management and frequent doctors' appointments, cooking and cleaning and laundry, whatever whatever whatever... but please! don't fill my ears with whining and crying!mom is usually so easy to take care of. she is generally cheerful and cooperative and pleasant to be around. but, every now and again she will get a uti, get very weak and her dementia kicks in, then she gets so frustrated that she can't feed herself, toilet herself, get up from her chair without help, and the crying and self pity begin. i remind her ""mom, you have an infection, you are on antibiotics now, you should feel better in about 2 days. this has happened many times before."" that helps for a bit, but then the crying, and to top it off it drives me so nuts i lose my temper (tell her to ""stop it!"" in a firm voice and walk off) and i feel so guilty :(.i know this isn't that bad, i should forgive myself, we all have triggers. but i snap at mom for crying when she is frustrated and i feel like a little shit.any advice? i know we all have triggers... how do you keep from reacting?"," well, i found a solution last night. i am not sure it is the best answer, but it is the best that i have found so far. since others confront the same issue, i am sharing in case it is something useful to you.mom's crying reminded me of when my kids had temper tantrums: born of legitimate frustration, perfectly understandable, and sets me on edge. when the kids were little and tantrumed, i didn't judge or shame them, but didn't give them attention or energy and removed myself from them as much as possible until they played out. so i thought i would try the same, see if it would help.when mom called me to help her to the bathroom with a voice full of whines and tears, i quickly came and in a kind and even voice i told her she was having a hard time, so rather than struggle with the bathroom i  would help her into bed and change her. she wasn't too keen on the idea, but since i change her once or twice a night when she needs it she was familiar with it, and knew it required minimal effort on her part. she let me help her onto the bed, urinated into her depends, then i changed her quickly and with no fuss. i then told her to rest while i got her dinner.when i came in with her dinner, rather than her sitting in her chair with her table in front of her, i kept her in bed and i hand fed her where she had no struggles and no reason to fall into frustration. after a few minutes she asked if she could get up and feed herself, and i told her she could if she thought she could do so without having so much trouble she cries. she agreed, and when she was seated with her food in front of her she calmly, slowly (and somewhat messily) fed herself. i sat near her and kept her company and helped her with anything she needed.a little later she apologised for giving me ""so much trouble"", and i told her i loved her and i was happy to help her, always, with whatever she needs.so, yeah, brought back the methods i used to raise my kids (who are now outstanding citizens, btw). i don't like treating mom like a kid, but it worked, was still full of love, so i guess it is the best that i have, so far. putting it out there, in case somebody else can benefit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f7n35d/cant_take_the_crying/,,Can't take the crying

"i graduated my bsn with a minor in gerontology in december 2018. i have had my cna for over 7 years by that point that i figured i should just study for my nclex in the coming months. living in the bay area in ca became too expensive i had to move back in with my folks in the greater la area. health issues flared again and money ran out, so of course my procrastination kicked in. i had to pick up another cna job. no hospital would hire me despite all my experience!! maybe my recent degree scared them as i would only be there for short period of time. so nursing facility it is... but then the cna license expired last summer. only other jobs available were home health. took the first one... woman running the agency said “oh she’s a sweet lady but has vascular dementia and alzheimer’s with recent stroke in june 2019 but is in a outpatient rehab recovering but she’s a catholic nun that’s starting to hit.” nothing against them. their community has been great. long story short new blood clots formed in her legs and she stopped being able to walk, so now she’s home hospice and bed bound now. this was back in august 2019.i am still here. i was working 12 hour shifts with her 3-4 day’s a week with her but her aggression and agitation was just becoming so bad i hated going to work. i burned out. i now just so 6 hour shifts a couple of times a week. my first cna job was hospice but at least we kept our residents comfortable. they don’t do anything for this poor woman. tylenol that’s it for her pain! she’s got severe arthritis/inflammation in her knees you can feel the warmth radiate when your hand just hovers over her. she screams every time i reposition her (no pressure ulcers yet. she still eats 3 meals a day with my help).i don’t take things personal. i worked in a major county general hospital ed with an interesting population and was told every degrading word in the book. she tells me to go to hell and shut up all the time. she tells me she’s going to kill herself and she wants my foot to kick her in the head. and she tells me she’s in pain her legs and back hurts. i tell her “main” nun/sister all this stuff but she says “oh that’s just part of the disease.” ummm no shit? i went to nursing school and worked in multiple units of a hospital... i know what i’m working with but just because she can’t tell you doesn’t mean she isn’t in pain. she grimaces all the time and she’s been literally laying in bed since august so i have no doubt she is very sore and in pain. the pressure on her pelvis and back must be so terrible. i do rom often but she is soooo stiff. i have yet to see the doctor come to do an assessment on her. only an lvn comes out. i voiced my concerns but he doesn’t listen. i reminded him 3 times to get me dicloflenac gel for her arthritic knee. she is prescribed 1mg xanax but of course the nun in control of her medication cuts in half so she doesn’t get her full dose. she claims it works for her but i’m the one with her most of the day and i’m the one that gets the lashing all day by this poor frustrated catholic nun. i need to get my nclex asap so i get out of this place but it’s just so hard to watch this lady essentially suffer. i’ve worked in a phenomenal hospice/palliative care facility and i feel we are failing at providing comfort to this women. i come home so agitated and helpless. i’m in no mood to study. the agitation, restlessness, loud vocalizations is just getting worse and the nuns that live in the house with her just close the doors. she apparently had a possible small tonic clonic seizure before my shift started this morning but i do see any signs of post ictal or high bp. though i know she’s very risk for it. sorry for the long post. i actually go on and on! i’ve been trying to watch teepa snow’s videos for some more resources.", why don't you take the test already??????,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f2xels/so_overwhelmed_with_my_11_demented_nun/,,So overwhelmed with my 1:1 Demented Nun
"i want to start this off by introducing myself and explaining my situation.i have been a caregiver for members of my family since i was 20? or so years old.it started with my grandma, then both of my grandparents until my grandfather died. i went on to help my grandma until she was eventually placed in a home where she currently resides. they both have/had severe alzheimers/dementia and my grandma is a diabetic. i would cook, clean, and administer meds for them both. because of my experience with this, it was naturally expected of me to be there to help my mom adjust to taking care of my dad after his 3rd stroke. his first was in 2015 and his third and final was in march of 2016.i had been living with a friend for the past year and would occasionally visit my parents. up until the 3rd stroke, they were doing great on their own and they actually had a healthy dynamic. now some backstory: my parents have an extremely toxic relationship. my mom was a lifelong alcoholic until last year (explain later in post) and my dad was almost never home while i grew up. i am the oldest of 4, 3 girls and 1 boy as the youngest. i was expected to take on many responsibilities from an early age because of my mom's alcoholism. i constantly got into verbal fights with my mom while trying to defend myself. i would get in trouble for stuff my siblings did, i would fight back about how unfair it was that my youngest brother and sister were never made to do chores or clean. this affects their adult lives, with my brother only learning how to do basic things from his gf and my sister turning into an unchecked ego. ithere was a lot of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse that happened pretty much my entire life. my parents constantly fought and would refuse to divorce because they wanted to stick together for my brother. long story short about my brother: he is the christ child and can do no wrong. they worship him. standard sexism in the family unit stuff. my mom would bend over backwards to make sure my dad and brother got everything they ever wanted, while myself and my closest sister were treated like the help. i was the only one that was ever hit and anytime i did something that upset my dad, he would spank me and blame the pain on me, saying stuff like this hurts me more than it does you. i would get my behind shredded for making a b in 3rd grade. stuff like that. the one time i told a teacher about it, she contacted my parents and told them everything. i was having trouble sitting at school because my dad had beat my behind the night before for not cleaning my room in a timely manner.anyways, i will move on to the current situation. a few months after i moved back in with my parents to help out, my mom broke her back. burst fracture if her l1. turns out if you have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis, and you drink heavily every day for 30 years, you make your bones so brittle that a sneeze could break your ribs.who knew right?so i was suddenly not just helping, i was taking care of both of them.now keep in mind the emotional abuse i had experienced in the past.my dad's emotional filter in his brain was basically destroyed. he lost his left side to paralysis. he would verbally lash out at me and my mom for little shit and on a few occasions he tried to hit us with his cane.he could have actually killed my mom if he had hit her but thankfully that did not happen.fast forward to now. i have become their full time caretaker and take care of literally everything.i could go on and on about all the shit that has happened in the last 4 years but this post is already too long. now i am completely burnt out. i can't be around my dad without being triggered violently and i have to stop myself from blowing up. my mom is a narcissistic guilt trip master and i literally cannot leave the house unless it's to take them to doc appts or to buy groceries. the few and far between times that i can leave the house, they both guilt me and make me feel terrible and treat me like a child. i'm gonna be 30 this year. i have no life. i have one friend. i almost never leave the house. we are living off of my dad's social security disability check which isn't enough to actually survive on. my mom is waiting to get on disability but they are taking their dear sweet time. we haven't paid rent in the last 2 months because if we did wouldn't have any money for food or for medicine and that's a whole other bag of dicks right there. both of their meds together cost roughly 800 a month. and that's even with my dad now being on humana and medicare.i don't know what to do. i desperately want to escape and get on with my life. literally everyone i talk to tells me to get out and i know i need to.but here's the thing...i would feel so guilty, despite everything. i would feel like i'm abandoning them. i have tried to reach out for help. nothing is working.both of my parents are technically capable of taking care of some things themselves but they won't do it and when i try to explain how it would help me greatly, it turns into a ""you're so ungrateful and selfish"" argument.i have to make phone calls for them that they could make themselves. fill out paperwork they could do themselves. i even have to talk to their docs for them because if i didn't, they wouldn't care and wouldn't advocate for themselves. there is an extremely unhealthy attachment going on here and i just wanna hear from anyone who is or has experienced something similar. i just need help. i am so fucking tired and i'm scared that i will send myself into a cardiac episode or worse because i'm under so much constant stress. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'm sorry if i have posted in the wrong area.

"so just a very broad question/ discussion about end of life legal issues between doctors and hospice. fil has battled alzheimers for at least 12yrs. it was definitely taking it's toll, but his body seemed to be doing ok. the brain, not so much. his quality of life was going downhill fairly rapidly, but was still able to get around with minimal physical help. he began getting infections, and had a couple hospital visits to address them. long story short, his long term family doctor was sure he was septic, and that anything else they could do would only prolong his life, but the quality of it would be terrible. he suggested that he be admitted to hospice care, just to keep him comfortable. we kinda scratched our heads a bit, as he was still responsive, and didn't appear to be in physical duress. we asked an attending dr. what they would do if it was their dad, and they said hospice. now, we all agreed that this was the place where he would have ended up sooner, rather than later, but under the hospice meds, he couldn't /wouldn't eat or drink hardly anything. after about a week, he was struggling breathing, so his dr instructed the hospice nurse to give him meds every 30 min(!), she had never had that instruction before, but she carried it out. within 6hrs, he passed. nobody could find the dr to have him sign off on the cause of death, and it appears that he is out of the country. now we get word today that the county coroner didn't accept the listed cause of death! like wtf?! so i was just curious what anyone here knows about it."," what was the cause of death provided by the hospice staff physician? terms like “cardiac arrest” are often listed by hospital and er physicians but in the forensic community these are not acceptable causes of death - rather they are terminal events that happen to everyone when they die.it is up to the discretion of the coroner or medical examiner (depending on which state you live in) to determine whether an autopsy is needed and what the cause of death is. if it is straight forward as the hospice physician claims, then the coroner should review medical records and the cause of death would be something along the lines of “sepsis due to complications of alzheimer’s disease”. typically an autopsy would not be performed in this case, given that the decedent was in medical care with a known medical diagnosis before death.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f2e3hy/coroner_wont_accept_cause_of_death_that_was/,,Coroner won't accept cause of death that was listed by hospice for FIL.

"hello all. it’s been an exhausting 24 hours. my little brother (23), fiancé (m25), and i (f25) have been taking care of our paternal grandparents for the last two years. our dad and aunt have been pretty absent until recently only because i forced my father to take poa within the last few months. my pop (grandfather) has been fragile my entire life. he was a coal miner but was sent all over the world to look at mining machinery and make diagnoses. he’s truly brilliant and gifted and never had any education past his ged. unfortunately the men in my family have horrible heart problems. great grandfather passed in the middle of meeting from a massive heart attack at 65. my pop (his son) is 82 so he’s done great (but has had open hearts surgery and so many other procedures, my dad has had a heart attack but refuses to go to the doctor anymore). two years ago my fiancé and i bought my grandparents home and moved them in next door (handicap accessible) so they could maintain their freedom a little longer. pop quickly deteriorated and we’ve become regulars at the er, hospital, and nursing home. we’ve only had pop home for 2 weeks at a time before he was back in the hospital and then to the nursing home for 90 days over the last two years. my mim (grandmother) has dementia but won’t seek treatment and has put so much stress on him. we all love her so much but she is a bully to pop at no fault of her own. it’s an ugly disease. she’s extremely manipulative and we’ve begged for help but have gotten nothing. she went as far as threatening to kill herself and slapped a paramedic when pop had fallen and amr was called to the home in the middle of the night. she blamed me many times and sometimes it felt like she didn’t see me as a granddaughter. she would scream at me for no reason and would think i was a home nurse at times. i know it’s not her but it still tears my heart up. pop has had to call the cops on her when he was home because she could be so mean. my blood pressure had gotten so high i was in stage 2 hypertension. yesterday i was heading out the door for work when i received a call from my dad that i needed to get to the hospital. pop coded 2 times and his heart had stopped beating for 15 mins. it took over an hour for the team to get him stable and then an eternity to get to see him. he was strapped down. had to tubes everywhere. blood everywhere (port put in his neck) ice cold, and green in color. his heart and kidney functioning are down to 10%. he’s lived the last year at 17% heart and 23% kidney. my little brother and i talked to him. held his hand. and tried to comfort him . i don’t know if he could hear us but we wanted him to know we were there. his body twitched a lot but i want to think it was him squeezing my hand to let me know he’s there too. this week we found out my little brother has 45% heart functioning and his valves are letting blood in and out. he’s been having problems the last year and finally switched doctors and within a week had some answers and a referral to a cardiologist. my brother told pop that he got his results back and that his heart looked good and he’s healthy as can be. we don’t want him to worry.   i just want to hear his voice again and tell me “everything is alright, kiddo”. my cousins (aunts children) haven’t even bothered to see or call our grandparents in the last few years. they’re 27, 30, and 34 years old. i couldn’t sleep last night so i browsed social media to keep my mind busy. all three cousins have been posting pictures and talking about all their memories on the farm and doing things with our grandparents that they never did. it enrages me. it’s silly to let it bother me but it breaks my heart for my mim and pop that they haven’t been around (they all live local too). the 27 year old is also diabetic and called pop a few years ago asking for a bottle of insulin. my pop didn’t even recognize his voice or know which grandson was calling. cousin didn’t even stay and visit when he came to get the insulin! his baby momma and 5 kids stayed in the car so he ran in and ran out. i know it’s their loss and they will have to deal with this own conscious but i can’t stand that they pretend to be involved. we begged for help and everyone was always conveniently “busy”. this has turned into such a long post and if you’re here with me to the end. i thank you. it means more than i can even express. my heart is so broken and i’m so lost. my wedding is in 2 months and my number 1 fan won’t be able to see it. i’ve dealt with loss before (friend committed suicide right after high school) but i’ve never watched someone deteriorate in front of me. i know i will get through this but it seems impossible right now. i would give anything to have one more talk with him."," i don’t normally respond because these are always so heartbreaking and i never feel like i have the right words to help.  i usually come to this sub to feel less alone.  but this one hit home for me. i’m in the same place with some cousins and family, but they’re out of state and i’m the only grandchild helping.  it’s super tough.  we lost my grandpa almost two years ago and they visited to claim dibs on his stuff (and my grandma’s stuff, even though she’s very much still alive).  your grandpa hears you, and he knows you love him!you and your brother and fiancé sound like fantastic people!  wish i had better advice other than that i think you’ll feel at peace with your choices where your family might feel regret someday in the future.  stay off social media (reddit excluded, of course).  that is what helps me.  it hurts when you feel like you’re just starting your life but you have so many responsibilities that none of your friends or family will understand.  seeing people doing fun stuff on facebook sometimes can be a bummer (although people only share the good stuff—we can never see what their lives are actually like).  it’s probably difficult, but take time for yourself when at all possible.  go on a coffee date with your fiancé.  i love wandering every aisle in the supermarket.wishing you all the good things, and hope your brother gets better news (my dad just got his second valve replacement—they’ve made a lot of advances in cardiac surgery so hopefully your brother can get the best and easiest treatments).  hang in there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/etau73/my_pop_is_on_life_support/,,My Pop is on life support.

"hello fellow carers! throwing out a request for some advice/thoughts on making decisions about my father’s future. i am currently living with and caring for my father, who has parkinson’s dementia alongside other health issues. my mother died recently and i am now the sole carer and decider for the household (alongside my brother who lives overseas). dad’s house is currently a small house with bedroom, bathroom and sitting room on the ground floor level (all upside down and round-about) , with the kitchen and his current bedroom+bathroom downstairs in the basement. my parents always planned that he would someday move up to the ground floor bedroom and still have access to the sitting room and obviously the front door and outside! we have also been wondering about the possibility of moving. ideally to a bungalow (one level house) or an apartment, so that unlike in the first scenario, he could have access to the kitchen. first scenario is most definitely the simpler option. it would just involve some furniture moving and buying, with a little bit of possibly muddle-dum from dad being in a new room. (his dementia is relatively early, although getting worse by the month and he is very confused). the stairs are for sure getting scarier for him. thankfully i am here 24/7 and do all cooking, so really, him not being able to reach the kitchen is not a big tragedy for now and certainly not as his condition will certainly progress. also thought about getting a stairlift, but unsure how long he might be able to use even that and if it’s worth it.second scenario-move to bungalow or flat-possibly dad’s ‘old age dream’, but frankly one that should have been put into practice a few years back. alas they did try but found the prices were beyond their reach. there do seem to be a few available now, but in some not so nice areas that he doesn’t really know. and similarly with apartments. (he is also very fussy about noisy neighbours but beggars can’t be choosers hey!) moving would for sure give him the access to all rooms that may not be possible here. but i guess it’s quite obvious...i have my worries.-could he cope with a move...physically, mentally, financially-are we laying out huge stress, to put off the inevitable (going into care)-to afford what he’d really want, it would have to be in an unknown area (and so possible disorientation) and that is not so ‘safe’apologies for long waffling. just wondering if anyone has any experience with similar situations and any thoughts."," what about setting up a small kitchen on the ground level floor. small fridge, microwave, sink. this will give him a bathroom, shower (tubs are not good due to falls), living area and kitchen.  this allows a caregiver to use stairs and ""say hi"" as they come and go (he has his bedroom for privacy/sleeping).  the biggest concern is ""if he fell and couldn't reach a phone"" how long before someone discovers him?  i was out changing the oil in my truck and couldn't get off the garage floor for four hours. thankfully my son stopped by and helped me up, but i didn't fess up about how long i had been on the floor. since starting my boxing works outs i can not get up off the floor by myself (we have to practice on getting up without using our arms in class, harder than it sounds)dementia, by definition, means we forget thigs. pdd (parkinson's disease with dementia) is different than alzheimer's - so be specific with medical personal that as treatment/drugs are different.  with alzheimer's a friend's dad forgot how to stand, he would fall on the floor. so a much higher level of care. with pdd we have balance/stability issues but remember how to use a walker to navigate the flat. i'm 36 years into parkinson's. it started when i was 25, at 61 still active. my boxing classes (for parkinson's) help with keeping me active both physically and mentally.  my memory is not good, fine during the day but i don't drive at night. critical is reducing his stress and for him to get a good night's sleep./r/parkinsons for those with and family and friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/erk4w2/should_my_father_move_house_or_stay_put/,,Should my father move house or stay put?
"i am 34 and have been the sole caregiver for my 75-year old grandmother for 4.5 years now. it has taken a serious toll on my mental and physical health, as well as the relationships with others i love. she has a myriad of health conditions i have to manage and it's hard to have a life working full time, managing her caregivers, and taking care of her during most of my 'free' time. i have felt my resentment towards her growing over time and although i know i love her or i wouldn't still be taking care of her, i often feel seriously resentful of her and find it hard to be nurturing, patient, or affectionate with her. everything about her annoys me, especially with her progression of dementia. i come home to only her after work each day and she can't carry on a regular conversation and is often confused. i feel like such a shitty person and i just want to explode some days. i have had serious depression and am getting treatment now and have found an outlet in exercise recently. i just don't know how to love her again in a genuine way when i just feel so much resentment that she took poor care of herself and i've had to give up a big chunk of my youth and deal with chronic stress of managing her care. i don't get enough respite and honestly we can't afford much more than what i currently get, as we are now on almost year 3 of waiting for her va benefits to come through. if we don't get that money in the next 10 months i will have no money left for care. i just don't know what to do. no one in my life understands what this is like and i am so very lonely and depressed every single day. i don't want to be this person, but i don't know what to do.", get her on medicaid and talk to a social worker and get her in a nursing home. i think this is the most logical move.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/efs59k/how_to_deal_with_caregiving_resentment/,,How to deal with caregiving resentment

"normally i’m very practical and task-focused and empathetic. i need to vent for a second. my dad was always a fucking weirdo thanks to bipolar and whatever brain damage he got from driving like a guy with bipolar, he made my life difficult from the beginning, i am certain my anxiety issues stem from his stupid illness, because of his eccentricities and absolutely embarrassing behaviour and now he’s got dementia, and he’s ruining this part of my life too. my entire family was damaged by his stupid sickness in one way or another normally i’m the one with the patience to cope with him but today, just ducking no, today, if he were bad enough to be accepted into a home i’d sign him up in a second as it is he’s not for the home yet, but he doesn’t have the capacity to attend the activities at the senior centre because he wouldn’t remember that they exist and certainly couldn’t get there on his own and for me to navigate him there by bus would involve literally, literally 20 phone calls, it would have to be my jobso as much as he’d probably benefit from line dancing and choir, he’s not going to. instead he’s the weirdo on the bus, all day, different busses the information staff at the bus terminal call him a regular, apparently our conversations are the same six questions every two minutes, they’re all about how he’d sure like to see my mom, who divorced him 20+ years ago and how he’d love to live with my brothers, who can’t stand him i’m going back home for the day and i am so, so happy to leave him i’m sorry he’s lonely but he’s impossible"," keep letting him ride the bus.  they know him and will watch out for him, call the proper authorities in an emergency.  perhaps get him a  dog tag necklace with your information in it.  does he qualify for a government cellphone plan?  good luck to you and don't feel guilty",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ed1q6h/vent/,,Vent

"this will be our first christmas with dad since he was diagnosed with dementia, and he is quickly losing his memories and grip on reality. he also has parkinson's, so using his hands and walking are becoming difficult for him. i'd like gift recommendations to help keep him comfortable and/or help with his memory.his interests before dementia: cars in general, star wars, sci-fi shows and movies, the band ac/dc, playing pool and cards, and the army. but over the past 6 months, he hasn't shown the ability to enjoy or interact with these things. he mostly stays lost in his mind. any advice would be appreciated."," pdd (parkinson's disease with dementia) or lewy body dementia (dementia starts before signs of parkinson's) are very similar.   the first year of diagnosis is the worst as you mentally and physically shut down with ""oh, i've been diagnosed with....""the best gift you can give someone with parkinson's is a ""parkinson's boxing class"" membership and go with them. we don't hit each other but work out in class. i was thinking it wasn't for me but kept showing back up. the more i worked out, the better i slept, the better i felt.  huge difference.i was trying to find a neurologist presentation where she talks about dementia.   we get scared by the word, but it is more executive planning. we may have been great at juggling a dozen things, but these days we are just doing three. memory does slip, but there are helps for that (i keep all appointments/to do on my computer and print out the night before. my screw up was pulmonary appt being the day after i have surgery, so got it to see my lung doc the week before surgery).",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/e7ha54/gift_ideas_for_someone_with_dementia/,,Gift ideas for someone with dementia?
"i had about three years living away from my mother. i was still 5 minutes away but i was still technically in my own apartment with only my beautiful fiancé. three years of being a normal young woman. since i was 15 years old it has been something. one surgery or procedure on top of another to fix my mom, grandmother with alzheimer’s moving in, my mom deciding it would be a good idea to leave my dad and move across country.the only times of the day or week that i wasn’t running errands for my mom or helping her take care of my grandmother were when i had to go to my menial retail job or my classes at community college. i missed a lot of work and skipped a lot of classes trying to be a normal 20 yo for a minute.by some miracle i found a wonderful boyfriend and he had to tell me that too much was being asked of me. i couldn’t even see it for myself. being my moms only support system and full time lackey was normal to me. the fact that she agreed to take care of her mother through her long and shitty (literally) journey with alzheimer’s but was offloading a portion of that burden on me without ever fucking asking never occurred to me. i was a dutiful daughter. don’t even ask me how long it took her to hire some fucking help for us-too long. yes, there was money available.so my grandmothers suffering finally ends when i am 24 and my boyfriend moves in about a year later to help my mom pay the bills because she is basically house poor until she can sell the house. he phrased it like she was doing us a favor. i wanted to leave like i wanted to leave since i was 19 but i couldn’t. she had no one, my brother was a a teenager and my sister...well. it’s always been different for me. in their defense it is always me she asks. when my brother was old enough and made enough money (barely) to move and she started trying to convince him that he needed to stay because he couldn’t really afford to go, it would be mutually beneficial to stay, he needed to focus on school etc., i told him to get the fuck out.when she sold the house a little over three years ago i finally got the fuck out.but then more things started going wrong with her heath. hospital, surgery, recovery. driving to her apartment to find her loopy and septic. driving to her apartment to take her to the er because she called me after passing out. when she didn’t answer her phone i enjoyed several anxiety filled drives to her apartment wondering what i would find. doctors told me several times that my quick thinking saved her life.so now with her most recent hospitalization it is looking like there will be no more attempts to “fix” anything. a drain in her side will prevent infection and her other conditions...well. there are a lot of moving parts. her care will be palliative now, focused on her quality of life.is there money for assisted living? nope. does she even have insurance since the divorce? nope.so my new husband and i (getting married in very early jan!) will be getting a house and moving her in. what i lose in having to live with her again i gain in possibly ending the constant nightmares about finding her dead in her apartment. i am 30 now. i barely had a “20s” and now they are over and i am right back where i started. i never wanted to be a caregiver.my fiancé said he always knew this would happen but i am burning with guilt for putting him through this. i want to have children in the next couple years but i can’t imagine tacking care of her and children. my career? i am always struggling not to let this shit hold me back and it doesn’t always work.thank you for reading.", i'm so sorry. i just want to give you the biggest hug.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/e4yia5/i_had_about_three_years/,,I had about three years

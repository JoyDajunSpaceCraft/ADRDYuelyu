"my grammy will be 85 this month, the same age as my grandfather who takes care of her primarily. i’m with them 9-4 on weekdays and bring meals on saturdays. we met with her neurologist today to review some medication changes. we are at our wits end. she is grumpy and cranky, if you don’t do what she wants she’ll throw a giant pity party saying how you’re no good, you’re too stubborn, you just don’t care enough to help... she’s said some extremely awful hurtful things to my aunt who we usually call in as a last resort if we can’t get her calmed down. my papa is very proud and he won’t think about the long term. i’m moving away likely this summer or as soon as april, and i want there to be a plan in place for when i’m no longer here to help. other than he dementia and pretty much entirely relying on her pacemaker she’s in good health. my papa is stressed and at his breaking point because he can’t handle her, but he refuses to get outside help. both my aunts and i are in agreement the time is near for her to be put in a home. but we can’t get my papa to budge on it at all. he says he can take care of her, he can do everything they would do for her there. but they’ve both lost interest in everything they used to like, so they don’t do anything during the day. if they go somewhere she won’t get out she stays in the car. earlier today she walked out the door to go to her mothers house, who’s been gone for 20 years ranting about how no one will help her and we’re too stubborn. we don’t know what to do with her anymore. is it time to seriously consider putting her in a home? and if so how can we convince my grandfather that this is good for her and for him? i know he’s proud but their qualities of life are both suffering.", does she take any drugs? my wife takes clonazepam and seroquile and it has calmed her down quite a bit. cbd oil seems to help also.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/f5iwxw/is_it_time_for_a_home/,Is It Time For A Home?
"i was talking with a friend the other day who is an unpaid caregiver to her mother who is in the late stages of alzheimer's. she commented that she wished that there were tax credits available to people like her who are dealing with this financial burden. i work in the accounting department of a publicly traded american company, so i am mildly familiar with our federal tax system, but because tax is not my primary focus, i couldn't give her as good of an answer as i wish i could have. off the top of my head, i suggested the $500 tax credit for a dependent other than a qualifying child, but frankly i'm not sure that her mother would qualify for this either. i'm now looking into this topic closer to see if i can find something more helpful for her. is anyone familiar with deductions/credits that unpaid family caregivers may be able to benefit from? i'm more interested in federal income tax, but my friend is a resident of california if anyone is aware of anything she could take advantage of at the state level as well."," the dependant care tax credit can also apply, if they pay for care for her, and she is a tax dependent of your friend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/f5e3bc/tax_deductionscredits_for_family_caregivers/,Tax Deductions/Credits for Family Caregivers

"i have a story about my mother (74). she had been living at their home with my father / her husband who admittedly did not consider himself to good at taking care of my mom. she had not been diagnosed with alz but after many years of decline we concluded it was dementia/alz with severe sundowners.  she could barely walk from damaged knees from many years of being overweight. she was not able to wander. she refused to see doctors or take meds.  my sister stepped in and tricked her into seeing a doctor she said was her. similarly she had an appointment with a neurologist.  my mom failed all of the cognative tests. she was prescribed anti anxiety medication.  she refused and faught taking her meds or even pain killers every day.  her temper and sundowners was soon too much to handle. my father still refused to administer meds claiming undersirable side effects. he did not bathe or clean her. he refused our pleadings to get outside help to handle those things. he sequestered himself in a separate room to keep to himself safe from my moms verbal and physical abuse. he was physically and emotionally neglecting my mom.  last october i confided with my sister that we needed to intervene by contacting adult protective services anonymously. we explained why we were calling with details of the situation etc. aps visited the house a few times declaring that my mother was not safe or being well cared for. they made it clear that my father had to admit my mom to  nursing care within three weeks or they would take her out of their home.  two weeks later she contracted pneumonia and a severe leg infection from scrathing a fungal infection. my father called 911 and she was taken to the er kicking with three ambulances screaming, biting, swearing. the er doctors had to sedate her and put her in a containment jacket. they soon started antibiotics and anti anxiety, mood meds. my father questioned side effects. she was in the hospital for a few weeks. her infections cleared but she faught, bit and punched medical staff. they were trying different doses and meds, doses to calm her. the head nurse was said to going into irriversable delerium and that she is dying. my father was shocked to here that. the hospital chaplian visited and said a prayer for my mother, consulted with my father.  the hospital social worker had a meeting with my father. they said that my mom cannot go back home and she has to go for rehab at a skilled nursing care facility and then to an assisted living home. she was transfered out of the hospital to the skilled nursing care for rehab. the hospital didn't transfer knowledge of meds or dosage.  the first night she raged and overturned an 8 foot table in the dining area. keep in mind she cant walk well. she threw food and drink over other residents. she was sedated and jacketed. they got her meds corrected and they were traing her how to walk with a walker. she refused to use the walker but she had to pass walking tests to be transferred to an assisted living home. she was rejected by all but one assisted living home because she couldn't walk 50 ft. she was transferred to the assisted living where she had to move about on her own. while there, the second night she caused a fight with her room mate. she had given her room mate a bruised face. she was recommended to have a single room. a week later she was found in the morning on the floor. two days later she fell and broke her left femor just below the ball. she went to the er for two days. my father reached out to my sister and me for direction. we all declined surgery in favor of comfort care because the outcome would be the same if she had surgery or not.  she was transferred back to skilled nursing care with hospice comfort care. her pain was managed but was still combative while on meds. she couldn't get out of bed or move.throughtout this whole ordeal my father was visiting her almost every day. he didn't really care and neglected her before. why is he being so caring now?my wife and i went to see her the following weekend. she was sleeping but awoke when we arrived in her room. she kind of recognized my wife but not me. my wife held her hand. my mom started to cry saying she is sorry over and over. i asked if she wanted water. knowing her, i asked for chocolate pudding for her. she drank four 6oz cups of water with a straw and half a pudding without throwing it. i later learned she was refusing food and did not eat. we left her that day saying we loved her. the next 9 days she declined. last monday she was unresponsive. on wednesday evening the hospice nurse made the call to bring in family. my father went home and we planned to see her thecfollowing morning. two hours later, she passed with the hospice nurse present. my father was notified by the hospice nurse and he sent an email to us saying she passed sildntly and peacefully.im ok. i am relieved she isn't in pain. i miss the mom i used to know many years ago.", my sister said she had an doctors appointment for herself. she said she needed moms company and sweetened the deal with icecream at her favorite spot

"mother is single, 73, bipolor, and dimentia.she has no family except me (8500 miles away) and my brother (15 mikes away)brother has power of attorney.  when he figured that out, he promptly took her to the bank last year and transferred all her money into his personal bank account.i warned him to put it back, and he laughed.then i called the county for elder abuse and a few weeks later all the money was returned to her accounts.he was pissed and said "" shes now your problem"".fast forward 8 months to today.her condition is worsening.she forgot to take her meds and she was driving erratically in a small town.the police stopped her.  she admits she had a psychotic episode.  the police impounded her car, took her keys and drove her home.she has since recovered her car.i also discovered last week she didnt have any food.  so i quick ordered online meals which arrived today.after she got some nutrition in her her mind cleared up and she realized she is in way over her head and is struggling to take care of herself.i had the talk with her today and asked her if she wanted me to pull power of attorney and go for guardianship.first she said yes, and then she said no cause she doesnt want to go into a nursing home.she spends all her time smoking ecigs and drinking coffee rocking in a chair.  very few people come to visit.i did ask my brother to deliver some forzen meals for her but he neither replied or complied with this simple ask.it will cost me about 2500 in round trip airfare plus legal fees to get guardian process executed.what would you do? i did try adult protectivr services but they are reluctant to get involved.the state is ny.thanks for taking time to read.", goodluck to you and your mother. hope things can be resolved for yall.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/eziug0/when_is_time_to_get_outside_help/,When is time to get outside help?
"originally posted in r/agingparents and someone suggested i post this here.my dad (66) and i have never been close and i've always wanted to be. that's not really the point of this post, but it matters. he's uncomfortable talking about much of substance and always seems to feel ill at ease, like he isn't sure what's coming out of his mouth and not certain of where he is. he wants to make people laugh but not be laughed at. he's always been a proud man. i keep his jokes going even when they don't make sense, and our conversations are usually light. sometimes though, his stress overwhelms him and he cries to me about what may or may not be real problems and i don't know what to say.i live 1100 miles away, and my siblings found out last october that our dad was diagnosed 2 years ago with lewy body dementia and alzheimers. the only reason his wife told us was because he was hospitalized and they could no longer hide his symptoms. i just found out he was hospitalized again yesterday to have his meds readjusted. late sunday night, he tried to walk over to his neighbor's house because he was convinced he had been hired to manage a football team and he needed to be next door to start work. his wife tried to redirect him and he spoke angrily to her and pushed her. so now he's back in the hospital and i'm a wreck.i'm going to call him but can somebody with more experience please help me know what to say to him? i always try to meet him where he is and act as if whatever he says is perfectly ordinary conversation. it's sad, but i can do that. it's his anguish that kills me. when he cries about not having any money and tells me he was robbed, what do i say? i have no idea what their finances are, and furthermore, i was told never to contradict someone with alzheimers. hell, my dad never liked being contradicted when he was healthy. i don't know how to comfort him. it seems impossible to get him off that track and it destroys me to know he's suffering and not be able to fix it.please help.", great suggestions! i also recommend connecting through music from the era he was a young man. maybe talk about who his favorite musical artists were and even listen to some tunes together even during a phone call. often music connects  us with our loved ones.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/eyvtj2/looking_for_help_communicating_with_my_father/,Looking for help communicating with my father (Lewy body/Alzheimers)
"morning all - i'm looking for some advise and/or information in regards to what my family (and mother in law) are experiencing.   my mil has struggled with early onset for the past 13-15 years. over the last (now) 3 weeks, she was moved into a memory care facility, because my fil could no longer provide her care, while also providing himself care. we applauded his efforts, and were actually very excited for this transition.   my mil is 65, wheelchair bound, but at the time of entry to this facility, was able to stay awake and really ""communicate"" in her own way with us (word salad mostly). she did experience some issues with chewing/swallowing, but it was simply the beginning stages of that.   now, after about 2 weeks living in the facility, she is no longer ""awake"" - she simply sleeps 24 hours a day, and almost seems drugged in a sense. quite catatonic, and experiencing a lot of jittering/shaking, as well as not being able to clearly communicate (at all, mainly moans). she is no longer eating at all (they will puree all meals) and she is beginning to choke on small amounts of water.   we, as a family, were not expecting such a quick decline in a span of only 2 weeks - the facility has reassured us that her medication/routine is exactly the same (nothing has changed) - other than her living situation. they did mention that this can be common behavior in a new facility, with new/unfamiliar people, etc.   i'm just curious if any of you have seen this first hand, or experienced this - and if you have any possible advice (or knowledge) to bestow upon us. we're kind of all at a loss - because on one hand, we are concerned for her well being, but also, we aren't sure if a ""rally"" will take place - due to her age, condition.   more or less - i'm just reaching out to this community for some insight! any response is appreciated.", how many years has she been in wheel chair?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/eys9wa/has_anyone_experienced_this/,Has Anyone Experienced This?
"my husband’s very sweet grandmother was diagnosed awhile back. she is in her 80s and has luckily progressed fairly slowly, but her short term memory has degraded enough now that it is causes problems. she had been living in florida with her husband, but when he died last year, the grief pushed her into the next stage of the disease. she moved to be close to her son (my father in law) in an assisted living home that has memory care in a separate suite. she is not yet in memory care. her long term memory is quite in tact, but her short term memory is very bad now. she can no longer follow a recipe and baking used to be her passion. during a recent family reunion, i spoke with my mother in law about how her husband was coping. he can’t enjoy his time with his mother anymore because everything is surrounded by this layer of stress. he is in charge of her finances and she asks the same questions over and over.  then my mother in law said something that concerned me.she said “we’re just waiting until it gets worse because then it’ll be easier. she fights us on every decision, but when she forgets everything we can just do what’s right for her and she won’t remember.”then she looked at me and said “don’t worry. we won’t ever put you two through this.”i’m so sad that they think of it as her putting them through this disease. i’m sad that they don’t see how, as frustrating as it is for them, it is worse for her. she is still with it enough to know that she is forgetting. all they say when we ask how our grandmother is doing is “she’s exhausting”i asked how they were going to keep from “doing this to us”. my father in law’s solution is to kill himself as soon as he gets a grim diagnosis and my mother in law doesn’t know. my husband and i live across the country and there isn’t much we can do to help, but i am worried sick about all of it.any advice or suggestions or thoughts would be helpful."," a few suggestions. first, regarding their plan to prevent themselves from putting you in this position: i'm with singingbrook on this. encourage them, if they haven't yet, to get poa's in place for themselves, designating each other and their kids to be able to make financial, health care and end of life decisions as needed. mine includes what my wishes are regarding moving me to assisted living or memory care - i wanted to make sure my daughter knows that i would rather go to a facility than live with her, because i don't want her life to become her being imprisoned in her house as my caretaker. second, rethink this: ""i’m so sad that they think of it as her putting them through this disease. i’m sad that they don’t see how, as frustrating as it is for them, it is worse for her."" trauma isn't a competition of who has it worse. they can understand that this is horrible for her, while at the same time their own life has been derailed, they are probably living under stress that never lets up, possibly being consumed with not only the active battles, but also intrusive thoughts that interfere with daily activities, sleep, maybe are causing other health problems as well. finally regarding what you can do to help. yes, you are across the country and can't help with day to day care. here's what consumes my time in addition to that: paying her bills. filing online claims to the hsa, to her long term care policy. dealing with medicare changes. figuring out what pharmacies can deliver blister pack meds to her assisted living place and letting them know her insurance info. depositing checks to her bank. filing her taxes. that sounds like 5 hours work, tops. but no. every damn thing blows up into hours and hours. i find out there's a change to her insurance, there's an hour on hold to talk to someone. they get me a new policy. i have to get that set up, send all the info out to her doctors, the pharmacy, where she lives, pay the bill. then get hate mail from her former employer only to find out since i called the insurance company directly that triggered cancelling her company sponsored medical plan. now i have to call them (more hours on hold) and get a new plan through the company - so they get the commission and reinstate her - and contact all those other people to cancel the first attempt, set up everything again, and if i get that policy autopayed through social security then the reimbursement for her premiums can't be autopayed to her bank account, i have to walk the reimbursement checks to the bank every month. or they can autopay the reimbursement, but then i have to pay the insurance premium by check every month. every damn little thing is a spider web like that, and all the background info of how any of it works is lost in the other spider web that's my mother's brain. so volunteer to take that burden on. ask if there's any administrative stuff, bill paying, setting up caregivers, they'd like you to handle. you can do that from across the country if they trust you with it, and if you can do it legally. or if any of it can be done by just logging in online, you can be the people that do that. does she need supplies ordered and delivered? even if they say no, ask again in one or two months. they'll appreciate that you at least understand that it is a burden (instead of dismissing it because she has it worse!) and that you offered to help where you could.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/exbh0t/worried_about_how_in_laws_are_handling_it/,Worried about how in laws are handling it.

coming to a point of just pure frustration for me at least on my part.coming to a point where our house kitchen was almost fully burned down twice. once was our stove being totaled, 2nd time half the kitchen was burned down, and my dad was told by my mom multiple times to not use the stovetop, but did it anyways.now when it comes to whatever is left in our family savings just about a month ago my dad lost 1grand due to some miss placement of his certain investments that he can't remember. my dad didn't give me enough details because of his stubbornness. i could easily come up with couple of pages to what else my dad lost money-wise, and important items like a passport to his driver license due to this condition, but what happened in the last week or two kinda made me lost my anger.and today.... well... i almost lost it today where i had to walk out the house cause of how angry i got. today my mom left about 80dollars in front of my door to do some grocery shopping. i was sick all day, and was in my room just resting.as of right now, my parents is in the process of selling our house, so my dad can sorta retire and not worry about any debts, and of course, it will help his medical situation. that being said, we kinda hired these handymans to repair certain parts of our house in order to put it in the market so it can sell for a better price.so long story short, my mom left money for me to which my dad kept the money in front of my door and of course my dad not walking with these handymen, and forgetting that my dad left cash in front my door, like 100% for sure these crooks/handyman took the money, who i didn't know was going to show up today.i mean... i know it's only $80dollars, but just something triggered in me that got me really frustrated at my dad, when you also add all the incidents he did in the past. i had to walk outside just to vent my frustration cause of what my dad did. it was just one too many incidents that caused me to kinda lose my anger.another reason why i lost my anger today, cause just last week my dad gave someone $100 something dollars to replace our mid size fridge at our basement, to which my dad gave it to this one handyman who ofcourse didn't show up with our replacement fridge. this didn't have to do with his mental condition (or maybe it kinda does), but just adds up when my dad makes all these decisions combine with his alzheimers.my mom keeps telling my dad to be more careful with our financial situation, but he keeps forgetting minor and simple things, which causes our family to lose money. like i feel bad for my dad, but same time really frustrated cause he just won't listen most of the time.not sure what else to do, cause i know alzheimers is nothing you can solve in one day, but not sure if there are some sorta routines or medication. i know my dad takes some sorta medication, but ofcourse he won't give me the details.but, as of right now, i am kinda losing it. cause mom does make more money than me, and she works in the child daycare field. her, health isn't doing any better due to her age catching up. but, seeing money being lost by my dad, that's being hard-earned by mom is really hard to see. my dad didn't lose like all our savings or anything like that. but, just these incidents kinda adds up and doesn't make our already financial situation any easier.i thank you for reading this lengthy help i guess you can say. not sure if there is some sorta help group of sort that can help my dad's routine on not forgetting things and i guess not being stubborn is another source of method to fix i guess. but, just really hard to cope with, especially when my parents are in a tough financial situation."," you can't blame an alzheimer patient when they are put in situations where they can lose money or burn down the house. we took all the knobs off the range. if you leave him one burner, that's your fault, not his. if he has access to money, consider that money gone. again, it's not his fault, it's the fault of whomever let him have access to the money. this is a very hard situation. you want them to have their pride. i let my mom have some money handy for her pride, but not much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/evewsc/i_am_not_sure_what_to_do_with_my_dads_what_seems/,"I AM NOT sure what to do with my dad's what seems early stage of

"i'm looking for experiences of how parents/grandparents/etc. reacted after stopping memantine. my mom's on both memantine and donepezil. we just got the latest monthly pharmacy bill for her mail-order prescription and the co-pay for memantine went up 300%. it's insane, and i can't find anything saying that memantine went up that much in 2020. we're currently looking into whether this is a mistake on medicare's part or the pharmacy's. if a $200 monthly co-pay is the new price, we cannot justify her spending that much as it's not the only medication she's on and others are more important imo.her memory care doctor told us that stopping that med will have her declining far faster mentally, but her body is still healthy and she'll just go into, for all intents and purposes, a bedridden vegetative state. when i've brought it up, the memory care and her regular physician both say it is not recommended at all. i know she already hates the disease, so i don't want to make it worse, but i know that this new price is too much for her budget.i don't know if the doctors are feeding me scary stories to keep her on the medication or if it's really that bad. can anyone offer insight on what they experienced?", you can get it online from overseas pharmacies online.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/evawvd/memantine_and_quitting_it/,Memantine and Quitting It

"hello, i got a dna test from 23 and me a few months ago, and found i have two copies of the e4 variant. which is associated with the highest risk of alzheimer's. when i saw this, i felt like my heart sank. i tried so hard to not think about it, but it keeps haunting me like a ghost. being 30 years old, immediately after i told some of my closest friends, they told me i'm worrying too much, that i'm too young to worry about that.my mom told me she can't think of any alzheimer's in our family, though, that wasn't reassuring because my grandfather has dementia, and our family isn't very close...at all. a family member could easily have alzheimer's and neither of my parents would know about it.i get complemented on my intelligence and ability to learn more than anything else, even though i don't feel like i'm that intelligent. either way, i heavily value the quality of my mind, and i always have tried to do everything i can do to either to improve or preserve it.i could do a lot more for my physical health, but i try to do everything i can for my mental health, even when i get migraines.so, being tested for two copies of the e4 variant was a huge slap in the face.i'm sure this doesn't mean i have a 100% chance of developing it, but that doesn't eliminate my anxiety. and it seriously doesn't help that most people i've spoken to about this is being unsympathetic.so, i guess what i want to ask is, has anybody else had the same experience?is it really possible for somebody with two copies of the e4 variant to live to old age without developing alzheimer's?is my anxiety justified? is there any action i can take to prevent it? i know i'm asking a lot of questions, i just...i guess i'm just really distressed about this. and i can't afford to go to a doctor any time soon.if you have any information you think be useful, that would be great."," i would be scared shitless, even if i knew better,  so i sympathize. id be scared because my dad and grandma had dementia, and all my dads siblings. so theres some kind of familial component and i consider myself at higher risk :p i also know im not an e4 carrier though. i used to work in a lab that included apoe genotyping in some of its studies. so i believe stuff you probably already googled, that its not a ""youre automatically doomed"" thing. mayo clinic is a reputable source.theres some studies that apoe4 has antagonistic pleiotropic qualities, that its advantageous in some ways tho it appears some times to be disadvantageous. this would jive with your high intelligence now. you could google (or google scholar) ""antagonistic pleiotropy apoe"" if you wanted to go down that rabbit hole.  i only know about it because that was being researched at my old lab. but i dont know how fringe an idea it is. if i were you id also see if there were studies i could participate in that involve apoe, dementia or alzheimer's, or whatever combination. id check out trialmatch and  i haven't done any searches in there myself recently but you might want to keep an eye out.because lots of reasons.1. maybe you can get a confirmation on your genotype. maybe youll luck out and it turned out it was an error. 2. you could be put in touch with people who are deep into latest science to ask your questions.3. maybe youll come across a study that will actually benefit you (note studies are generally not allowed to promise you they will help you). 4. its good to help science, in general.. but cures of tomorrow are based on research done one people today. so jump in now.. maybe 25 years from now you will have contributed to a cure that can help your future kids. :pif you go this route be mindful that participating in one study can possibly disqualify you from other studies.there are things that are said to be associated with lower risk, and a lot of those things do relate to your physical health, so i would get on that. you could see what your local alzheimer's association is up to and see if you want to jump in. after the nih, they are the largest funder of alzheimer's research in the us, and are involved in pushing legislation to help alzheimer's patients and caregivers. in my state, i think they recently helped to get extended early onset care support for patients from government for example. getting involved in such things now might help set up systems that can help you out later, in case you do get it :p not to be glib but.. in the end.. you're kinda stuck with the hand you're dealt.. and yeah its no guarantee you'll get it. if you do the ""right"" things there's no guarantee you'll be spared too. such is the shit sandwich that is the threat of alzheimer's. so, i just try to be healthier in general, with one eye on the alzheimer's-avoiding version of healthy. but don't let it consume you (because then you might be trapped on reddit wasting your time commenting to strangers about alzheimer's stuff lol).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/eu169v/testing_positive_for_two_copies_of_e4_variant/,Testing positive for two copies of e4 variant.

"i'm 33 years old. i just bough a magazine today about alzheimer's, being that my mother is beginning to show many of its symptoms. while i was reading the magazine, i realized that i too, have the same symptoms, but they are very mild(forgetfulness, thinking someone stole my stuff, wandering around town forgetting why i went out, etc.) . but i'm only 33. my mom is pretty young too, 57 years old. we are both very active people, her even more-so. anyway, if i suspect i have it, and my mom does too, where is the best place to start, in terms of getting tested/diagnosed?"," it can begin in one’s 30s, yes. but i hope you can step back for a second and breathe. we all—throughout life—forget things and make bad decisions and see patterns that aren’t really there. and if you pick up a copy of the dsm (a book that categorizes the symptoms associated with different mental disorders), you will probably end up thinking that you have a mild version of everything. all i have to do is read about whiplash and my own neck will start to hurt. the brain sometimes associates that way. of course, one never knows.  so the second best piece of advice i can offer is to keep a record book of what your mother seems to be experiencing. ask her to help you make those entries, if that seems appropriate. and keep one for yourself, if your concerns persist. a reliable medical history is a key to an accurate diagnosis. if it is determined that she has early onset, that may encourage a medical professional to take your own personal concerns more seriously. some publications thrive through fear mongering. others ‘over-represent’ because neuroscience simply does not have all of the answers. symptoms are identified in a vague and overbroad way because that is all we really know so far. that does not mean we shouldn’t study. we do, however, have to be mindful of our sources of information and the infancy of this area of medicine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/etomqm/can_a_young_person_get_alzheimers/,Can a young person get Alzheimers?

"i spent six days at my folks' last week to watch my dad (73, alzheimer's), so my mom (73)  could go to the beach with friends from thursday-sunday. i live several states away. i would guess dad is still in the middle stage. his short term memory gets worse and worse, his long-term memory is pretty good, he is high-anxiety/obsessive (cleaning) and paranoid (about money, his house), and he has angry outbursts, mainly when he's extremely stressed.mom and dad went across the country to spend two weeks with my siblings and their families (children from 8-17). it went poorly. dad was confused and rattled, had a number of angry episodes (yelling, ranting, etc.) he was confused about where they were, when he could go home, etc.while i was alone with my dad, he did okay. he had three outbursts, mainly about my mother -- where was she? when was she coming back? why did she get to go have fun, and we're running errands for her? i am an american! nobody is going to come into my house and take care of me, because i am a man. i can still do things! a lot of that makes sense. some of it got to be pretty rambling. i found that if i responded calmly, asked what i could do to help, say that i could tell he felt angry, i'm sorry things are tough dad, he would calm down. we watched tv, made food, listened to music, told each other jokes, had a mostly good time together.mom came home, and within an hour, things were bad. she has always been high-anxiety, bossy, and honestly pretty selfish. she rolls her eyes at him, would whisper in front of him, ""you get to go home. i have to live with this."" she corrects his stories, tells him he's wrong, tells him to do things for her without ""please"" and ""thank you."" she's a tough person to spend time with, and he's catered to her for 50 years. unfortunately now, his filters are gone (not that they were great to begin with). it's not like i have never seen them have an argument, which usually resulted in a five-day ""i'm not talking to you,"" but monday was devastating -- swearing (from both -- including f-bombs and ""jesus christ,"" which i have never heard from them). he was mad that she came home and made him a breakfast date to make him go away, so she could have me to herself. he wanted to stay home, and she said that ""he won, because he threw a tantrum, so he's being rewarded for bad behavior."" she literally boo-hooed around the house, i sat with him at the table and held his hand while tears ran down his face, and he said he wished he had a gun and one bullet.so, things are bad. mom kept trying to get me to agree with her that he was difficult, and does he just get to win all of the time. i said it was not a game, that he was sick, and that she needed to find her center and not be so reactive. she cried again, i said this is hard stuff, we support you, he needs more help with his anxiety/anger. she said he's taking medication for those things, and i said they are not working. when i got home, i wrote her a letter that priority #1 is to call his doctor and not wait for the next quarterly appointment (he sees a dementia team, including a psychiatrist). his anxiety/anger/paranoia could be better controlled, and she can do xyz to make things less stressful at home (this was all done as gently as possible, except when i said that she needs to stop mocking him to his face.) i've been home now for four days, she keeps making excuses as to why she can't call the doctor (your dad is just always around...i don't want to talk about him on the phone in front of him). this is the same person who will leave for three hours to go play bridge, or an afternoon to play mahjong, or golf, or out to lunch, or whatever. i don't know why she doesn't just tell him she's going to grab milk, drive around the corner and call, except that she never does anything she doesn't want to do. against my advice, she is now planning a 16-day vacation in arizona to spend four days each with four different families. this will go poorly, but she wants to do it, so too bad, i guess?ok, so, my question is: i have his doctors' names and phone numbers. she e-mailed all of that information to us kids some months ago. i realize that his doctors may not be able to talk to us about my dad or his treatment, but can i relay information to them to try to get him some help? i don't need to tattle on my mom, per se, but his anxiety is very bad, even when she is not around (i had to be careful how i poured water down the sink, because if any sloshed around the sink at all, he'd run over to wipe it all up. he licks his finger and picks poppy seed-sized specks off of the floor. he arranges things neatly (like taking all of the tooth brushes out and putting them in an evenly-spaced row on the counter. plus, he did have terrible outbursts with me, even though he kept also saying: i'm not mad at you. i love you. you're trying to help.) i guess i'm just feeling pretty fried. i do understand that my mom has to live with him every day, and that she also is declining. i am just seriously concerned about his care, and what else could be done to help him. bringing in outside help is of course an option, except my mom is cheap and doesn't want to spend money on that, and honestly, it will make my dad really angry to have a stranger in the house taking care of him. he's still with it enough to figure these things out, but not with it enough that he can care at all for himself (he is not able to manage meds, food, can't drive, etc.) thank you for reading. god bless all of you warriors out there!tl,dr: dad with alzheimer's is having major problems with anxiety, paranoia, ocd, anger; caregiver wife does not want to call to get more help."," is she planning to leave him alone for 16 days or take him with her?  you can definitely call the doctor and relay your concerns. if your dad is considered competent he may be able to give the doctor permission to talk to you.  definitely look into adult daycare in your area. it will give your mom a break as well as give your dad something to do during the day (they may allow him to wipe off the lunch tables, for example) as well as daily contact with elder care staff, nurses, and peers.   my dad with dementia has been making lots of messes lately. half of me wishes i could borrow your dad for a few hours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/eqi9tl/can_i_communicate_with_dads_doctor/,Can I communicate with Dad's doctor?

"hey all. to make a long story short, after a string of traumatic events (a car wreck involving head-trauma, great grandmother's death, and my aunt's death) my nana has been showing signs of alzheimer's. my great grand-mother was also affected by alzheimer's; however, she was older than my nana is now.my nana has been divorced and my papaw is remarried to my mamaw (all these familial terms, lol). she has never hated my mamaw, maybe not liked, but never hated, though she now is certain that my mamaw and papaw got married immediately after my nana and papaw got a divorce and it burns her up. she genuinely believes it with her whole heart. to make matters worse, my nana was the one cheating on my papaw! so there's that.i would argue that my nana is still in touch with our reality to whatever extent, but our timelines and belief of how events played out is so different. how the hell do you deal with something like this? do you play into it, knowing it's not the truth? just ignore it? arguing only upsets her."," my mum does this. she gets fixated on ideas and grudges and there is just no changing her mind. arguing with someone with alzheimers will only make them (and you) frustrated and upset. distraction is the only way. distract and redirect to something more pleasant and joyful for her. make her laugh. engage her. change the subject every time it comes up. when my mum gets a fixed idea in her head about someone she 'hates' or who has supposedly wronged her in some way, the only way to actually break it is for her to spend time with that person in a positive and enjoyable way so that she remembers why she likes them. it sounds like that might not be an option here so redirecting her attention is the only way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/eocro6/when_the_timeline_becomes_jumbled/,When the timeline becomes jumbled.
"i'll just quickly share my experience and advice and then a resource.five years ago my family and i began noticing signs that my mother was having difficulty completing everyday tasks. initially, we looked at these things she was doing as quirky, elderly silliness. at the time, she was picking up my kids from school every day and they would notice that she seemed off and her driving was becoming a little more aggressive, she'd show up to school later and later, she had strange cuts on her hands and face, and one time she forgot they were in the car and went home instead of our house.i decided to change our routine and i began picking up the kids. all good, right?nope. basically, now that the kids weren't seeing her every day, we were no longer getting those all too important progress reports from them. we got busy with our lives, and we only spoke to her on the phone, and other some minor confusion, she seemed fine during those calls.fast forward two weeks and her neighbor is calling us saying she is at their house telling them that there are people staying at her house, so she needs to move in with them.we arrive to find her covered in bruises, unwashed, empty refrigerator, and untouched prescription bottles.those final years of her life were up and down and full of resentment. she seemed angry with me, and frankly, i can't blame her.so, now that my father-in-law has had some minor memory issues and one fall, we have had to have some difficult conversations, but i won't wait this time.i took several online assessments, [like this one,]( as soon as i started to feel like something was off.be proactive, get help from professionals, and take care of yourself!"," after we made the difficult decision to move mumsy into memory care, we found out that the facility she was in (independent living) had had quite a few ""incidents"" that they had documented. plus her friends i talked to all agreed it was time.why weren't we (her adult children) notified?  all of us had talked to her on the phone, and had those quirky, senior moments, but if we had been talking to each other, the retirement center, and her friends, we might have figured it out sooner. we weren't getting all the information compiled. good for you for figuring it sooner.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/eo993b/this_time_around_im_being_proactive/,"This time around, I'm being proactive."

[this was my last post in case anybody is wondering.]( it was really nice feeling supported from everyone, this sub has really become a source of comfort, advice, and knowledge for me. i wanted to give a bit of an update. incontinence started earlier than my predictions, with the first recorded instance happening last night. i don't know if it was a full-blown accident, as it seems more like she didn't follow bathroom hygiene for a while and maybe it built up to the point of being visible? i don't know, and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. mil was walking around and had a large spot on the back of her pants that i pointed out to bf. he tried to talk to her about it, but it ended up with her denying and him losing his patience. she eventually took a bath and we swapped out the pants. bf was exhausted and he's been in shock pretty much all night. he doesn't want to believe that this is happening and wants to believe this is a one-off and that she still has another 6+ months before having to worry about continence issues. bf is poa, and is feeling overwhelmed, saying he didn't realize that poa meant doing so much. i think last night was a huge eye-opener as even he realizes that fighting with his mom every day to change her underwear is a lot. he's been really sad about this latest step, understandably so. i've tried bringing him to the sub, but he says he's not ready for all that, although he appreciates it when i read some of your posts and helpful responses out loud for him.we talked it over for a while, and he messaged his sister and we're having a small family meeting tonight after work. according to him, she hasn't been telling him all the awful details that have been happening when she takes mil out once a week. i'm not sure about this, because sil and i have talked about it multiple times. he says he was doubting both of our stories because he didn't see it, it hasn't happened to him, and that we were alone when it was happening. i pointed out that he's the one in the family that's famous for having a temper and also that he is a man and his mother has been getting increasingly sexist in the last year or so and that may be affecting the way she addresses him.we also talked about our approaches to care. he admitted that he had been feeling like i was being a wicked witch and a bit of a dictator with trying to establish care. he also said i was being mean to his mom. i asked for clarification and explained that i keep my tone neutral and use easy to understand words when i'm asking her to do something because any other tone elicits an outburst from her as she really doesn't like authority, or me for that matter. he did acknowledge that i've never yelled at her, or sworn at her, or anything like that and that he didn't know that was why i was keeping voice low and that maybe he had misinterpreted what i was doing. bf apologized to me for being mean to me when he's realizing that me being ""cold &amp; clinical"" is simply trying to talk to him about where we are in the process and how to make his mother's quality of life better. he has been a bit frazzled and has never really had a routine, so it's been a constant struggle establishing one. for instance, last night, dinner wasn't even on the table until 11pm! granted, the accident was a huge factor, but we're just all over the place schedule-wise.i sat down with him last night and wrote out a schedule of care that she would be expected to get if she was in a hospital, or a nursing home. i told him i was willing to help as long as we could argue that the quality of her life with us would be higher than she would be getting in a home. i also wrote down a list of symptoms to bring up on their next dr visit in february. i'm hoping that after tonight's meeting, we can really start in earnest to find placement for mil, or at least some sort of respite."," your patience and support for your bf and his family is impressive. i sincerely hope he appreciates it because many people would gone before dealing with this horrid situation. in a way, as tough as it was to deal with, it's good your bf saw first hand with the incontinent episode that this is not the kind of care that can be managed in a private home. what he dealt with that overwhelmed him is nothing compared to how it will get later. and later could be months.... or years. the sooner he deal with reality the better.how did the family meeting go?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/elgc2n/updates_to_my_last_post/,Updates to my last post

"i’m taking my dad to a nuero appt tomorrow. he was diagnosed with early stage alzheimer’s last august. he was told not to drive then. he has continued to drive, saying he’s fine. tbh, i’m not sure if it’s time to pull his license or not. i don’t drive with him much. when i do, he’s ok. the last six months have been horrendous. three weeks after my dad’s diagnosis my normally stable step-mom had a full psychotic break and has been way off ever since. she tells us stories about him and his driving, but we aren’t sure if they are true. she’s so manic and demanding that we can’t really tell the extent of his problems. we’ve really been focused on her issues way more lately as she has needed a lot more help. she was the one that ran things for the two of them and now she can’t balance her checkbook or follow a recipe. here’s what’s has got me worried:- he has said, many times that if he can’t drive his life is over. it’s his freedom and once he loses that his life will be over. - he has always been a struggle to deal with. he’s quite anti-social, prone to depression. he doesn’t do anything but sit at home and watch youtube videos and drive to a local drive thru for a diet pepsi most days. and my step-mom sends him to the grocery store every few days. - my step-mom hasn’t been driving much since her break. she’s very uncomfortable behind the wheel. - i live 45 mins away. my sister is closer. about 5 mins away. i know there are services available to take them places like the grocery store, but we aren’t sure they will use them. ultimately i’m scared i’m going to see my father give up tomorrow. i’ve heard so many stories of people that decline terribly after they can’t drive anymore. i’m pretty sure the neurologist is going to really tell him to stop and it’s going to hit like a ton of bricks."," help your dad to start with the small stuff.personally i found 1 can of diet mt dew a day was responsible for about 60% of how bad things were. your not confined to shrivel up and die, you can get better.its tough to determine where each individual person is at with a dependency like thattell your dad to do his best and not to try to throw the results of the test. besides, these guys have seen it all before when it comes to angry people and throwing or not throwing the test, nothing your dad does or doesn't do will likely change his results, you know?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/el34b4/dad_has_nuerology_appointment_tomorrow/,Dad has nuerology appointment tomorrow
"my paternal grandfather passed away a few months ago after a brief but intense period of living with alzheimer's. he never sought treatment, and passed away from a bad fall. since it runs in the family, i'm concerned about my father. he has become increasingly forgetful, agitated, and confused. he has type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and a history of dvt, all of which he consistently takes medication for. he has a bmi around 40 and does not exercise or eat healthfully. he has not yet seen a doctor; my mother and i are preparing to speak with him tonight. he is generally resistant to speaking to medical professionals about what he considers to be ""mental"" issues, and i don't think he thinks it's a problem, just a natural effect of aging.what would be the best way to approach the conversation with him? his symptoms are becoming more alarming each day, and i'm fearful that without early intervention and a major change in lifestyle, his prognosis will not be good. any advice about where to start and how to navigate this moving forward would be sincerely appreciated. thank you."," pretend he is going in for a regular check up, or to get a flu shot.  alert the docs that he needs the alzheimer's test (they do simple things like ask you who the president is, to count backwards from 10, what is the year, about 10 questions like that).  dementia patients struggle to find the answers.  you absolutely have to get a diagnosis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/el0pdc/im_pretty_sure_my_63yearold_father_has_developed/,I'm pretty sure my 63-year-old father has developed early-onset Alzheimer's.

"hi everyone, i come here as both a caregiver to my father and as a mental health professional who has been focusing on the impact of dementia particularly a parent's cognitive decline on adult child caregivers and their siblings. i am a phd candidate at the university of louisiana monroe, and writing my dissertation on sibling relationships in the context of caring for parents with dementia. in particular, i am looking to explore how a parent's cognitive decline affects sibling dynamics.i have been granted irb approval, and am looking to interview adults via skype who meet the following criteria:\-identify as primary caregivers (or coordinate care) of parents with dementia (or any clinically significant cognitive decline)\-have at least one sibling.i will provide additional study details and informed consent release to any interested participants. if interested, please email me at [sieberd@warhawks.ulm.edu](mailto:sieberd@warhawks.ulm.edu)", my mother and i took care of my grandmother with dementia together for many years. my mother and i went through many stages of trust and belief during this time. at times i was convinced my mother was not a good care giver and at the end realized she was amazing. i will never have a relationship with three of her four siblings again and she pretty much is the same but with sibling guilt so it is harder for her. it is just crazy how people can ignore what is in front of their own faces and ignore reality.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ekw22z/dementia_caregiver_study_adult_caregivers_of/,Dementia caregiver study (adult caregivers of parents with dementia)
"he started taking seroquel at 25mg in june, then we had to increase to 50mg in september-ish after assaulted some caregivers and became agitated to the point of requiring restraints while in the hospital, and now...his symptoms have been getting steadily worse over the past two weeks or so. we've been living with him for a few months. friday night after getting his 50mg dose in the evening, around 4am he started pounding on our bedroom door, yelling and screaming, and attacked me - hit me (though not very effectively) with a metal basket, deeply scratched/gouged my arm with his nails, and left a few bruises. when he got up the next morning i was sure to give him 25mg with breakfast to try to keep him calm throughout the day as it seems like he's been waking up with hallucinations and paranoia, vs. his usual sundowning. he was still agitated and threatening by that afternoon and we had to give him 75mg in the evening to get him to calm down. this morning i had to hide his 25mg seroquel in his cereal because he was so suspicious and paranoid of me.&amp;#x200b;i had already talked to his care team about increasing his dosage the morning before he attacked me. i was thinking he needed to go to the extended release version but now i'm wondering if he needs something more heavy hitting entirely.&amp;#x200b;i am planning to attend a caregiver support group either tuesday or thursday, possibly both, depending on when i can meet with his care team. i am still shaken up from the friday night incident.", my mom didn’t do well on seroquel and takes zyprexa instead,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ekilk5/dad_with_alz_is_getting_increasingly_psychotic/,Dad with ALZ is getting increasingly psychotic
"ughhhh, i'm just very angry about the whole thing. i've been fighting with my bf for a while now about getting his mother onto a waitlist for a nursing home knowing that it'll be about 2 years before she gets placed. he has refused to and is now saying she doesn't have the low-income insurance that she needs to get onto the waitlist. i'm frustrated because he isn't doing anything to get his mom the proper care that she needs and it's going to get way worse before it gets better.we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and the bedrooms and the bathroom is on the second floor. she's gained a lot of weight in the last year and is having trouble getting off the couch and the stairs are making her tired. i don't think she has much time left before she is unable to navigate them. she is also complaining of problems with her bowels constantly, of having diarrhea, which i suspect is her articulating that she is getting close to losing continence. bf is convinced that isn't the case and that it's simply her diet.she is also getting increasingly aggressive. she is irritable and angry with both me and my bf's sister. she yells, swears and threatens violence. she also hurls a lot of racist statements my way (i'm asian). his sister and i are on the same page regarding her care and needs and it's frustrating that bf can't see it that way.his biggest problem is that he doesn't want her to feel afraid and that's why he's resistant to her going anywhere. i understand his fear, but i feel that she is going to be afraid regardless and that it would be better to get her acclimated to a new environment sooner so that she has a chance to recognize her surroundings. i worked as a nursing assistant to get through school and it's been really frustrating. i've worked in nursing homes and they're not as bad as people make them out to be. yes, they're not home, i get it, but they're not jails. i've been trying to help him navigate the waters but he's been resistant to any help. when she was first placed on her meds, i mentioned that she should be on an antidepressant because of her behavior and to help her sleep. he eventually decided to take her off of it without telling anybody because he felt that i was too pill-happy and trying to overmedicate her. that led to a solid 2 months of her crying constantly, being angry with everybody and just having a really rough time before he realized that she really needed the meds.i'm worried that she's going to need assistance toileting, and bathing soon and she won't let him help because he's a boy, and she's violent towards me. it's unrealistic to expect his sister to drive over constantly to help because mil is violent towards her as well. i feel like he is setting us up for failure because by the time she really really needs help, we won't be able to get help when we need it.he told me yesterday that he'd rather the two of them move into a studio apartment and he can just deal with her so that she can die in her own bed. i'm really tempted to let him do it, but that would be a catastrophe, he has a very low patience threshold, constantly loses his temper, and isn't able to give any sort of structure to her life. i'm just feeling like i'm watching a very slow-moving trainwreck and i'm tied to the rails."," through all of this, remember to take care of yourself. you can't control what your bf does, and it may be better for you to take a step back and let him realize what he needs to do. he's in denial right now, but he won't be for too long. i praise you for your dedication to this family. alzheimer's is a wild ride!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ek96ll/super_frustrated_with_this_whole_process/,Super frustrated with this whole process
"hi everyone, just found this sub. we put my mother in law in an alzheimer's facility today, even though she did not want to go, crying and fighting, but we decided it was best for her own safety. after a few incidents where she left all four burners on the stove going for many hours, including a red hot skillet on one of them, we decided it was time, and she just couldn't live alone any longer. there have been numerous incidents that involved her driving and getting lost, not being able to recall her name or address, and spending hundreds of dollars on groceries thinking her children were still little, so we felt that this was a good decision. she was devastated to have to leave her beloved cat, and was extremely distressed when we left.the facility we chose is very nice, very very expensive (&gt;$6.5k per month), and seems extremely clean and well run. there are many activities, a heated pool that she can use year round, lovely grounds where she can walk or sit, all sorts of dining options, and shopping trips to a nearby shopping center, etc. we thought it seemed like a great place.my wife and i both work in medicine, and felt like the nursing care there was good, but as we left today, my wife was telling her mother that she would bring her bag of crocheting and knitting that she had forgotten to bring to room tomorrow. at that point, one of the nurses took us both aside and said, ""we recommend no visits from family for the first couple of weeks our residents reside here, so it gets them used to their routine, so please don't promise to bring her crocheting or come to visit for a while.""my wife cried all the way home. i was also a little alarmed at how quickly they shuffled us out of the place, telling us not to return for at least 10 days to 2 weeks, and to call first. this sounds a little off to me - i have always encouraged people who put their families in nursing homes or assisted care facilities to drop by unannounced, and as often as they liked, to keep a good eye on what is going on there. but i have no experience with alzheimer's or memory care facilities, and i am not sure if this is normal or not. is there anyone here that can advise me if this seems common or normal at all? this has been a horrible day, and i'm at my wit's end. looks like i have a huge learning curve ahead of me. thanks."," we were told the same thing by a home that was abusing my grandmother.   any facility that doesn't want family to visit is, in my opinion, likely neglecting or mistreating residents.   the red flag is especially ""call before,""  this is so they can make sure she's clean,  dressed,  and not, as we found my grandma,  asleep in a wheelchair wearing a hospital gown while it's below freezing outside in the dining room 2 hours after breakfast.

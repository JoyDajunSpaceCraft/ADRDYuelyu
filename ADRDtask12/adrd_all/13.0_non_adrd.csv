"hi, i am an mba student in nyc and am working on developing software to help physicians detect early mental decline in elderly patients by easily allowing loved-ones/caregivers/etc to remotely report any changes to the patient's doctor(s). my father-in-law had frontotemporal dementia and i know how frustrated everyone was with the ""system"". ideally our software will help: \- identify signs of early mental decline in patients  \- suggest potentially inappropriate medication (beers criteria)  \- work to improve medical adherence in patients  \- allows families to plan accordingly (will, financial planning, etc. through appropriate resources)  \- more...we are actively developing this software and need to know if there is interest in this idea. would you (as a caregiver) like to see something like this in a doctors office? would it make/have made your life easier? would it have helped the patient at all? this is an important step in developing the software so any thoughts would be 110% appreciated! thank you in advance for any thoughts you may give :)sincerely,joe", i think it is a lofty goal but would be helpful. my sibling and i live relatively close to our parents (about a half hour for my sibling and 90 minutes for me). i stay with them when they aren’t doing well and i know both of their mental health is declining along with their physical health. the most important part to me would be the ability to actually identify valid resources for help.glad to know people are trying to make things better out there.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/d1rvbt/looking_for_feedback_from_the_community_to_help/,,Looking for feedback from the community to help people.
"i've been caring for my mother for about 5 years now. she has undergone chemo, radiation and two major surgeries for anal and bowel cancer. right now she has an ileostomy and is cancer free (so far) but i know it won't last long. she's all i have as far as family goes. i'm pretty lucky, despite all this, that mom has no dementia or any other mental issues so we get to have great conversations and enjoy each other. but she's in her 80s and the years have finally worn her down. it's been a particularly bad winter with nearly a dozen trips to emergency and major surgery. but the thing is, things have improved. she's mobile again and most days doing fairly well. this has been a bad week regarding pain for mom so it's hard to watch and seems to have pushed me to my limit. there really isn't much i can do to help her except keep her safe and clean. it's broken me.  but i'm starting to feel so tired. so incredibly tired, i've begun to fantasize about life without her. i find myself sitting down at the bus station looking at the time table to see where buses are going. sometimes i don't even know how i ended up there. i'll just be sitting there wondering what living in any random city would be like.   i think i'm just looking for a safe place to vent and maybe connect with a few others who understand and maybe share some dark humour and amusing stories to help get through the bad patches."," believe it or not, and i hope it helps, your post actually was the first bit of hope & encouragement i have had all day. just to hear that someone was out there who had dealt with radiation and major surgery for those kinds of cancers, and an ileostomy, and in her 80s.... and she is still alive, mobile, doing fairly well sometimes, able to enjoy your company.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/d0niz2/not_sure_where_to_start_bad_week/,,Not sure where to start - bad week
"mom has dementia, which is sometimes mild, sometimes worse. tonight i went to quite some trouble to make her a delicious and nutritious dinner. when i served it to her, she complained that it was the same thing she had last night, and she is tired of always eating the same thing. i explained to her that i hadn't made that particular dish in months, but i would get her something else if she wanted me to. she said no, she would manage, but i can tell she thinks it is the same dinner as last night, and is mad at me. she is poking at it, and every now and again i hear her complaining to herself. i don't know how to react when she acts this way. there is no reasoning with her and her dementia. any advice is greatly appreciated."," try having her keep a log of what she eats, written in her own handwriting. you will have to be very diligent to get out the log and guide her after every meal. when she inquires why, tell her it's to help you keep track so you remember what you gave her. then, the next time she thinks she's had the same thing, pull out the log. she can't very well argue with her own handwriting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/czuz2s/dealing_with_moms_altered_reality/,,Dealing with Mom's altered reality
"hello, i’m a 19 year old female and i take care of my 76 year old grandfather with alzheimer’s monday-thurs from 7am-6pm while my mom is at work. i also help her with him when she gets home and watch him on the weekends while runs errands, wants to go out, or take my little sister to the pool, etc. my grandfather was kicked out of his house by his wife, who knew he had the disease but got mad he didn’t take his medicine so the two of my aunts had him at their house for a few days but said she can’t take care of him because they both are sickly or whatever that means. something is always wrong with them. they pressured my mom into taking him so she did. this is was in early january. since i was not in school or working at the time she took him in, i guess that meant i was going to be the one to start taking care of him while i was already watching my 4 year old sister monday-fri. i thought my mom would eventually put him in a nursing home and i’d be able to find a job and be in enrolled in some college courses by now but it’s been eight months of no progress. in these past eight months, he’s wandered out of the house four times, two of them being when he was with me because i overslept and cops had to be called. social workers then of course have to get involved and i almost got charged with elderly abuse. i talked with one of the social workers who came to my house and she told me they took my name off the and put my moms on it instead case because she would ignore their calls when it happened the first time. this angered my mom and we got into an argument about it because she thinks i’m being selfish for not caring that she could go to jail for elderly abuse when i was the one who was here when he left. i do care and i would hate to see her be charged. i cried and cried that day because i felt so guilty but i didn’t ask for her to put all of this on me. i can barely talk to the man because there’s a language barrier, he can’t feed himself, can’t walk, and is incompetent now. every time i mentioned how i felt alone to her and how taking care of him and staying inside the house all day was taking a toll on me, she just stayed silent or told me we wouldn’t be able to live if it was for him. i honestly think she doesn’t want to put him in a nursing home so she can keep his social security check to and his savings to pay bills that she says she can’t pay now even though she was before he moved in. i’m tired, i feel depressed, worthless, alone, and i’m starting to have some suicidal thoughts but i feel guilty for feeling that way because of my mom so i try to ignore them but i can’t anymore. all she does is make me feel bad about not wanting to take care of him anymore and wanting to focus on improving my mental health which i’ve already had problems with before him moving in. i don’t have anyone to talk to about it and i’m afraid i’ll just be told i’m being ungrateful since she feeds me and buys me clothes and maybe i am but i want to be in school, i want to work, and i want to have a social life, i want to feel alive. this is too much for me and i feel like i’m trapped in a dark hole. me and my mom got into another argument yesterday and i cried for hours until i fell asleep, woke up and cried again. i’m thinking about leaving and moving in with my grandma because i can’t take this much longer. caregiving has ruined me."," another update: i got a weekend job and i’m most likely starting school in january too! of course, when i told my mom that i had applied to the job she was was saying stuff like “is it really worth it?” and “i don’t think you should be working”. to me it is, i get three days out of the house and i get a little money to myself..the day of my interview she was already complaining about having to take me to work to when it’s not even a 10 minute drive.  now that i’ll have a little money i’m going to try and save for a car.  now as for my grandpa, he’s been on the waking up in the early morning, getting out of his bed, dirtying up the house, leaving pooped in diapers everywhere, turning every single light on, and one morning he left the sink water running while i was sleeping and flooded the kitchen. i need to fix my sleeping schedule, i’ve been waking up later than he does so i guess it is partly my fault for not being awake when he’s doing all of that but it’s still stressful. every morning i just clean, clean, clean and then my mom gets home and let’s my 4 year old sister dirty it up some more and leaves meto clean it the next day. i’m honestly just starting to feel like a personal maid. apparently, she’s going to puerto rico too next month and leaving me with him for five days, two of those days being days i work. i told her it was wrong of her to assume it would be alright and not ask and she got mad..said it was no different from me watching him while he’s at work. she’s saying my uncle is going to come help but he has to work. i just think it’s messed up. still no progress on the home health aide either. she doesn’t want to pay for it even though he gets a $800 social security check and has his savings which is a decent amount. every time i mention the home health aide she says “and who’s going to pay for that?”. somehow she can pay for a trip to puerto rico and california with his money but not assistance for him. i don’t know what her deal is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cy1tih/19_year_old_caregiver_for_grandparentmy_world_is/,,19 year old caregiver for grandparent...my world is falling apart and mom is stressing me out.
"im not exactly a caregiver as in living with my dad but i do take care of him remotely and when i'm there. my dad is 73 and is struggling with memory loss, poor self esteem, lack of control over emotions, lack of purpose, and loneliness. he's been diagnosed late is life with adult adhd but is very much against medications and very resistant to counselling. he loses his wallet, keys, and personal calendar almost daily and sometimes has to get a new wallet with all the new cards because he can never find it. he says it's been getting worse and his memory has been getting worse. i'm afraid he's getting dementia but it could also be adhd too although he's never sought further diagnosis or treatment. he just gets so down on himself and his disorganization and i notice how he's constantly putting himself down or being negative. i just feel so so heartbroken for him to be living his days like this.i recently moved for a job 3 hours away so i try to call often and give him tips or just listen to him tell me about what he lost today and how he's looked everywhere but everything is a mess. i've helped him clean up his mess of a basement and kitchen multiple times but he just has a main issue with lack of mindfulness and too much clutter. he's very concerned and hopeless about his life but he's also resistant to getting professional help so idk what to do. i just want him to be happy and not so hard on himself most of his days. btw, he wants to learn how to use the computer or phone but also is afraid and will often take hours to learn the basics only to forget it soon after. i once helped him buy glasses online and he spent eight hours only to have the wrong prescription sent. ugh i just feel so bad for him!!can anyone offer encouragement or tips?"," you'll need to carve out time to go with him to his doctor's appointments. it sounds like mild cognitive impairment, or he might be slipping into the first stages of dementia. i don't think the adhd is a factor here, this sounds like a memory and organizational loss issue. you can ask for a neuro cognitive assessment by neurologist, which will give you some insight about what you're dealing with. however, since he's resistant to meds, then chances are he won't take the medication offered. still, it's not a bad place to start.that he's resistant to taking medications makes all of this much harder!  i took care of someone just like this. it was a series of dwindling abilities, and things went down for her rather quickly. she and her family chose to move her into assisted living with a hired caregiver who comes in 3 afternoons a week.  she will probably be moved into memory care soon.you can ask the doctor for a referral to home health (covered by medicare), which will send out a nurse to visit weekly, as well as a social worker to do an intake at the beginning. however, home health won't cover the other parts of what he needs, which is housekeeping, errand running, and keeping his calendar up to date, as well as providing meals.  that part will be out of pocket, and on average, will cost anywhere from $15 - $25 and hour, with the $25 usually being from a caregiving agency.he might be resistant to either the caregiver help, or moving into assisted living or memory care in part because he's afraid that he doesn't have the money. so now is a good time to delve into his finances, and learn about his assets. i highly recommend working with a financial planner, if you feel you might need the help. chances are, if he owns his house, it's also his biggest asset. you might point out to him that staying where he is over the long run is problematic because of the challenge and expense of maintaining the house as his mental faculties are slipping. offer to bring him up to where you live, and go look at a few places, as well as finding out who the best doctors would be, and see how he can change his medicare providers.see if there's enough money to move him first, then sell the house once he gets settled. find a place near you. it'll make your life a lot easier if he's close by.  see if there's a senior housing specialist -someone who knows all the facilities and can help you match his needs and assets to the right place.good luck!  i know this is hard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cx9uu7/resources_and_emcouragemt_needed_for_dad_with_adhd/,,Resources and Emcouragemt Needed for Dad with ADHD

(pt is late or doesn’t come at all...  i don’t really understand how any of that can even happen but it has been.)are there any awesome resources you all can direct me to?  how to cope, what’s the right thing to do, should i get licensed in something so the dr can discharge him to me eventually?  we’re just really struggling to do the right thing for my fil and also follow the doctors orders."," check with his insurance to see if there’s another home rehab place that they contract with. i had to do that for my grandma because the therapist ignored her limitations until her legs buckled during a session. once you find that out check with whoever sent the referral for therapy to see if they can send it to whoever you chose. otherwise, you can try contacting the home rehab to see why the therapist never seems to show at the agreed upon time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cibcqu/looking_for_advice_on_pt_with_dementia/,,Looking for advice on PT with dementia.

"i am not a caregiver currently, but i have an ageing relative i believe is in the early stages of dementia, and they have no other reliable close support, so i can clearly see the writing on the wall that caring for her is in my not-too-distant future.  i have a very complicated family, with lots of estrangements and unaddressed resentments. i was raised by my grandparents, and their children have always resented me. my grandparents had a very toxic abusive and controlling relationship and separated badly. my husband and i were left to take care of my grandfather during a bad injury after a fall several years ago, because his children didn’t even care if he was alive (before you condemn them completely, he was terribly abusive and controlling) he inevitably turned that abusiveness on us, and began trying to cause problems in my marriage, in my relationship with my grandmother, and caring for him destroyed me emotionally. by the time he cut me out of his life  (once he didn’t need me to care for him anymore, of course) for refusing to break off my relationships, i was a wreck. during his last illness and his death, one of his children took over everything and basically blew up the family controlling information, visitation, and attendance at his funeral. they looted his property while he lay dying, and continued to steal from the estate and to stall proceedings to rob their sibling of their share, dragging it out for years while everyone else watched in horror.i know i’m in for a hell of a fight trying to get my grandmother properly cared for and i am scared to death to go through this again. i’m starting to see signs of her slipping cognitively and i’m nowhere near ready to go through this again."," i’m glad she’s still taking care of herself. this sounds like where my grandmother was several years ago. you are right realistically it’s not going to get any better. it can be super frustrating having to explain things over and over again, but, for me, it was worth all the frustration when she had her lucid moments. again i am so sorry that you and your grandmother are going through this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cg87tl/new_to_this_scared_to_death/,,"New to this, scared to death."

"hey, i'm looking for some ideas to help motivate/encourage a client of mine to stick to her shower schedule. quick backstory: i'm a behavior consultant, and i work on developing person centered behavior plans for staff to implement in their interactions with clients. my clients often have dementia, traumatic brain injuries, or other neurodegenerative disorders, so they often aren't competent or capable of being held accountable to their behavior, so we turn to how care staff interact with them to lessen unwanted behavior. &amp;#x200b;so i currently have a client that has a bathing schedule during the week, but she will often decline the assistance of her caregivers during her scheduled time slot. she is in a minimal assistance apartment complex, and care staff only help with bathing during the early part of that day. she will ask for help later on according to her own schedule, but the staff are often busy and unavailable to help (only two staff on shift at a time). when they can't help, she reports to her pcp that her caregivers are not showing up for her scheduled shower times, even though this isn't true. staff aren't sure why she declines her scheduled showers, but they believe it is an attempt to gain control and/or make them look bad to her pcp when she reports ""staff aren't doing their job."" i'm looking for any tips or ways you guys have found useful for encouraging your clients/residents you care for to shower. generally this will need to be something staff can implement and encourage. no punishment such as withdraw of any activity or service can be used because we focus on positive reinforcement only."," pcp=person centered plan, correct? if that’s true, then the person you are supporting should be the one deciding their shower schedule. think about it this way: you and i are both able to shower when we please. some days we might want a morning shower, some days we might want an evening shower, some days we might way both or neither. but we have the ability to decide and everyone has a different preference.this is an example of fitting the person to the plan, not the plan to the person. from my perspective, the best solution would be to adjust staffing to this individual’s goals and hygiene preferences, even if that makes it more challenging for you.in the field, it’s not about making staffing easy, it’s about enhancing the person’s life and supporting them how they would like to be supported.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/cbxp6y/help_motivating_client_to_shower/,,Help motivating client to shower

"last september, my grandma was living in a care facility. the place should have been closed down, it was terrible. she deteriorated so rapidly, i fought and fought for her to come home. i said i would stay with her. we finally got her home and i have been caring for her 5 days a week since then. i feel blessed for each and every moment. it has been hard. i cried myself to sleep, praying for god to take her many, many times. i’m telling you this part for those of you that are struggling. there is an end. and now that i’m here, i wouldn’t change the last 8 months of my life for anything. i had to leave my husband and son during that time. it was so hard for all of us, but we got through it, having learned such valuable lessons along the way. at around 2 am on wednesday, i awoke to her breathing differently. i knew instantly it was the “death rattle” i had read about. i will tell you right now, for those who haven’t heard it, it was terrifying. our hospice nurse and i had talked about it before but i don’t think she did a very good job preparing me for what it was like. thankfully, by around 10am, we had given her some levsin and it’s been under control since then. everything else, however, is very hard to watch. she is breathing like she’s on a machine. just mechanical almost. we have to do all the things to keep her comfortable; eye drops, pain meds, lorazepam, moving her, etc. she has dementia and i didn’t think anything would be harder than seeing her during her fits, but this is. this is hard. not knowing what she’s thinking. not knowing if she’s hot or cold (she has been fluctuating between high fever and clammy). not knowing if she wants to tell us something. she is in a coma. some might say none of that applies but i just wonder, what if? my sisters and mom are here with me. my grandma is 96 but has more friends than i do😂. she has many visitors talking to her and telling her how much we all love her. but seeing her like this is almost more than i can handle. does it get worse? does she just slip away peacefully? does the (god forbid) death rattle come back despite medication? i’m terrified for what’s to come but also anxious for it to be over so she can finally rest. the last few months have been so hard for her. i’ve done so much research about death these last few months and feel like i’m so inadequately prepared."," it's been just over a week since you posted this. i'm hoping that whatever has happened since then, you're handling ok. my grandpa had to go to the er after he had a hard time speaking and fell. we thought stroke. turns out he had stage 4 brain cancer (9 lesions) and lung cancer. he was in the hospital for a few days, elected to have brain surgery to remove the largest tumor that was affecting most of his function loss. from there he went to rehab for 2 weeks to regain some skills while he waited to heal long enough to get radiation. the whole time he kept saying he wanted to go home. the day he got out of rehab, he went to my parents' house. the whole family was there, he had a home cooked meal, he played with the dog and we watched his favorite show. i believe he was where he wanted to be and was tired of being a burden to us. he went to bed that night, slept almost the whole next day except to eat, and the second morning after he was unresponsive. he entered hospice comatose and remained that way for 5 days until his death. i had never had any family members pass, let alone been there for it. but on the last day, there was a feeling that we all knew. i stayed despite only being there to bring my grandma dinner and leave. my mom drove back up around midnight. he passed around 1:05 am. some of the things we saw that clued us in: he developed a foot and eye twitch. his lips turned purple and began to curl under his teeth. his hands and feet were much colder. and his breath had a distinctly raspier sound, with more pauses. about 12:15 my grandma called the nurse because his breathing was slow and shallow. the nurse told us his breathing had moved from his diaphragm to his chest, usually an end stage indicator. she gave him more morphine, ativan and halidol ahead of schedule and told us that how he responded would be our biggest clue of what would happen. within 30 minutes, his breathing had gotten slower and slower with more pauses. his last few dozen breaths were very shallow and spaced further apart. and then the next one just never came. i have deep empathy for you. it's so hard i still don't fully comprehend what happened myself. but at least we felt it was very comfortable for him, as much as could be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/bvdxlx/my_grandma_is_dying_and_i_just_need_to_talk_to/,,My grandma is dying and I just need to talk to some strangers about it.

"hey all, this is my first post here, so please excuse how long this is. i am 24 years old and my mother is the primary caregiver for my 84 year old grandmother who has pretty severe dementia. my grandmother lives with my mother and father full time. she's lived with my parents for about 2 and 1/2 years. before that, she still lived in her home with my mom and i rotating nights staying with her. we did that for about a year and a half until we were both totally burnt out. for context, i also have two older brothers who are married with kids. i'm my parents only daughter. i'm married, but without kids, so i try to help my mom wherever i can with her caregiver responsibilities (drs. appointments, ""babysitting"" for date nights/vacations, etc.). my mom and i have always had a pretty close relationship, but it is starting to feel pretty strained lately. my mother is not in great physical health and hasn't been for quite some time. she is 63 years old, overweight and a heavy smoker. she is starting to have a hard time with mobility and having some pretty serious breathing problems. it's no secret why she is having these issues, with being overweight and a heavy smoker. we have a family business that we all work for and yesterday she was in such bad shape as far as breathing that she couldn't come into work. she was wheezing and gasping for air to the point that she couldn't walk more than a few feet. i feel like i have tried everything to try to get her to better physical health. i've offered to go on walks with her, help her with meal planning and give her advice on quitting smoking. i so badly want her to start taking care of herself better, but my mother is extremely strong willed and stubborn. last month, i ended up having to take her to the er because of extremely high blood pressure, like stroke territory high. she didn't tell me until we were at the er that the reason that her blood pressure was so high was because she hadn't gotten a refill on one of her blood pressure medications. she knew all along that that was what was going on, but didn't tell anyone in the family until i was in the er with her. i know that taking care of my grandmother has left my mom feeling extremely burnt out and that she is no longer taking care of herself because of it. after the er event, i told her that she needed to get to a gp immediately to get her bp medication figured out and to see about possibly taking medication for depression. i know that everyone is different, but we have a family history of depression (i take an ssri myself) and i felt like she should talk to her gp about her own mental health. the gp said that she sounded like she was dealing with caregiver burn out and prescribed her welbutrin; my mom told me that she would most definitely take it. last week i found out that she hasn't taken a single pill. with the pulmonary issues she was having yesterday, i told her that she needed to get in to see someone asap. i ended up having to call around today to try to get her an appointment because she said that she would ""call sometime next week"". everyone in our family is trying so hard to support her and help her, but she refuses help. my sil and i have offered so many times to take my grandmother for an evening during the week or for a weekend. we've suggested that she hire in home help a couple of days a week to help take some of the burden off of her but she refuses (and it isn't a money issue, my parents are fairly well off). because my mom is so burnt out, she is barely able to take care of her physical and mental health anymore. i am just so frustrated and at a loss because i don't know what to do anymore. i love her and she is my mother, and this may be terrible to say, but i am having a hard time being sympathetic to her anymore. she complains all the time, but doesn't take any of the help that is offered or bothers to help herself. her issues are starting to weigh on me and the rest of the family. i thought i would post here because i don't have the perspective of a fulltime caregiver. it is such a damn hard job, and i frankly don't have that life experience yet. members who are caregivers, what kind of help/support would you want in this situation? does anyone have any advice for how to help care for a caregiver?"," this is a really tough situation, when the caregiver is in denial about having pushed herself to the breaking point and seems to be committed to pushing even further.without knowing too much about your family, is it possible your mother (in spite of evidence to the contrary) is convinced that she’s the only one who can do it? is it possible that in some way she’s internalized her caregiver role to the point that she doesn’t know how else or who else to be? sometimes caregivers have codependency issues. that would be something i’d might read up on to see if it applies here (and maybe it doesn’t).in the meantime can you and your other family members sit down with your mother and share your concerns with her? it’ll be harder for her to dismiss all of you as a group. i’d ask her something like “mom, you know we’re all prepared to help [on these days with these specific tasks]...is there something that would make you comfortable enough to let us start? can we at least agree to doing this for one month and see how it goes?”i’m sorry, i know it’s so hard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/bp1brr/being_a_caregiver_for_a_caregiver/,,Being a Caregiver for a Caregiver

"this is the first time posting here, so first, i just want to say hello to all you amazing and selfless people. caregiving sure isn't easy, but our loved ones are so worth it.so my question is, does anyone have any advice on how to deal with bathroom obsessions with elderly patients with dementia? my grandmother is 93 years old and had a stroke (occipital infarction) about a few  months ago. ever since, she has developed an obsession with needing to pee, with which she needs assistance. this happens in 1-3 minute intervals at bedtime, but 2 minutes is usually the average. so, after she ""pees"", i help her get back in bed, then she'll lie down for a minute or three, and then pop back up to repeat the process. it's like the movie, ""groundhog day,"" only instead of repeating the same day over and over again, we're repeating the same few minutes over and over. she will do this almost all night until about 4 or 5 in the morning before finally passing out from exhaustion. by 7am, she is back up and at it again. she doesn't even pee most of the time and when she does, it's just a few tiny drops. it's much worse at nighttime. during the day, she does it in 5-10 minute intervals. her doctor confirmed that she does not have a uti, bladder or kidney infection, so it isn't that. she is also taking bladder control medication, but it isn't working, so we're pretty sure it's just ocd/anxiety. i'll ask her if she remembers going to the bathroom just a minute before and she always says, ""no, i don't remember. i need to pee."" if we tell her she just peed and to lie back down, she will comply, but will pop right back up a minute later. she is fast too, so you can't take your eye off her for one second, because she will try to get up on her own and would fall without assistance. in the middle of the night, she gets extremely loopy from her medications. i'm sure she is also sundowning. sometimes, she forgets how to walk. last night, i had to pick up her and carry her back to the bed. i'm a 130 lb female with a back injury and the chronic pain is really starting to affect my ability to work. thankfully, we have a pretty large family, which means me, my mom, my grandmother's other two adult children and my uncle's wife all take turns  taking night and day duty, so that makes it much easier. i am grateful for that. her current doctor wants to increase her xanax dosage to three 0.5 mgs a day and i feel like it's just making her even more loopy. her doctor also gives her trazadone at night for sleep and anxiety. i worry that the lack of sleep is eventually going to take its toll on my grandmother's body and mind. the human body can only function for so long without sleep. it's also physically and mentally taking a toll on my family and me. i love my grandma so much and it breaks my heart to see her like this. just a year ago, she and i went on weekly lunch dates together. it's such a stark contrast to her current condition, post-stroke. she also helped me through the hardest time in my life when i went through an unwanted divorce a few years ago. i owe it to her to make her remaining time here on earth as comfortable as possible, but my family and i are grasping at straws over this bathroom issue. does anyone have any advice? i apologize for the length of this post, but from the bottom of my heart, i thank you for reading. tl;drmy 93 grandmother with dementia is obsessed with going to the bathroom to pee, which she needs assistance with. she does this every 1-3 minutes throughout the night and hardly ever pees and when she does, it's only a few drops. during the day, it's every 5-10 minutes. she does not have a uti, bladder or kidney infection, which is confirmed by her doctor. after she goes to the bathroom, she lies back down, only to pop right back up minutes later. at night, she is so loopy, she forgets how to walk and i have had to carry her back to her bed. i already have a back injury which is affecting my ability to work. my family and i are so worn out. any advice would be greatly appreciated!", diapers.  change them in the morning.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/b7qpzy/elderly_grandmother_is_obsessed_with_going_to_the/,,Elderly grandmother is obsessed with going to the bathroom every 1-3 minutes at night and 5-10 minutes in the day.

"sorry my first post is on a gross topic...my mom's been in assisted living for about two years. i've been doing her laundry every week, and it hasn't been a big problem. she's used the ""moderate"" poise pads for years, with regular underwear.over the past couple of months, though, she's apparently leaking a lot more and her underwear is getting soaked around where the pad is. some weeks i bring home 15 pairs of undies that are all damp and stained pretty badly, that i feel i have to wash in a separate washer load. it doesn't seem to be result of a uti--she's on preventative medication and is monitored for them pretty regularly. i'm thinking it's just the kind of incontinence to be expected with dementia progressing.i took in some disposable underwear for her to try, at least overnight when the leakage seems to be worst. but she's only used one, which an aide made her put on after a shower, at my request. we've talked about them several times, she seemed to think they were a good idea, she just can't remember to use them overnight instead of the regular panties. i thought transitioning her into them gradually would be a good idea, but now i'm thinking it wasn't such a good idea.maybe it's time to just take all the regular ones away, and leave only the disposable ones in the drawer where the regular ones used to be. if there isn't anything to remember and no decision to make, maybe that would be easier?or, am i being a big baby about washing the underwear?", i would try just replacing all underwear with disposables and also talking with her physician about bladder control issues. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/b71cgq/transitioning_to_depends/,,Transitioning to Depends?

"so, i took care of my grandmother who had dementia and was schizoprenic for seven years. it started when i was 14 and ended when i was 22.  six months before she passed i had a breakdown and asked my parents to put her in a nurssery home. it made me few a bit guilt, but i couldn't look after her anymore, i was always tired and she needed someone to be by her side 24/7. one the last month i took care of her i did not sleep at all because she would spend the entire night walking through the house, slamming doors and repeting some weird stuff that she had been saying for years (she no longer remember how to speak portugues, or native language), i had classes during the morning and during the afternoons she was awake and beeing loud. &amp;#x200b;during those years i was her primary caregiver, because my father had work, my mom was a mess with no patience that honestly made my job worst. she would scream and start fights with my grandma and i would need to interving so it wouldn't became somenthing phisical. my older brother never did anything. it was me who had to change diapers, bath her, give food, medicene, take her to her bedroom when she got lost and clean after her.  all of these while suffering the fact that my grandma did no longer recall who i was and seeing her looking less and less with her old self.&amp;#x200b;anyways, after she went to the nurssery home i was in a really bad place mentally, when i was starting to get better she died and everything went to shit again. a year later i am trying to get a job ( a internship actually, that i need in other to graduate college) and everywhere i go they focused on the fact that i have no fucking experience. but what about the whole fucking years that i spend being a caretaker? i can't put this on my resume and obviously it would be weird to talk about it on a job interview, but it annoys me so much that all the work i've done won't really count for nothing. &amp;#x200b;sorry for the poorly written rant, i find it difficult to translate my thoughts to english."," i'm sorry for the passing of your grandmother and what a stressful experience  you had dealing with her death and caring for her despite your family dynamics.i think it's valid to disclose you did caregiving--whether you mention that it's your grandmother or not is up to you, but as everyone else has mentioned, the skills and knowledge you pick up as a caregiver is invaluable and helpful for many aspects of any type of job that's out there. i tell everyone including my workplace that i take care of mom, which was a valid reason for me to cut down on my hours, but they also realize that when it comes to the elderly and caregiving, i'm an expert, which helps me in my job specifically because we are a medical information company.now, believe it or not, in another lifetime, i worked as a graphic designer (amongst many other types of jobs) and i can tell you right now, if you want experience in graphic design, it's pretty simple--just volunteer at nonprofits (or anywhere--it's just that nonprofits are usually hurting for help) specifically as a graphic designer. if you're at the point that you are doing internships, then you should've amassed a decent portfolio.however, even if you're going to do work for free to get experience, just think that probably most of your classmates are in the same boat as you, so you really have to ""up"" your game by having a great portfolio and have a thick skin (rejection is par for the course), writing/emailing to all the nonprofits or advertising or design agencies you want to get your foot in the door to. here's where you make sure you do a spellcheck and grammar check to make sure your email queries to find ""work"" won't be automatically moved to the trash folder because you didn't even bother to do that much--probably be good to have a friend or better yet, a teacher, give it the ""once over"" to make sure it's up to par because when you're writing, you're sometimes too close to what you wrote and can't see glaring or small mistakes. as other redditors mentioned, your english is fine--for here, but not when you're trying to find a job or internship (perhaps if you have a ton of outstanding experience with a matching portfolio to show for it, some misspellings and the occasional grammatical error in your emails or resume might be negligible, but better to be safe than sorry).with your expertise in caregiving, you might want to try different nonprofit facilities that care for the elderly (like there are some churches that do this kind of thing) and see if they would like to have a volunteer graphic designer for their newsletters and such (they're nonprofits, they usually send newsletters that double as a fundraising piece).but more importantly, look after yourself--keep sane... it sounds like you are a positive force in this world that could benefit from your skills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/b6oomy/im_23_and_have_no_working_experience/,,I'm 23 and have no working experience
"my mom has been struggling with advanced lupus cerebritis and the effects of dementia for the past year or so. i've been her full-time caretaker, and both sides of my family have virtually disappeared off the map (certainly in my life). i spend about 98 percent of my waking hours helping her. recently her rheumatologist has actually said she's showing serious signs of improvement, according to his data.... unfortunately that does not coincide with her experience. her memory and cognition continue to decline, and it's like watching someone turn into an empty person. the next step is to get her to a neurologist, but that is several hours away. she barely stays up for 20 minutes at a time. a two hour trip would exhaust her, and make her basically unable to perform the tests that the neurologist would need. &amp;#x200b;on top of that, we have to wait until september to see the neurologist. it's the next possible appointment. &amp;#x200b;anyone who has dealt with a loved one with dementia/memory/depression issues, probably knows what i'm venting about... but her hourly fixations on the most tiny details have really worn me down. i'll do it for as long as i need to, but she worries about the same exact thing, every few hours. whether it's toilet paper amount, taxes, her ipad not being fully charged, etc-- but she will fixate/forget/worry constantly and i can only imagine what it's like for her, because it's an exhausting loop for me. i feel bad for feeling bad, but that's just the way it is. &amp;#x200b;i feel like her family has ignored the difficult parts of this situation, i feel like the doctors (to a certain extent) have as well. i feel so crummy not being 100% tolerant of the symptoms of her illness, but i can't ignore it. &amp;#x200b;/rant"," how can you be 100% tolerant of symptoms that stem from something that is causing your mom's decline in health? don't beat yourself up--it's normal, and who knows how long this period of adjustment to your new reality is going to take.you're a shining light for all the fair weather relatives who vanished at your mom's moment of need. so sad, but thank god your mom has you, although you really need to take care of yourself as well, either seriously getting help, support groups, or respite care, which most insurances cover, based on medical necessity, which probably applies in your mom's case. do you have medical poa? if not, try calling your mom's insurance with her by your side so that she can give them permission to talk to you to ask about respite care...about this neurologist who is hours away--are you in a remote area where there are no other neurologists in your area? health insurances are obligated to negotiate something like a ""single case agreement"" to out-of-network providers who are closer to the patient when there are none within a reasonable distance (20 miles? you'll have to check with the insurance).as far as your mom's deteriorating dementia, you don't have to take anything she says to heart--just humor her, agree with her or distract her with something else that is more palatable to you. when she says something for the umpteenth time, agree with her for the umpteenth time, and either go through the motions of doing something she will be happy about or distract her to something she will be happy about, like:\-  you think there's not enough toilet paper? here, let's put an extra roll on this shelf.\-  before we start your taxes, how about we brace ourselves for the monumental task in front of us by having an ice cream sundae?!\- hmm, you don't think your ipad is fully charged? if it's showing at 100%, you can show her, or even if it's at 100%, just go ahead and plug that charger in anyways. (if she's on a wheelchair, you can situate the power end of the plug away from her so that she doesn't see that it's not actually plugged in. i don't have a clue whether it makes any difference if you plug in a fully charged ipad; it shouldn't but just in case...)it's gonna take a huge period of adjustment before you can embrace and be at peace with your role in this new chapter of yours and your mom's life.you are now your mom's advocate. even though her rheumatologist says she's better, you need to tell him/her everything that's going on because tests don't catch everything and doctors, i'm sorry to say, are not necessarily going to go out of their way to go outside the lines of what minimal options they're used to, but most of them are open to a little nudge here and there, but you have to be the one to suggest this or that. i don't know much about lupus cerebritis, but for my mom, whom i'm the primary caregiver of (my sister helps out when necessary, her husband and mine, thank god, are supportive), i was the one to suggest physical therapy, whether some meds were necessary, to get memory/dementia testing, etc., and luckily her pcp was accommodating.you have the power!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/b3elek/venting_feeling_helpless/,,venting. feeling helpless.

"i am a enneagram type 1 personality. i knew about my type before i stared caregiving but its taken me years to finally connect the dots of how 1) i became primary caregiver,  2) why i hate doing it, and 3) why i cant quit. plus 4) how i'm moving forward.1) my mom has early onset dementia. my involvement started when i moved to be near her (as did my sibling). i took her to doctors appointments, made sure prescriptions were being filled, dealt with insurance, taxes, appointments etc. as her disease progressed i devoted more time to her - taking her shopping, coming up with activities, arranging events with friends, taking her on vacation, etc. eventually i quit my job. eventully i lived on and off with her. eventually i stopped self-care (food, excercise, doctors) because someone needs to sit next to her always. 2) the enneagram type 1 is often called the perfectionist, or the reformer or the helper. i won't go into detail, but basically the personality type likes to get things done and done well. 1s are relentless and have high standards. this is why i enjoyed getting the paperwork done and finding the ""perfect"" outing. it was satisfying. but this was a role i had defined for myself. no one else in my family was willing to clarify what they were going to do [phrasing is very much type 1], so i ""needed"" to expand my role so my mother had the ""right"" level of care. so i took the reigns until someone else took them. no one did. even after a huge turn in my mother's health (and my perhaps not so obvious shattered mental health) has family actually commited to caring for my mother at even a compromising level of care. (i admit my level is too high, but you can't even lower a level if you're not present or leave whenever you want.) it's also hard because i expect my mom to do the things that will help her (ie listen to me). it is soooooo frustrating to tell her to stand up straight and she just lists to the other side. my most high anxiety is doing excercises with her. her pt is easy, but i get so angry when she simply cant straighten her arms all the way, or shortens the range of motion. i know she as cognitive issues - but it is infuriating that she can't even help herself. she cheats herself. she is capable of so much, but doesnt like to put in the effort. (i know i know i know... it's the personality)3) my family has communication issues. i have mental issues. despite what all the memes say, you (i) can't cut out the toxic nuclear family from my life. i ""have to"" take care of mom. because no one (father or sibling) else is willing to compromise with their lifestyle. ie i believe my father is a type 1 too, but his standards/priorities are different than mine. he wanted to lock her in her room while he worked in the yard.... because the way things look are more important. 4) obviously, this is very frustrating for me. a lot of it i need to work through. for dealing woth my mom i have written down: &gt;my goal as a caretaker is to make her feel comforted. if she's not willing to fight it, i don't need to spin my wheels to fight it. i can fight for her with doctors, clerks, family, etc regarding her needs and wants. but i cant save her. i am working on surgically removing myself from the situation. i need to stop thinking of her money (because she did very well and earned every penny that supports this family) as a factor. previously i thought, why should we pay someone 15/hr when i earn 12/hr at my job? i'll just quit and do it. well, i lost a lot of opportunities, and most of all a sense of self. my sibling can't (chooses not to?) follow through on my simple requests (wednesday evenings for an hour and a half). attempts to have serious discussion have to happen at their convenience, not when the discussion needs to happen.my mom's turn in health (which got better) really showed me how bad i'd gotten. and how much my standards were getting in the way of me. i'm hoping this post will help me move forward. well. that's all. any other type 1s (or other types) have anything to share?"," relatable, but no solutions to offer :/ just company.

"sorry in advance for the lengthy ramblings. i'm 25 years old and i have been living and taking care of my 90yo grandmother for 3 years, in the beginning it was just taking care of her when she broke her hip unexpectedly but then she had a blood clot and what i suspect is brain damage from oxygen deprivation. it honestly could be dementia but in the beginning she didn't know the date or anything but she was still her, could talk about subjects, and was interested in tv. all that changed after the blood clot and she transformed into what she is today. she calls her dead sister all the time, constantly says my name to the point where it seems offensive to me now, stares at the wall, won't watch tv, won't make eye contact and sobs all the time and abruptly stops. i cook her food, bathe her, groom her but she is still able to walk and dress herself (mostly). &amp;#x200b;for the most part, i watch her during the week and my mom, dad and brothers watch her on the weekends. but the situation is precarious to say the least, my dad is not the most patient person and has never gotten along with my grandmother, my brothers are selfish and lazy and won't help to the point which is needed and will only help when she asks to go to the bathroom etc (which she doesn't ask for she will just pee in her pants), and my mother is disabled herself and cannot handle the physical aspect if my gram was to fall. all of this weights on me and makes it hard for me to not stress about it on my time off from watching her. my sister lives with me and my grandmother and cannot handle my grandmother at all. they never had a great relationship and i don't blame my sister for not having a lot of patience with her on top of working a lot with a long commute. &amp;#x200b;overall, i just feel that the situation is getting worse and worse and that everyone is so frustrated with her (myself included) that we need help. unfortunately, there is no one else to help out, my mom is an only child, we can't afford a caregiver and the only other option is a cheap nursing home which i feel would be a death sentence for her. i feel the time slipping away and completely trapped with these circumstances. i want to go back to school to get my masters but i am very scared of leaving gram with my mom since i feel that the toll will honestly kill my mom. on top of everything, her doctor doesn't believe anything we ever have to say, when she was short of breath with the blood clot he told us it was normal for someone with her lung condition (interstitial lung disease) to have that happen. i genuinely think she would benefit from antidepressants or anxiety medication since she is so nervous all the time that she shakes but he doesn't ever see that in the 5 minutes he sees her every months so he refuses to give us anything. &amp;#x200b;honestly i feel that i'm at the end of my tether, i don't know what to do to help her, make her feel better and she frustrates me so much that i can barely hold it together. and today has been such a hard day that i felt that i needed to vent.&amp;#x200b;if anyone has any idea about anxiety medication and their effect on older people or tips, they would be greatly appreciated. also on a side note, i can't imagine how hard it must be for some of you not having any support and my heart goes out to any of you. you guys are my heros for doing this alone."," there's an option of a sort of ""day care"" for the elderly, where she can go off during the day and still come to the comfort of her home at night. if you feel a nursing home would break her, this might be a better middle ground.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/anuqsx/at_the_end_of_my_rope/,,At the end of my rope

"i’m a 23 year old female living with my 87 year old grandmother as her full time caregiver. she used to be in assisted living where she was thriving for a pretty long time, and she was happy, but her needs eventually exceded what they were able to provide and the costs of keeping her there simply got too high after her longterm care insurance ran out. my mom (her only daughter) doesn’t want her going into a nursing home, and since i was still living at home and my boyfriend was basically homeless and just staying with us, she told us if we moved into a house with granny, she’d cover the rent. moving in with my mom or my older brother were not really options because they are both homeowners who don’t have handicap accessible houses. so we had to find a place that was accessible.things were ugly for a bit and now we pay a portion of the rent because my mom decided the rent was too high (a common problem here in co), so now i work two jobs to cover that, plus care for my grandma full time while my boyfriend works (military) and is going to school. its hard to find others my age who are in a situation similar to mine, and people who can relate and offer support. my mom treats me like shit because “i’m not giving grandma enough care” when i have no experience in this field (she has chf, copd and other lung problems from her husband who was a longtime smoker, and dementia. she is completely dependent on a walker and cannot make her own meals, do her own laundry, or shower herself. we have home health stopping by for her therapy a few days during the week, but i feel i can never leave the house except to go to work out of fear of leaving her alone. i have to be home multiple times a day- rushing home on my lunch breaks to give her lunch and her medications, i can’t go out at night or she won’t have dinner, etc. my boyfriend helps where he can but he is home much less often than i am and is not as familiar with her needs or how to deal with them. while mostly all she does is sleep through the day, and watch tv/read in the evenings, she is still needy and dependent. her appointments are a struggle because i have to load her and her wheel chair into my car (i am very small and not strong lol, and she is heavy set). i try to keep her occupied and enriched during the day but i have depression (have had it for years) and already have a hard time engaging with anyone. she likes to read, but with her demetia, her book options are limited. all i can really do is put on tv land for her and leave her parked in her armchair all day and try to make her interesting meals. i am sure she is lonely and bored, because she was very social and did activities while she was is al, but she doesn’t really let it on.anyway, i just needed to get it off of my chest and hopefully get some words of encouragement. some days i feel satisfied that i’m giving her a better life than she may get in a nursing home, but i’ve been discouraged for a while now that i’m just wasting the young years of my life dealing with a situation well out of my control."," hey, you’re kick ass. i’m 24 and taking care of my 92 year old great-grandma—it is super rare to find other young caregivers in real life but this subreddit is a wonderful thing. you mentioned home health aids?—is she on hospice? i’m here in ca and our hospice provider offers a quite a few services from volunteer visitors during the day, non-denominational religious volunteers/priests, and nurses. i just finished my undergrad but i was gone often up to 12 hours two days a week for school and would agonize that she would fall/need help while i was hours away. i was able to coordinate visits from hospice while i was at school—if she qualifies that would be great to fill in gaps so you don’t have to drive back home from work. time off is really important. you might be able to qualify for respite hours too—so you and your boyfriend and friends can have some quality time. i also know that feeling of feeling as if i’m  not doing enough or feeling as if i’m not the most qualified. this subreddit has really helped me and comforted me in low moments. keep giving her your love—that’s the most significant and vital thing you can do.

"so a little backstory. my husbands grandma has alzheimers. she can still do most things herself but she will forget to eat and the worst symptom is the hallucinations. she frequently thinks people are out to get her and these are brought on by stress. a few months ago she was living on her own with her husband but he got sick.  his health declined very rapidly and he died pretty much within a week of getting sick. obviously, she was a wreck. here is where things get shitty...instead of giving her time to grieve, the family put her in assisted living immediately and sold her home. all she does is cry. she has tried to escape several times and now is in a locked memory ward. she hates it. everytime i go to see her she pleads with me to take her home or to get her out of there. the family had to stop taking her out for lunches and whatnot bc she would refuse to get out of the car to go back in. she also refuses to take her anxiety and depression meds and the facility said they cant slip it to her in food or a drink bc illegal. one of the biggest things that the family does that pisses me off is when she is trying to express herself and tell us how sad she is and how she wants to go home they change the subject. i cant imagine being so depressed and wanting to go home and my family wont acknowledge how i feel. also, she feels the need to show us how she is still capable of taking care if herself. she will recite things she remembers and tell us how she can do everything on her own. it's very desperate. i have a 14 month old son and on xmas she kept trying to pick him up to ""prove"" she can care for him. i let her hold him but shes frail and hes heavy so she could hurt herself. i dont get mad,  i know why shes doing it.my husband and i have asked that we try to find her a new place (we hate the facility she is at, it's very depressing . the one my grandmother is at is much nicer and she would have my grandma there to keep her company) but they refuse.my heart is breaking for her. what can i do to help calm her? any advice on other resources for her? i feel like she is getting worse bc over xmas she said she ""isnt going to be here much longer"" and in afraid shes thinking suicide.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/a9zhxa/husbands_grandma_having_a_terrible_time_in/,,Husbands grandma having a terrible time in assisted living...

"i was her primary caregiver for the past six weeks, with my brother helping when he could.  she had cancer. i thought we would have more time with her... until she started vomiting blood and hallucinating on thursday evening. long story short, my father has said she had six months when he meant six weeks (possible dementia... he has been getting numbers and values wildly confused in the past few months and my mother refused to know how long she had).the weird part was, she looked completely normal up until the last two days. she was tired and listless but still had color in her face and was somewhat lucid.then the hallucinations started. she kept the tv tuned to sitcoms 24 hours a day even if she want actually watching them, and started thinking they were in the living room and she was in the scene. she screamed at me to warn my brother about the bear that was loose in the warehouse (""last man standing""). she told me to call charlie sheen and tell him that she couldn't come to his wedding (""two and a half men""). she was worried about barbra jean (""reba"").  seeing her mind slip into madness was horrifying... knowing that i could do nothing to help her left me numb and bereft.the worst part was that not one of the three hospice nurses i called in the last week even attempted to warn me that she was near the end... not when her body gave out and collapsed after trying to walk just a few feet with a walker, not when she was vomiting blood... the nurse simply prescribed prilosec and went on her way. not one of them arranged for her to go back to the hospice house. they left it up to us to deal with it all.i did the best i could... i think... but i just can't help but feel that i could have done more to help her had i been a little more prepared and knew what to ask and how/when to ask it.now we are taking care of dad and he refuses to consider assisted living accommodation, despite the fact that he can't drive, is wheelchair bound and continually gets facts confused. i am more worried now than i ever was."," my deepest sympathies, and great admiration to you for your strength and kindness. yes; medical personnel likely have to have an emotional shield up, or maybe b.s.

"i have decided due to various factors, i need to get paid if i am able to continue caring for my dad. he lives alone, doesn't drive, has some dementia. so care is fairly involved, much of it being monitoring through phone calls and video. some weeks are easy, some not. i also do all the shopping/cleaning/meds etc. how do i determine a fair wage? one brother has sole control of money and poas. he is okay with paying me (it is preferable to an outsider or nursing home). my brother suggested paying hourly as contract labor.this would be okay...except...how do i fairly account for all the time i have to spend monitoring? it's not that each instance takes long, but more that it adds up plus i have to always be alert. i don't get a day off from watching over him. next, the day i go to clean/food/etc is a team effort. my kids and their dad help. if i did alone it would be far more hours. do i add their time in? i feel bad i have to even ask to be paid. i have been doing his caretaking for years now. however, my situation has become where i need to earn extra income. therefore, i have to either get paid for caretaking or stop it altogether. how do i figure a wage that is fair to all? do i consider also that i have to pay all taxes as self employed? thank you so much for any help. p.s. none of the other family is willing to help in his weekly care; sharing the care is not an option."," the work you do to care for your father is valuable and important.  please don't be ashamed to ask for payment for it.the formula above seems very fair.  the other thing to consider is a flat fee for the monitoring and then an hourly rate for appointments, hands-on care, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/9vov4k/request_advice_for_parent_caregiver/,,Request Advice for Parent Caregiver

"my mother (65) was diagnosed with cancer two months ago. we do not know specifically where it originated, because by the time it was discovered, she was riddled with it all over her body and is too far along for treatment. she is now at home getting hospice care by nurses who come by 2-3 times a week to bathe her and check her meds. we were told that she has six months to live, but she appears to be in a freefall at the moment and we honestly don't expect her to make it past christmas. her memory is failing her and she is now too weak to make it to the bathroom half the time. every day with her is a lesson in panic and fear... someone leaves the room for a few minutes, and she flails into a panic-stricken state, demanding to know where the person is, why they left and when they are coming back. the other day i told her i was going to buy her a new phone because her old one wouldn't keep a charge... i was gone less than 20 minutes before she started calling people in a panic trying to find me. no particular reason... i just wasn't there anymore and she couldn't remember where i went. two weeks ago, we got a call at 6 am reporting that my father (also 65 and severely disabled - cannot drive and is wheelchair-bound) had been rushed to the er... he had fallen and couldn't get up, was combative and delirious and non-responsive. he had a uti and high fever, as well as fluid on his weakened lungs. bacteria was all through his blood stream and ecoli was in his urine. this has happened before, apparently. nobody can figure out why it's happening over and over and over again.(notice that i said ""apparently""?... well, before my mom was diagnosed with cancer, she was my father's primary caregiver and shielded me from a lot of what was going on with him because ""she didn't want to upset me"". more on that later.)my father is now back home, but he has been signed up for home health care. at this point, he is about the same as he was before his latest er visit, but it's obvious to everyone that his mind is failing him. he was always a little goofy and eccentric, but now it is far more pronounced and he is making up wildly erratic ""facts"" and stories that have no basis whatsoever in reality. he shouts out strange noises for no reason, etc. he still knows who we are and where he is, but it's obvious that he needs to be evaluated for dementia or alzheimer's. his behavior is alarming all of us, and it's slowly gotten worse over the past few months. physically, he is helpless. he cannot drive and he can't walk more than a couple of steps and only has one semi-functioning leg. falling out of his chair while trying to get into his wheelchair by himself is a common event and requires multiple people to get him upright. he sometimes loses control of his bowels and soils his wheelchair seat as well.i live about 45 minutes away, but since my mother's diagnosis i have been coming over every single day and often staying the night. i am able to telecommute so i can work at their kitchen table during the day. when i first set up this arrangement, the understanding was that i would run errands for them on my lunch hour and do small things for them during the day while working - things i could do in a couple of minutes, like getting them medication or drinks. however, it has escalated to being asked to run errands across town while i'm working. they see me sitting there and assume i'm free - they forget that i'm working. my boss is very understanding of my situation but it's still taking a toll on my career and my sanity.add to the mix:1.) my brother - he lives with them but works 50 - 60 hours a week (manual labor). he helps when he can but he works the night shift and has to sleep during the day. he is just as strained and frantic as i am and his temper is growing shorter and shorter every day.2.) his ex-wife - they are on civil terms and she is still friendly with our family. she helps when she can but their custody arrangement is set up so that my brother gets their son every other week. this means that, every other week, he is over here and has to be taken care of, along with my parents. she sends him over here even when he is sick and contagious. 3.) my nephew (brother's son) - sweet kid, but he's 9, high-energy and caught in the middle of all of this.there have been instances of nasty comments and outburts - my mother screaming at us to ""stop kissing her ass"" when we do things she's asked us to do... but if we don't do them, she feels neglected and abandoned. dad accused me of ""picking at the family fortune like a vulture on a carcass"" when i gently suggested that he add my name to their checking account in the event that a bill needs to be paid and my brother is unavailable, or that he make me an additional power of attorney. i've never asked for a single penny from either of them in my entire life, yet suddenly i'm mercenary and after them for their (meager) fortune (rolls eyes). my brother is a power of attorney and has his name on the account, but i feel that putting all of our eggs in one basket is a bad choice. he has been known to fall asleep behind the wheel while driving home from a long exhausting shift, more than once.and then there's me... my husband is at home, trying to be patient and understanding while i try to sort out the insanity, panic, fear and constant medical crises. i'm in daily communication with their nurses and caregivers in a vain effort to restore the order of things, but still i dread falling asleep every night, because falling asleep means i need to wake up the next day to chaos, pain, fear, crying and insanity. self-care is a huge colossal joke at this point.tl;dr - dad keeps screaming that he doesn't need help, but his immune system is almost nonexistent and he's pissing in his wheelchair (on those rare times that he's able to sit in it) and rambling incoherently. mom is losing her memory and wasting away in a hospice bed in the living room. they're both hopped up on enough morphine and percoset to give a drug dealer a stiffy for a month straight. my only sibling is a workaholic who gets by on 3 hours of sleep and a 6 pack of monster drinks every day, routinely falling asleep behind the wheel of his truck as he drives to yet another 12 hour factory shift. meanwhile, my sil sends my nephew out trick-or-treating with a full-blown case of pneumonia and then sends him home to us to nurse. life is good."," you know, i just remembered something! is there a hospice facility nearby? it could be a great place for your mom to go to. they are usually run very well and all the one's i've been to (volunteered for hospice for five years) have been very compassionate and well run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/9ue6o0/rantvent_my_story_i_never_thought_i_would_find/,,(rant/vent) My Story -

"apologize for the wall of text. i am just very scared for the future.i visited my mom this week. i live one and a half hours away in a different town so i visit my mom every two weeks when i get the weekends off (rotating shifts). this week was terrible. they took her off her xanax four months ago at the pain doctors and her anxiety is through the roof! she didn't have toilet paper or nearly any food that wasn't spoiled. she hadn't eaten and she was wearing old clothes. there was cat vomit on the floor but the litter box was clean.my mom has complex post traumatic stress syndrome, anxiety, and depression, and i think i am beginning to see signs of dementia. i cleaned up the house, brought her some food which made her feel better, and looked at her medicines. turns out the norco she's taking makes her anxious and she's been taking 2 more per day that than she should because her lower back was hurting. you may be asking, haven't i seen a decline when i visited before? yes, i had. i moved away two years ago and since then my mom has been living but not thriving but she always seemed to have plenty of food and was able to take care of herself, now i am not so sure. when i would ask her how she was doing she would always respond that she was a little lonely but alright. i thought she was at least managing. i have always lived with my mom with the exception of these last two years.  she talks about how she wants to move because she is lonely where she is but will then change her mind because of how this will affect the cats. she refuses to go anywhere even though she can drive. she will do things like going to senior dances, and exercise classes if i am with her but i work so much just to keep me afloat that i am not able to always drive down and pick her up, ect. unless i am there she spends her day talking to the cats and watching 1940's movies on repeat. she told me that if she was getting bad she would come stay with me for a few days and i would even pick her up! she told me this weekend that she has been hiding how bad things were from me for the past four months, that she hasn't been eating (she's lost a lot of weight and will only eat medium to large meals if i am there with her), she has only been sleeping four hours a night (because the xanax made her sleep), she's been crying a lot, and she's been taking old pills to see if they help her that she's saved from the past.she refuses to go to specialized therapy even though i said i would pay for her to go. i was unable to convince her to go to the hospital that night but we went the next morning.  she has a minor kidney infection, and may have to see a urologist to make sure her kidneys are functioning. we are changing her pain doctor and she is seeing her general practitioner tomorrow. we are moving changing doctors to the one's in her home town because all of her doctors are an hour away. we are also looking at moving her into a senior community closer to me.i want her to get a memory test once she's finished taking her antibiotics because i want to see if she is having any memory issues without the infection because we all know how internal infections affect the elderly. i feel like i let her down. if she is starting to have dementia it essentially means my life is over. i am calling tomorrow to get her set up on meals on wheels, hopefully that will help her eat. she talked to my aunt and she is planning a trip down there to get some socialization. i highly doubt that she will go but i am happy that she is at least planning something,  i live so far away that i can't come down there everyday, in addition her apartment is so smokey that i get sick when i stay there, i also no longer have a bed and my old room is essentially the cats play room. i would have her up here but my apartment does not allow any pets. she has always been a great mom but she has never been good at caring for herself. when i was 14 i took over all the government paperwork and paying for everything. i also was the main cook and her main listener. she likes to go on and on about how she was mistreated to much in life, and i went into social work as a profession so believe me when i tell you compared to some of the cases i had to work on how she was treated was not even comparable. i feel like i did too much for her when i was younger and now she can't/won't take care of herself. add to this i have only three friends who can emotionally support me if i do need to be a caregiver. if i can't work how are we supposed to survive? do i just live off her check? i am so new to this caregiver thing and i am really resenting my mom for being unwilling to take care of herself, not to mention if she does have dementia (memory test pending) i know what is in store. how am i supposed to survive as a caregiver? how can i stop feeling resentment towards my mother? i am so sorry for the wall of text but i am feeling so overwhelmed right now. i am feeling very alone, and i want to do the right thing for the health of my mother. thank you!"," thank you everyone who responded! the last few days have been hectic. we have to change her primary care physician because this guy is useless. my mom had a sheet printed off from the hospital about how she had to get her urine tested for blood from her gp. the dude was so lazy that he didn't even look at the paper and instead told her to go back to the hospital. told her that changing pain med doctors was impossible and she wouldn't get her medicines. a half truth because i called the pain doctor myself and they told me to to change doctors without having the medicines affected. he wanted to send her three hours away to see a psychiatrist for her xanax where she would have to pay out of pocket because it was out of state. like we couldn't find a psychiatrist in our own state? he was beyond useless so now we are changing her gp, she is going to get her urine tested tomorrow at the hospital. she is still taking her uti meds and has been in a better mental state. we are also looking at senior apartments in my town or closer but many have wait lists. she doesn't want to move yet but we are looking somewhere in the next three months. i want to say thank you to everyone who responded! i am much calmer now and i talked to a few of my friends so i know i have support. my roommate and friends even agreed to check in on her if i have to work, ect. now i am looking at insurance options for when she needs an assisted living facility. thank you for everyone who told me to have patience and breathe. the world seems a little brighter today.

"i have been with my boyfriend for about 5+ years. he has an apartment in his grandmother’s home and his mom lives upstairs with his grandma.  his grandparents raised him and his grandpa is deceased.  his mother is very into herself and isn’t super close with my boyfriend or her mother. my boyfriend has basically been her primary care giver, they pretty much have a mother and son relationship.  his grandma has always been an anxious person as long as i’ve known her. in the past year or two her memory and anxiety has gotten worse and worse, which i believe is dementia. she’s 85 years old.  i love this woman, i really do, but she is driving me insane. i constantly have to answer the same question 10x.  you cannot keep his apartment door locked as this will cause her to flip the hell out. i stay over there on weekends and her new thing is coming downstairs several times in the morning to ask me the same questions or “ check on the dogs” . we have two yappy dogs so naturally every time she comes down they alert me.  my boyfriend is a heavy sleeper, a bomb could go off and he would not wake up…so naturally i am the one the questions are directed at.  throughout the day i get calls from her asking the same questions as well. she has aids that come to her house but they don’t come every day nor for long periods of time.some days i feel i lack the patience for her and it makes me feel awful. before all these issues started we got along very well. i have always tried and still try to help her out the best i can. both my grandma’s have passed away and she has been like a grandma to me as well.  the plan a while ago was to move in with my boyfriend in the apartment; however, i just feel like that would be signing myself up for more stress/frustration. his grandma asks me constantly when i am moving in and i tell her when my finances get better. this is not completely a lie...but i am leaving out a big part of the truth.  i would love nothing more than to live with him but the thought of not having my own space/privacy is daunting. he has no idea i feel this way and i think it would greatly hurt him. like i said, she is basically his mother.  i wish we could find a place of our own but he will not leave until she passes away. i am also very worried about how he will take her passing when she does. she means everything to him. sometimes i want to yell at this poor woman. i’ll be honest with you, after the 2nd or 3rd time she comes down in the morning i get frustrated and my voice will start to raise.  i know it’s not her fault but it grates at me. it’s odd to be dealing with an issue like this in your late 20’s. open to all advice and suggestions.  thanks for letting me vent.", thank you!  finally starting to open up about it to my best friend.  the deep breathes are a must.  i wish you the best of luck too! ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/8zfm3x/my_boyfriends_grandma_is_driving_me_nuts/,,My boyfriend's grandma is driving me nuts..
"i’m 32 and i have been taking care of my now 91 year old grandmother for about 3-4 years now. i left my previous job because of health related issues. while looking for a more suitable job, my grandma’s mind went downhill and she was diagnosed with dementia. she also had a stroke and could no longer live alone. so i, not knowing how hard it would be, stepped up to the plate as caregiver. don’t get me wrong i don’t really regret it. i gave my grandmother my room, and i now sleep in a recliner in the living room. i have lost a lot of sleep, and most of my me time is late at night in-front of my computer watching youtube. i no longer have the want or desire to paint or draw anymore. it’s not laziness either. my mother says it is, but i don’t think i’m lazy if i take care of my grandma 24/7, cook meals for the family, and clean the house everyday. i haven’t been diagnosed with any mental disorder, but i have never gone to speak with a doctor about it. being unemployed makes it hard to afford or even get health insurance. so... no doctor and i have no idea why i am the way i am. i am almost positive i have anxiety. i am always worried and nervous, and panicking when the smallest things go wrong or change. my chest gets tight and i feel like nothing is ever going to go right again when this happens. my mood also seems to change at the drop of a hat. i go from chipper and happy, to angry or panicking, or i get really really depressed. not wanting to do much, feeling hopeless, useless, and with “dark thoughts”. i’ve also been a bit paranoid lately. i’m not going to go into it, but sometimes i’ve come to the weirdest conclusions, and believing them until my mom talked me out of it.lately i’m sitting at depressed because my mom’s legs are doing bad. she has an infection on her skin and it looks terrible. i feel helpless, i don’t know how to help her. grandma has changed so much now and it hurts to see her that way. my dad doesn’t really want to be involved, and the only other family members that could help ran away. lets just say aunt a and uncle b ran away  to another state because they were pissed that they weren’t given my grandmother’s house after she built them one, and bought them another property after they sold the first. sorry this is tmi, but i really haven’t had anyone to talk to... there is so much more, but i don’t know where to continue. i just feel like the girl who is slowly disappearing. i will be nothing when all of this is over. just the woman who lives with her parents, and looks five years older than she actually is..."," i feel these ""dark thoughts"" and depression you're experience is acclimated with lack of quality sleep and not having the freedom to do what you want (i mean, you're young, having fun should be what you do). what you're describing (chest pain and panicking) sounds like anxiety to me (i have it as well).it's unfortunate when siblings runoff when their parents get sick. i'm willing to bet, almost every family will experience this. i'm currently experiencing this with my client. she has alzheimer's and lives with her daughter. but her 3 other kids couldn't care less. however, the daughter, who has power of attorney, is fixing this by giving herself more when her mom dies. which i think you should do. if people cannot take care of their sick parents when the time comes, it shouldn't be split evenly, if 1 kid takes the burden, while the others are mia.now, is there any way for you to leave the house and have your mom watch your grandmother? you need a break. do you have any friends you can stay with, just for the weekend? just so you can get some r&r?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/8drizy/i_need_to_vent/,,I Need to Vent...

"hello fellow caregivers, i'm glad to have found this sub.  it'll be nice to have other people to talk to.  the story up to now:i am now 42, i have epilepsy and am on disability, my daughter lived with my mother as her guardian as i couldn't provide as well for her.  my mother has been an rn for 40some years, she works in upper management in insurance and has for about 20 years.  she is single.  my sister and her family live in town close to ma's, as does my mother's brother, who we have calculated has spent .1% of his time with his parents since this all started.at this point, due to ma working 70 hours a week or so and having a 50 mile one way commute as well as many business trips, we have yet to finish cleaning out their old house.  my uncle went to help us once early on, we had to keep pulling things out of the dumpster that were important, he also sold some possessions to his brother-in-law for next to nothing and tried to do the same with their truck and boat so we can't let him up there alone.  utilities are still being paid and someone maintains it for them.  he's proud of it, he literally built it with his two hands, but his memory of it is foggy now.  they take him by whenever they go up to that town, sadly that has mostly been for the funerals of grandma's and his sisters.  mentioning this also bc of him still having all of his accounts and property, so he has to pay directly for someone to take care of him.7 years ago in january my grandparents needed to move in with my mother for medical reasons.  grandma had nearly died from blood loss due to an ulcer and papa's memory isn't good enough for him to live alone.  ma had been building a house at the time with a room and accommodations for them and driving to their home 80 miles away weekly to check up, but the emergency occurred a month before the house was finished.  so we moved them temporarily into the house she had at the time while grandma was in the hospital.  about a week after she was released, papa had an appendicitis attack in the middle of the night, in the middle of a blizzard, seizing on the floor while grandma tried to walk over him with her walker to get to the bathroom.  we don't do things easy in our family it seems.  papa has a bit of dementia, but he still has a pretty good grasp on things, just short term memory issues, and grandma had a few mini-strokes which caused her to be a much different grandma than i had grown up with; she was suddenly racist, grumpy, and a bit spiteful.  papa would ask about every 10 minutes for a week why he was wearing sweatpants and why his side hurt.  when i'd tell him about getting his appendix out, he'd just say, ""well that's damned silly at my age."" and chuckle and let it go.  he knows he can't remember, but he remembers the important things and so far hasn't gotten depressed about it.as my mother works full time out of town and they could not be left home alone, i became the caretaker when she was gone.  initially this was meds, meal prep, putting the foot rest up and down for grandma every couple of minutes and assisting her with cleaning and bathroom duties.  she was incredibly specific about what she would eat (for months it was thin hamburgers, instant mashed potatoes, and brown gravy from a mix; and god help you if that hamburger patty was too thick or too large) and we had to correct her sudden racism and political rants in front of my daughter and my sister's children.  grandma also drove my mother to calling me on the phone in tears a few times at first just being spiteful about things.  my sudden absence from home for extended periods of time gave my then so an excuse to start drinking again after 6 years of sobriety, so my home life went to shit. we finally got them moved into the new house and after a few months of pt grandma was able to get around with a walker and papa was there to help with physical things, she was his memory, and she owned the remote control.  at this point, with a new cell phone, they were okay to be left home without supervision as long as ma got home at night and anytime she was on a work trip i stayed so they felt safe.  granted, i can't drive, but my sister and daughter both could and my sister lived nearby and were always on call.  my uncle lives less than a mile away but until this past may hasn't had a cell phone (which we gave him and forced him to use) and it could take days to get ahold of him.things were pretty good with grandma and papa for the past few years, she even got her sense of humor back somewhat.  i got rid of the so after many years of misery and now am with someone who appreciates family and isn't a drunk.  he puts family first and loves my family.  pretty much as soon as he moved in with me this feb though, a bunch of shit happened at once.  grandma was at an md appt and the pa didn't lower the bed or steady the step when she was getting grandma off the examining table and she ended up falling and shattering her ankle on one side and her knee on the other side.  they didn't notice the damage immediately so she ended up in a wheelchair but still taking some steps, incredibly painfully and with assistance, on them for a few weeks.  we hadn't had hhc in yet and as a full lift she was draping herself around my neck because that's how she felt safe and killing me.  when we finally taught her how to properly get up from the chair to rotate to bed or toilet, the weight and sudden stops for when a bad twinge of pain would hit her ended up causing me to hurt the hand she used to put her weight on.  it still isn't right, but at the time i assumed it was overuse so if i fractured anything, it's too late now. one night she tried to be tough when i was there and didn't call out to have help in the bathroom, while papa was in the er with ma for a coughing issue.  she fell ofc.  we ended up with both of them in the er within a week, she had been coming down with a cold as well.  at this time she was 85 and he was 92.  papa was so worried about her, they were a room away from each other with ma and i bouncing between, and i witnessed my papa cry for the first time in my life, he was so scared he was going to lose her when she was right next door and he couldn't see her.  she wasn't as bad off as he was except for the knee and ankle, but he couldn't remember that part.  we had to keep assuring him that she was fine and one of us with each of them at all times.the mds came to their senses after new x-rays on grandma and put her in a chi pt rehab facility with a no weight bearing restriction.  as often happens, she developed pneumonia, got transferred back to the hospital, and we lost grandma last may.  we made sure papa got in to see her every day in the hospital and finally to say goodbye before she passed.  i'm crying again, i hadn't done that for years before grandma died.  we promised grandma that we would keep papa at home.  so since march they have needed to have someone there 24/7, and now papa needs the same.  we'd had hhc for a bit and asked the rn we thought was the best (never talked to papa like he was a child, etc) if she could suggest someone like herself for taking on a few days a week of papa-sitting and also taking care of the dogs and doing up meals and dishes.  there's a lazy mini dachshund named daisy and ma's ""i need something happy in my life while everyone is in the hospital"" rescue puppy, peanut who is half mini d and half, wait for it, mini jack russell.  she's been chewing her way through every item in the house since a week before grandma passed (my sis and daughter snuck her in to see grandma in the hospital and got a smile out of her, then got kicked out.)  so it's a wee bit more than just sitting around with a nice old man who naps quite a bit and likes nature and cooking shows, but not much more.  she suggested her daughter who is a cna that was taking online classes, we met her and tried her out and she is great.  she even bakes and cleans the bathrooms.when i'm not there ma sleeps in a recliner in the living room so she can hear if he gets up.  with her job, stress levels, and thyroid issues, she maybe gets 4 hours of sleep during the week, and as he gets up to go to the bathroom and get a drink 5-10 times a night, those hours are interrupted.  when i'm going to be staying with him the next day, i sleep on the couch so she can sleep in her own bed.  at home i get 10 hours of sleep or more easily, there, not much and that causes me seizures after 2-3 days in a row.last month the girl told us she'd only be available tuesday and thursday for her next semester of school, which is a shit schedule for me but, trying our best.  today, the first day of classes, she texts me an ""oh shit!"" and lets me know she has class every day during the week and wants to set up something like me doing t/th mornings and then she'd drive me home at noon and take over, but then also m/w/f she wanted to come in at 3, but wouldn't be able to take me home. so basically she can barely work and lately she'd been picking me up at 5 on some of her days bc she had plans for before my mother got home, which is often late, though she tried to be home early for her.  all of these trips involve papa having to ride along with.i spend over half of my life at ma's.  papa keeps forgetting that i don't live there.  i've caught myself at my apartment saying, ""yeah, i'm going home at 5:00"" referring to their house.  now i will be staying there sunday night through friday evening until we can find someone to replace her.  were it closer to summer my sister's kids could, but for now, we're just floundering.my mother is working past midnight when i'm there and going in at 3am on nights she gets home before that.  she's under so much stress that i think she should get a hotel room some of those nights instead of driving home - last week once with her windows down, singing to stay awake.  my daughter is in her last year in uni and is doing as much as she can, and my sister works full time as well but she and her husband and kids do everything they can to help too.  i actually got my uncle to spend a few hours there the other night when the gal had to leave early yet again and i was still catching up on sleep from a 3 day stretch.  but even when he does come to do something, he doesn't give ma long enough to do anything, maybe 2 hours.  she takes him out to meals regularly, she takes him to every farmer's market, we went to the zoo a few years ago, he's a constant fixture on our whole family's facebook pages, everybody loves papa.  my uncle doesn't facebook so he's not even seeing any of this.  there are probably 50 people out there who could tell you his breakfast order by heart, they know all of the stories he's told that we faithfully record, and just generally know *him* better than his son does.  in addition to housing, med prep, paying for meds, food prep and paying for food, setting up and driving to md appts, laundry and housekeeping, and being a good daughter, she also spends time with her grandkids and daughters and buys extra groceries every weekend that she ""drive by drop off""s to my daughter, me, and my sister's family as well as my sister's ex as he has joint custody and is nice and she wants to make sure her grandkids and their father both are able to eat well.  i swear my mother is wonder woman.  she's set to retire in 2 years and is looking for property down in the gulf to have a winter home at for her and papa and the dog and the menace of a puppy to go to.  she's taking my niece to italy for a school function this year and trying to find time to take papa down to look for property, but he won't fly so it's a long bit of a drive.  she's on thyroid medication, and she forgets it at times, so i worry.  she's burning herself out hard, and i can't pick up all of the weight, i literally have seizures if i can't spend at least one day at home pretty much sleeping straight through after 2-3 days in a row at her place.  my sis and daughter try and are great for weekends, but i'm going to start being there every week day starting this upcoming week and i don't know how i'm going to handle it.  i miss spending time with my so.  i miss my bed and my cats and my comfy chair and my laptop.  i love papa and don't mean to sound like i don't want to be there, and i won't let anyone i haven't spent time with together with him be a new caregiver for him, but i'm exhausted.  then i look at my mother and wonder how in the hell she's doing it. she's done the driven work ethic thing for decades, and while i could work, i was the same.  now i need 10 or more hours of sleep and a lot of pills a day.  but she's doing that and everything else on top of it.  i fill the pillbox but she has to order the scrips, i can cook, but she has to get groceries, and i can't drive (and we don't have a vehicle so my so can't drop me off) so she generally has to pick me up and drop me off.  and then, there's the puppy.  the puppy that will literally go from dead asleep to bouncing off the walls (after sliding into them from the ottoman leap) and running a slalom path through the table and chairs, scrabble in the turn on the kitchen floors, and start doing laps at breakneck speed for about 10 minutes with a water break in the kitchen once or twice.  the puppy that has eaten papa's slippers, most of her toys, anything cloth she can get her teeth one, the rungs on the chairs, part of the floor of the deck, the bottoms of the cabinets, 4 dog beds, multiple pens, and -when he doesn't hit the door all the way shut and she can sneak into his bathroom -papa's razors from the trash.  the puppy that is scared of snow shovels (we had to give her 3 days of immersion therapy with one in the middle of the floor) and snow and needs to be on a chain to go potty, but only if the weather's nice enough, thank you very much.  the puppy that will not sleep anywhere but on me when i'm on the couch for the night, that got the lazy dog moving again, that makes ma smile, and gets papa to play (and remember her name, yay! new memory!)  yeah that puppy, peanut is sweet, but she's a handful.i've gotten way off into rambling land.  i'm sorry.  having all of this to say, i wanted to explain things before i complained about the new schedule, and i guess i got caught up in a stream of consciousness. anyway, that's our current situation.  i don't know how long it's going to take to find someone new that's suitable.  i don't know how long i'll be functional doing this.  i don't know how in the hell my mother does what she does and what i can do to help her more.  i'm frustrated with a puppy.  i'm resenting my uncle.  i'm missing my so and my home.  if you made it through this, wow.  thank you for reading."," hang in there, sounds like you are in the mix! rest, eat, try to laugh, even if its stupid cat videos

"warning: turned into a bit of a vent!hey everyone, recent lurker and first post! 29/f/east coast us here. i’ve been caregiving full-time for my mom’s younger sister (62), who has early onset alzheimer’s, for 2 years since i was 26. my mom and i recently gave up the reigns of caregiving to her kids because i was experiencing pure burnout. i was also juggling caregiving separately for my dad (divorced from mom) who is suffering from end-stage cirrhosis and awaiting liver transplant. he now needs full-time care. i graduated college and left part-time work to take care of my aunty and my dad. personally, i also struggle with major depressive disorder and anxiety, exacerbated of course with caregiving. (favorite coping mechanism? lol. getting lost in other characters’ lives on netflix binges like everything sucks and on my block.)i’ve been struggling lately with a very heavy sense of being left behind- professionally, mentally, socially. many of my friends and peers have graduate degrees, are already years into their careers, are getting married, buying houses, having kids or just able to go out to dinners or meet up over drinks and talk about things they have achieved or are pursuing. their lives may not be perfect, but their lives are at least progressing.  i feel stuck and left in the dust. i feel like life has paused before i even got a good chance to start. my own sibling who decided to move far away is established in their career, bought a house, got 2 dogs and is getting married in a year.  there’s a lot of family tension and rifts because a lot of people on different sides feel some are contributing while others aren’t, some people are getting praised for what they do while others aren’t. (i have my share of resentments, but i won’t delve into that here.) you all know the deal.anyway. bottom line is it’d be great to have more of an understanding, empathetic support system. i have a couple of sweet friends and an amazing partner, but i often feel like the “negative nancy” or that i’m repeating the same issues. are there any other young, unemployed unmarried caregivers who are experiencing similar stuff that would want to create a chat group? talk to each other throughout the day when we have pockets of downtime? vent or complain about the day? but also talk about light, fluffy things so we’re not a complete pool of misery lol. things we’re watching on netflix? hobbies? articles we read? maybe plans or goals? i know the issue of feeling left behind or stalled isn’t solely for young, unemployed caregivers, that’s just where i fall! if you feel you relate to anything and would also benefit from a support chat group, please comment or message!"," believe me i also know what you mean. i’m 32 and i have been taking care of my now 91 year old grandmother for about 3-4 years now. i left my previous job because of health related issues. while looking for a more suitable job, my grandma’s mind went downhill and she was diagnosed with dementia. she also had a stroke and could no longer live alone. so i, not knowing how hard it would be, stepped up to the plate as caregiver. don’t get me wrong i don’t really regret it. i haven’t been diagnosed with any mental disorder, but i have never gone to speak with a doctor about it. being unemployed makes it hard to afford or even get health insurance. so... no doctor and i have no idea why i am the way i am. i am almost positive i have anxiety. i am always worried and nervous, and panicking when the smallest things go wrong or change. my chest gets tight and i feel like nothing is everything going to go right again when this happens. my mood also seems to change at the drop of a hat. i go from chipper and happy, to angry or panicking, or i get really really depressed. not wanting to do much, feeling hopeless, useless, and with “dark thoughts”.lately i’m sitting at depressed because my mom’s legs are doing bad. she has an infection on her skin and it looks terrible. i feel helpless, i don’t know how to help her. grandma has changed so much now and it hurts to see her that way. my dad doesn’t really want to be involved, and the only other family members that could help ran away. lets just say aunt a and uncle b ran away because they were pissed because they weren’t given my grandmother’s house, after she built them one and bought them another property. also i’m not married, don’t have kids, and i feel like my career is gone. with that, my self esteem is down the tube. sorry this is tmi and a bit depressing , but i really haven’t had anyone to talk to... i tend to hermit a lot. i’m terrified of talking on the phone sometimes, and it’s hard to get out of the house. i have to force myself ti take my grandma to the doctors some days. there is so much more, but my mind won’t work anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/87sv1l/just_curious_how_many_young_caregivers_2030s_are/,,"Just curious how many young caregivers (20/30’s) are there in here who are unemployed, unmarried, no-kids and struggling with their own mental health?

"not a caregiver, but i could really use some advice on how my family can deal with the issues caused by my great aunt and uncle right now (both in their mid-80s).just a quick background: my parents, sisters, and i are the only family my aunt and uncle have, we all live 1+ hour driving time (one way) from their house, and obviously we love both of them very dearly.my aunt and uncle have each had their health problems over the years, but we are now at the point of no return. my uncle can no longer take care of himself, and even though he knows it, he refuses all help unless it's coming from my aunt. that last part might sound like a good thing, but it's not. my aunt is not capable of taking care of him for a variety of reasons, with the most difficult being that she refuses to see the reality of the situation. i cannot imagine the pain she has endured watching my uncle deteriorate the way that he has, and i understand that she is being faced with some unbearably hard truths, but that does not change the fact that she is allowing (and a lot of times forcing) my uncle to put himself in dangerous positions. she will still send him to get something from their basement even though he's had trouble keeping his balance lately. she asks him to fix stuff around the house even though he loses track of what he's doing and makes things worse. the most extreme example i have, which i only mention to show the gravity of this situation, is her letting my uncle lie face down on the floor for hours after having a stroke because she ""thought he was sleeping"".i feel like normally my family would be in a good position because my aunt and uncle are very well off financially and could afford any type of help they needed, but both of them refuse to acknowledge that it's necessary. we have tried everything we could think of at this point, but it wasn't much. my parents have more or less given up because they've tried things over the years (begged my aunt and uncle to move closer to us, spoke with them about independent living and assisted living facilities, etc.) and nothing has worked. they also say that we cannot force them to do anything they don't want to do, and that they don't want to anger them and ruin the time we all have left together. i went over to their house recently and had a heart-to-heart with my aunt (told her how sorry i was for what she is going through, told her my perspective, offered my help) but that didn't lead anywhere either. if i was able, i would be their live-in caregiver in a heartbeat.  anyone in my family would do that. unfortunately, we all have full-time jobs or are full-time students, and it wouldn't matter anyway because my aunt and uncle wouldn't want that. i just don't know what to do about what's coming...my uncle isn't going to get better, and i'm afraid he will die in terrible accident around the house, which my aunt will have to witness, if my family doesn't do something. but what can we do? edit: in my rant i forgot to mention that my uncle has recently been diagnosed with dementia (though we've suspected it for years)"," in my experience, it has to be their idea to get help.  they fear losing control and so hold onto it fiercely.   all you can do is to keep gently nudging them to accept help.  usually the elderly don't want to accept help because they don't want to be a burden on others.  what they don't understand is that by refusing help they are a bigger burden.  there are lots of in home services like home instead, visiting angels, etc.  there is also a referral service called ""a place for mom"", you tell them what you are looking for and they'll have the right people get in touch with you.  also check into your area wide aging agency.  they also have loads of information.

"my hubby's 92 year old grandma recently fell and broke her hip.because she is amazingly healthy she had surgery, went to rehab and is now at home.  she has always had a bit of dementia(my diagnosis not a doc's) but now is doing some really weird stuff. really weird.anyway, her care has always been a team effort but she's attached to me, i'm like her safe person or something. our kids are good to help out when they can.lately she has become exactly like a child throwing a temper tantrum (i think) because her daughter will soon be homeless and we won't let her live with us.grandma has become extremely demanding.  if you come within her line of site she will call you to do something for her and before you finish she's asking you to do something else and before you really get started on the second request there is another and she would go on and on and on all day.because i'm very straightforward i have no issue telling her i'm not doing that-that i have other things to do and i walk away.  if the requests were important i would take care of them.  but my children and my husband really don't know how to deal with this.  i think they are afraid of hurting her feelings but in private they go on and on about it.  it's annoying to be honest.she tells you she wants cheese in her eggs for breakfast for example.  so i take her that. a minute later i hear her buzzer go off. i ask if she needs anything she tells me no, and then the buzzer goes off again and my husband comes up and she says ""john take my plate i cant eat these eggs they have cheese in them."" and her tone is awful!  he makes her new eggs.  she doesn't eat them. she gives them to the dog when no one is looking. (i've made the rule no one feeds the dog because i'm the one cleaning the gigantic messes) the dog goes all over the kitchen floor.she circles through the kitchen, dining room and living room endlessly(with a walker, lord that scraping noise on the floor is so irritating) talking loudly to the animals- this goes on almost all day and part of the night. if we manage to distract her and she sits down it's only for a few minutes and she's right back at it.  she won't talk to me, she talks at me. like i am her servant.  she is really, really mean to my husband.  it's taking a toll.  i'm getting angry with this. mainly because it seems like she is doing this on purpose, but part of me feels this is dementia.  it just seems like its on purpose because it ramped up after we informed her that her daughter would never live with us.i'm really dying to confront her on it, but i know that would make no difference.  i'm getting to the point where i am not sure i can do this anymore, but if i say that and she goes to a nursing home it will be because i couldn't do it, and i think hubby would resent it.thank you for letting me vent. i am open to any and all ideas on how to deal and not lose my sh*t  ;p"," the first step is getting her diagnosed for her issues. it may be dementia, but there are other issues that this could be linked to as well. from the description, she sounds manic ( sleeping little, needs to constantly be in motion, and other things) look up ""manic episode"".  having her see a mental health professional, along with her primary care physician would be great first steps. they can provide more information on what she is going through, and how you can handle it, or if more rigorous treatment would be a better fit. definitely look up your counties health and human services department and see what programs and assistance they may be able to offer. i wish you luck, and feel free to pm me with location and i can try and find more resources to help you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/74wurh/grannys_broken_hip_and_dementia/,,granny's broken hip and dementia
"i was a natural caregiver all of my life. even as the youngest child, i always tried to care for my mother and older sister. this was my nature with friends and lovers, too. i never had children, but always had a strong maternal instinct. i helped my mother care for my grandmother after a stroke and then dementia, but she was already in assisted living and we had a lot of help. my mother was diagnosed with cancer in the spring of 2014 and by september of 2015, she was gone. i worked full time and cared for her daily. her first round of chemo had to be administered in the hospital. that caused congestive heart failure, but she was given meds to reverse it and continued on with treatment. ladies from her church group organized a weekly schedule to take her for chemo. i would work all day and then go directly to her house to make sure she had whatever she needed and see that she was alright. i went to the pharmacy, the grocery store, and visits to see her oncologist. i did all of her cooking, housework, and helped her with baths. i had to ask about, keep asking, and finally complete a will for her online. my sister helped very little during all of this time. she would help if i asked specifically for her to do something, but she'd do as little as possible and then accuse me of being irrational if i complained. i was so disappointed and frustrated with her throughout that time. my mother was very strong in her faith and believed that she would receive a miracle, so the entire time she was dying, she was making plans for the future, which made talking to her about what i needed to do to get her affairs in order almost unbearable. mother refused to come stay with me. finally, when i could no longer lift her, the pain and symptoms of dying were unmanageable on my own, i had to make the decision to call in hospice. i had to tell her. she accused me of giving up on her. my rational mind knew that the disease and chemo had affected her mentally, too, but it still broke my heart to hear those words and see her eyes. i tried so hard to take care of her, and there's a lot more about the condition of her house that i had to deal with but won't go into it here. it was the hardest time of my life. after she was gone, i was so indescribably lost, and still so busy with probating the will, sending death certificates, making sure her mortgage was paid, cleaning out her house and eventually selling it. i had missed so much work in the last six weeks of her life that i had to go back immediately after her death. i could never stop. i had to keep going, just like before, except i also was grieving and beyond tired. i was exhausted in every sense of the word. i still am. i hadn't really recovered when my sister had to have rectocele surgery in january of 2016, three months after mom's death. the recovery for her was not easy. she stayed with my fiance and me for a couple of weeks to allow me to care for her. i took off a few days when she first came home but then had to go back to work. she would leave our house during the day when i was working and go to her house or do whatever she wanted, then come back for me to wait on her hand and foot during the evenings. i was frustrated with her, but showing her a ton of grace. a couple of months later she was diagnosed with breast cancer. she had a bilateral mastectomy but opted not to endure chemo or radiation because it was caught early, very small, and completely contained and removed. don't get me wrong. i am overwhelmingly grateful to still have my sister and to have her cancer free! her mastectomy july 2016. after the absolute hell of tissue expanders, she opted for the biggest implants her plastic surgeon would allow. incisions never completely closed. areas of thin skin around both incisions worsened rapidly. both were infected and had to be removed and replaced with smaller implants. again, thin skin and infection caused one of them to have to be replaced with an even smaller implant. now, fluid is leaking from the incisions again, which have been sutured and re-sutured to no avail. she will have to have both implants removed and has scheduled another major surgery for breast reconstruction, diep flap, for january. i've been caring for off and on for the last year and she has stayed with us multiple times and seems to enjoy me waiting on her. i never fully recovered from caring for our mom for more than a year. almost ever since she's been gone, i've been caring for my sister in a completely different way, but when will it end? why do i feel like such a heel for not wanting to care for her anymore? she doesn't have a companion or anyone else to do it. before the second set of implants didn't take, she was planning to have cosmetic surgery to have her lady parts revamped, and she sort of seemed to be informing me so that i would need to help her. i just kind of went off and told her that i could not support a decision to have any kind of surgery that wasn't absolutely necessary, and that my well had run dry. she has backed off of that crazy idea, but now another major surgery is scheduled and i just feel depleted of the ability to give care. i'm sure i'm not alone with the guilt and shame. i just don't feel like i'm the same person anymore. i wish everyone well but i don't want to care for anyone, but myself. my heart goes out to all caregivers. i know the amount of time i've endured doesn't hold a candle to many other stories."," presuming she has insurance to pay for the surgeries, would that insurance pay for in-home care?

(lots of times she didn't recognize me).me:  my parents are doing great.her:  have you seen my mom?me:  no i haven't seen her lately.when she'd have lucid moments and recognize me, she'd ask where  daddy (my dad, her husband) was.  i'd always say he was at work.when she was having a bad day she'd get mad and say, ""why do you keep calling me mother?!""  i'd just smile and say, ""because you remind me of her.  i had the best mom in the world.""i'd also use redirection.  i'd redirect her attention to something else to break that thought process.  she's ask me for the 100th time what she's supposed to be doing and i'd say, ""look at that cloud, looks like it might rain.""  i think the key is to join them in their world, their reality.  trying to make them join your world confuses and upsets them.  i used to tell people it was like mental gymnastics....always jumping around and totally exhausting.  don't try to explain things in depth to her.  her mind can only do one thing at a time now, so keep everything simple, like you would with a toddler. it's hard, but don't sweat the small stuff.  pick your battles wisely. don't take her comments and questions personally. i found it easier to call her by her first name and kind of distance myself from the situation.  don't ever feel bad about venting or ranting.  cry when you need to.  laugh a lot (even at inappropriate things).  this is the hardest job in the world.  everything will be ok in the end, but getting to the end is stressful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/6i1twx/dementia_advice_needed/,,Dementia advice needed.

"so i have been a professional care giver for about five years now.  i have worked with various disabilities both physical and intellectual, terminal diseases, brain injuries, dementia.  i also have worked with people of all ages from children to geriatrics.  i now currently work with three men in their 20s who all have disabilities.after reading about me before you, i'm very uncomfortable about how much people are taking to this story.  i find it very disturbing that any hired caregiver would start a romantic relationship with the individual he/she is working with.  not only does the person she works with have a disability, but also is battling depression and has attempted suicide.  to me, this would be the same as starting a romantic relationship with a person in a psych facility for suicidal ideation.  being a caregiver who mainly works with the male population i pray that the family members do not compare this character to me.  i take my job very seriously and i do care about the guys i work with, however i would never push those boundaries. also for any of those familiar with the story, is lou hired help from a home health care service?  how is she not concerned about losing any licenses or certifications for sexual abuse?  i'm very concerned about the effect a movie like this is going to cause and i am interested to see if anyone else feels the same way."," i don't think you have anything to worry about, because lou is not trained to be a caregiver at all. she isn't trained to do anything at all, this was the only job she could find. will has an actual medical caregiver as well, he just isn't there all day so they hire someone to make sure will doesn't commit suicide again.i liked the book, but i am also not any kind of certified caregiver, i just live with my intellectually disabled aunt, so i didn't think of that aspect while reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/4mhr7i/what_are_your_thoughts_on_me_before_you/,,What are your thoughts on Me Before You
"so, as the title text says, my dad has suddenly had to move in with us, and i'm absolutely overwhelmed. the story is as such: a couple of weeks ago i got a call from the police. apparently my dad, who lives alone 3 hours away since my step mom died, had called the police to complain about people having a sit in on the front lawn, and having broken into his house. the cops arrived, and my dad is talking to bushes and there's no one there. he's been bothering the neighbors about it too, who saw nothing. the police said they couldn't admit him to the er, as his vitals were good, but he refused to go back into the house, and then drove to the local gas station and started having a fight with an invisible person in his car, and the police were called again, and so i drove up the 3 hours, and took him all the way back home with me, where after a good deal of sleep and some discussion about the possibility of hallucinations (he was an er nurse and understands the concept very well), he calmed down and seemed to go back to himself, though i could notice a considerable disruption in his normal cognitive abilities. we took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway. so they set us up with an outpatient appointment the following week, and we set dad up in the guest bedroom. we've since had the outpatient appointment, and the psychiatrist basically said that he thought dad had a mini stroke, and it caused an onset of dementia, and he didn't think dad should live by himself anymore based on how he answered the questions. so now dad is moving in with me.first off, dad seems able to take care of himself in many ways, like hygiene and self feeding, but has issues with more complicated aspects of living. he can't really work the tv (he could if it was just turn it on and change channels, but the whole smart tv thing and multiple remotes has him stumped constantly, even with a regular cable box and two remotes). he also has a hard time working the keurig, with its 3 buttons, and can't manage his dumbed down little flip phone, accidentally deleting phone numbers, etc. this is a man who used to work regularly in excel for a clinical trial management service, and the man who introduced me to the internet, set up a computer in our house when dos was the os, and had an atari 2600 from release, so he wasn't a luddite, but now he can't use a computer to save his life. it's heartbreaking to see him futz with his seatbelt for 3 minutes, or with the ac knobs, or the tv remote we got him which only has about 6 buttons, but i used to work in mental health, and patient care isn't something i have a problem with.my problem is this: how do i begin dealing with all of his stuff? he has a whole three bedroom two bath house filled with 40 years of stuff. he has two cars and a truck, a rental house, and two empty parcels of land, all 3 hours away from us. and, i found out after going up there and going through all of his stuff, that he got depressed after my step mother died and hadn't dealt with any bills in almost a year, and his taxes and god knows what else were all kinds of screwed. the first thing i did was get all of his bills paid up, and i'm trying to deal with his finances, but i've found so much stuff i'm out of my depth on, like that he never made any claims on my stepmother's life insurance or anything, and he gets money through investments but he can't really tell me how that works tax wise or anything.here's where i am right now:- i've got his bills paid for april, and i'm working on may's. i have years worth of paperwork to go through and i'm trying to sort through it a little at a time.- we went up this past weekend and i had him label everything he wanted to bring down, and everything he wanted to keep or put in storage.- i put one car in the shop because he just left it in the garage for a year, and we got a new battery in the truck, and drove it back down to our house. the other car is so old i don't think it'll make the trip.- i got his neighbor to cut his grass for the time being, after getting dad's permission to tell him what's going on.- the current tenant of his rental house wants to buy, so i guess i need to figure out how to sell a house without a realtor, which i've never done before.- i've gotten the name of an estate sales agency, to maybe go through and sell all dad's other stuff, which is the only thing i can think to do to deal with all the stuff we can't keep, and i've gotten the name of a junk remover for whatever is left.- dad's house will bare minimum need a major landscaping overhaul (he's let his land grow up significantly, and there are trees down in the yard), and possibly a new roof and definitely new flooring if we're going to sell the house. he owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless. i don't know.- i've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and i'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if i'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.- i let dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now i'm managing them for him.the whole time this is going on, all i can think is am i doing the right thing? how is this going to affect my life? how is this going to affect his life? am i missing something? and i'm constantly second guessing myself and my actions and whether i'm doing the right thing at the right time.i have no resources. my wife is still employed, thank the gods, but i've been laid off due to the virus, which is the silver lining to all of this because i'm getting unemployment with the extra money for the time being while i use my time to help my father, but eventually that's going to run out or i'm going to have to get a job to maintain our home and pay for him until we can get his finances figured out.so, i apologize for the long rant, but i guess what this post is about, is that i need help and though i know more than some i've never dealt with this and i feel like i'm drowning in stress, i don't know if i've missed anything important, and i don't know what resources might be at hand for this.and hell, in the midst of all of this, how do i actually care for my dad!? i'm managing his meds for him, and making sure he gets food, of course, but i'm at a complete loss for how to occupy his time, and help his life be worth living, especially in the midst of this virus stuff.and, selfishly, i need to figure out how i make sure that my dad's life doesn't consume my own? i know my life is derailed currently, and there is now a new normal, but what's on track for me going to look like going forward, etc.any advice, or resources, or anything at all is helpful at this point."," \- get power of attorney so you can deal with his finances, his property and other matters. his wife's insurance money will come in handy once that gets settled. \- put his name in for an assisted living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. my mother's place has assisted living and memory care in the same residence, just different floors. it seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. \- if he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. before my stepdad even started hallucinating, he would get lost and sometimes even ended up in the ditch. finally his kids started ""borrowing"" his car for weeks at a time until he was diagnosed with lewy body dementia and was told not to drive. \- check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. many places have senior's social workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a seniors' center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. \- it sounds like you are doing all you can so far. it will be challenging but the hardest part  is now when things are in such a mess. he is lucky to have you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/ggvuc4/dad_71_coming_to_live_with_my_wife_and_i_after_a/,,"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia.

"my 72 year old mother has been forgetful (getting her dates wrong for major events like weddings, misplacing things, forgetting to pay bills) as long as she's been my mom, but her memory has been steadily getting worse over the last few years and she is now acting weird in other ways.she loses her train of thought mid sentence and just starts stating facts that are sort of related to the thing we were talking about. she asks me the same questions repeatedly, although this might be loneliness and her trying to keep me on the phone. she makes really weird decisions and gets super defensive when you ask about them. this year she started taking out large sums of cash and carrying it around on her. she couldn't have a bag on her at work, so she'd stuff bills in her pants pockets and every time she stuck her hands in her pockets and pulled them out she'd drop money. she was dropping multiple $20 bills every week. i know there must be a reason- she's forgetting her pin or losing her wallet or something, but she gets angry and refuses to speak to me if i push the subject.she has short bursts of very petulant, childlike behavior and paranoia. they usually only last a few minutes, but they are very different from her normal behavior. this is what concerns me the most, she has a different look in her eyes, like she's confused and frightened.this week she left a tap running for hours and flooded her bathroom.i've looked up early dementia signs online, but most of them assume the parent previously had the ability to perform essential self care tasks, which my mother never has. she lost most of her teeth by 40 because she wouldn't brush them or go to the dentist. she has never been able to feed herself regularly, pay her bills often enough to not have services cut off, etc. she has always been bad at looking after herself, which makes it really hard for me to tell if this is cognitive decline or just her norm + aging. my sister has mentioned a few moments when she seemed ""off"" to her, but doesn't believe there is anything majorly wrong. she was working full time up until the pandemic. she seemed to be performing fine at work, her coworkers speak highly of her abilities when i interact with them.i feel like i should suggest she see a doctor to be assessed, but it may cause her to become angry and secretive. she would rather lie than have people worry about her. she once purchased a second kindle because i asked to borrow her kindle and she didn't want to tell me she didn't know where it was. if this is fairly normal for a 72 year old and she's probably going to be stable at this level of functioning for a while i don't want to push her and cut off any truthful communication. if this is actually concerning behavior i'd like to talk to my sister about  how we should approach it with my mom."," you should definitely not ignore this. make an appointment with her primary to discuss what you are seeing and what she is experiencing. if they discount what you have noticed it is time to switch doctors and find someone who has a better understanding of dementia. in the meantime, contact your local chapter of the alzheimer's association for guidance. you do not need a diagnosis to get help. they will be able to provide a lot of guidance and education for you as you figure out what is going on. they also have lots of support groups for caregivers and for those with dementia or alzheimer's. find your local chapter here:  [ hope that helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gf0bam/how_worried_should_i_be/,,How worried should I be?
"i’m not sure if this is a rant or a call for advice. basically my grandfather and his wife had a workplace affair in the 60s, and one day decided to walk out on their spouses and children to be together. i say “walk out on” but she left, while he kicked my grandmother and their four children out of their home with a few days notice. they’ve lived a purposefully isolated and reclusive life ever since. my mother and i are the only ones who ever came around and she was very clear that she would rather we didn’t, and only put up with us because he made her. i hadn’t been around in a couple years due to distance, but recently moved a bit closer (2 hour drive). my grandfather passed away last week. apparently, she’s been living with dementia for a few years. she should have been placed in an assisted care home long ago as she cannot even be left alone, let alone care for herself in any capacity. we found out she hadn’t showered or changed her clothes in 3 months. she won’t eat unless you put a cooked meal in front of her. most of her day is spent sitting at their small kitchen table, and going in the bathroom every 10 minutes to smoke. mom and i are taking turns staying with her and everyone involved hates it. mom is power of attorney/proxy, and i am the alternate. her children made it clear they want nothing to do with the situation or to help in any way. she has about a 10 minute “reset” time as we’ve been calling it. following the doctors advice we initially planned to tell her he died once, and then remain vague. but she’s so mean (was when she didn’t have dementia) and keeps telling us to leave her alone. my mom lost her patience and started telling her over and over that he died. now i can’t go back to the vague answers because while she can’t quite remember, she’s been told enough that she has a vague idea (saying things like “no...something else happened”) and getting combative until we tell her. she’s convinced that we just need to leave and that she can handle their house, their 7 cats, and her own care by herself. it’s clear that she can’t because she doesn’t even think to feed the cats or do anything for herself. we’ve been in contact with a few nursing homes and one seemed like they’d take her. we even had an appointment on monday where we took her there and they talked and they said they’d give us a decision in 24-48 hours but now they’ve just been ghosting us even though they have 12 open rooms. we’re in a pretty rural area so that was pretty much our only nearby option. my mom is now under the impression that at the first sign that somethings wrong with her (she’s been complaining of a pain in her head for a few days) that she’s going to take her to the hospital, where we can hopefully get adult protective services involved since we also can’t get them on the phone. it’s making us physically sick to be in that house since they both smoked inside of it for half a century. my mom has to do the bulk of staying there since i’m still working and like i said, live two hours away. my mom and i are both so exhausted from caring for this woman that always hated us and to be honest we never cared for her much either, that i’m worried for my mom’s sanity and my own safety. i’m just so exhausted and i drive all day for work on top of the drive there all the time (on top of my job which is very high stakes and stressful because of covid-19) that i feel like i’m constantly on the edge of falling asleep or passing out. i know my mom isn’t the type to do anything rash but if you make someone suffer physically, put them on the end of verbal abuse from their “stepmom” 24/7 all while trying to process the death of a parent, i’m worried she will do something in the spur of the moment. we’re both just so angry with the situation, that he put this on us, and that it’s all happening during a pandemic which makes everything 100x harder. we don’t even have death certificates yet to access his bank account so everything for her and his cats has been coming from us, and we both struggle to support ourselves too.", wow that's really hard.  you and your mom are good souls for taking care of her despite the fact that i kind of feel like she's not really your problem. have you considered getting any county or state agencies involved since her family doesn't really seem to want to take care of her?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gbhwca/grandfather_passed_his_wife_has_dementia_and/,,"Grandfather passed, his wife has dementia and hated us when she didn’t.

"apologies for posting so much, things are crapping out here. i will be calling his doc tomorrow and if she wont callback i guess ill have a caretaker out for a few hours. and cal social services. my dad (93) stroke dementia and parkinsons, tied to a walker on his good days and lucky to get around on his bad days hes also a narcissist so everything he says or does is god.  he has horrible balance issues. getting up from his chair to his walker is often an ordeal that involves struggling to get up and falling back into his chair. ive picked him up off the floor a few times and this morning he was callig cause he was weak and couldnt use his walker. tbh i never quite know if hes telling me the truth or hes running a game. even at his age and condition he still tries to manipulate.there is no one else to take care of him and he cant do anything. all i ask is he do things safely. but he doesnt use proper judgement. i see hime struggling to stand and ffer a hand and he gets belligerant. tonight he was hanging between his chair and walker, barely balancing and looked stuck, so i genty placed my hand on his back and he made it, then was pissed. i explained to him hos this is done and tgat if he had a nurse or caretaker here thgey would chew his ass for being unsafe and then give him a hand. he just spits venom. he was calling for help this morning but then tonight its 'i dont fucking need your help'. on the one hand i want to just say 'ok, fuck you, if you fall you fall'. if that happens im not waiting in him, he'll have to hire in someone. aight, sorry, but am i just being a idiot wanting to help him since he always complains of weakness and has horrible balance issues?  what i see when he tries to get up is he sticks his butt way back and that pulls his center of gravity back. ive told him that but of course he knows all. should i just let him alone and when hes trying to get up say goodnight and walk away?at tgis point i will try and talk to his doctor and if that fails social services or a carenurse. as far as i know fro someone like him he should not be allowed to do what hes doing but im damn tired of the belligerence and idiocy. he expects that he can jut tell me whatever and ill just go...huh? gosh ok well i guess i let you fall then, have fun.tbh im alone in this, will be searching for a caregiver supoort group, probaby online, cause at this point it feels like im lsoing the fight to mr knowitall.  i moved back to go back to school. lost my job and decided to study for a career change. mom passed and dads been going steadily downhill. he has 2-3 bad days then hopefully 5-7 good days. these last two down cycles were hell. if it gets any worse then i cant  take care of him. but despite all the crap it has been beneficial in that i do the chores and i get a place to stay and food. but here lately i can get anything done and it seems like im upset every night. hes starting to gaslight and thats not acceptable. unfortuantely i wouldnt find a jhob in this economy so i think im fucked. but am i correct to try and keep him safe or should i just let him struggle and walk away."," my papaw had the exact same issues you describe with standing, especially when getting out of his recliner. i got him a set of grab bars with handles that he could use to push himself up easier. (they are on amazon, under able life universal stand assist.) all of the physical therapists with home health who came to see him were impressed; none of them had ever seen anything like it and most asked me what they were called and where i got them so they could tell their other patients. they might be worth looking into for your dad.my grandmother is the narcissist in our family, and i am fairly sure she has dementia now too, but it is so hard to tell what is dementia and what is her usual  personality. she complains over literally everything; even if she loves something to begin with, she will complain later. (for example, i bought her new cordless phones a few months ago, and every time i’d ask if she liked them she would say yes, they were perfect. two nights ago she sends me a text asking if i still have her old phones because she doesn’t care for these.)it’s really hard not to let her attitude get to me, but i try to remind myself that she is making a choice to be miserable, but i don’t have to let her make me miserable too. if she’s in a mood i don’t indulge it, i carry on as normal and leave her alone as soon as i can. one way you might be able to tell what is dementia vs. narcissism with your dad would be to have someone else come in to help him. sometimes dementia patients are difficult with family but not with strangers, and will be perfect angels when a nurse tells them what to do. if your dad is hateful to strangers too, well, at least then you know that it’s nothing personal towards you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g9he21/when_to_know_they_need_help/,,when to know they need help
"hello world of aging parents. i have a challenge to overcome. i’ve been taking care of my mother. my husband and i have lived with her (in tight quarters) for over a year now. she’s on a dementia medication which improved her condition greatly. she has refused to take any medications recently, so she’s no longer on her anxiety/mood medication. the only diagnosis i ever heard for her, psychologically speaking, is borderline personality disorder, which appears to fit.my feelings oscillate wildly. often i think it’s not so bad. and then i go to places where i think the plan to move and leave her with an aid (to make sure she’s covered, needs wise) is all she deserves. she can be incredibly mean and also incredibly supportive and that’s her struggle. but i’ve felt that she let the worst parts of her get the better of herself. so i’m having a hard time biting the bullet and signing off for a lawyer to get her on medicaid and get her at-home care and disconnecting myself from the responsibility. my mom is against having her finances interrupted and having ‘a stranger’ help her with anything. this would mean both of those things. i also signed on to work out of state at the end of the summer, and my husband and i agreed that we should take some time to ourselves out there to get a foothold before having her come out, around 6 months of time. that means it is imperative to get that care set up for her. so there’s really “no option”.questions, comments, words of constructive criticism and/or support are all welcome."," the adjustment will be hard, but it sounds like it is what is best for all involved. reassure her that you are not disappearing forever, but want to go back to enjoying the role of daughter. it will be a good thing for all of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g4w5oj/support_needed_afraid_to_sign_papers_send_check/,,"Support Needed: Afraid to sign papers, send check for retainer to get mom community care"

[removed], thank you all for the comments. it’s been two days and i still feel like i wish i could do more as i go throughout the day trying to catch up on things that were otherwise neglected. it sucks we didn’t have as much support/resources we needed to keep him home longer but i hope for the best.maybe we’ll have a windfall and he can stay strong until i can afford to hire some help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/pl3e7d/moved_dad_to_memory_care_yesterday/,[deleted by user]

[removed]," would a mobile pet groomer offer a solution or would that be upsetting to have a stranger come to the house/driveway? are you able to get your mother into the car with you and take her along? calling ahead to explain your mother's health could be really helpful for an employee to know to approach her calmly and cheerfully and to spend a little extra time to explain what is happening.the way i see it, almost every adult has experienced a loved one with dementia or is at least aware of what it does to people. and most are more than happy to help out even in small ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/pkj4c4/mom_is_more_confused_and_paranoid/,Mom is more confused and paranoid
[removed]," can you engage your wife in this conversation?  sadly, this does need to be addressed sooner than later.  my father has early onset alzheimer's (diagnosed several years ago) and my mother was in denial for too long about it; now we are struggling to take care of him properly while waiting for memory care placement at our local va facility.  it is not an easy conversation, but again - the sooner the better from my personal experience.  medication has not helped my father, but that can certainly vary by patient - and again, the sooner the better.  this is truly a horrible disease, and i am so sorry you are having to deal with it.  you might have to push the issue a bit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/pke2ok/breaking_the_ice/,Breaking the Ice

[removed]," is she living with a caregiver, or alone?i live with an affected spouse.  by now, i am doing all the cooking and also manage meds.  most of his are to be taken with food.  i put them in a bartender's jigger, could also be a small jar or shot glass or salt cellar... and put that out along with his meal.  i always check to be sure he has taken them.since he has arthritis, knowing there is a pain pill in his meds (along with statin, bp meds, and alzheimers meds) is enough inducement for him to medicate.if he lived alone, i am sure he would be messing up with his medication virtually all the time.  it's just too hard.  so this might be why your grandmother can't take them.as for doctor appointments, he usually enjoys them (we joke about this being our only social life these days).  but for sure, your gran needs someone to accompany her, as well as mentioning relevant things to the doctor and remembering his instructions.good luck.  we all do the best we can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/pjkkbu/refusing_to_take_medication/,Refusing to take medication

[removed]," i'm so sorry. i really am hoping the best for your grandma, mine went through pretty much the same exact thing (minus covid) after a doctor gave her seroquel during an er visit for a uti. she went from living on her own with family checking in on her every other day, to the hospital, to assisted living then hospice... within 3-4 weeks. it was awful but she was also the type that couldn't stand the thought of not remembering/having to depend on anyone so it was very much her time/her choice. which brings some sense of peace i suppose. anyway, from a medical standpoint though, they do know that covid seems to attack the brain in younger people (i think the age is mainly due to the significant amount of grey matter your average 20 something has whereas as we age we lose a little each year and there are too many variables to rule out/lack of preliminary scans just before covid to compare to in order adult's.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/piqpmz/covid19_and_severe_alzheimers_progression_help/,Covid-19 and severe Alzheimer’s progression help.

[removed]," i wish you patience. my sincere feelings are with you. i lost my grandmom on july 25, who raised me when my mom was working. i am 29 years old. i know there is very little to do, and things will not get better. there will be days where you will have to decide she should stay in a hospital intensive care, or with you. we choose “with us” option, it wasn’t going to change anything anyways. but we wanted to be around her in her last moments instead of some machines in a cold room.i don’t know your mom’s situation. but there are still small things that can make her remember all of you again, that i wish we could practice more with my grandmom. i am pretty sure you know all the meds and supporting pills etc, so i will pass those. but one thing clearly makes difference and we totally easily skip that, walking, small exercises with your help, arms, legs, and sitting under sun with fresh air. i took my grandmom to hospital 20 days before her death, after 5 days of arrival from the hospital, she started “not to leave the bed” and within 14 days we lost her. when i took her to hospital, her memory was entirely gone, she was not aware of anything, not able to create long sentences, or sentences that makes sense. only “i am afraid” or “i am thristy” kind of things. but i was speaking to her doctors on the garden of the hospital and i forgot her wheelchair was under the direct sun for like 20 minutes maybe, she said it was hot, and i said sorry, but it’s good for the bones! then we tried to walk with the help of 3 other people for like 5 minutes until she is visibly exhausted. we came back home, the first thing she said was “(my mothers name), give orderabi a glass of water, kid is tired!” and we were like crazy happy after almost 6 months she remembered us. also, if you can create an album collecting your pictures with her from different years, names on top of those pictures, like me & my son james  kinda design will help a lot and bringing her old belongings around the house will also make her much more relaxed about everything. making her wear her old dresses, my grandmom singed her favorite childhood song a month before her death by heart with the singer and cried to it!these are all small things but believe me, all valuable, every meaningful words she will say will become so much valuable for you, you can also ask questions like do you like to share with me some story with your mom, her name etc and record them with a camera, you can show her this record and say this is you, and keep as a memory for yourself. i wish you patience, again. i am here anytime if you need somebody to talk. take care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/pezajp/this_is_hard/,This is hard

[removed]," that's a tough situation, i feel with you. i think the tips in the thread about redirection and distraction are right, talking facts or sense just doesn't work. both my parents also have dementia and i can identify with you quite a lot. the best advice i've gotten so far is to create a pleasant and comfortable environment/ setup. talk about your experiences and what you've done instead of asking questions. bring some flowers that you picked or some bread you baked/bought. anything that is nice really.and if you're not up for it, give yourself a break, try to be nice to yourself. if you can, get a break from helping them, you need to live too :-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/pedu1q/how_can_i_best_help_someone_who_doesnt_remember/,How can I best help someone who doesn't remember what they don't remember?
[removed]," all of us who are caregivers recognize what your mother is going through.  the most important thing i can recommend is for her to find a caregiver support group.  if your grandmother can't be left alone, it will have to be a virtual one or even just a support forum.  she should contact the alzheimer's resources in her area.  you can help with this, do a google search for alzheimer's and (city or state).another useful contact is the agency on aging for her locale.  they can help her figure out what financial help your mother can access.  again, google ""aging"" and (city or state).at some point (and maybe not too distant) your grandmother might be better served in assisted living.  this is where financial assistance becomes most relevant.i try to be a loving caregiver to my husband, but sometimes i do lose it and yell.  he had a hand surgery recently and kept undoing the dressing.  i yelled when i saw what he had done.  after the third time i insisted they put a rigid cast on him so he *couldn't* undo the dressing.best wishes to you and your family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/pe6v4z/advice_needed/,Advice needed

"my mother is her mom's primary caretaker and recently my grandma has gotten really bad. we don't know for sure if it's actual alzheimer's or dementia, but she has regular mood swings to the point where she will be speaking (nonsense) in a normal mood and then immediately switch into the most hurtful and mean things we've ever heard. she tries to start fights with members of the house, she hoards loose chips under her pillows, and frequently leaves the house unaccompanied. she was getting in the car at one point but my mom and dad now hide the keys. now she can't do that, she goes into the woods behind their house or will cross the street to the neighbors houses. yesterday they found her underneath someone's porch.my mom isn't sure what to do or how to get help. they've tried talking to doctors, and my mom is her power of attorney, but apparently the doctor doesn't think she's a danger to herself. just trying to help my mom get some relief or assistance, they can't afford to pay to house her at a facility that's equipped to help people like this."," so, dementia is a symptom, that has many causes, and alzheimer's is just one of them. some causes of dementia are fixable and some, like alzheimer's, are not. because of this, if you think your doc is not being helpful, you should push harder. you could try asking a doc for a clearer diagnosis or more instruction. you can also try and get a second opinion, especially from a neurologist. you could find a support group in your area from groups like this: if possible its good to find a group near grandma, because they may know what resources or govt help applies. alzheimer's assoc and sometimes aarp have free education regarding dementia too. it looks like there are 2 chapters in michigan: alzheimer's association helps with all kinds of dementia, not just alzheimer's, so dont be shy even if you're not sure what she has.keep in mind a lot of free support groups and education are online nowdays so don't give up if they are far from you. you could call the offices and ask for help, they may have some advice or literature to share. your state has a decent looking page for dementia support (note alzheimer's assoc and aarp are listed in their page): i would check out all the links on that page. they all look good. heres a link from one of their listed websites you should definitely check out:  . you should also find out if your state, county, maybe city has its own government office for ""eldercare"" "" elder care"" ""elderly affairs"" ""aging"" ""seniors"" or stuff like that. sometimes smaller local offices have resources too. you might be able to find such and office more easily in your phone book, and be able to find out what they may have to help you by giving them a call. this will be especially true if maybe they don't have much of a web presence. i think a lot of rural areas or or towns are like this. counties in the state i am in do things like pay for a day or two of day care, or provide some free in home assistance. stuff like that. but every county is different, and sometimes theres a waitlist. good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/p8xsu2/does_anyone_have_an_idea_of_resources_in_michigan/,Does anyone have an idea of resources in Michigan?

[removed]," here, it depends on the rate set by the family. if you're paying a rent based on x hours with a nurse, say 1 hour per day, family members would have to chip in more. that said, with toileting and delusions as issues, i'd be shocked if the care home has her on minimal care. it's time for someone to talk to the director. the other issue could be if your dad has argued at all with the nurses over her care. i learned during a meeting that my older sibling tore into the nurses one day and had to be escorted off the property. nurses were scared to go to help her if he was visiting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/p6tb4l/does_this_seem_right_memory_care_center_question/,Does this seem right?

[removed]," i’ve been where you are. you are 100% doing thr correct thing. think of it like this: if your dad needed surgery, would you take him to a hospital? all you’re doing is getting him the proper care from professionals who know what the they are doing so that everyone will safer and more comfortable. when my mother was diagnosed with cjd (very similar to alzheimer’s but far more aggressive) my dad was just adamant that he could take care of her at home. i should say that - at this point - my father wasn’t exactly the picture of health. we all spoke to him and said “no, you won’t be able to take care of her at home, and she needs professional care”. to make a long story short dad’s “caretaking” wound up with my mom literally face down in a ditch outside their house and my dad having a nervous breakdown. cut to - two month later: once my mom was safely in memory care her quality of life improved considerably. because the entire facility had been built around people using walkers and wheelchairs, my mother was able to actually move around on her own. because there were actual professionals who knew how to help her in and out bed and in and out of the bathroom, her risk of falls (which will never by 0) went down considerably. and mom was able to participate in activities including cooking classes, physical and music therapy, and even a dance class. obviously, none of these activities would have been available in my parent’s cramped, cluttered, home.  now, mom had a degenerative and effectively untreatable and 100% fatal condition. so she was confined to a wheelchair within about two months of moving in and passed away a few months later. all of those events were in line with her initial diagnosis. but the facility and the staff did amazing things. they couldn’t increase the quantity of her days but they worked hard to improve the quality of her days, and for that my whole family was thankful.as an aside, my father joined my mom in the facility a few months later as his own dementia deteriorated. his adjustment period was longer, but, like mom he eventually started to get into the social activities and now he even has two girlfriends (that’s a whole other story, lol). the point of my story: you’re doing the right thing. your father has a medical condition and you are seeking professional assistance to get him the treatment he needs. the treatment for his condition requires almost 24/7 care - so you’re getting him 24/7 care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/p6d8go/moving_my_father_into_memory_care_facility/,[deleted by user]

[removed]," the thing about alzheimer's is that she is losing the ability to learn and retain new information. especially if she has a stubborn personality to begin with. you're not really going to ""solve"" the issue. all you can do is deflect and distract and change the topic. you won't change her mind. you can say you already saw the doctor about your weight and they said you're healthy. or if she insists, you can take an extra serving of food and immediately quietly package it up to take it home or split it with another family member. say things like ""ok i'll do some research on that"". you could visit her in baggier clothing or sweaters and scarves that make your build less obvious and avoid the drama. or you can straight up tell her you recently gained a bra size to make her feel better. really there is nothing wrong with your body at all, but trying to convince her of that every time is just throwing your energy into a black hole. understand she loves you and is concerned doesn't get how to show it properly. then spend her last days talking about other things and avoid the topic altogether.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/p5r4z5/great_grandma_doesnt_understand_my_metabolism_is/,Great Grandma doesn't understand my metabolism.

[removed]," it sounds like he is in the very early stages, as far as my experience can tell. it's a very tough road ahead. my father was a very smart man but we began to notice that he was becoming more and more repetitive and forgetful. about a year or two after we noticed he was faltering, he started to believe there were multiple women in his house (it's only my mother) and wasn't sure ""who was who"". from there, his mood declined and he forgot many of his social graces, for which he was previously excellent. this was difficult on all of us, because it comes across as intentionally rudeness, which it obviously is not. geriatrics have not yet formally diagnosed him, but he's clearly in the mid to late stages and he is defiant (and in denial). the thing i am most proud of and thankful for is that i always treated his repeated and non-sensical questions as legitimate and valid. he trusts me more than anyone and i still get some very tender moments with him, even though the disease can make him a total prick",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/p1rt8p/my_dad_just_got_diagnosed_with_early_onset/,My Dad just got diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers .

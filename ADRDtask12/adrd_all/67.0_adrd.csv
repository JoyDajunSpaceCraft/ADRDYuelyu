"mum has just been prescribed an antidepressant. this was necessary but the side effects seem to be like she's actually been sedated. has anyone had this happen? i've asked for the gp to do an immediate review of her condition.we were wanting to help with her distress levels not have her sedated like a zombie. in my home country it is not legal for dementia patients or elderly residents to be sedated for the ease of the staff as this is considered being restrained.for reference mum has both alzheimer's and vascular dementia. she is in a fairly advanced state. she has been frequently wandering into other residents rooms. the other day she tried to remove another resident from a princess chair, so we did need to take some action about her behaviour and stress. she has also reached the stage where she frequently becomes very angry and slightly aggressive. we didn't want this sort of side effect though. i'm feeling very torn because i don't believe in sedating people for the sake of it and in fact it's not legal here, but mum seems to be in a constant state of distress and anger and clearly needs some sort of help. they try to make sure that she has activities that she can attend. because of her condition and because dad has cancer she's not able to be cared for at home.", we've had to change moms med's twice in the last few months & each time took a week for her to stabilize.  she would be totally zonked for the first 5 days or so then each day be more alert and herself.  each time i panicked thinking the meds were too much but after 2 weeks they were fine.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r64bvk/should_an_antidepressant_have_immediate_sedating/,Should an antidepressant have immediate sedating effects?
"i am that horrible daughter that has given in and not gotten home health care for my mother. she screamed for independence but she is starting to get to the point where she does things that are illogical.  i've posted a few times but she's to the point where she doesn't remember to eat, doesn't take a bath and is in a constant memory loop asking me the same question over and over. luckily, i have been working from home through the pandemic and have been able to spend quite a bit of time with her and meet her needs. the time has come (i believe) for me to get home health care. i have a life and want to be able to work (won't be working from home much longer), live in my own home (she wants me to move in with her) and am trying to juggle work, my mom and other responsibilities. why do i feel so bad for getting the ball rolling on the home care? i'm starting out with 4 hours a day a few days a week. i feel like i'm betraying her."," ohhh the ""guilt"" we feel when we put our lo in a home. this is something which is very hard to shake off. just remember that she needs to be in a facility where her needs are met and you are doing your very best to put her needs first and foremost. don't be hard on yourself. you got this☺️",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r5vtk9/home_health_care_guilt/,Home Health Care Guilt?

"hi, i'm fourteen years old and my granddad has dementia, alzheimers and hearing loss. hes 85 years old. he lives with me, my younger brother (he's 9) and my parents and a dog. he came to live with us maybe two years ago. i think hes had dementia since i was about 8. i didn't really know him before then. his wife, my grandma, died when i was ten years old of a heart attack. she was really the only grandparents i was ever close to. i loved her aand i was really close to her. so back to my granddad. like i said i didnt really know him before he had dementia. i used to get frustrated cause we would have the same conversations over and over, or because he would sometimes barge into my room while i was at online school and ask me to write a telephone number down for him but i dont any more. but lately it's been getting harder and harder.even before dementia i dpnt think he was a very nice person. my mum would sometimes tell me stories of him being borderline abusive - hed call her names, and ignore her, and push her into a wall, and break the things he liked because they were ""disturbing"" him. so i dont like him at all. but my mum is the only person who can take care of him. i've seen his private parts because one day he forgot to put his pants on. luckily my brother wasn't home. i have  changed his diaper before, since he shat in it. my parents try the best they can to take care of him albut most of the day they're at work. last week he kept calling my brother a little brat, a monster etc and my brother went crying in his room. my parents were comforting my brother but i got so mad i stuck my.middle finger up at him. then he started calling me a brat too, and i didnt really care. we went ot the mall with him too a whole ago and he got really agitated and wanted to go find my mother (she and my father were going to get some stuff from the supermarket and told me to stay with him where he was). anyway he got really mad when i tried to explain it to him, and he started to walk away. i was afraid my mother wouldn't know where we were so i tried to sort of move in his path so he started shoving me to the ground. i started to cry but he still wouldn't listen to me. luckily my parents came back then.a couple days ago too he kept demanding to see a doctor (hed seen one the day before) and when my mum said she did she lost her temper and started to yell at him, saying he was a horrible person and basically saying hed harrassed and hurt both her and my grandma i was really close to all their life. and she went on for a bit. i told my brother to stay in his room and listen to some music. then i went back to my room and started crying. i hate him. hes a burden and a trouble to us and i feel really really guilty for feeling that way, but sometimes i just hate him absolutely. i wouldn't care if he dropped dead. at least my mum would be free of him.anyway that's about it. i feel really stupid and selfish for thinking that way but does anyone know any tips for being more patient with my granddad? thanks."," first off, you’re not being stupid or selfish. every adult on this sub is having trouble dealing with a dementia patient in their home. these are real feelings you are having and they are not stupid. your situation is unique because you are a child. you should be posting about kid stuff not difficult adult stuff. second, talk to your parents, you and your little brother shouldn’t be home alone with him, there are laws that protect you. talk to a teacher if your parents blow you off, they will then talk to your parents and it will be a wake up for them to take action to change the situation. third to help you right now, and this is something we all talk about too, when a person is going through dementia it’s like their mind is aging in reverse. so, if a two year old goes walking through the house naked, you would just shrug and think, well he’s two, and not get mad just help them get dressed. it’s really the same thing. they can also feed off your emotions, if your angry they will be quick to anger too. my grandma was a mean lady, and i helped take care of her when i was a teenager too. one thing is their long term memory can be pretty good, and she loved music (like a little kid does) and i would change her mood quickly by playing music. so what i’m trying to say is he probably has something that makes him happy, some small thing (like a little kid) that will give him joy. try music, old types of candy(if he can have it, ask your mom), card games, puzzles, coloring books, old time toys, etc. you get the idea. his mind is kinda like a little kid but jumbled up with all these adult memories and thoughts that don’t make sense anymore but he knows they should. its frustrating for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r5ncpi/how_to_be_more_patient_with_my_grandpa/,How to be more patient with my grandpa?

"the problem here is that she was physically &amp; mentally abusive towards me all throughout my teen / young adult years when she drank. for this reason i do not see her often (maybe once every year and a half / two years) and have had to distance myself for my own personal mental health to be stable. her drinking led to a stroke due to an underlying condition (afib) and her mind was never quite the same after. she suffered from mild aphasia / mobility loss initially, but as the years of alcoholism have worn on, her memory has gotten pretty bad. my sister and i have taken her to detox and various rehabs more times than i can count, but she never stayed sober.she forgot that my paternal grandmother passed away, this was back in 2014. the few times a year i do talk to her on the phone, she will call me right after we hang up, forgetting that we had just spoken. this has been occurring for at least a few years. she also has not remembered my or my sisters birthdays for the last few years. my father, who was severely depressed &amp; an addict committed suicidal back in 2017 - my mom seems to be “stuck” in that year. i think it is because she feels guilty for having left him two decades ago for the man she was having an affair with. both of her parents died in 2014 as well, and she was on really bad terms with them due to her drinking when they passed. she seems to be “stuck” in that time period as well.since then her drinking has gotten so bad that all of her teeth have either rotted or fallen out &amp; she almost burned down her apartment. but i can’t help but feel like these may be symptoms of dementia and not just the drinking.the hard part is trying to discern if it’s the drinking, the side effects from the stroke, or if it could be dementia. i am not willing to subject myself to further abuse so me helping her is not in the cards at the moment. she is also with a partner who enables her &amp; supplies her with alcohol, he is also abusive and we have gotten into fights when my mom has been hospitalized in the past due to complications related to alcoholism under his “watch”. needless to say i don’t trust him to do the right thing when it comes to caretaking for my mom. he seems to only stick around to collect a cut of her disability checks, which he’s been able to get away with doing for the last 7 years of being with her.my sister and i have gotten wellness checks done on her, but she (and her pathological lying partner) have somehow been able to successfully convince several waves of police officers that everything is “fine” &amp; they leave with nothing having been done. i realize this is an incredibly complicated condition / situation and i’m just posting this with the hopes that maybe someone out there is also watching their parents from afar under similar circumstances. my sister seems to be a bit closer with her than i am (which is how i know about most of these awful symptoms she has displayed) but she has physically distanced herself from my mom for the same reasons that i have.i know that once something “bad enough” happens and she is once again hospitalized for either a seizure due to alcohol withdrawal or another stroke that my sister and i will step up and put her in a home. until then i feel like my hands are tied and it’s an incredibly conflicting feeling to prioritize my mental health &amp; avoid further trauma, ptsd, or physical/ emotional abuse. it fucking sucks."," first and foremost.  kudos to you for being a caring, responsible adult in the face of so much.  it sounds like you are doing everything you can do.  hugs.  dealing with dementia is bad enough, but when they are an addict -  i cannot imagine what you must be feeling.  one quick thought, are you in contact with her pcp?  if you are, you may be able to reach out, and schedule a convo just you and her pcp to talk through the symptoms, concerns, and everything.  then, try and encourage her to go (or your sister might be able to).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r4yeii/my_mom_age_59_who_had_a_stroke_at_42_has_been_an/,"My mom (age 59), who had a stroke at 42 & has been an alcoholic for almost 40 years might have dementia"

"hey all, i've posted about this on r/askdocs if you want to check my post there for more info, though i thought i'd post here as well. i'm a 17 year old male, so maybe i'm being totally irrational, but i'm still a little worried. i've found that dementia actually develops in someone wayy before they show obvious symptoms and it can be diagnosed, and so by that point its too late to treat (is it treatable at all?). english is my first and only languge, yet i will occasionally totally forget super common words. i'll know the idea for the word i want, but the actual word has absolutely slipped my mind; i know there's a word for it because i remember there being one and it would be crazy if there wasn't, but i can't manifest it in my mind for my life. sometimes when this happens i'll be able to remember the word after a minute or two, and sometimes i just won't be able to get it and i'll have to ask people for help. it's not like the word is totally gone from my mind forever though. eventually i do remember the word, i just can't recall it in that moment. i can't say precisely how often this happens, but i'd have to guess maybe once a week. though sometimes more often--it's mildly happened three times today, and once yesterday, which is a lot. i've never *heard*  or *read* and common word and not known what it means though (unless i actually haven't learned it somehow haha), only when i'm speaking/typing. i also sometimes forget names of people who i know pretty well, like teachers or family friends. i'll just absolutely not be able to recall what someone's name is. i might as well not even know their name, even though i have class with them every other day and see them almost every day. probably the worst case of this happening was when school started back again this year, i could absolutely not remember the name of a friend whom i had hung out with nearly every day last year. i didn't remember it until someone else said it, and i haven't forgotten it sense. it's not so bad that i'm forgetting my family members names though--it's usually a teacher who i had a previous year, a family friend who i haven't seen in a while (but i've still known very well for a long time). although it has happened with concurrent teachers. and a couple days ago, this wasn't with a word or a name, but i totally forgot my zip code. i remembered the first 3 numbers, but the rest i didn't know. i searched it up and read it and though ""no way that's what it is"", even though i've been able to perfectly recite it nearly my whole life, and it's even a nice combo of numbers that rolls off the tongue well. and that was just a single incident. now i can still recall it perfectly like i could before. i didn't mean for this post to be so long. should i be worried? i don't any other symptoms, or serious symptoms. my grandfather currently has lewy body dimentia, so i'm worried if that would increase the chance for me to get it. should i go see a doctor about it? or are these just the same memory slips everyone has, like when you walk through a door and forget what you were going to do? thanks for any replies."," i remember when i was a high school senior i was about to introduce my boyfriend at the time to a dear family friend.  i totally lost his name.  and the more flustered i got the longer it took me to recall his name.  a couple years later i was at a college get together with friends before classes started, and when a girl i had known about a year approached me, her name totally escaped my brain. gah!no alcohol or drugs were involved. when my daughter was in high school or early college (can’t recall 😊), she too had a brain fart and couldn’t remember a four digit code she’d known since middle school. i don’t know if this is all that unusual.  maybe it has to do with stress or fatigue but please ask your doctor. btw, a helpful hint about walking through a door:  i repeat to myself the object i am going to retrieve as i’m walking through the door and that helps me remember my errand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r4lu1b/signs_of_early_dementia_should_i_seek_help/,[deleted by user]

"my nana has had dementia for about 8 years now. while my family all take turns sleeping at her house at nighttime to make sure she’s safe, the “big jobs” (bathing, changing pads, anything with bodily fluids xd) seems to fall onto my mam and me. one thing we have not figured out for the life of us is how to manage my nanas weight. for the first few years of her condition, we think she ate very many times a day as her groceries would disappear.

"i see a lot of posts about those taking care of their family members with dementia, and being judged by other family members in a sense. or worse for that matter. no other family member will help even though they should hold the same amount of responsibility that you should have, and you are the only one to actually act on it. i'm not sure if that is the clearest way to put it but i think the gist is given because most on the sub are in that situation.i just want to explain my situation, not to get tears or likes or upvotes from others, but just to throw this out there and see if there are any suggestions, see if anyone else is in a similar situation, just anything that can help. and even if it's saying ""best of luck""... that can helpmy mom was dropped off at my apartment from the family she was living with during covid, she was living in their rv. they took her in because she lost her apartment and she was part of the church, also got them a job there (it was a school), and had contributed with living there. her condition is very mild and doesn't need help bathing or physical things. but that isn't justification for them to keep her around and that is fair. as i am thinking she is doing just fine there, i received a text saying that ""your mom is coming to visit"". they are in northern california and i am in southern, so my mom would come and visit often. only this time it was strangely worded that there was no plan on her going back, and no plan for me to prepare for this. just a simple text that between the lines stated ""your mom is coming to live with you from now on, she will be there tomorrow.""so that happened. i have no idea what to expect. she was still in an early stage so it didn't occur what the challenges were going to be down the road. they drove her down the next day with a dresser and files of documents and gave me the glhf. i pleaded with them to give me more time to figure out a better living situation before she came to stay, but no to availed. i just had started a new job that could make enough to find somewhere for her to live and get care but it went downhill. i left for work and she would be crying on every phone conversation not knowing where i went and why i wasn't with her while she was ""visiting"". she thinks it's still a vacation and that she is going to return back there. it's been 2 years now and i still can't figure things out. i can't physically take her somewhere that she doesn't want to live, and she always thinks i'm taking her to a psych ward whenever i suggest it. i, or we, live in a studio apartment currently. my new job should fix that situation soon but who knows what will happen. i've been in a studio apartment with my mom for 2 years and i miss so much of my life. i even bought dividers for when i work and sleep, but it's still so off-putting having her live in the same room. it just seems like a dead end. until i make enough to find somewhere nice, that is going to cost a shit load of money, i'm stuck.  in the end: please appreciate being able to have your own room, to have any privacy, and to be able to plan ahead. this may come off as selfish, but i'm fine with that. i'm being selfish, sure. but if i was in my moms situation and could comprehend what i'm putting my son through i would do my best. unfortunately, this has all become a vacation for her ruining my life, although not intentional. and there aren't any other family members that can chime in because she is my only direct relative, i can't be angry at distant cousins or other members of her church, it just all falls on me."," find whatever care home you feel is appropriate for the level of care she needs.  do not tell her, find the place and if possible get the new room set up with some of her stuff so it feels familiar, then just take her there, no discussion beforehand. she won't understand if you try and explain it anyway.  follow the lead of the care home: should you visit soon after or wait a couple of weeks so she can settle in. there is no shame in not being able to take care of her all by yourself, you were put in an impossible situation but you must make the decision which is best for both of you.  good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r420ye/i_understand_the_frustration_of_dealing_with/,I understand the frustration of dealing with other family members not contributing or judging your methods of caretaking... but what if you are the only direct family member?

"i have an upstairs neighbor. he's in his 70's and recently found out he's terminally ill.i am very sure he also has some form of dementia or alsheimer's, because he tends to be extermely confused and doesn't understand everyday things. he has a son, but he told me that he does not want to help at all.i have been taking care of him since the last months, going grocery shopping for him, cleaning, bringing him meals and helping with his mail and everyday tasks. since i am a student i am very busy and don't feel comfortable to handle the responsibilities myself, i have now arranged a caregiver for him. (but it will take some weeks until the caregiver comes). so the reason i am posting this here, is a situation that happened 2 days ago.my boyfriend and i woke up at 6:30 in the morning and we heard a weird beeping sound. it was really annoying but also kinda quiet so we thought it was a car alarm from outside. after roughly 10 minutes we get up, and my boyfriend notices the sound is getting louder when he moves to a different room of the apartment. finally, we realized that it was the fire alarm from our neighbor upstairs. we run upstairs, my boyfriend bangs on the door and i go ahead and ring every neighbors bell to warn them. after a couple minutes the neighbor finally opens the door. and dark grey smoke was coming from his apartment, from the kitchen area. you could hardly see anything, let alone breathe. so my boyfriend runs inside to find the fire. luckily, there were no flames yet, but there was a pot on the stove which had some form of meat inside, black smoke arising from it. my neighbor told us after, that he wanted to cook something in the middle of the night, and then he just went to sleep. and he didn't wake up from the alarm.if we wouldn't have heard the alarm, my neighbor would propably have died from carbon monoxide poisening.so, the most dangerous part of it is that while we (and the other neighbors who came running out their apartments) were completely panicked, he was completely oblivious to what was going on. no reaction whatsoever. while we were screaming ""fire! its burning!"", he was literally laughing at us, going back into his smoke-filled apartment and peacefully combing his hair infront of his mirror. he did't know what the problem was. so my boyfriend took care of the smoking stove and thankfully nothing further happened. i didn't initially call police or anything because i truly couldn't think clearly at this point. also, i had an appointment with his caregiver later on in the day and wanted to talk to him first, before calling the police or something.  later on in the day, after speaking to all my neighbors abutbthis, we agreed that this wasn't save and we should call the police. well, they told us that we called too late and they couldn't do anything anymore, because the situation wasn't acute anymore. so, we basically have to wait until he will burn something down next time. he really does not think clearly anymore. christmas season is coming and i saw that he bought alot of candles.i am scared for my life at this point. i have hardly slept last night.i just don't know what to do."," if his stove is electric, unplug it. if it’s gas find the shut off valve. it sounds like you are in his place a lot, just hide or take the candles. if you are helping him with meals then a “broken” stove isn’t too big a deal. do what you think best until you can get the proper authorities to intervene. it’s not worth the risk to him or his neighbors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r3mxmk/im_afraid_my_neighbor_will_burn_the_house_down/,i'm afraid my neighbor will burn the house down.

""all she does is watch tv, it's easy!"" he says as i come home emotionally exhausted and immediately have to work on final essays and projects. i have bad mental health even before this, i can barely care for my cats (my father does most of the work at this point and then scolds me like i'm a forgetful five year old). today she started an argument and i just realized i'm at my limit. i should have never taken this job, all i can think about is breaking all the glass in her cabinet. i only have three days left and i just don't know if i can do it. she needs someone who is patient and can take care of her without getting upset. i can't telling my dad he'll tell me to just hold out, it's only three days. none of this is her fault. she never even remembers when she argues with any of the caregivers."," i can empathize with you. my grandmother (96) lived with me for the past year while my folks were building a new house. i also have two kids of my own and a husband who works away for 28 days at a time. no one understood or saw the abuse that was happening to me, not even my husband because my grandmother was on perfect behavior whenever he was home. my mental health rapidly began to decline in october and was full out spiraling into depression. thankfully my parents finished their house and moved my grandmother in with them. unfortunately she fell out of bed and broke her neck the first night there. i was literally the only person my grandmother would listen to or accept help from. called 911 and the paramedics took her to er. after four days she was sent to a short term care home that didn’t understand that she has dementia. yes, she’ll verbally agree to follow directions, but it doesn’t mean she’ll remember. so her first night there she got out of bed, fell and broke her pelvis and hip in three places. back to the hospital. now she’s been at the short term care facility for two weeks. after all of this my family has finally begun to understand what i dealt with on a daily basis. this week we will be touring and interviewing memory care facilities. if you like to read there’s an excellent book called “the 36 hour day: a family guide to caring”. it explains a lot of what is happening inside their brains. but it’s hard. so hard. be good to yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r3g919/i_dont_want_to_care_for_her_anymore_i_just_dont/,"I don't want to care for her anymore, I just don't want to be near her"

"i don't know where else to post this so here we are.my grandpa being a 86 year old veteran, he doesn't take much nonsense from anyone. not when it comes to his family or animals, anyway. i've seen him begin to deteriorate as she plays the denial card, making excuses as to why its happening etc, his new primary doctor finally got him in to a neurologist to determine which disorder it is. so anyway, i got the homestead, they moved to a new place, which he is not pleased about. everything hit the fan on thanksgiving after multiple threats were made against my dog. after the fight, he began protesting that he wanted his own place, which i know isn't safe for him at this point. i drew the line at him coming back to the house, as i cannot care for him on my own, he would be restless and moving between houses or just refuse to go back. he began protesting that he'd take me out of his will, take his son out of his will for not driving us, just all sorts of irritational stuff. i told my mom we should start looking at memory care facilities as i have a feeling now that it is noticably onsetting it will get much worse quickly &amp; put more of a strain on everyone. she doesn't seem too thrilled or interested, and we've already made excuses as to why he can't drive his truck instead of having a safety discussion as he does not want to lose his independence, understandably. it's just a generally tough and seemingly unsolvable situation."," someone in your fam needs to get him to sign a power of attorney for financial and medical. have it notarized. i hid my dads vehicle keys so i could deny i had the keys. he was unsafe but insistent. yeppers had a lot of threatening behaviors also. when speaking w his doctor, request a behavioral health exam. they will assess and find whatever is going on w his brain. lastly the va has veterans centers where he can be placed if he needs long term care. or they can provide home health. that gave me some badly needed help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r32r3i/my_mom_wants_to_play_hot_potato_with_him_i_dont/,[deleted by user]

"so before i get started i really do need to give a trigger warning regarding csa and csam, whilst i'm not going to be giving details i know it is a very sensitive topic. this is why i've given it a ""spoiler"".&amp;#x200b;so my grandmother has been displaying signs of dementia for a few years, about a year ago she had a stroke which has aggravated/accelerated the symptoms. we are trying to get her a diagnosis but it is difficult as my grandfather is trying to ""cope"" aka deny its all happening (that's a whole different topic). like many of you, we struggle sometimes with the repetitive questions, odd behaviors, and loss of the woman we love. however, there is one extremely difficult topic: her brothers.my grandmother was the youngest of 10 siblings. we always knew she wasn't close to many of them but we put it down to her being the youngest and spending the majority of her childhood at her eldest sister's house (who was 18 years older than her and married not long after my grandmother was born). around 6 or 7 years ago two of her brothers died in quick succession and she refused to attend the funerals, this is when we discovered that she was abused by them when she was a child. during this time she relied heavily on her brother who was closest in age to her (we'll call him fb). this led to more visits to extended family than i can ever really remember and my mother becoming close to two of her cousins (neither of whom were the children of fb). after a few years, the contact with fb abruptly stopped. emails weren't answered, the phone lines were disconnected, social media profiles vanished. my mother then spoke with her two cousins who had discovered that fb had been arrested and charged with csam and grooming. this was a major shock to everyone but we all agreed to close the door on him so to speak and decided to leave his (now ex) wife and his (former) stepchildren and grandchildren alone to deal with their own trauma and heal. we all began to question former aspects of his life- such as his adult childrens estrangement and preference to talk to children vs adults at family gatherings. my grandmother was beginning to show symptoms at this time and was the only member of our family not to accept her brother's true nature. it was extremely difficult for her to accept that her favourite brother, who loved our family and was so kind and loving to her, her children and her grandchildren, was ""just as bad"" or ""the same"" as her abusers. she talked about how fb wasn't ""evil"" like the others, ""the same"" or ""as bad"" and that this couldn't be true at all and that it must be a misunderstanding (it definitely wasn't). this resulted in her ringing fb's ex-wife (which went horrendously and we were told she wanted nothing to do with our family ever again and that she had a restraining order against him). soon after this newspaper reports revealed that he had taken a plea bargain and was definitely guilty. after this, my grandmother rarely brought up fb and we drifted away from my mother's cousins.fast forward to now and my grandmother will not stop talking about fb- completely unaware of his crimes. we avoid bringing up his crimes as she clearly has memories of her childhood trauma (as she has begged not to see her other brothers, unaware that they are very much dead) but it is hard to explain to her why fb is not there. we've tried lying and saying that he is dead or that we haven't heard from him in a long time (which is technically not a lie) but every time she goes through a grieving process that is extremely difficult for everyone involved. we've also tried saying that he'll be over soon but for some reason she seems to remember this and then brings up his impending visit constantly, this is also very difficult for us as the thought of seeing the man makes us all want to vomit. has anyone else had to deal with something similar? has anyone had to deal with explaining an estrangement to a loved one with dementia? i think more than anything i just needed to vent."," thanks for sharing and venting here.  it helps us all to know we aren’t alone in this struggle.  vent anytime.  it’s hard.  i haven’t experienced this to the extent you have.  my father in law has dementia and has now forgotten his wife died 4 years ago from cancer.  he now believes she died this may of covid.  i think a few have corrected him, but we try to avoid the conversation and just let him believe what he believes.  but it hurts to see him down as if she really did die this year.  he is blaming his issues on her passing so recently and not that he has dementia.  he doesn’t believe he has a problem.  we just got guardianship of him as his judgement is struggling to recognize what is a scam or false and is essentially gone. i’m glad you posted.  sorry you have to go through this.  your post helps me to see what is probably in my future to an extent.  therapeutic lying is something i’m going to have to learn.  i hope and pray your grandmother can know some peace from her past trauma and i pray strength for you and your family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r1gc0h/very_difficult_conversations_trigger_warning/,Very difficult conversations (Trigger Warning)
"so,i’m slowly trying to come to terms with the fact that my mothers probability of having dementia is high. i haven’t been dealing with it well and i keep catching myself having moments where i try to excuse it away.. i tell myself, “oh,well. she remembered an actor from a favorite show she liked! so,that has to be a good sign!” or “she didn’t misplace this today,so it can’t be dementia!”. this false hope is the only thing that’s been keeping me a float,i so want my mom to be okay. i want her memory to be what it once was,but it’s really not and it hurts so bad. she’s here but i miss her,and i’m angry with myself for missing her when she’s still in my presence. she’s still my mother but some days it feels like she’s a completely different person. my heart is so fucking broken,broken for selfish reasons and for her. i just want her to be okay,i want to be strong for the both of us and i have no clue how to be when i can’t even fully cope with her having it."," you're not heartbroken for selfish reasons. dementia is such a cruel disease, because it's a slow death: we watch the person ""die"" for a long time before their body actually succumbs. we lose them, mentally and emotionally, by degrees. it's really fucking sad and heartbreaking. you're allowed to notice that she's not the person that she once was, and you're allowed mourn her even though she's technically still alive. that's natural! it's your mom, and it's crushing to watch her deteriorate. mourning is the appropriate, natural response to this situation. if you haven't taken her to see a doctor yet, i recommend doing so asap. look into support groups in your area, network with people who have also watched their parents go through this, and sort out the legalities (healthcare power of attorney, taking over her finances, etc.) as best you can. the sooner, the better. best wishes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r1dk41/coping_with_possible_dementia/,Coping with possible dementia

"hi everyone,my first ever post in reddit and not a happy one at that.if any of you guys could post advice on what the early signs for your loved ones were and how you dealt/coped with them i'd really appreciate that.my grandad is my world. he's everything my parents never were. i live with him now as i'm mentally not able to live on my own (severe depression, c-ptsd, etc).i've lived with him for 4 years now. we get on great and things have been great up until now. in 2018 he ended up in hospital with sepsis. was in intensive care for 2 weeks.once he left hospital it took him some time to come to grips with what happened to him.it left an impact on me as he started convulsing and frothing at the mouth in my car driving home. called the ambulance and it was a day later where i was informed that he had sepsis, which developed from having a uti.he was back to normal after the whole ordeal after a couple of months.now the changes happened when the pandemic hit last year and we were placed into lockdown (i live in the uk).my grandad has always been an outdoor person. loved the army days so much he served for 21 years.so being stuck indoors for months on end with nothing to do and constant bad news on tv has definitely had an impact on him.the biggest change happened when we visited my uncle in london this july.was meant to be for a couple of weeks. my grandad started to forget words and could barely string a sentence together. i remember my uncle's partner telling me he seemed to have lost it and i said it could be early onset of dementia and i remember having a mental breakdown after taking my grandad to a&amp;e to have an assessment done.he had a memory test done and it was 50/50. they reckoned being put on the spot impacted the scores.he briefly forgot his address, but second time could say it confidently.we left london to go back home as at that point i was an emotional wreck and couldn't enjoy what was supposed to be a small holiday and to see family. the charm wore off.my grandad seemed to improve for a while. roll on today and it's gotten worse over the last couple of months again.forgetting so many words, struggles to string sentences together and admitted to me today that he has a hard time understanding people.so speech and understanding of the language seems difficult for him. he doesn't get lost whilst out and about as he's out every day. he doesn't lose or misplace items. he does seem down or even depressed. sleeps an awful lot and in the afternoons. doesn't do the things he enjoyed i.e. puzzle books, reading, watching sports, etc.so speech, understanding of the language, and sometimes being inappropriate (giving people the middle finger when we are out and about if said people are rude or just farting in public) seem to be the issues at hand here.i've rang the gp and am awaiting a call. i'm trying to get in touch with dementiauk, but they seem very busy so left a voice mail.what were your experiences before your loved ones were actually diagnosed?i'm just hoping it's depression and not dementia 😔thanks guys!"," it could be dementia but it could also be mini-strokes. mom had both (she likely had vascular dementia), and each time she had a small stroke it knocked her off her baseline. keep an eye on the uti situation.  in the elderly it really messes with their brains.  mom had one and it temporarily made her dementia much worse until the antibiotics kicked in.  make sure he gets plenty of water on a daily basis. hopefully his doc will call you soon.my mom’s early symptoms were memory looping (repeating same things over and over again within minutes), messing up her checkbook, forgetting to pay bills, paying bills twice, not being able to use simple electronics, not bathing regularly, and some paranoia. she would also exhibit reckless behavior (picked a mushroom on a walk and started to eat it, same with other plants, littered).best of luck, i hope he bounces back if it was stroke related or lingering uti.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r177q2/my_grandad_may_or_may_not_have_onset_of_dementia/,My Grandad may or may not have onset of dementia *long post warning*

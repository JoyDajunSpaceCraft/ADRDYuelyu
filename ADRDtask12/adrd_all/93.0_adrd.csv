"hey! i know this is reddit and you can’t really diagnose someone on here, and that i should see a professional but indulge in me if you will. i’m really concerned that i have some form of dementia. i’m 18 years old and a daily marijuana user (my mom says it’s brain fog, i hope it is) i also indulge in psychedelics as often as i can. i’ve had unexplained weight loss from 160lbs to 130lbs in a few months period, and recently i’ve had no appetite, just a few bites and i’m full. i also feel as though i have no perception of time, one minute and five minutes feels the same to me. entertainment such as music and shows are now what feels like an impossible task for me as i can’t really follow along or i simply don’t want to (could be anhedonia) i’ve had ringing in my ears recently and ear aches. i also find it hard to converse, if there’s a pause in the conversation i’ll forget what we were talking about but have the general idea of what we were talking about. all of this has been ongoing these past few days,i’m really concerned and it’s driving me crazy."," cannabis has the capacity to destroy cognition, especially at your age.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kxj8nl/im_18_do_i_have_dementia/,"I’m 18, do I have dementia?"
"fairly sure my dad has dementia. certainly some sort of 'foggy headedness' as he describes it. just this week i've finally got him to the doctor's to start the path to diagnosis.but twice today i have seen two examples of new behaviour and i wondered if they were familiar to anyone else.at lunch he started talking about a problem he'd had with his computer. he couldn't remember the details but it was frustrating at the time (likely months, if not years ago) and was suddenly frustrating him again. he kept talking about a set of three parallel wavy lines that for some reason stopped him from completing the task in hand. my best guess is he was trying to insert a chart or diagram into a document. anyway, that doesn't really matter. whatever the task was, it no longer needs to be achieved and he conceded that he may actually have sorted it out in the end.it was odd that it should have popped back into his head though, and watching his frustration at his inability to articulate his thoughts was quite upsetting.then this evening we watched an item on the news about scottish fishermen having difficulty expiring their good to europe after leaving the eu. this triggered another fretting session. again, he could barely remember the details but he thought that maybe he'd signed away some rights and should've taken some sort of action. so far as i can tell it had nothing to do with fish, scotland, exports, or even the eu. maybe his pension, maybe the nhs. he thought there was a letter or email 'about a year ago' relating to him losing 'three rights/things' and he couldn't remember what it was, who it was from, or if he'd resolved it at the time.his inability to remember and to articulate his thoughts really distresses him. i try to help him talk it through, but i'm starting to wonder if that just makes things worse.so somehow, minor events of the day seem to trigger memories of things that are barely (or not at all) related. things from his recent past that are likely of no consequence now but were frustrating back when they originally happened. and things that he can't actually remember the details of, but he seems to have stronger recall of the emotion connected to them.sound familiar to anyone?"," yes. it’s called getting old. it’s fine to get a diagnosis but unless it’s something serious there’s not much to be done. i got my doctor to prescribe a small dose of namenda for my deteriorating memory, but there’s no cure for old age. serious illness or conditions aside, try to appreciate the dad you have. life is truly so short.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kxicfp/agitated_by_past_frustrations/,Agitated by past frustrations
"my dad  has moderate dementia.  although he has never been a talkative or very social person, lately he has becoming more and more apathetic.  not depressed, angry, moody or agitated, just apathetic.  for example, he will watch tv but doesn't matter what it is and can even be on mute. we will engage in a conversation with him but rarely a response or follow up questions from him. he use to occasionally suggest visiting some fam he hasn't seen in a bit, but he no longer asks.  none of this is particular problematic for us (and we are grateful he isn't angry or combative), i just feel bad he almost always looks bored. he is currently taking  rivastigmine and namenda. i didn't realize apathy was such a common symptom of dementia until i read about it. i realize this is part of the disease and likely there is no magic answer but anyone have experience with improving this?", medications and psychotherapy can help restore interest in life,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kxgkk8/anyone_have_suggestions_to_treat_apathy_in/,Anyone have suggestions to treat apathy in dementia patients?
"i’m sure there are many posts like this. i’m not usually much of a sharer but i guess i just want to post this. my mom and i had been taking care of my grandmother for years now, but within the last three days we finally moved in with her, which has been months of preparation. this morning we find her in her bed, and she’s passed. obviously none of you knew her but this is just like her, as soon as we move in of course she has to die. there were so many nights i wished she wasn’t here, so many nights spent cleaning up her literal shit, being screamed at and hit as hard as she could muster, which wasn’t much. hours spent chasing her around as she paced the house, nights spent crying because i was so angry and frustrated and overwhelmed, how no one should ever have to do this. some days all i could think about was her dying. yesterday she threw up, something really unusual for her, i guess we should’ve gone to the urgent care, should’ve called 911 i don’t know. but we were so scared to have anyone in here, we knew if she got covid that would be it. well obviously in the long run that didn’t matter. just last week she was okay, sitting outside happy to pet the cat, but yesterday her eyes were different and the previous few days she was more out of it than usual. we thought it was her increased zyprexa, we were sure as soon as we got her off it she would go back, not to normal, but her normal dementia self. now she’s dead and i feel like i have nothing, no purpose. i’m 25 and i’ve spent the last 6 years of my life taking care of her. i always said i wouldn’t let taking care of her become my identity l, but here i am anyway. part of me thought she would pop up from bed, as we waited for the people to collect her. i feel horrible for my brother, we wouldn’t let him see her, his girlfriend tested positive, but he had three negative tests, still we were terrified. now he can never say goodbye. right now this pain feels insurmountable. too much for one body. i never posted here but often read through it, felt better knowing people were going through the same thing. even as her brain was deteriorating she still loved us, i would always say “you’re my good friend right?” and she would always say “yes, of course.” just like a grandma would. i don’t know, i just wanted to share with people i thought could understand. thanks for reading."," i'm so sorry. love and pain are so deeply intertwined. you just did a terribly difficult and thankless task for another person, and you should be really proud of yourself for making sure your grandmother was never alone until the end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kxdr3e/its_over/,It’s over

"my mom is 71 years old and seems to be at the midway point of her journey with dementia. she used to crotchet (and remembers this) but has completely forgotten how to crotchet; she doesn't really have any other hobbies apart from supervised window shopping and watching television.latch hook kits are a relatively simple and cheap craft activity that kept mom engaged for about 15 minutes today. i had to sit with her and help her figure it out -- it required lots of my help and encouragement -- but it was something we could do together and she laughed a bunch and expressed a bit of pride.we basically got through 20 ""stitches"" (all one color -- white -- in the first row of the pattern). she couldn't do any of them on her own and we had to re-do about half of them; i ""drove"" about half the time but placed the hook in her hand as much as possible.i'm hoping she'll maintain interest and be able to learn this skill enough to where she can do it somewhat on her own -- or at least looks forward to doing this together.here's the design i selected for our first project -- i picked this one because the colors are simple and easy to differentiate; she's nearsighted so we're doing all of this with her reading glasses on. this kit comes with everything you need, except filler for the pillow -- i'll order that if we finish. ran about $18 usd on amazon.hope this helps someone else.edit: uploaded photo of the design."," that's so lovely, and i'm glad she was able to engage with it and yous were able to share that activity together!possible suggestion for the future for if she isn't quite able to manage the actual stitching any more, i've seen people use even just winding up the wool as an activity, as if set up right it uses more broad movement skills than fine ones, still gives them the sensory experiences of the feel of the wool and the colours etc. and let's them feel like they're being useful and are helping. may or may not work for you one day, but it's an idea i've stored away to use with my mum one day as she was a big crafter in the past",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kwvftl/simple_craft_activity_latch_hook_kits/,Simple Craft Activity (Latch Hook Kits)

"he is 50 and for two years or more, i have noticed that he’s not “with it”. i could talk about the simplest things and he has zero clue what i’m talking about. for example, we were working on taxes and i closed the browser tab and he had zero clue what i’m talking about. he had add but this is far worse. he remembers nothing that i tell him. granted he’s usually on the damn phone posting/talking on facebook but it’s still different. his mood is ridiculous. he will go off on customer service reps for a full hour of verbally abusing them. he gets verbally abusive with people on fb over this capitol right. he got verbally abusive with his mom. the worst was when we had a stained concrete floor installed and he made them redo it 3xs!!!!!! he said there were imperfections. i saw none. workers saw none. friends saw none. it was embarrassing and awful because it was near obsessive. yesterday he went to a client 50 miles the opposite way. he said he was trying to remember the manager’s name who he has known for 15 years and he couldn’t. he repeated it all night in his head. woke up, couldn’t remember it. i honestly thought it was due to him smoking weed. he’s a long time user and has been getting good stuff with his medical card. i don’t smoke so that was my guess out of the blue.we’ve had a rollercoaster marriage for 18 years and have a 12 year old son. that sure hasn’t helped with my own depression or wondering if this marriage can survive. i’m more of a maid, secretary, errand runner, billing clerk, healthcare navigator,..overall a mom of a bratty teen who is 50. so now with this going on, i really don’t know how to cope. i bring in the most $, everything we have is from either me or my parents when they died. i bring in healthcare and retirement. so financially together it’s check to check. apart, he has nothing. it’s an incredible strain to take care of someone when healthy let alone the possibility for dementia. i’m overwhelmed every day. i’m unhappy. i’m overworked. i don’t know how to deal with a diagnosis of ftd."," hard to say for certain - they were able to give an absolute diagnosis for my sister, but she was further along than it sounds like with your husband.she got a formal and comprehensive evaluation by specialists at a memory clinic under the supervision of a neurologist.  it was about 2 hours of cognitive tests for her, while family members gave historical behavioral information.  combined with the mri, which showed significant brain volume loss in frontal lobes, the diagnosis for my sister was as conclusive as it can be.if you do get a diagnosis of ftd, i would recommend discussing your financial and legal situation with a professional to plan for the inevitable future and also to see if you qualify for any assistance - for example since your husband is working-age he could qualify for disability. if you're working with a memory clinic or neurologist, the social workers on the team are a great resource for this.i'm sorry this is happening to your family, ftd is not a kind disease and in many ways affects loved ones much more than the person who has it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kvunxx/50_year_old_husband_going_to_get_tested_for_ftd/,50 year old husband going to get tested for ftd.

"so for years, my grandmother would forget trivial things, how to get to my middle school, simple directions, simply just a symptom of getting older. mind you my grandmother was still driving when she was 92 (not well, but driving!). but when lockdown occurred, her retirement home went into shutdown immediately (months before our community even had a mask mandate or stay at home order). they made the residents stay in their apartments with everything delivered to them, no outside visitors, you had to call or see them from their apartment balcony. needless to say, the decline was rapid, she'll answer the phone in a very professional tone even after you say who you are, it'll be halfway through the conversation before she can piece together who you are. for example, my dad will call, they'll talk for a few minutes then say ""sunshinestategal is right here hold on"", i'll get the businesswoman voice until i say it's ""darling"" (not the real name), this is the nickname she and my grandfather gave me when i was 20 minutes old, her tone goes into the ooey-gooey grandmother voice, like she's remembering this little baby when i'm 18 years old. but she'll ask the same question about 10 times in 3 minutes, she just cannot remember that she already asked it. the funny part is that she'll always ask me what i'm doing that day and i'll always respond ""cleaning my room and homework"", she'll laugh and say ""i get that response every time, how well is that cleaning really going? might be time to just get an industrial broom and sweep it under the bed and call it a success!"". and even now she might forget names and but somehow whenever we speak she seems to tell me something new, like what her history teacher was like senior year of high school in new york in 1944 when she was 16 years old. or that didn't i know my grandfather memorized the eyechart so he could stay in the navy even though his eyesight was terrible. little things you know?she's such a classy, strong, intelligent woman, and i love her very much. my grandfather passed away when i was 6 years old, he suffered badly from alzheimer's and dementia, i was too young to really be aware. i just remember he loved chocolate doughnuts, so one day i was probably 5/6, my aunt brought me and my cousin daria (6), and a dozen doughnuts, my grandfather, had already eaten one chocolate doughnut and there was one chocolate left, that my cousin daria had left out for herself, he saw it picked it up, and it was gone before i could blink. he looked at me, chocolate on the corners of his mouth, crooked smile, and winked.if you read this far, i really can't believe you did, i wrote this between midterms. feels therapeutic not going to lie. i'm visiting my grandmother on saturday, so i'm happy about that :)"," wonderful she can still understand telephone conversation.  you must be clearly enunciating your words, putting gaps between words and sentences.  there are a few folks i understand on the phone, but not many.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kvtu10/lockdown_sped_up_my_grandmothers_decline/,Lockdown sped up my grandmothers decline

"howdy, this is a master post of what i've learned about caring for a relative with dementia.  i'm not a health care professional, i've just been through this four times and want a post to give to those who are new. this post combines six other posts.  constructive criticism is welcome.  it's written without covid in mind; it changes things, of course, but most of this is still applicable now and the rest will be again.  there's not a lot of sugar-coating here so if you're in a bad headspace, read this later.  dementia is a progressive, incurable disease that results in death.  half of everyone who lives long enough will develop dementia.  there are multiple types of dementia, but absolute diagnosis of the specific type usually cannot be made until after death.  specific things will make dementia worse: infections, dehydration, surgery, radiation/chemo, hospital stays, changes in routine, traveling, broken bones, alcoholism, etc.  most sufferer's progressions follow a similar pattern, but everyone's specific journey will be different.  note that this progression can take months or decades.  there are things that can be done, we think, to prolong or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms.  a diet low in sugar and alcohol but high on plants and fiber like the mediterranean diet can help.  exercise is essential.  those who speak two languages are half as likely to develop dementia, and people with higher educational attainment develop debilitating symptoms much later than those with less educational attainment. &amp;#x200b;# begin the journeyonce you suspect dementia, get your elder the best long term care insurance you can find.  use their most recent physical you can get; if it's too old, get a new one asap.  do not mention to the doc your suspicions about memory issues; family seems to pick up on these 1-5 years before they show up on the actual diagnostics, and it'd stop you from getting good ltc insurance.  read the contract and see how long you have to wait to get a dementia diagnosis after the policy goes into effect, so to not invalidate the insurance. this is the time to get your legal paperwork in order.  get your power of attorney or equivalent, and get the different forms the different institutions require.  your bank will usually have a notary on hand who can notarize things for you.  speaking of banks, consider moving finances to a credit union.  cus are non-profit: they don't make money off you by charging fees.  this small difference every month can save a lot of money for later, when you really might need it.  care homes are expensive.  also, get your long term directives in order.  what does your elder consider important to her quality of life?  what daily activities does she consider necessary: if she can't do that, it's not worth it?  does she want cpr?  life support?  for how long?  how does she want her body handled?  where to be buried/ashes to be scattered?  your doctor may have a booklet that will help you go through all of this, which can be filled out, notarized, and filed with your doctor/hospital so they have to honor her wishes. then get a dementia diagnosis.  many times a simple problem like a uti or other infection can appear as dementia-like symptoms, so rule out other (solvable) problems first.  if your relative is resistant to going to the doctor, offer to take them out to lunch, or ask them to keep you company while you get a prescription from the hospital's pharmacy, and then take them to their appointment.  yes, it's devious, but nothing happens without a diagnosis.  once you're sure of dementia talk with your resources both professional and family.  your healthcare may have a memory care or elder care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.  bring your relatives, or bring them back the brochures.  there will be a lot of very difficult questions from relatives/friends who are not in the loop, such as ""what can we do"" and  ""what's the cure"".  the answers are ""take care of her until she dies"" and ""there isn't a cure"", which they won't like to hear, but will have to accept from the professionals.  so having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.  if they know generally what the progression is you're less likely to come up against issues with them later.  so many relatives think ""oh, they're just hanging with grandma, how nice!"", when the truth is so much darker.  half of all caregivers will develop diseases or die while caregiving; it's often one of the worst, most stressful things we will do in our lives.  get a support group going for yourself, early, while you're still able to find time.  get a therapist if you can.  look around for what help is available where you are.  you go to [alz.org]( and use their resources.  out where i am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, i hope you have the same or better.  you can find this by searching for ""elder care"" and your city, county, country, province, etc.  day care, respite care, and other programs are, frankly, essential. this part is important and ongoing.  start looking at where she is in the progression of the disease and make plans for the next step.  not planning for the future is the biggest mistake most families make.  they're so incredibly busy just barely taking care of today's needs that they're not ready for the next step.  my aunt was  literally hoisting my grandmother onto her back to get her from her bedroom to her chair in the front room, and then took care of her during  the day... and that was all she could do.  when grandma caught a cold, the coughing kept her from holding onto my aunt's shoulders so she couldn't get out of bed.  that led to the beginning of bedsores, so she had to go to the hospital.  instead of letting it get to that point aunt should have had in-home carers, lifts, equipment, supportive mattresses... so many things would have made life easier for both of them.  but aunt was too busy -- or overwhelmed -- with the massive job of caregiving.  prepare for the next step while you can. apply for government-paid in-home caring/recompense/assistance now, because by the time your requests are approved, she'll probably need them.  apply for a place at the best memory care facility you can find/afford now, because you can decline placement over and over and over, and just be put back at the head of the list for the next available spot.  during covid we found that the places with union workers had the lowest numbers for covid infections, controlling for many variables, due to the workers having access to ppe, so that's a consideration you might want to look for.  your country/states' department of social services will probably have a rating on all their care homes that might be helpful. many places are big enough that they provide multiple services, from respite to simple assisted living to locked wards, often via different wings.  respite is like checking your elder into a hotel for a weekend: the facility will take your elder for a bit to give you a break, and will help familiarize her with the facility.  these facilities will be able to transition your elder from one stage to the other via professionals.  this is very helpful because caregivers just compensate and compensate and compensate, burning themselves out far past the point where they should have transitioned.  keep in mind that these places run from 60k to 200k per year.  that insane price, along with the proof that elders are healthier longer at home, are why most people keep their elders at home with them for much longer than we used to.  but sometimes a care home is just necessary.  there are placement services which will take your elder's requirements (ostomy care, diabetes, hoyer lifts, meds, etc), distance from your home, and prices into consideration and get you a list of facilities.  they're very helpful and usually take recompense from the homes themselves so they don't cost you anything. save what you can.  talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.  get tapes of all the family histories and stories you'll ever want to hear.  get her involved in alz groups as an aid or an assistant  so when she's a participant she'll still want to be there.  find out what her favorite music is, download it onto an easy-to-play format for when/if she has bad days.  get out the old pictures and see if she can identify the mystery faces. if you have access to it, look into high-cbd products to see if your elder has a good reaction to them.  dementia progression typically includes depression and anger, and most patients also experience sundowning, sleeplessness, and/or agitation.  cbd can help with all of these if it's well tolerated.  please check with your doctor first, there are a few medications that interact very badly with cannabis.  i have personally had very good luck with mary's medicinals' ""the remedy"" and a high-cbd edible but had to try a few things to find what actually worked.  and boy howdy they really do help. these are things you can do instead of worrying.  i do these things because not doing them is a bad idea, and they help me work through the grief.  activity helps dispel fear and anxiety. &amp;#x200b;# the progressionthe sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  they know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  the ***best prepared*** progression is usually:1. ""impaired  cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my car, i don't remember where i parked it"" situations.  electronic gps like a tile can help here.2. poa/healthcare poa signed by sufferer3. all financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated4. dnr, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time5. long-term care health insurance attained (asap, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be)6. shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, ada furniture, doorways, hallways etc)7. patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage8. this is usually when their driving starts to suffer.  taking away their keys usually provokes horrible rages, there is another option.  go to your country/state's department of motor vehicles site to submit their form for retesting an elder's capability to drive.9. medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.10. medications to help with actual alzheimer's prescribed.  they are usually not very effective, but are expensive and have serious side effects.  some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from hmos for 7-10 years  from now.11. driver's license revoked, usually automatically after diagnosis &amp; medication12. apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  this may take many tries and many years.  talk to your hospitals' elder care representative.13. if sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local authorities so they can be prepared.  this may not be appropriate in certain jurisdictions or for certain families. 14. get an electronic tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.15. around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  this is not common with boomers and silent generations as they generally believe suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in patients who are younger.16. this is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders. it was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in care homes.  now we know that they decline much faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better  care.17. in-home care becomes necessary during the day.18. 24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be admitted to a memory care facility.  this is a locked ward where trained professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  this step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver, patient injuring self, etc.  memory care facilities are not cheap, they can run between $4,000 - $14,000+ a month.  &lt;&lt; this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare access burn out... badly.19. patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity20. patient loses ability to feed self21. patient loses ability to swallow&amp;#x200b;this will be posted to both r/alzheimers and r/dementia.   i hope that anyone else can chime in if i've missed anything."," this is a great post. may i add a couple of things?  in mid-to moderate dementia, financial issues become common. our elders forget they didn't pay a bill, and think they are being stolen from when the company asks again to be paid. they forget how much money they took out from the bank, and think the teller stole it from them. they become much more susceptible to scammers and fraud.   unfortunately your bank cannot share details of their financial accounts with you unless you are a signatory on their account. before the dementia is too far along, try to persuade them to make someone else a signatory on their account - basically, you just go to the bank and they sign paperwork to allow you to access the accounts. this will allow you to monitor what is happening, pay their bills, and take care of them. if you are part of a family with issues, it can be wise to have 2 different people sign on to the account so you can watch each other and prove you aren't stealing from mom yourself.   in addition, call the 3 credit monitoring agencies and have their accounts locked. this will prevent someone taking out a new loan in your elder's name without additional verification. it can still be done, if the scammer gets the elder to approve it over the phone or in writing, but will help prevent casual loans from scammers.  lastly, make sure your elder has an account created for them on the social security website. not having an account has become a common way to steal tax refunds and identities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kv7w3n/dementiaalzheimers_disease_progression_for_family/,Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers

"hello everyone, i’ve had a terrible couple of days so i need to vent. my father has been suffering with dementia for the last 6 years. a few months ago he became bed bound, incontinent, delusional and refused food for 21 days. i was sure that was the end. (he had all the symptoms of active dying) we had doctors come in and all they said was that this was the inevitable end of dementia. prescribed some sleeping and anxiety pills. no need to say it was the worst 2 months of my life.then all the sudden he got better. started eating, walking and going to the bathroom by himself.  the problem is his dementia and delusions became much worse. doesn’t recognise the house he’s been living in for the last 20 years. doesn’t remember his brothers are dead. doesn’t know the day, date, time, year etc. the worse part is i had to take away his car keys since it was no longer safe for him to drive. we go on walks every day, i try to keep him occupied and i’ve hired help to keep him company while i work. for the last few days he’s been crying saying he can’t live like this and wants to die ( kill himself) he says it constantly and it’s causing me so much trauma that my body is in panic mode 24/7.  i am dreading every conversation just because i don’t know how to respond anymore and it causes me a ton of anxiety and resentment, because i’m giving up everything for him and he constantly complains about his life and how he wants to die. i know he’s confused and i feel so sorry for him, but i also feel sorry for myself. i’m 24 and i feel so old. i feel no joy. i feel like this will never end or it will when i’m too old to enjoy life. i’m resentful because he is 86 and never made plans for his future. all the responsibilities fall on me and i know for sure that if it wasn’t for me he’d be dead a long time ago. i have lost all hope this situation will end soon since he seems visibly healthy.thanks for reading"," there are states in the us.  more to the point, can you place him in a care facility to alleviate the pressure on yourself?  caregiving takes an enormous toll and your mental health matters too.  his primary care doctor can help, talk with her/him (meds also likely need to be adjusted based on his behavior).  i am so sorry, i remember this pain and experience vividly!  my mother is doing much better health-wise in a facility now than in the past 10 years of caregiving, and we did all we could to keep her in her home (and more than we should have) based on her wishes.  she had also never planned.  she declined fairly quickly - up and done for those with alzheimer’s and less so with other forms of dementia.  however we no longer had a choice.  you are in my thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kv3gq1/depressed_and_suicidal_father_with_dementia/,Depressed and suicidal father with dementia

help/advice would be appreciated. i recently was asked to help with a family friend that lives in the same apartment complex.   i've know her for over a year and she really likes my company.my question is about her ptsd. her neighbors occasionally argue loud enough she can hear it. the neighbors aren't violent or anything like that the walls here are just really thin. when she hears this she instantly gets cought in a loop where she tells me over and over how her  dad was very violent towards her mom and she won't put up with that b.s. in her house. there's usually about 3 or 4 questions she can't seem to get past. i try to tell her she's safe here with me and no one is angry or upset with her. it can take hours to get her calmed down a little. this is heartbreaking and any advice is appreciated.," if you’re the primary caregiver for someone with alzheimer’s or dementia, you might feel like you need a support system. the first thing to do is reach out to friends and family. they can be your biggest allies, but if they can’t help, there are other caregivers who will understand exactly what you’re going through. understand your feelings and those of the person you care for. know when to seek help, take steps to maintain and strengthen your own physical and mental health, learn ways to cope with caregiving stress, and find support from others who understand what you’re going through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kus1iz/first_time_caregivering_for_someone_suffering/,First time caregivering for someone suffering from dementia.

"we knew it was coming. her vitals were all wrong. i called my siblings two days in a row, warning them so that they could come over and say their goodbyes. nobody came. my children and i stayed up late with her, taking turns holding her hand. we put my toddler in the bed with her and granny stroked her hair and held her close.my oldest child warmed up a soft, lavender scented teddy bear in the microwave and tucked it into granny’s arms. granny was still clutching it this morning when the nurse came to pronounce her dead. she was also still wearing the little rubber band bracelets my kids had made her, for her birthday back in october. when i found her this morning, my sons were asleep in the floor beside her bed. the tv screen was blue from where it had eventually turned itself off after they’d fallen asleep watching pinocchio. i called the hospice line crying but cut the call short so i could relocate them before they awakened to find her dead. i berated myself for whatever potential psychological trauma could result from all that. the nurse came and wasted the meds, had me sign as witness, tossed the bear to me, and people took granny to the funeral parlor - all before my sons woke up. they had stayed up with granny until two a.m. and ended up sleeping in. mom showed up shortly afterward, and helped look through stuff. asked about the drugs and seemed annoyed about the nurse disposing of them. later on my daughter and i went to granny’s old house to get some books and pictures. one sibling was already there creating a take-away pile and acting hysterical about some perceived slight by my mom, while my other sister was also apparently stirring up drama from her house, screaming at people and carrying on about this and that. it’s amazing how they both managed to make today about themselves. i’m embarrassed my daughter witnessed all that. i still haven’t heard from my brother, who is the attorney in fact. that’s fine, granny was the last emotional tie connecting me to those people anyway. i don’t mind writing them all off at this point. i held it together for a long while as my daughter and i gathered books. what an impressive collection she had. damn she was cool. of everything i saw and have been through today, it was a coloring book that did me in. one of those cheap coloring books from the nineties.it reminded me of the ones she always used to bring over for me. then i remembered how she’d call me every birthday and start singing “happy birthday to you!” right after i answered “hello?”she would also call every year right before halloween to let me know “it’s the great pumpkin charlie brown!” was playing on tv and on what channel. she was at every track meet, pageant, basketball game, birthday, pta performance, you name it. she’s been a fixture in my life ever since her son married my mom when i was three, and long after they divorced. she has been more of a “family” to me than any of my biological family, and the most dutiful and admirable person i’ve ever known.anyway yeah, the coloring book sent me over the edge and i cried all the way home, probably making my daughter as uncomfortable as my sister had made me.i love you, granny. i wish your life had not been so hard. you deserved so much more than the hand you were dealt. 💕"," i'm sorry for your loss. my wife and i take care of my elderly father with dementia. it is tough and non of my other siblings stepped up for the task. we feel alone and you've reminded us of what god has entrusted us with, caring for my dad. it's a privilege i will be more grateful for and cherish. thank you for sharing your story and god bless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kur71y/she_died_last_night/,She died last night.

"please help, i don't know what to do.for as long as i can remember, my mother has been verbally abusive and she is a big time narcissist. my father was never the one to stand up to her, and despite the abuse, he never left her. they are quite codependent, and do not have any friends. since my father stopped working two years ago his mental health and cognition has declined exponentially, and he is now unable to take care of himself.my mother is immensely stubborn and uncaring and that has really become a problem for my dad. she is his primary caregiver and has power of attorney. my mother still tries to run her small business as well as maintain two houses (residence in the city and cottage in the country) and consequently my dad's care often gets pushed to the backburner. she has bad knees and hips and can barely walk and so she often has my dad run around for her. she definitely needs help but she refuses any suggestion of help, whether it be a cleaning lady or even a local kid to mow the grass. and now, with the pandemic, she has found the perfect excuse to not have any outside help or to take my father to the doctor. she will get him dressed in the morning and will clean his sheets if he wet the bed, but not without screaming at him and berating him for something out of his control. she will make him food, but only when she's hungry. she won't let him take a nap because she says he will be up all night. he often goes for little walks and has gotten lost a few times. i thought after the first few times he was brought back by the police, my mom would have invested in some kind of tracker or something. but any suggestion i've made to help with this problem has been met with no, there's no point or it's too expensive.i live pretty close by and i visit when i can, but every time i go i see another way in which my father is neglected and it hurts! he has been wearing the same two pairs of pants and they are too large for his frail frame and worn at the heels. when i ask why she won't get him some new pants she says he has enough clothes. my dad used to wear a big bulky pair of boots that kept his feet warm, but my mom now has him wearing a worn out pair of boots that aren't warm enough just because the other ones ""take up too much room"" her front hall. i tried replacing his cotton socks with warmer wool ones and she took them away. she hasn't got him to clean his dentures in months. he hasn't had a haircut in a while and he looks in terrible shape. my mother is sick and abusive and she should not be in charge of my father's care, especially since she priorizes everything else in her life above his needs. maybe i'm just too much of an empathetic person, someone who is able to see all these things that no one else does. but i am incredibly angry and disgusted with her. not only is she not taking proper care of him but she refuses to even consider any of my suggestions and has actually actively undone the things that i do for his benefit.i tried to help at first but it's exhausting fighting her so i gave up, hoping for a better outcome with time. but i can't take it anymore. i want to involve somebody, the authorities, a lawyer but i don't know what i have the right to do. i have no backup on this from my brothers as they would rather turn a blind eye. he's getting old, there's nothing to be done, is probably what they're thinking. but i want my father to stop being punished for things that he can't control. to stop being berated and belittled. i want my father to live out whatever time he has left with some dignity.any advice would help me. i feel so alone in this. if anyone has dealt with similar issues i'd love to hear how you coped.thanks", absolutely report her. my mother is also a narcissist and they are relentless nothing stops them from getting everything their way. i just want to wrap your dad up in a big woollen coat and get him a bowl of chicken soup that poor man. her petty actions need to be reported. the things you’ve written can definitely be conveyed to a person at the protection agency. call your country’s dementia advisory service and see what they suggest too. just hit them all up on reporting your mother to anyone and everyone that will listeni hope you get somewhere soon,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kuq82w/father_has_dementia_mother_is_an_abusive/,"Father has dementia, Mother is an abusive narcissist with power of attorney!"

"my grandmother lives alone in a different country and we therefore keep in contact through weekly telephone calls. last week we had a normal conversation, however today something extremely alarming occurred. my mother rang my grandmother this morning and all was normal until around 2 minutes into the conversation my mother suddenly starts shouting “what’s wrong with you? are you okay?” continuously. after a minute of this she hangs up the phone and is in tears. i comfort her and ask her what happened. she said my grandmother and her had a normal conversation until my grandmother said the phrase “so i went to the doctors last week for a scan and the results came back normal” (this scan was just a general check up on her health). my grandmother apparently would not stop saying this phrase over and over again no matter what my mother said to her. i told my mum it was probably not the best idea to shout at her but that i would give a go talking to her instead. my phone call with went something along these lines: me: hello! how are you?grandmother (g): i’m doing well thank you how are you?[1 minute of normal conversation] me: so mum is a little upset right now, shes worried about you. can you tell me about the phone conversation you just had with her? g: yes, i told her that i went to the doctors and my scans came out normal. i don’t understand why she’s upset. you would think i said something really strange if she’s worried about meme: oh okay, must have been a miscommunication. by the way how are you liking the new shampoo we sent to your house? g: you would think i said something really strange if she’s worried about meme: yes i know, but how’s the new shampoo? g: you would think i said something really strange if she’s worried about me (this is when i realise she is doing the same thing to me) i tried to change the topic of conversation 5 different times but had no luck. she just continued with that phrase over and over. even when i attempted to say goodbye she was still saying the same thing, i unfortunately ended up having to hang up on her. we have no idea what could have caused this and no family members can check up on her until the morning (it is the middle of the night for them). the instant onset of this is what is concerning us, she was fine up until last week. we briefly managed to speak to someone who is in frequent face to face contact with her and they said she has been fine, except perhaps a little forgetful (although she has always been a bit of a forgetful person) but nothing of concern. i’m more concerned that my grandmother has had a traumatic head injury of sort but unfortunately she is the type to never let us know if something is wrong as she tells us she does not want us to worry. we are planning to call her again when it is morning for her. anyone had any experience with elders suddenly repeating the same phrase over and over again? and was this onset as immediate as the one my grandmother is experiencing?"," someone has to check on her personally. they need to do a visual check and have face to face conversation with her. this could be a family member, a friend, neighbor, or some type of first responder. if they see any cause for concern, they need to take her for a medical exam. who can you contact to check on her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kuhvfb/does_this_sound_like_dementia_repeating_the_same/,Does this sound like dementia?

"my questions are:      **1 - does this sound like it could be beginning dementia or something else?**   **2 - do you have any advice about or experience with long-term care insurance?**   **3 - do you have any good resources or book recommendations for people suffering from cognitive difficulty, or for their families/caregivers?**any input or links/resources will be appreciated!  my mom has been having some cognitive issues for several years. she is 56 and retired at 54 because she was not really able to keep up with her job and it became too overwhelming (she worked in it, same job her whole career). i feel like her personality has changed somewhat also and i feel bad about this, but for the past few years i've been feeling like it's not worth talking to her about anything because she won't remember anyway.   my (f, 31) brother (24) and dad (57) live with her. they are in denial and try to claim it's just **add/adhd** and that her brain doesn't pay attention even when it seems like she is, so i went to the doctor with my mom in october and she tried an add drug that did not help her at all. she is an intelligent person but she was **diagnosed with adhd when she was kid** (at that time it was referred to as minimal brain dysfunction) although she never got any help or treatment for it and it didn't seem to have any real barriers to her schooling or it career until later in life (late forties/early fifites).  when we went to the doctor for add/adhd in october, the doctor didn't seem to think advised her to get a **neuro-psychiatric evaluation** but i told him not to order it yet and not put it in the notes because she might want to get some type of **long-term care insurance** and doesn't want to **disqualify** herself from that. it's expensive though, so it's a major decision, and i know my dad is doing research and trying to make the best choice.  she also has developed a **hand tremor** in one hand only, in the last 6 months (her estimation). my dad swears she always had this, but she definitely didn't. i only noticed it when she was swiping her credit card at the doctor's office, and the doctor noticed it as well.   overall i feel like my mom lives a normal life and she **does remember some things**. she is also able to keep up with the family laundry and still knows tricks to get out different types of stains, etc. she can do grocery shopping if she has a list, but she might miss a couple things (which happens to everyone sometimes). she can cook simple/standard things like tuna helper, grilled cheese, spaghetti, etc. but gets overwhelmed by cooking more than one thing at a time.   she is generally able to set appointments and keep them as long as she writes them on her wall calendar correctly, and i think she checks her calendar every day (then makes notes to herself). however, an example of some cognitive trouble is -- when we went to her doctor in october, she went to their old office location that had been closed for over a year and was really confused when she couldn't find the building (it's now a different business). then she thought they moved across the street so we went there, no luck. i googled where the doctor practiced and the first address given was a hospital that is familiar to us, so my mom said ""oh yeah, i remember going there - you just park in front and check in"". so we drove to that hospital but my mom couldn't figure out how to get to the front parking lot. when we went to check in and gave the doctor's name, they said he didn't have an office there. eventually we got the office address and went there, and my mom confirmed she has been there before but just couldn't remember where it was. i later realized the reason why the hospital rang a bell for her was that she had been there a few weeks earlier to accompany my dad to a colonoscopy appointment.   she also hit a couple curbs while driving that day (i drove after that). it was like she **knew her brain was failing her and she was scattered and uneasy** about it. when we got home after the whole ordeal i told her i wasn't mad and it wasn't a big deal to reschedule, etc. but she couldn't relax and she thought she was having a heart attack. i think she was having a **panic attack**. i do think she is definitely having issues with anxiety, and probably depression too. i think she has tried some **anxiety and depression** medications but says they don't help.  here are some examples of the cognitive issues i've noticed:* **has to take notes** **when she talks to anyone (in person or on the phone)**. if you ask her a question about a phone call she just had (like with grandparents), she has to refer to the notes and she can only tell you the answer if she can find it in her notes. also, if she has to relay information into a short text message to notify other family members, it takes her several hours to do so when it should only take a couple minutes.* **asks the same questions within minutes**. then asks the same questions throughout the day, again the next day, on and on forever. she pretty much **doesn't remember any conversations**. it puts a strain on everyone. it's hard to maintain a patient and pleasant attitude when you've answered the same question 3 times already in the past 20 minutes all day long. i feel like we are good at answering repeated questions until about the 4th or 5th time and we all start to lose our cool.  my mom doesn't know it's the fifth+ time she's asked so if she gets a sense of our annoyance, she'll say ""well you know i don't remember things, be nice to me"". and we're annoyed and thinking, well if you know you don't remember anything, why do you even ask questions at all? what is the point, really?* **not able to plan anything or solve basic problems**  she can't plan out christmas gifts or do christmas shopping anymore, unless she is just assigned a couple of specific things. she used to plan family vacations and get togethers, but now planning anything involves too many details for her to keep track of. she cannot be in charge of anything.  even simple things like two people carpooling to one place, then driving separate cars, etc. would be an example of a detail that she can't keep straight in her mind. so even minor things like camping nearby or going biking then to a restaurant is something my dad would have to plan the details for. and someone would need to keep her on track like remind her which car she should be in, which car she came in, etc.* **not able to learn how to play new games, even ones for young children** (5-6 year olds) that only have a couple of rules.  example: i bought ""taco, cat, goat, cheese, pizza"" which is a children's card game. even after playing several rounds she was unable to remember how to play or what the objective was, yet the kids picked it up quickly. she then opted to sit out from playing because she recognized she wasn't catching on (this is what always happens, but at least she tries). she also used to like puzzles but when i brought one for us all to do as a family she gave up pretty quickly and just started holding up single pieces and asking people if they know where it goes, which was very unproductive and not a normal thing when people are doing a puzzle as a group.* **everything is overwhelming to her**. she cannot find the time or willpower to sort through a pile of mail, make a christmas card even though she wants to send one out, etc. even though she is retired and doesn't do anything all day. she retired two years ago and literally has not accomplished anything or taken up any hobbies or anything. (and their house has a lot of clutter corners/piles and unfinished projects)* causes fights and confusion among family members because she will **offer to do something, then act like she didn't** (or vice versa - decline/refuse to do something then act like she never declined).   small personality changes  1. **strangely attached to things** and she never used to be that way. when i tried to throw out some of my old stuff i found, i later found that she had gone through the papers i had recycled and items i planned to donate and kept them. there was a bugs bunny stuffed animal that she put at the foot of her bed because it ""makes her happy when she sees it"", which is a pretty bizarre thing coming from her. she puts random cute stuffed animals around the house as decorations and she never would have done that before unless they had some kind of special significance.  2. i also think she has a **more ""jokey"" personality** than i ever remember. she seems to make jokes about everything, or interject brief funny commentary about things on tv, but they're never very funny, it's usually stuff she has said before, and sometimes it doesn't even make sense. maybe this is to compensate for not really being able to converse in other ways.3. **occasional strange fixations.** example -she wanted to buy venus brand razors but they had to be a certain kind, and she didn't know exactly how many she wanted, but it couldn't be too few or too many. we had to drive to 4 stores so she could settle on 5-pack of venus razors (3-pack was too few, 8-pack was too many -- even though she'd use them eventually and buying in bulk is a better value). in the past she would never do something like this, she'd likely just buy what was on sale and call it good. it was just weird.  i have a lot of examples and i've started keeping a list, but this is the main gist with a few examples. thanks in advance for any thoughts or suggestions you want to offer."," that doesn't sound like dementia or adhd. it sounds like some other kind of neurological disorder. is she seeing a neurologist or psychiatrist? if not, you need to request a referral asap and they need to do a full neuropsychological evaluation, including imaging. that said, definitely get the long term care insurance as soon as possible, as it is likely that whatever she does have is degenerative in nature and that she will need long term care at some point. it may be expensive, but it will be less expensive than paying out of pocket. also, the humor thing is likely a coping mechanism.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ku9a4e/my_mom_has_cognitive_problems_is_it_dementia_or/,My mom has cognitive problems.

"my dad is in a home. a great one. but as far as i can tell, they all eat the same meal. my dad loves the food and eats it all. but it got me wondering. if you were a vegan or vegetarian your entire life, or most of it, and you now had dementia. it seems like someone should ensure that your pre-dementia eating beliefs are maintained. or is that a silly expectation. especially if the dementia patient doesn’t seem to remember it or bring it up. i guess my concern, if i had dementia, is that my life long beliefs would be respected.  then i also think, in a small home like his, that could be a lot of extra work for the people who already work so hard. thoughts?", that’s silly. he has dementia. imagine if he refused to eat everything except meat because of his dementia.  are you going to let him starve because he should still be a vegan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ku1l0l/thoughts_on_eating_and_ethics_when_in_a_home/,Thoughts on eating and ethics when in a home
"i (26f) am in the middle of moving my father (66m), fiancé, and i to our new house 3 hours away. using poa i sold our existing house. the past 1-2 weeks has been the absolute busiest ever; finishing up all the documents to close on the new house, setting up/shutting off utilities, running errands galore... and all that work has gone completely unappreciated by my father. i get that he has to move out of a home that’s been in the family since the ‘60s and how he could be attached to it in ways i don’t understand. that’s to be expected.what wasn’t expected was him screaming at me that he hates all the frozen food i make him and doesn’t want me to make it for him anymore. the thing is, he’s been eating it for months and liked it until now, usually he wouldn’t even know a meal was frozen unless i told him. i barely know how to cook; he’d be eating eggs and tofu stir fry over and over again if he had to rely on me making home cooked meals. he can cook, i’m ok with him cooking, it helps him maintain his independence and feel like himself, but he never makes/eats enough food and doesn’t seem to understand anymore when things go bad. i know a main reason why he’s acting like this is from not eating enough food/drinking enough water, i ask him multiple times a day “did you eat anything? are you drinking water?” - prior to the past week or two this worked well, but not so much now. thankfully starting next week i have in home help that will start coming to help with meal prep and keeping him engaged in appropriate activities. it can’t happen any sooner. i get that he (in theory) isn’t aware of what he’s doing. it’s really hard to believe that he’s not aware that saying things like “you don’t love me” several days in a row is hurtful. that and there’s been two times recently i had to leave him alone overnight, for essential trips up to the new house, and both times he went into our living area and moved things around. it has been very clearly communicated for almost, if not over a year that our living space is off-limits and he has no reason to need to be there. the first time he said he had to “feed our cat” - i left a note explaining i had friends already feeding her and he didn’t need to. that time he also helped himself to some of my rum. the second time our cat wasn’t even there so he had no excuse. he didn’t even take anything from what i can tell, but did throw two very nice sweaters and large print crosswords i got him in a pile in the middle of the floor. he obviously did that to try to make a point and get a rise out of me. through all of this, i’ve learned so much about staying calm and not indulging his anger or attempts to argue with me. if he tries to escalate, if possible, i’ll say something like “i don’t want to talk about that, is anything else on your mind?” - to which lately he says no or continues yelling at me. most recent days i’ve managed to not raise my voice at all. i’m really sick of every conversation lately ending with him saying “i’m going to talk to my lawyer” - for one, we are moving out on monday, there literally won’t be business hours before then, for two, he claims his lawyer is helping him for “free”... that’s not how ethical lawyers work. for three, without an id or access to his money (both of which i have) he isn’t going to get very far with any sort of legal proceeding. fourthly, even if he did miraculously talk to a lawyer and try to take me to court 1) wouldn’t they have to tell me? and 2) he can’t ever remember what day it is so it’s not like he’d show up to the right court date. this ended up being really long.. thank you to anyone still reading this. if anyone has also dealt with moving someone with dementia who’s easily agitated, it’d be helpful to hear your experience.", bredesen protocol,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ku0kjw/ah_the_joys_of_moving_someone_with_dementia/,Ah the joys of moving someone with dementia...

"he is 81 years old. he has not been diagnosed with dementia. cognitively he has gone downhill over the last few years, particularly in the last 2 years since he was barely able to sleep for months due to an ear tumor which he needed a few operations for. it all took a lot out of him physically, which accelerated whatever cognitive decline he was already having before this. over the last year or so he has had probably about 20 instances of waking up in his own living room (he’s lived in the house for 35 years) and it taking him a couple of minutes to realize where he is. in the last year he has also seemed to get some mild auditory hallucinations (only a few times) and visual ones (stuff out of the corner of his eye, happens more often than the auditory ones but still not very often). he is on a lot of medications which could be causing that though. i know i ideally need a doctor’s opinion (i’ve asked him to ask his doctors plenty of times and he always forgets as he usually already has a few other things to ask him about). but in people’s general opinions, are these signs of usual aging or signs of dementia/alzheimer’s?"," it sounds typical for dementia. however, you should take him to a doctor and also consider the medications he's on. you say he is on ""a lot"" of meds, and these could have side effects or not work well together. he could also get detrimental effects if he is also forgetting to take his  meds or taking too much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ktu8ym/my_dad_keeps_forgetting_where_he_is_when_he_wakes/,My dad keeps forgetting where he is when he wakes up

(her sister has it, to the point of needing medication and disability. her doctors used to say it was one of the worst cases they've ever seen.) my mom has also been diagnosed with mild ocd and ptsd years ago, but has always been fully functioning and never ""needed"" meds . anyway, two summers ago, she became obsessed with her memory. upset when she forgot little things, mispronounced a word, etc., she became intensely hard on herself. she started eating only ""brain healthy"" foods and lost about 20 lbs. this eventually led to days on end of research on dementia and alzheimer's. she spends hours a day, entire days, taking brain tests online and playing memory/concentration games. as time went on, it has worsened. she now claims she is ""sun-downing"" whenever her moods become out of control. she spends hours crying, praying, telling me to prepare for the diagnosis. she tells me it's okay if i put her in a home because she doesn't want me to see her unable to remember me. she won't talk to people, including my boyfriend's family, neighbors, etc. because she fears she'll repeat herself or say something ""stupid"".she has had mris. they showed some blood vessel issues, but her neurologist said they're totally normal for her age. but, my mom, being dr. google, has now confirmed (in her mind) that she has vascular dementia. she has also spoken to several other docs about her symptoms. she did well on a cognitive test. she told the doctor ""that's just because i practice this one every day at home on the internet"". finally, the latest doc (i'm not sure of his title), brought up the subject of ocd and stressed to her that she has ocd, which she's always had, only for whatever reason it's now taken the shape of pseudodementia. i feel incredibly sad and confused over this situation. covid-19 and the fact that i moved out (in 2018) have seemed to make it worse. i am wracked with guilt. i have no one to turn to. i cannot seem to be able to help her, convince her that she is fine, or more importantly convince her to seek help in the form of therapy or meds. i truly do not see any signs of true memory loss, just obsession over it. she keeps saying, ""by next year, i will decline...by next year, i won't know who you are"", etc. it feels like she wants this. it feels like she's wasting precious years, where she's in the best shape health wise that she's been in a while, on a figment of her imagination, and so some times i am incredibly angry at her and frustrated.  if you're still here, thank you for taking the time to read. has anyone been through something similar themselves or with a loved one? i really appreciate any and all feedback."," i am so sorry that you are going through this with your mom!  my mom did obsess and have delusions, refusing to go to the doctor or listen then we were finally about to get her there.  not to the extremes you describe.  we had many calls with her primary doc to talk through options.  when she was delusional about people out to get her, the tv taking to her, etc. we were able to finally have her admitted to the hospital and psych ward.  they diagnosed her with alzheimer’s at that time.  maybe her doc can help you with this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ktffo1/advice_on_my_momocd_role_in_pseudo_dementia/,"Advice on My Mom--OCD Role in ""Pseudo Dementia"""

when she'd talk to me she'd talk low as she stated that the lady in charge said we all need to talk low to not disturb them.  and she was sleeping 14 hours a day or more, not wanting to get out of bed.upon my wife's return weeks ago, i wanted to take her to have lunch and decided we would leave my mom home alone and keep watch on her via the camera's i've installed in the home.  we went to the garage and i had to return to get something from my desk and found my mom on the floor (mind you, my mom has had several instances where she would ""act out"" if she did not feel she was getting the attention she needed and fake an illness, literally.   we have visited the emergency room a few times due to this) and i called the ambulance (not knowing if it were fake or real).  they took her to the hospital and after a few hours indicated that she could be released.  this is where it gets right!!!i told them i would not take her home as she is a danger to herself, my wife and i and due to her hallucinations and dementia we are not equipped to manage her life.  the hospital leaped into action, got a case management nurse to work with us and a social worker.  within a week my mom was moved to a care facility (memorycare) to begin the process for medicaid support for her illness and long term care.  we still have to work with the government agencies for long term care, and i've made some great contacts with folk at the agency to help move this forward.you should take this approach and get your loved one the help they need.  no one in the medical world is going to help you unless you force them too.  worse part of this story is, that, i should have done this long ago and not let this get to this point where it is now at a place where she's helpless.  no matter what you do, i pray for you and your family and hope for the best.  you should join [alzheimers.org]( and start attending their meetings and get yourself some support.  dm me if you have questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/krg3ed/mother_has_stopped_eating_or_drinking/,Mother has stopped eating or drinking

"my mother has vascular dementia . they say mild but her behaviour in the last year has been extreme. so we’re looking at psychological evaluation too.police called by neighbours as she dumped garbage on their drive and threatens them . crashed her car and totalled it . hit two other cars . called the police over nothing until she got a caution. throws out house keys . called emergency plumbers and locksmiths costing hundreds and hundreds and had locks changed for no reason saying they were broke. accuses her tv and  phone of being broke and buys new ones when they are fine . i’ve had numerous calls with confused and irritated tradesmen over bills she can’t pay for ridiculous work she asked for . the kicker here is she lies so much. before i knew better i went and warned the neighbours the other side to stop asking her for money.... which i later find out was bullshit and i had to go apologise. lies about a plumber burning the cat with left out chemicals , about being spied on etc etc .the thing is we aren’t close . at all. i left home at 18 then at 25 moved to america . i’m 40 now and just back around as she had cancer two years ago . but mine and my families life is not in the uk. she was always a narcissist and a liar  and we have little in common. now i feel like i’m expected to deal with all this with someone i don’t feel any closeness with . ok vent over . thank you. good luck to everyone here"," god, i feel you.  i'm sorry you are going through this.   it's like we have the same mom in a way.  my mom was deep into religion after losing her job 25 years ago and some trauma in her second marriage.  she never really got along with her siblings 11 of them as i've discovered over the last few years of how mean she was as a child, a liar, did not want kids or know how to deal with us and just never able to settle down.  narc for sure, could not keep a husband or boy friend, once they found out who she really was, they ran.  and she was never stable, hopped from apartment to apartment, state to state whenever trouble or things go too complicated and close.  so over her religious years all of that was put in the back closet and now that dementia is front and center, its all coming out full force.  she curses, throws things, says cruel and mean hurtful things; intentionally starts arguments so that you know to leave her alone.  funny thing i've learned that is really strange, she gave up on maintaining her own life (she has you ladies and foster kids around her for 20 years doing everything for her) so she would never have to lift a finger.  well, they all ran like the men in her life and she was left to suffer until i got the call to come get her.  it's a sad state of condition; even before the dementia she had no clue as to how to cook, prepare food, or keep food.  her fridge was always full of rotten stuff from dollar general and if it was not fast food, she didn't eat it.  i feel bad for her; it makes me sad to see her as she is.  a shell of the woman i once knew, who looks at me as if i'm the devil himself and use's words to validate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kr5jqq/mothers_first_dementia_diagnosis/,[deleted by user]

"my mother (65) has always had some undiagnosed mental issues(depression,anxiety at the least). she was in a bad wreck around 10 years ago and suffered a concussion. at that time i discovered she was taking a lot of prescription pills that she had hid from us (pain pills, ativan, anti depressants). in my opinion she was over prescribed and addicted and possibly abusing the pills. the last 10 years have just been a train wreck. lots of ups and downs with her moods, health issues, sleeping all day, severe depression, confusion and disoriented. her pain pills were cut out about 3 years and we thought for sure she would be herself again. she was a little better but still out there. she suffered a bad fall last year and broke a lot of bones and was in the hospital a while for surgery and rehab. the dr did advise that ativan could be the culprit in her fall and confusion.  we finally got her healed and off the pain medicine again and then she had another issue that required pain medicine. it’s just constantly something.  anyway her primary dr is still prescribing her the ativan.  that’s all she’s on right now but she’s worse than she’s ever been. she is unbearable to be around. she’s not herself and constantly guilting you or being selfish. she’s hallucinating.  she says she sees girls. she will not sleep at night. she will be awake at 6 am but sleep all day. she has lost so much weight and looks terrible. she doesn’t even know what day it is most times. she’s can repeat a story from 30 years ago but can’t remember any medicine she takes and constantly searching for things she has misplaced. she has forgot to turn the oven off several times and is no longer allowed to cook by herself. i have begged her to get help and she refuses. when we went to the hospital a year ago for her fall i stayed with her every night and she was so mad at me and my dad for talking to the drs about her confusion or behavior.  she cried and guilted us for taking her to that specific hospital.  the doctors had a serious talk with her about the ativan and recommended her going to a treatment center. she did not go but i think that’s why she refuses to see a doctor about her issues now, fear of being locked up. i have no idea what to do anymore. i cry myself to sleep basically mourning my mother who is still alive. she is not herself. we have always been so close and i just don’t know how to help her. i am getting bitter with my dad for not forcing her to be truthful with a doctor or getting her proper care. i truly believe this is early signs of dementia however i am not getting much support as my family thinks it’s from prescribed medication she refuses to quit taking so they are angry with her.  i’ve pleaded with her to consult with a dr and she will not claim anything is wrong with her and makes excuses for her behavior, confusion and hallucinations. she’s so quick to go to the dr with anything else but not when it comes to her mental health or memory.  everything is always other people’s fault. she’s so child like. anyway i need help on how to get her to be honest about her symptoms and her current state with a dr. i cannot just sit and watch my mom decline like this"," one strategy i've heard of is phoning up the doctor ahead of time and explaining the situation, and then asking if you can make an appointment, but don't tell your mum the real reason for the appointment, say the doctor called to book her in for something else. when there, ask if the doctor can bring the subject up as though it were routine, like, 'now mrs \_\_\_, while i have you here i wonder if we could do a quick check up on your memory and cognition? i'm sure there is nothing to worry about, but it's just something we like to keep an eye on after a certain age' it is of course very dependant on the doctor being willing to play along, and whether or not your mother is able to mask her difficulties at the appointment. but it might be an option.also, try not to say too much about your mothers condition to the doctor in front of your mother. this could lead to her trusting you even less and allowing you even less control over health matters and such. hopefully the doctor will arrange to speak to you away from your mother. i hope you figure something out, this sounds very difficult and frustrating for you. all the best",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kq5eyz/how_to_make_your_parent_consult_with_a_dr/,How to make your parent consult with a Dr.

"hello.. this is my first time ever posting on reddit and it's from my mobile so please excuse me if this done wrong.&amp;#x200b;for the past few years my(25f) mom(59f) has had very specific paranoia regarding two facets in her life. the first is that our neighbor is doing all sorts of things to sabotage my mom's life/things. ranging anywhere from him poising the plants in her yard and leaving gas/oil in the garage in bottles (started this one four years ago) to breaking into our home and moving/leaving things, stealing items/cash, ect. (past year) and it's been slowly getting worse. second is that her co-workers are talking behind her back, excluding her, stealing her things, taking things from her lunch box or smashing food items and putting them back in.( i admittedly do think this may be happening but obviously not the stealing and food wrecking. as my mom is excluded from the room a lot/put with the harder work most of the time though she is the oldest by at least 10 years.)&amp;#x200b;i've done what i can to help her with these fears. i had my own mental health issues to work out and only started working two years ago. i still don't have my driver's license so i'm limited in what i can do distance wise.&amp;#x200b;in the past 6 weeks i have:\-changed the front door lock 3 times\-changed her bedroom lock twice\-she has gotten an adt alarm system and my brother and i have changed the code 4 times \-she thinks the house has a 'bug' in it and will whisper when she calls anyone, won't let me say codes aloud.l ect.\-she's gotten a system that didn't take pictures to one that does take pictures when you arm and dearm the system.\-i've put up a small secret can i have to charge and empty every night that points to the front door.\-i've put plastic on all windows big enough to fit a human( mostly to keep heat in but it proves noone is getting in through them)\-every morning she comes to me crying that the neighbor broke in while we were sleeping and stole x. i  spend anywhere from 10-60minutes to find x. she gives me 2-3 other items that are still missing claiming she's still right.&amp;#x200b;my brother who lives with us works two jobs and is gone during the nights, but is home in the day most often. and i'm gone from 7-5:00. my mom works in the same job industry as me and is gone 7-4. she'll pick me up at 5 but will usually stop home to pick up the dog and take her for a walk before that.&amp;#x200b;besides this insane fear of this specific neighbor doing things (there's so, so many examples i can give) she's.. relatively as normal as anyone else. but this is driving such a huge wedge between us and it's breaking me. i don't get a break anywhere, at home or work and i'm exhausted. all i wanted for the past few years was my mom to be happy, and whatever is going on is making her miserable. she's admittedly my best and only friend i have that isn't online so this whole thing is making it that much harder for me to think logically about.i've done a little research and i've talked with some co-workers who had family with similar paranoia and they say it \*could\* be early dementia.&amp;#x200b;my question is, where do i start to get this diagnosed? what is the first step? do i go to a regular doctor with her and talk about what's happening? she sees a psych for depression, do i talk to them?(she lies through her teeth to make the appointment short so she can just get her meds, her psych knows nothing of this paranoia) if she refuses to come with me do i make an appointment in my name and talk to a doctor/psych about my mom to get advice? &amp;#x200b;i feel so lost and admittedly i do not have any friends nor family who i can turn to for support. it's only me and my twin brother, who, working two jobs is already stressed enough and trying his best to save as much as possible in order to keep us afloat if my mom becomes unable to work due to this as the 3 of us together are barely scraping by paycheck to paycheck right now.&amp;#x200b;if it helps at all i live in the united states in the state of minnesota.&amp;#x200b;any help or pointing in the right direction would be much appreciated. thank you very much."," whoever she sees as a doctor make sure you call or email them with all your concerns. be very specific about things so the doctor may be able to spot trends, like if the paranoia is worse at night or in the morning, if there seems to be hallucinations that make the paranoia worse. without a hipaa disclosure signed by your mom that it is ok to share her medical info, the doctor won’t be able to discuss her medical history but it will least guide her medical team on what to be looking for. also, a poa may be difficult as she may need to sign those legal papers, but you may need to look into guardianship, also filed through the courts. with guardianship you then would be able to speak with the doctor about her health, watch over her finances, etc. mn board on aging may be able to get you to the services than can help you. and keep coming back to reddit. there is a lot of support in this group.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kpsgi7/unsure_what_to_do_or_where_to_start/,Unsure what to do or where to start
"we are looking at various options for memory care facilities for my mil. we've looked at many facilities in the us (both in her current state as well the state that we live in). however, we have not been terribly impressed by the places we've seen despite having a decent budget to work with.has anyone explored care facilities in foreign countries? i know there are some in mexico that some us citizens go to. i've also recently read about some seemingly very nice memory care facilities in thailand that cater to foreigners. any thoughts on this, including whether medicare will cover any costs for doctors, drugs, etc for someone living outside the us?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kpqndj/anyone_have_experience_with_memory_care/,Anyone have experience with memory care facilities outside the US??
"hi there, just wondering if anyone has any advice or reassurance or really anything because i'm feeling really lost right now.my mum is 55 years old, and she's always had a whole lot of health problems (nerve problems, t1 diabetes, cancer, autoimmune conditions, circulation problems, severe depression and anxiety, you name it the list goes on) it's hard to say exactly when her dementia onset as many of the early symptoms likely blended in with all her other conditions (struggling to walk and dropping things? well she's in a lot of pain and her hands are ruined. forgetting words and other things? brain fog from her meds and depression. apathy? she's been depressed for years. seeing insects everywhere? she's on too many meds. she doesn't cook or do any housework anymore? depression or laziness. she's gone off a lot of food and doesn't eat much any more? nausea probably. etc.) but for a bit over a year now it's been undeniable that something was really wrong. she stopped being able to manage her health conditions, which caused particular problems with her diabetes and she ended up hospitalised a lot. her speech started to get affected, and she repeated stuff a lot. she was noticeably slowing cognitively, she was acting strange and at times paranoid/delusional. she stopped caring at all about her appearance, way more than normal. she was unreliable and couldn't seem to remember anything properly (for example if you asked if she had eaten, taken her meds or if anyone had phoned she couldn't answer accurately), and eventually we realised she wasn't at all safe to leave the house on her own. there were other things as well but this post is long enough lol. so in around october she was finally admitted to a psych ward for evaluation after my dad finally got her therapist to understand that something was very wrong. she's been in there since then and has deteriorated in a number of ways (incontinence, increased mobility issues, falls, speech is even less clear and fluent etc.) and they've put her on medication to calm her down as she was restless and agitated before, but otherwise it feels like they gave up the diagnostic process in late november. they did all the standard tests to rule out infections and deficiencies etc. as well as brain scans which apparently showed a bit of vascular damage but as her blood pressure is apparently fine it can't be vascular dementia. i'm worries they don't really has the experience or resources to handle a case like my mum, where it's potentially a slightly rarer form of dementia and where diagnosis will be difficult due to no one really knowing what happened in the early stages. does anyone have any advice as to what i should do/ask for? tl;dr: mum (55) has been in a psychiatric hospital since october for suspected dementia, but due to a large number of previous health conditions diagnosis has been especially complicated, and i'm worried the doctors have all but given up there is no super clear cause at this point."," im not an expert but i think she would have other symptoms if it was dementia but i could be wrong. you are all suffering, seeing a psychiatrist probably your best bet. they can make an assessment of her. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kpocit/mum_stuck_in_diagnosis_limbo_scotland/,Mum stuck in diagnosis limbo (Scotland)

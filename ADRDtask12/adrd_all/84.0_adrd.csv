"it occurred to me the other week how much easier our caretakers are going to have it.  nobody goes anywhere without a smart phone, smartwatch, something connected to the web that we will be so accustomed to carrying that we won't leave home without it.my dad, on the other hand never had a cell phone, never had a smart watch, never learned to use a computer.  he's physically still quite fit (which is good) but gets lost in his own front yard (which is bad).  i'm trying to keep an eye on him, without making it seem like we are worried he is going to wander away.  some days are easier than others, from my observation platform, i can see most of the front yard and part of the side yard, but when he goes out the back door or around the back of the house i can't see him.  i've made a mental note of the things he always has with him, glasses, watch, sandals and thought of how to add a gps tracker to them.  replacing his watch with a smart watch would be perfect, except nobody makes a wind up smart watch.  he's never going to remember to charge a watch because he has always had a wind up watch.  the sandals also have potential to hide a gps tracker in the straps or those gps insoles (which if they could recharge from walking would be a pretty good idea).this morning, i had almost the perfect idea.  a gps monitor and rfid combo unit.  set up the exterior doors with an access control system that you have to have the rfid tag to open so that your patient can't get outside without the gps monitor attached to the rfid tag.  i think a sign at eye level that says this door won't open without your bracelet/necklace/special underwear would still work for my dad at this stage.  the problem is, it would have to tie into a fire alarm system of some sort to automatically open the doors in case something bad happens."," hi, check out tack gps tracker, it is a very small tracker.

"so i've been lurking here a bit, just trying to see how other people deal with this. finally decided i needed to post. for background, my dad is 69 and lives with my mom about 5 miles away from me. they moved down a couple of years ago so we could help them out because they were getting older. my dad is diabetic and has congestive heart failure with a history of multiple heart attacks. he's also always been very stubborn, very sure of himself, and a little paranoid. he's also never been good at being compliant with medication and doctors orders. over the last 5 or so years, my dad has gotten progressively weirder. it started with him thinking he had worms. he was getting sores on his legs, likely caused by edema from cfh, and he made it worse by compulsively picking at them. his doctors have checked him several times, and of course they can't find any kind of parasites. over the last year or so, he's begun to get worse and worse, both mentally and physically. he began to accuse my mother of being abusive to him, and that he hated living here and wanted to go back to his home state. he'd threaten to leave, even though he could barely walk sometimes with his legs being so swollen. i think being cooped up due to covid hasn't helped. but anyway, back in november, he started getting more and more agitated, and fell a couple of times, and we'd either have to go help him up or call the fire department to come get him up. then one day he was in a particularly nasty mood and fell and he wound up hitting my mom. not hard, because he's very weak, but still... we called the ambulance, and they talked him into going to the hospital. when he got there, he became very combative, swatting at the nurses, trying to bite, and pulling out his ivs.they eventually had to restrain him after admitting him due to his blood sugar and blood pressure bottoming out. we talked to the doctor about this and he mentioned a social worker would be coming around to talk to us, because he was getting hard for my mom to deal with. i'm the only one in the family who works, and i help take care of my wife who has her own severe mental health issues, so moving him in with us is a non-starter.unfortunately the hospital discharged him a couple of days later and no social worker ever followed up. ever since, it's just been a constant cycle. he began sleeping with his legs hanging off the bed for... reasons? which wasn't good with his fluid buildup. his legs were just pouring fluid and were so swollen and inflamed and blistered. he had a nurse that was coming in to see him and she kept trying to get him to put his legs up and he refused. around this time he started believing that my mom was different people... like he believes there are anywhere from 3-6 women living with him, all of whom claim they're his wife. he's also seen other people in the house. the nurse knows about this, but she says there's not much she can really do. i can't talk to his doctor without my dad's permission either, and with covid, the doctor can't even see my dad in person. my dad has refused to go back to the hospital, even when he lets his blood sugar bottom out. it was a downright fight trying to get him to agree to letting a friend of ours come clean their house to help my mom out.he's also good at holding things together when he has to, and sometimes he will be mostly lucid for a couple of weeks on end. but it seems the bad days are becoming more and more regular. at one point a couple of weeks ago he had gotten so obstinate and accusatory towards my mom we were starting to look into guardianship. i was afraid he was going to lose his legs because hw as doing absolutely nothing for them. then one day he decided to get into bed properly. and his legs got better! since then he's been elevating his legs, and for a few weeks he's been in a pretty good mood... until the last couple of days. i went to visit them tonight and he was accusing my mother of wanting him to die and threatening to kick him out. of course he's perfectly innocent and never says anything rude. he wouldn't let my mother and i talk, and he just kept getting more and more agitated, so i just left. apparently he's been letting his blood sugar bottom out and gets angry with my mom when she tries to get him to eat something.it's all getting to be too much. my performance at work has suffered, and my mom is at her wits end. i've just stopped engaging with him when he's agitated and delusional, and have tried to get my mother to do the same. you can't have a productive conversation with him like that. he really needs to be in memory care. but he won't see a doctor, and he's good enough at keeping his shit together that i'm not even sure a doctor would realize there's a problem. getting him to see a neurologist or psychiatrist would be a war. i'm honestly afraid he's going to try and drive and go back to his homestate and either kill himself or someone else. or i'm afraid he's going to go into a diabetic coma, or fall and break his hip. i just don't know what to do... maybe i need to talk to a lawyer about guardianship? get him involuntarily hospitalized? i don't even know how that would go. i'm sorry for the massive all of text. i just need to vent to some people who have been through the same thing... if anyone has any advice or suggestions i would be eternally grateful. fwiw we are in florida."," does he have a general practitioner/family doctor?  that's usually the best place to start if you do. they can prescribe medications to help with the behavior issues.  getting him into a memory care with the behavior issues may be difficult.  if you can manage to get him into a hospital, for instance, the next time he falls or lets his blood sugar drop dangerously, call an ambulance.  they can do an evaluation there and prescribe medications. the hospital can even help with placement in a memory care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nb6so4/dad_is_getting_worse_dunno_what_to_do_maybe_just/,Dad is getting worse.

"\*\* sorry for the long post\*\* so i'm in fl (i don't live here - just come for long weekends every month). i was planning on staying a week to help dad (87)with mom(89). he warned me that i might not want to come because she was angry at him, me, and my poor husband who has been in her presence 3 times and she really likes him. *note - i help them with all their finances and stuff - they've always trusted me and looked to me when they need anything. my mother's huge trigger is money.* our first two days were...quite good. she doesn't remember her words, but we hung out, played cards, and there weren't any problems. then day three happened. she walked into the bedroom i'm staying in and pointed her finger and said ""i need to talk to you"". note - mom has always been a wonderful person and a great mom. we have always had a great relationship. she proceeded to lambaste my father and i for ""stealing her moneys"", calling me a liar in a tone that brought chills to my spine. it doesn't even sound like her. it went on for about an hour until i finally walked away. dad and i both made the mistake of trying to discuss her concerns logically. she told me that she always thought i was a liar and that playing cards with me and being nice was hard because of all ""this"" that she had to try and hide. at some point she takes off and we have no idea where she is for three hours. she absconded with a bag packed with a jacket, a book, her phone, and $3000. she's got bad knees and walking is not something she does a lot of except for now, apparently. wth?day four she stomped around, refused to eat or drink saying she wanted to die. took off twice. day five - she passes out and pitches backwards, landing on the tile floor with the back of her head hitting first.  is out cold for a few minutes then argues that she will refuse to go in an ambulance. yeah no. trip to the er and a night in the hospital. my father said that he felt terrible but it was a relief to not have her at the house for a day. :( day six - we bring her home late afternoon, she eats, showers, and goes to bed. day seven - all he&amp;&amp; breaks loose. calling me a bitch, screaming at my father and crying that the lord was watching him and that he needed to tell her he did it, insisting that her wallet had been plundered because the money in there and the money in her secret stash was gone. she didn't use those words. money is ""cell phones"" or boxes. this went on for two hours.  then starts in that her purse is missing - she finds it after we search the house in a dresser drawer with her sweaters - not where she keeps it so ""it must have been one of you"". then her slippers are missing...but they're right next to her side of the bed right out in the open neatly placed. someone put them there - not her. none of her words were correct so this was even more difficult because we had no idea what she was talking about and had to keep doing something akin to 20 questions to make any sense of it. dad at this point has had it. we contact two mc facilities - one is coming over in the morning to do an evaluation. she also gets mad at some good friends who call to check because she showed up twice on their ring camera when they weren’t home. they were “not giving her privacy”. she takes off twice this day - once just before it got dark. my father was beside himself.  the viciousness of her manner is horrible - and not my mom.  day eight - today - we take dad to the dr and in the car she's trying so hard to get herself wound up but it doesn't happen. the rest of the day - she's fine. not normal, but very nice to my dad. so....dad wants to cancel the eval. says everything seems to be ok and i can leave if i want (but he's way ok with me staying) after i've taken another 2 weeks off of work. his health is getting bashed by all this and i'm worried that the dementia is going to kill him first. and during all this - all i wanted was to ask my mother today if she still loves me. i feel like i want to just fall apart with the sadness of all of this. i want my mom back. is this how it goes? when do you know it’s definitely the right time to do something other than deal with this alone? i can’t leave my dad here by himself if she swings back to “bad mom”.  are there options for us other than mc? she refuses to have anyone come in the house. \*\* also note – all her words are wrong – this is cleaned up to get the point across and it’s still damned long\*\*td;dr? – mom is all over the board with ok days and horrible days. i’m stumped and overwhelmed."," update:  i drove to her neurologist's office this morning to get her an appointment. apparently she's been canceling her appointments and told them a while ago that she wouldn't be back because she found a new doctor.  it's amazing how crafty she can be even when she can't remember most words. they were amazing and got us in today (i had to share what's been going on, otherwise we'd have to wait a month). she agreed to go, then didn't. she turned into a crying mess who then started screaming that i was a bitch and then...she came at me. yikes. dad grabbed her (gently) and held her and she went back on the bed. we dressed her (she was in jammies) and she tried to run  to lock herself in the bathroom. sigh. i had to be stern and loud-ish and tell her that she had a decision to make - go with us in the car, or take an ambulance to the geriatric psych ward at the local er. this process took an hour. she finally came with us, begrudgingly. the doctor was amazing. he's got her on three meds (starting one at a time), is going to have a nurse do a home visit to see what medical needs she has, as well as a social worker to get my father help. plus he wants an occupational therapist to come and help her work on her balance. what was a horrid day ended up hopeful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nb5m1d/good_days_bad_days/,"Good days, Bad days?"

"i've been living with my bf, his mother and his grandmother (his dads mom) for about a year. his grandma was diagnosed with dementia before we all moved in together and with covid it all seemed to work out. i was the one primarily home with my (7y) son, homeschooling him after i lost my job about half a year in. i recently, in the last two months, had to move out and in with my grandfather who needs help managing his diabetes. but mainly due to the abuse i've been dealing with, primarily alone, due to his grandmother's failing health. from what i understand, her personality wasnt that much different before being diagnosed and was most definitely a narcissist. she was isolated alone for 15 years raising my bf alone, a hoarder and would occasionally take in abusive homeless men. slowly over time she became more and more abusive to me and my son, and my pleas for help fell on deaf ears, as no one else in the house stepped up to take *actual* care of her. (they say shes fine because she says she is, but if you're there often enough you know shes not)eventually we left because it just kept getting worse, with harrassment, she would steal our stuff, accuse me of things, giving out personal information onto the internet and to ads/people who call; including my personal email and phone number and our address with personal information on who is there and when.  when my bf's mom got frustrated and yelled at me for bringing up the issues and demanding a 2nd family meeting (the second one all year) she said ""it doesnt matter what you think, grandma gets to win. she wins"" as if i dont want her to win, i want us all to win, including my son and me who both deserve help, peace and a schedule. as if i'm not begging them to actually take care of her and not just ignore her 24/7 to go out, dance, drink and party, leaving me and my son to be the only people exposed and available to her. so we left. and slowly my bfs mental health is getting worse. and whenever i visit, his grandmother screams at me, harasses me and says some vile stuff, and i just... have to take it? i asked my bf to please give me some pleasant words or compliments after she tore apart my character when i walked in the door for the first time in a week. she told me how terrible i was, how i should be ashamed and god hated me for what i've done to her??? and he just.. said he couldn't say anything nice to me? that his brain ""wasnt working"" and he was ""tired"".but i was in tears, and am now. i've always been the kind of person to try and help and raise up others when they suffer, and i've always tried to do so for him, but when it comes to her, he always leaves me high and dry. i dont know what to do or think. i just feel like we have to end our relationship. i just feel so lost and i wish i had help and support."," so sorry op, that's sad, very difficult situations.   dementia is difficult and narcs are impossible, i know, my sister has narcissistic personality disorder since many decades.  oh gosh.  nightmare.  i can imagine npd with dementia, horrendous.  keep distance!    do you know the r/raisedbynarcissists ?  sounds like you'll find some helpful tips there... i totally understand how yr bfs mental health would be degenerating, i hope he can get himself out of there!  if he was raised by her for 15 yrs, he is most definitely in the fog.  sure if he's suffering increasing abuse, will be hard for him sometimes to act normal or positive or happy loveydovey with you, it's sad.  there is no reasoning with narcs, and no reasoning with the memory lossed, so that's a double-whammy there for a start.   some folk just don't want to be helped, they have their own path whatever it is, even to destruction.  yr bf needs counselling, support, and to get the heck out of there.  i hope you yourself don't let yrself get entangled with trying to help / fix anything there, sounds absolutely futile & impossible.  sure, for your own mental health & yr son, you need to not engage with his mom or grandma, just don't go there.  if yr bf won't leave there and is always consumed by it, then yes, maybe you ought to end relationship.  sad but.. point him over to r/raisedbynarcissists !!!  down the right side of the page, scroll down, there's < helpful resources> , in that, go to ""resource collection"";  and further down is list of  << rbn network & allies >> , idk if some things there might also be useful.  at r/narcissisticabuse down the right side is again, < reading material >  and < resources >.  that sub is for intimate partner abuse, but narcs are narcs, behaviour is same.  you'll find techniques & tactics for folk who find themselves in position of having to have contact with narcs, who can't run away & go no contact (eg co-parenting with a narc partner).  but i suppose r/raisedbynarcissists resources has same stuff.so sorry, optimal\~cellist, what a nightmare!  so sad.  so sorry.  life sure sucks sometimes.   i wish you all the best!  good luck!   hugs :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nb3nag/my23f_bfs23m_grandma_is_ruining_my_mental_health/,My(23F) bf's(23M) grandma is ruining my mental health and our relationship.
"so, my grandfather’s(who was diagnosed with dementia 8 years ago)doctor recommended we take him walking since his posture has been deteriorating/he walks very slowly. also, he is no longer able to feed himself and can’t communicate. i’ve been taking him out walking. usually for about an hour or more. every time we get back to the house he gets confused, frustrated, and angry. one time we went walking before i had a class and i had to get back in time for the class. he got frustrated, through a tantrum, and disrupted my class time. he ended up leaving on his own, got lost (at night), and we had to call the police.i just got back from taking him out walking today and he (as usual) is frustrated, angry, saying it’s not right, that he wants to go out (we don’t take him out because he refuses to bathe, change his clothes, wear a mask. anytime we try to clean him he gets very angry to the point that it seems futile at this point.) is there a point in taking him out walking if every time we come back it results in a tantrum? is one hour enough? now he’s disrupting my grandmother while she is trying to work and she is about to take him outside again.also, sometimes he has dizzy spells at the end of the walks, which makes me nervous to extend it further than one hour.  last time we did more than one hour he started to slump significantly as we were walking and i was worried he was going to fall over. when we got to the house he seemed physically unstable and i was worried he was going to faint. i try and give him adequate water with his meals. he had had lunch with an apple/popsicle a few hours prior to our walk today and at the end while he was throwing a tantrum he said he was dizzy. before he complained of being dizzy i gave him an ice cream sandwich and water because i figured that would be the case. he didn’t drink any of the water."," five years ago i would walk at least an hour per day, and averaged at least 10 miles per week.  but now my dementia symptoms have gotten more severe, and my balance is more of a concern along with my energy output.  now i average .85 miles per day and about 6 miles per week.  walking is less, and split into two walking periods every day, of a bit under 30 minutes each.personally i would guess that these walks may be too long -- exhausting his energy reserves, and energy is needed for cognitive functioning..i think a little bit of pushing for walking may be helpful, but mostly let the person with dementia set the barriers -- let us be a major part of the care-partner team for decisions on what is best for us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nb01oi/is_one_hour_of_walking_enough/,Is one hour of walking enough?

"my uncle was officially diagnosed with dementia in dec 2020. it was a long time coming and unsurprising. for reference, he turns 78 this year and lives in mt. our family is very small. so far, he’s doing fairly well, spending most of the day watching tv. he has a good sense of humor, makes jokes, etc, but repeats himself often. he’s also a hoarder with lots of big, old rusty trucks and power tools lying around the property.the biggest issue so far -as it probably is with many people in this situation- is driving, and when/how to get (for lack of a better word) your family members with dementia to stop driving, or at least get people to ride with them. at his diagnosis, the doctor talked to him about driving, driving less, and driving with other people, but when i asked all he remembers is “the doctor told me not to drive”. most of the time, he drives his 2012 subaru two miles twice a day to his pasture to feed his horses. for the time being, we’re alright with him doing that. however, occasionally he decides to drive somewhere else in something else, like yesterday when he decided to drive his rickety (to put it mildly) 1980 half ton pickup truck. he’s a little foggy on where exactly he went and what happened there. the truck is in poor condition and the thought of him driving it is terrifying -i won’t even drive it.so, how to you get your aging family members with dementia to stop driving? what are some strategies and tactics to use? what can we do to prevent a tragedy from happening?thanks!"," if you feel he's still safe in driving, you can use a tracker called carlock on the car.  it is placed under the kick plate of the car and links to your phone.  you can then be alerted when the car starts and it will track their location.  this can help you locate him if needed. it can also help give you a sense of whether he is getting lost but finding his way on his own, and it also tracks driving ability (harsh breaking, etc.)  once you feel it's not safe for him to drive, then taking away the keys or disabling the vehicle somehow is better than taking away the license.  they still need the license as id after they stop driving.  at least where i live, we need her license for doctor's appointments and even needed it for entry into her latest memory care facility.  if you are in the us, i think they also need it if you need to take them to the social security office.  sometimes, when i fill out her paperwork online, they ask for a driver's license number.  definitely hold onto it if possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/naws46/what_to_do_about_driving/,What to do about driving?
"recently, my family and i put my dad in memory care. he'd gotten violent (lots of paranoid delusions) and, after he tried to push my mom down the stairs and strangle me, we decided this was more than we could handle.my mom is in a bad headspace, in part because she feels enormously guilty for placing him in a home. i don't. mind you, i don't like it, and i feel sad that we had to put him there, but i also believe it was necessary. he's a danger to himself and others at this point, we're not equipped to handle it, memory care is, and frankly, it is reasonable for the rest of us to want to be safe in our own homes. if i could travel back in time to when my dad was in his right mind and ask him what he'd want us to do, i'm sure he'd tell us to do what we had to in order to keep him from hurting anyone.so, no, i feel sad but not guilty, and when my mom asked me, i admitted it. she called me cold-blooded. i'm not sure whether she's right or she's just lashing out.has anyone else felt this way? i see a lot of caregivers expressing guilt, but very few saying, ""you know, actually, i think we got him the care he needed, and it sucks that that couldn't be us, but i feel ok about my decision."""," i feel you are just being human and feeling relief. from what i have read and experienced at the later stages, it is just too much for family to handle at the later stages especially when aggression and incontinence is involved.in july, i was just broken down and realized that i can't do this much longer after dealing with multiple and increasing issues over the last eight years (i was the only one helping except a little bit from my daughter). in addition,  i had to retire early 6 years ago to cope with the demands of the situation.i finally placed mom in memory care in october after a very scary sundowner's situation where she threatened to kill me and was having imaginary telephone conversations with no actual phone in her hand. at that point, she was officially diagnosed with moderately severe vascular dementia.i developed my own physical health issues from the stress which i am trying to get a handle on.  it is now may and she is in a wheelchair, in the severe stage, and enrolled in hospice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nawf4w/feeling_guilty_for_not_feeling_guilty/,Feeling guilty for not feeling guilty
"was listening to a lecture and the lady said something interesting. she said that she doesn't like the term 'behaviour' because it makes those with dementia seem responsible for the effects of their illness. it conflates the disease with the person and means our frustration is more likely to be connected with our memories of that person going forward.  if we criticise someone's behaviour, we are ultimately criticising them as a people as opposed to this bastard illness.she prefers the term 'symptoms', because it clarifies the distinction and means that when caregivers are stressed and sad, and just want to scream you're not railing against the often loving figure that raised you. just thought it was interesting how important the language is with stuff like this.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/naw6gx/behaviour_vs_symptoms/,'Behaviour' vs 'Symptoms'

"this is in the uk if that makes a difference.a bit of background, dementia runs in our family. our uncle (my dad's brother) who is 5 years younger than our dad is currently in a nursing home suffering from early onset dementia. one of our dad biggest fears is going the same route as his brother. this, the loneliness of the pandemic and possibly the death of our mother by cancer who he looked after in her final days a few years ago have all taken quite a large toll on him. he is active, social, fiercely independent, and seems in  good health for his age, but he does seem to be drinking more, being more forgetful and confused and has bursts of seemingly unjustified anger.my sister and i are a bit worried about him and want to make sure we as a family do the best by him. due to how's he's been over the last few months, my sister (who has poa) asked to speak to his doctor to ask advice to whether these symptoms could be the start of dementia or something like depression. she didn't ask any personal details on dad's health and was just seeking advice on what we should be looking out for and if there is anything we can do as a family to support him.after her initial talk with his doctor, the doctor said he would need to tell dad next time he's sees him that he had spoken to her and what her concerns are. his reasoning is that because dad is independent and of sound mind it is his duty to let him know. now i understand if he had to disclose any information about my dads health directly, but all my sister wanted was some advice. the doctor did not previously let her know that by talking to him he would have to tell our dad what they spoke about and she assumed it was a confidential discussion. should the doctor have let her know the procedure before he spoke to her?our main worry is that this will deeply affect our dads mental health knowing that we were worried and have sought advice. he has made comments in the past that lead us to believe that if he did get dementia that he would take matters into his own hands rather than go into a nursing home and go the same route as his brother.we love our dad so much and only want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to keep him as independent and as happy as possible for as long as possible. is there a way to ask the doctor to not disclose the conversation? he has said he wouldn't talk to him until my sister has had a chance to tell my dad herself but this still feels like it would do more damage to my dad the good.sorry for the long post, but just wanted to make sure all the details we there.", i think his doctor messed up not telling you he would have to talk to your dad about everything he speaks to you about before he spoke to you.  but what's done is done and at this point he has to speak with your dad.you guys could throw your sister under the table and say she acted on her own and that you guys think he's actually fine if you want to let him have some footing still.  so like your sister is just paranoid or sonething.i don't know though.  seems sooner or later your dad's gonna have to face reality.  would think he could handle it better while he's still lucid than later.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n9sh1j/confidential_advice_sought_from_gp_which_now/,Confidential advice sought from gp which now risks the well being of our father
"my best friend’s mom was just diagnosed. she had to move into a memory care unit, leaving my best friend and her brother to clean out her home. her mom was a high powered executive and was well known for being an absolute brain. to watch her go down hill so fast has been a nightmare, as i’ve known her for over 20 years. my question is, what can i do to support my best friend?  she is so nonchalant about her mom going into care and just acts like it’s no big deal. i have tried to ask her how she’s dealing with things and she is very avoidant. i tried to talk to her about it and ended up crying and she was comforting me, when it is her mother that is sick. i just want to be a good friend and be supportive but i don’t know where to start if she won’t even acknowledge how bad things are for her mom right now. what can i do to lessen her load?  i just want to help."," well, if they are still in the process of cleaning out the house i would think it certainly would be good if you could help with that. i had to clean out my mothers house and was grateful for the family members who helped. also if you can help arrange any administrative tasks in that process, like finding appropriate donation facilities or auction houses, storage facilities (and the rental trucks needed) and finally junk removal companies. finding contractors to do repairs as needed etc. etc. etc.i was overwhelmed with doing that and at the same time worrying that i was making poor decisions or uninformed decisions because i was both overwhelmed with the task and the grief of having to go through all those things that dated back to my childhood. if she’s going to sell the house then helping her find a good realtor and all the work/research involved in that would also be useful. people often ask “how can i help” but that puts a huge burden on the person that you’re trying to help because now they have to not only figure out what they need to do but tell you what to do and then hope that you will be willing to do it and in the way that they asked (mental load). any of this mental load that you can remove from her at this point would certainly be useful. and i don’t mean just preparing a bunch of documents and saying here look at this and tell me what you think. i couldn’t look through paperwork i could only do do do. it was very hard and many things didn’t work out which i blame myself for. i think if i had help with those decisions and they didn’t work out i would’ve felt less bad about them.being a good sounding board for decisions she will have to make would be useful, and try to approach those discussions in a matter of fact,  non-emotional way.  at the same time if and when she does open up to you just listen and don’t give advice on how to deal with it. it’s very annoying when you’re essentially grieving and someone else is giving you tips on how to deal with it. i don’t know how to explain it  but i basically shut down if all of a sudden i am getting a lecture on how to not be sad or overwhelmed.edit:also just add on, if she has kids that are in school you can probably help her deal with them especially if they are doing remote learning. offering to take them to their extracurriculars or shopping or out for ice cream or dinner or whatever so that she doesn’t have to worry about neglecting them while doing everything else. that would certainly ease a burden.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n9fgrc/how_to_help_best_friend_whose_mom_has_been/,How to help best friend whose mom has been diagnosed.

hi so i’ve been caring for my father now for over 11 years since mum passed away and we have had our ups and downs and he is 85 but last year or so my father seems to have developed dementia and it’s progressing fast which is causing us to fall out a lot. i have to admit my patience is very thin with him especially when he acts weird or says silly things which seems to be the norm now i have tried ringing the local doctors surgery up a few months ago but they didn’t want to know just fobbed me off. i’m the only person caring for him nobody else helps or sees him i’m here 24/7 and it’s grinding me down as well im just struggling to cope with the situation. a lot of the time he needs prompting to do something like he doesn’t make many decisions for himself at all anymore and he often talks about his past and forgets where we even are he thinks he’s back at home where his mum and dad was. it’s very frustrating and when i try speaking to him it can get into a heated row which i hate i just can’t cope with the fact that i’m losing my father and it hurts. he sleeps a lot during the day and at night he will wake up during middle of the night and can wander around thinking other people are in the house it’s very hard to see him like this especially with me just feeling like i’m on my own and im having  to cope with how i’m feeling too seeing all this. has anybody got any ideas or advice on what i can do because i’m lost with the situation?, i rang the docs this morning he’s got an appointment on wed thankfully. they want to do some tests on him and maybe refer him to the memory clinic. hope this helps him better,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n8ohyi/father_has_dementia_struggling_to_cope/,Father has Dementia struggling to cope.
"hi everyoneim currently living with my grandma, along with my mom and uncle. my grandma moved in with us about 4 years ago after she was diagnosed with dementia and my uncle moved in right before covid to help take care of her. she has paranoia (she thinks news correspondents are speaking to her and can see into the house from the tv), incontinence, and of course memory loss. she also has always been a demanding woman so this only heightens it. we do absolutely everything for her. my mom is really struggling. my grandma cries when we leave the house and gets scared, so as a result at least one person has to be home at all times. luckily my uncle works from home but when my mom isn’t working, she’s sitting with my grandma while she just talks and stares at her. this is when i’m away at college, when i’m home i help and sit with her a lot too. we have nurses come 4 times a week and they are amazing, but they have trouble showering/working on hygiene with her as do we. it’s a miracle to get her to shower once a week and with the incontinence issue that’s a problem. it’s become extremely overwhelming for all of us, but we don’t know when the right time is for memory care. my mom is also a very noble/caring person and feels like my grandma would be scared and lonely in memory care and i know will feel guilty. i guess i’m asking when the right time was when you moved your loved one into memory care, and how you deal with the guilt that accompanies that.thank you"," we actually placed my mom in memory care last week. incontinence has been becoming more of an issue, but it was her delusions that were the most troublesome and exhausting. we struggled with determining when the right time was but in reality, i think that when you get to the point of wondering when, it’s probably time. best of luck to you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n8mfvl/grandma_living_with_us_when_is_it_time_for_memory/,"Grandma living with us, when is it time for memory care?"

"hi everyone, i guess i just want some outsider confirmation that i’m not overreacting in anyway. family history is complicated, but essentially my (20s) dad (50s)and nan (90s) raised me. dad died suddenly from the virus last year, it was a huge shock. my nan was in hospital at the time as she had an accident and bleed on the brain. due to the situation in the world we didn’t get to see her during our grieving time and her other son decided it would be best not to tell her about our dad (her youngest son) as she did not come out the accident the same and was completely confused, didn’t recognise anyone and was then diagnosed with dementia. me and my sisters really wanted to tell her but the advice from the nurses was to not also. obviously within one week i essentially lost half my family, and my depression has been bad. i’m doing a phd and have been trying my best to finish it with only my sisters as support. last week i visited my nan as we’ve been able to recently with lifted restrictions. this was the first time she mentioned my dad in over a year. she doesn’t know who i am but desperately begged me to promise to find her son and it’s now clear she does understand that he’s no longer here but still doesn’t know why. it was heartbreaking, and all i could do was promise that i would try to find him, that i know he loves her and that was it. it broke me. i’ve been hanging on all this time since my dads death but something snapped and my depression just went wild, it was truly my worst nightmare and something i’ve been dreading the whole year. i feel suicidal, hopeless, and just desperately miss those two most important people in my life. i’ve asked for a time off from uni and while my supervisors are understanding somehow i feel guilty as i know dementia is something a lot of people deal with especially with grandparents and i feel like i should be able to cope. i think this was just the straw that broke the camels back, and i’m not sure why i’m posting here, i guess i hope that someone will be able to understand and tell me it’s ok xx"," you have had such a tough year, it’s a real testament to your strength that you’ve held together so well! it sounds like you’re having a very natural reaction to the traumatic things that have happened to you, and it’s definitely okay to feel like that.can you access some support services through your university? you shouldn’t need to manage with this without help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n8h5mu/venting_and_need_some_reassurance/,Venting and need some reassurance
"this post concerns my mother, who will be 48 this year. my grandfather passed away from early onset (starting at age 60) alzheimer’s a few years ago. my mom is currently experiencing menopause and has been experiencing heightened stress and she has always struggled with depression. anyway, i’ve noticed a couple of small lapses in her memory as of late related to her short term memory. as an example, earlier this week we discussed mother’s day plans and when i tried to confirm them with her yesterday she didn’t remember that today is mother’s day or what we discussed. she also works a stressful job and this happens to be the last week of the semester so pressure is on.today on the phone i mentioned that i had covid, which she knew previously, but in our conversation she had no memory of this. the reminder didn’t jog her memory either, she completely forgot. she got emotional when she realize she forgot, too. granted, i had almost no symptoms and so my experience was somewhat insignificant but so far this is the scariest symptom i’ve noticed so far.should i try to push her to go to the doctor? writing all of this makes me think i should, however, it’s almost impossible already to get my mom to do anything to take care of herself. i am thinking about approaching other family members about my concerns. my mom has a young son (8 years old) and i am extremely concerned for him if our mom is already exhibiting symptoms of dementia.thanks for your advice."," i'm sorry this is happening and i hope you can convince your mother to get tested. i speak from experience when i say that menopause can make you a little confused but this is troubling. it's good to know what's happening and it might be stress/depression/anxiety or other things that can be treated. if it is early onset alzheimer's, treatments are more effective and she can start to work with a therapist to develop habits that will help her remain independent for as long as possible. it will also give her some time to plan for her and her son's future needs. you might want to talk to your doctor about this as well and get a dna test.  she might be worried that she will lose her job/health insurance/benefits if they find out she has a problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n8g9e1/cause_for_concern_early_onset/,Cause for concern?

"my nana’s had dementia for the last 5 or 6 years that we know of, and now things are a bit harder in terms of feeding her and our work schedules. we are a large family thankfully and there’s 3 or 4 days a week where we can feed her properly, but we all work full time and she’s forgetting that she’s heating food we’ve left out.i’ve found tubs of soup in the microwave cold and stuff on the stove burned into pots (we’ve turned off all this stuff while we go now) she generally goes hungry despite trying to talk things through with her on the phone but does anyone have ideas or recommendations of “decent food” to leave out or ways she can heat food while we’re gone? is there a way?many many thanks in advance!"," my dad still knows how to microwave but i was planning to get something like the below smart microwave if he couldn't operate it anymore.  you or a hired caregiver can use the alexa app to speak into your phone and operate the microwave remotely.  all she has to do is put the dish into the microwave.  or you can set it as part of a routine so no one has to turn it on but i wonder if your relative is too far along for that.right now for my dad, i'm switching to a yolink motion sensor placed inside my refrig.  if my dad doesn't open the refrig by a certain time by a certain time, alexa will tell him he hasn't eaten lunch yet and to go eat lunch.  when he does open the refrigerator, alexa will tell him to grab the blue container and eat that for lunch.  there is a door sensor on the microwave door that when he opens the microwave, it tells him to cook his food for 1.5 minutes.  in your case, you could set the routine so that when the door is closed, the microwave will start automatically and cook for 1.5 minutes.  you might not even need the door sensor, i'm not sure with this smart microwave.my dad never misses meals anymore with alexas help even when he's completely by himself. he problem is, he often times only eats half his meals.  i have alexa keep reminding him to eat all of it but he is never hungry anymore so i gave up on too many reminds cause after the first one, he just tells alexa no.  instead, i've hired a friend to call three times a day to give him 220 calorie protein bars or nuts instead as snacks.  this supplements his meals he doesn't eat completely.  i'd have my friend nag him during meals but its much easier to get him to eat snacks than his whole meals so this alexa meals, friend snacks is more time efficient.  it's really cheap to do things this way too cause it takes about 15 minutes for him to eat a snack, done 3 times a day.i like the slow cooker idea but then i would have a much harder time controlling how much he eats.  my dad doesn't like cold foods which makes it tougher, maybe you don't have that problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n8ex77/meal_prep_ideas/,Meal prep ideas?

"my grandfather with dementia has refused to bathe/brush his teeth since december. me and my grandmother have tried to get him to bathe. we first started with asking him if he wanted to take a shower/tried to explain the importance of bathing. he  would always refuse. after a month of this we hired an aide to come. she stayed for a few hours and we tried to get him to shower. that didn’t work. when we tried to remove his clothes he got very angry. so my grandmother and i kept trying to get him to bathe. we tried bubble baths with his favorite music playing. my grandmother offered to shower with him. all but to no avail. one day we were successful at cleaning his upper body, changing his shirt (but not the bottom half), and putting on some deodorant. the last time me and my grandmother tried he got angry and hit her (not enough to bruise, but a hit nonetheless). while my grandmother was at work i tried a few times to get him to let me at least clean his face or wipe down his upper body with a washcloth and he wouldn’t let me. so, at this point i feel like we have kind of given up. but, he just keeps getting stinkier and stinkier. i can’t talk to him without holding or covering my breath. his breath and body smell really bad and i don’t know what we should do at this point. he’ll try and talk to me and it’s difficult for me to sit through it because of the smell. i’ll scrunch up my nose ( i don’t know how that makes him feel). i really don’t see us being successful with cleaning his whole body. since december we’ve only been successful at cleaning his upper body and that was once. my grandmother has tried brushing/flossing his teeth, but has only been successful a few times (since he gets angry). so his teeth have not been brushed in a least 3 months. should we keep trying? what other tactics should we use? or do we just let it be (letting it be, sounds like some sort of abuse towards him though, but he’s so resistant and gets very angry) and just let him keep getting stinkier and stinkier? the smell is starting to make me feel sick."," we get my mother-in-law in the shower about once a week. it works best if i get the bathroom ready, start the shower, get her clean clothes , and then say ""ok! you're shower is ready!""my inclination is to do this the way i did things with my adhd kids - tell them what was coming, remind them a few times, often with a countdown(""shower time in ten minutes!, five minutes more on the computer then shower"") which not only doesn't work with her, it makes it almost impossible to get her clean.like others here, she was a fastidious woman who was always well groomed and nicely dressed. now she sleeps in her clothes and has to be tricked into bathing and changing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n7258h/did_we_give_up_too_soon/,Did we give up too soon?

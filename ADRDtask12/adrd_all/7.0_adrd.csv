[removed]," my grandma has latched onto a vague ""they"" as in.... ""they took my car"" ""they made me leave my house"" ect .... she's usually sad/slightly upset by these necessary events, but not angry, and doesn't direct it at any specific family member.  so we usually try and phrase things where, *this is what has to happen*, because 'vague entity' .... yeah it totally sucks, we tried but this is how it is..... however, we're here to make sure you get whatever you need, even though *xxx* has to happen.   since this is a pension, maybe try placing 'blame' on some vague pension office protocol?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/s9ev53/im_going_to_have_to_be_the_bad_guy_with_my_dad/,"I'm going to have to be the ""bad guy"" with my Dad and his pension - and I don't know how to approach it."

[removed]," hi! my dad had it in september of last year. he is about midway through the disease process (i think). he is 70 and has no comorbidities other than dementia. he was fully vaxxed in january of last year. he developed covid pneumonia very quickly (like 5 days in) and was hospitalized. he also recovered very quickly and was discharged after 3 days. it took him about 2-3 weeks to recover his strength and mobility. he was very very tired after being discharged and i was so concerned, but he pulled through. it made his dementia worse, but i did see some improvement of functioning once he was healed and feeling good. it‚Äôs hard to tell if covid caused a permanent exacerbation of dementia symptoms or if his dementia just progressed naturally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/s97hyx/covid_19_and_alzheimers/,Covid 19 and Alzheimer's?

[removed]," different states have different rules, including easing death when it seems the right thing to do.  in wa, i think, a family may apply to run a ""small care home"" and use extra bedrooms with maybe four affected people who can begin to feel as if they have family right there.  prices vary quite a bit and i think were not bad in small wa homes.  it is criminal to trap young people in this kind of caregiving.  they are quite welcome to visit their loved ones in care homes.  look up [medicare.gov]( and find ""aging"" for a list of actual care homes in the area.  you can try something out, and change your mind later.  in fact, the aging person will probably be happier (think toast and coffee at breakfast in the kitchen, watching the pets in the courtyard, a long nap, the evening news, and an early bed time) than he would be in his own house.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/s8wb7y/how_do_you_know_when_it_ends_and_at_what_point_do/,How do you know when it ends and at what point do you stop?

[removed]," like other responses here, referring to yourself by name and conveying a safe and loving demeanor is what is important. mom is/was bilingual, so we always thought that introducing more words in the statement, ""it's me, [name], your daughter"" added another layer of confusion. because mom now has to remember name, and then what ""daughter"" meant in relation to that name. before things got to her current, final stage, she would repeat the word she couldn't recall, ""daughter... daughter..."" like she was trying to recall from a mental dictionary.the more we encountered ""conversations"" like these, the more it became apparent that trying to provide context clues only added to the confusion and subsequent agitation. it's your face and voice that are most important. words and meaning will be eaten by the disease, but emotions remain. the rest of the work on your end will be mentally and emotionally preparing yourself for the gradual loss on your end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/s7f0gh/probably_been_asked_a_billion_and_a_half_times_on/,"Probably been asked a billion and a half times on here, but what's the best way to respond when they start forgetting who you are?"

[removed]," first i'm really sorry for what your family is going through.  it's hard and it's good to reach out for advice.my advice: don't focus on the bad, focus on the good!  accentuate the good things in your memory, hold onto them and cherish them.  make recording of your conversations, write good memories down and just enjoy what you've got!do your best to spend time quality with him when you can.take it from someone with regrets here.  i wish i had taken more time to hold on then because i didn't know how bad it could get later.  you just can't know how it's going to go or how long it's going to take.  i wish my dad could give me advice one more time.  i just wish he'd say my name again.one of the things i have that i cherish more than anything is back before things were really bad my dad was outside and i was videoing him and he looks up and sees me and just smiles the best smile.    i wish i'd have had the foresight back then to just record everything i could.it's not easy. you just keep doing the best you can.*also remember how hard this must be on your mother.  she's going to need support and understanding too.  my mom has been changed so much by all the trauma and since covid happened all the support groups in the area shut down.  it's been miserable and isolating to a family that's already isolated because of a difficult caregiving situation.  be there for her too and make sure she's ok.  it's a pretty difficult greiving process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/s4ulir/changes/,Changes.

[removed], first i'm so sorry you are going through any of this. my advise is to get an attorney asap and fight this. nursing homes are a necessary thing as not everyone has family who can care for them or any family at all. the quality of nursing homes can vary wildly. i've lost both parents to dementia/alzheimer's in the last two years and it is an awful disease. i can not fortunate enough to have been able to keep them at home. my mom was in a great nursing home and they did a wonderful job of caring for her. i felt that she was actually loved but some of her caregivers. my dad ended up at a horrible place and i wouldn't say he was abused but he wasn't cared for at anywhere close to the level my mom was. i tried and tried to get him into another place but it was too late. i'm my heart i do hold some blame for his rapid decline on them but what can i do now? fight to keep him with you as hard as you can. he's a lucky man to have you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/s39ryk/brother_taking_me_to_court_for_guardianship_of/,Brother taking me to court for guardianship of elderly father
[removed]," yes, you have described it very well. that's the same experience i've had and what i've witnessed in others with dementia.  i live with my dad who has dementia so i see the ""behind the scenes"" of this. conversation is a struggle - both coming up with things to say and following what someone else is saying. i often prep him before calls and visits about who the person is and some things he can say. sometimes i will even write down or give him a question to ask while he's on the phone. he appreciates the help and acknowledges sometimes to me before a visit or call that he's not sure what to say and also that he wasn't following what was said. he is happy when he can contribute to the conversation by repeating a story or opinion he knows well (that everyone has heard a million times). the ""when are you going to visit?"" is an example of that with certain people - something to fall back on conversationally (in addition to not remembering past visits etc..).  i do think your grandma enjoys the conversation more than you think because she's not aware of all the ways it's not a normal or ideal conversation (that she's repeating, etc.). it might be sucking for you but not for her - and knowing that may make it not suck for you! my dad enjoys conversations even when he's not sure who the person is or what they're really talking about - he just knows it's someone enthusiastic and animated that is giving him a lot of attention. aside from avoiding too many open-ended questions that might put her on the spot of answering when she may not be able to, i say to just keep on doing what you are doing. talk about the same thing over and over if she enjoys the topic or just happily blab about some stuff so she can listen. tell her whatever pleases her like ""i'm going to visit soon. i can't wait."" tldr: i think you're doing everything right and your grandma is happier with the conversations  than you realize.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/s2gr7s/talking_on_the_phone_with_my_midlate_stage/,Talking on the phone with my mid-late stage grandmother

""that other car!"" he said. i stopped riding in any vehicle he was driving.3. he forgets who i am.4. he has entombed himself inside his home now, but no one will visit him. his behavior is like ocd. he sweeps his living room 4 times a day. no one but him has been in there for 18 months. same with his pool. the pool man quit because there wasn't much for him to do.5. his treatment of dogs. dear gods that's the worst.6. my brother has omicron. my dad visited him unnanounced, knocked on my brother's door, and shoved mcdonald's into my brother's surprised arms.7. i live 23 hours away by drive and 4 to 5 hours by flight so i hear alot of this after the fact, from my brother.he insists he is ok.i can't do anything from here (portland).should i ask for help, or is it possible it's a combination of poor hearing, eyesight, depression after my mom's death, and mild ocd?i don't want to take his phone calls anymore. i want to change my phone #. he will call constantly when he reads the instructions i left for him on how to use the phone.i don't know what to do. at all.5.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/rtz7bi/let_me_be_the_first_in_2022_to_say_fuck_you/,"Let me be the first in 2022 to say ""fuck you, Alzheimer's Disease"""

[removed]," its good you're having it near to him.. the more travelling for him is involved the worse he might be, especially if he gets agitated when theres a change in his routine. for some people with alzheimer's i would not be surprised if they became insistent on going home at some random early time. even sitting in a side quiet place might not remedy this. if you can have a side quiet place id probably try to see if i can get an especially comfy chair for him to sink in to and relax.id have on hand for him foods or snacks thats hes familiar with, so maybe he can snack and calm down if agitated. id also have a portable music player (with songs he liked from his teens to his 30s) for him to listen to with headphones on. music can sometimes change an agitated alzheimer's persons mood around. if you want to try, maybe even play some of those songs at the venue and you could luck out and have a nice dance with him. or some cheerful sorta singingish noises, depending how far gone he is. if you can have someone dedicated to keeping an eye on him (maybe a volunteer, or friend who doesnt mind) i bet that would be good too. someone besides (or in addition to) stepmil, so that she can relax. i can easily imagine a primary caregiver not be able to enjoy themselves at this event. this person can just keep an eye on them, tail them if they wander off, maybe go for a short walk with them if they ""have to go"" to some unspecified place, then guide them back to the venue once they got their wiggles out. you could maybe find such a volunteer through your local alzheimer's association or church group or something. but maybe your stepmil can think of someone who would be good (and that volunteer maybe gets a free meal out of it?).. maybe that person could give them a ride to and from too.. that could be supernice for stepmil/primary caregiver. so she can max out her fun time. id also ask stepmil/primary carer what other things could be handy. depending on how the rest of fils body is doing, maybe shed like a place to stash a change of clothes? some no water bath wipes? maybe diaper or two? towels? its great when people want to include alzheimer's folks in their plans.. don't feel too bad if it gets a little hairy tho. its great to even try. good luck and congrats!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/rqraay/getting_married_need_advice_please/,Getting Married.

"grandma has gotten more weepy lately.  like today when she decided she needed to make the hamburger into patties, and when she struggled with it she was bawling to herself.  or earlier last week, she was weeping at least once a day dealing with her catheter (glad that's out).  and it just seems like more things set her off.  she's also seemingly more needy.  she scratched her finger with a tin can lid today and yelled for my help and woke me.  it was a minor scratch.  i guess that is somewhat different but i think she is getting to be more worried, more scared to do things, etc.  &amp;#x200b;my question is how should i deal with her crying about things that i can't relate with.  they happen over very minor things, and i feel like giving her a hug then is almost coddling and encouraging more.  i usually end up just not reacting much to it, but i guess that is kind of a cold response.  sometimes i try to distract with treats or something else she's been obsessing on.  i think the behavior is more childlike weeping, and we used to when i lifeguarded give the little kid who skinned their knee a small treat and most would almost immediately stop crying.  again, it feels a little cold, but i also don't know how to handle these very well.  any advice?"," have you told her doctor about it?  my father was very weepy, he was put on an antianxiety medication, and he just about stopped.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bodglr/crying/,Crying

"i understand this might be tl:dr and i'm sorry, but i'm really confused and i need you guys to help me understand. &amp;#x200b;i'm just sitting at my desk and i'm thinking...what the hell is going on in my life that is so bad to render me practically immobile, it's not depression, it's not adhd, it's not bpd. this is much heavier than any of what i said, memory loss is heavily present, i'm starting to lose any memory i had in past, i have one best friend and i recently forgot how i met him and i can't remember it, i can't remember any of it, my father has a car and when he comes home, he asks me to unload his car for whatever he bought and then lock it, 1 year...1 year and i still can't memorize which way should i twist the key to lock the car, 1 fucking year...., everyday at 11 pm i go out in my yard to close the gate, i twist it and then go home, as soon as i place my feet on the threshold, i have already forgotten that i locked the gate, then i just go there again to check if it's locked, it is, i come back and same happens, every fucking day. sometimes i forget to eat as well, i forget that my hunger exists and worst of all, when i decide to eat, there is no way i can make a complicated dish for myself, i have to either make an omelet or anything that doesn't require a full paged recipe, damn, sometimes i just put coffee in my cup, look up and i have already forgotten the amount of coffee i have put.&amp;#x200b;well welcome numbers, oh numbers you heavenly punishment, i am absolutely terrified of numbers, a man can say a phone number 5 times and under no circumstances i will be able to memorize it, i have to be magnificently concentrated to be able to repeat it, 10 seconds pass by and i have already forgotten it. so anything that comes with numbers, is my demise, i can't even do do normal mathematical equations let alone complicated ones. oh, there comes a poor judgement symptom, hello there many winter-ish weathers when i went out in summer clothes, i have really poor judgement of weathers, i can't make appropriate decisions, i can't do anything....i don't even know how to drive a vehicle since i can't memorize the car's dimensions, i can't ""size up"" the road, the distance...nothing. on top of that i have serious mood swings, it's almost as if i were bipolar but not aggressive enough to be common bipolar, i have lost my skills to sympathize with people, i have loss of apathy....my father has really tough medical condition and i don't even know if he'll live but i just don't know what to do, i'm not crying, i'm not worried, i'm just...numb.and one of the worst thing i have is...loss of initiative...i used to be outgoing but now there is not a single hobby on this earth that interests me other than singing, i practically can't read books since my lack of concentration is a real thing. i don't try gym because every time i say ""okay, it's time to exercise"", i forget it the next moment. help me, give me advice please, i'm tired of this, my life is crumbling. i'm not a user of drugs, i'm not an alcoholic, i drink very rarely and it's even rare for me to drink much, i'm confused, my parents think i'm a lazy bastard who's trying to break up the family, they think i'm manipulative but i just can't do it, help me please, whom should i contact? what should i do? how is dementia diagnosed? psychiatrist? neuropathologist? are these signs of early dementia? please don't remove this post, i have nowhere else to go.", i saw you said you’re on meds for depression. anti-depressants are known to cause cognitive issues so much so that there’s a name for it: brain fog. i would tell your doctor these symptoms and that you’d like to try adjust your dose.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bo87nz/im_afraid_that_i_might_be_having_an_early_onset/,[deleted by user]
"i'm sure these get posted with some regularity, but wanted to see if i could get some general advice from other people that have gone through, going through, or treating people with the same symptoms we are dealing with.   a basic background.  my dad turns 80 this year and began showing signs of dementia that were noticeable about 4-5 years ago. started with the basic problems of forgetfulness and not being able to complete tasks (ex couldn't assemble a basic wagon for my son. this is someone who has performed manual labor and been a mechanic his whole life) then to forgetting who's house he was at - even if we were at his house.  he would always say, my brain just doesn't work like it did, and apologize.   this past weekend, mother's day weekend, is what spurred me to ask for advice here.  when he and i were alone, he asked what i thought of the lady he was with because they were getting pretty serious and he really liked her.  he said he thinks she is a great woman and asked if i'd be ok with that being my step-mother.  the issue with that is, that woman is my mom and they've been married for 40 years!  i told him that, and he said .. oh .. really? then asked if she was also the mom of my siblings.  i finally mentioned to my mom today that this happened.  i've been digesting it since then and could barely tell my wife with all the emotions attached to that conversation.  my mom told me that they went to dinner last night and on the way he asked her where she worked and occasionally will ask if she knows us kids.  they are getting some basic treatment from the va.  last time they went the dr said he couldn't tell of any signs of degradation, which there pretty obviously is.  i've told my mom to start looking into finances and get another appointment for a better assessment.   here are some questions i've been thinking in my head since a couple days ago:  1. how much longer (generally) until we seriously need to get him into assisted living?2. should he be driving?  3. as heartbreaking it is to ask, life expectancy?  4. should my family and i look to do any personal therapy? if so, what kind of therapist?5. general suggestions to try to enjoy my father as much as i can before either his mind goes further or body does? this may seem like a dumb question, but seems like it's getting harder and harder to connect.  6. what type of legal items do we need to start taking care of while he still has some memory and function left?tl:dr - sorry it was so long. dad is losing his memory and hoping for some advice. even if none, i think this at least gave me a place to vent and put down some thoughts."," he should definitely not be driving.  take the keys, sell the car?you need both a medical power of attorney and an irrevocable poa.  your mom (and maybe one of the kids) should handle all the finances, and be joint tenants on their bank accounts (you need these for her too--if she's suddenly incapacitated you need to be able to take over the bills).  they're simple forms but you do need them notarized.  you should be able to download them for your state.you also need wills for both parents (actually for everyone) and you need to check the beneficiaries on all his accounts, including retirement accounts.you should consider getting your mom help on a regular basis.  usually the minimum for hired caregivers is about 4  hours a day, 3 days a week.  your mom needs that, both to help with housework since she's got her hands full and to allow her to get out of the house regularly for her own sanity.  she can use that time to meet friends, shop, whatever she enjoys.  with vascular dementia, there is no fixed endpoint.  it can be quick or it can be years.  vascular dementia is a series of downward steps--he'll level out for a while, then you may see a sudden drop in function with each additional little stroke, even if there are few other stroke signs. therapy is always a good idea when you are dealing with this level of stress.  try several therapists until you find one you feel comfortable with.  you can give them the general situation on the phone when you're making an appointment and just ask them if this is a situation they deal with, and if not, ask them to refer you to someone who does.if he is not incontinent, he doesn't wander, and your mom feels she can cope, you don't need to get him into memory care.  it sounds to me, though, like it would be a good thing for all concerned to do it soon or now, though.things to enjoy with him:  his generation's music, singing, dancing, simple games like go fish if he's able, looking at photo albums, swimming or wading, picnics.this is heartbreaking.  i do find it charming he still loves ""that woman he's been seeing.""  next time encourage him to ask her to marry him.  it might do good for both of them.also [teepa snow]( has a whole series of youtubes on coping with dementia, including about the different kinds of dementia.  they are terrific and full of information and ways to deal with it.  watch as many as you can, and get your mom to do it too.best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bo68hc/advise_needed_father_with_midstage_dementia/,Advise Needed - Father with Mid-Stage Dementia

"my mom is 64, 62 when sort of diagnosed. she was living with her boyfriend/unofficial husband of 17+ years when counsel on aging was called, warned him to stop leaving her alone, get her to doctor's appt etc. in july 2018. they checked in again november 2018 and she was left alone so they got her removed from the home and put into a memory unit at a nursing home. i visited in december 2018 (i live 360 miles away). she was vibrant and seemed better than she had been. she is still sharp and was helping all the aides taking care of the elderly residents. i was upset and i really didn't feel like this level of care was needed but at the same time i was getting wandering reports, her hair was dredded, and she was being left home alone for hours possibly sometimes days prior to this placement. her doctor also approved her removal and placement. shortly after they moved her to a different facility. right off the bat i heard she had an incident with another male resident and both of them got sent to the hospital for evaluation for a bit.i visited her at this new facility in september 2018. i was appalled at how different this facility was from the first. patients were really disabled and deranged. i definitely met the guy she had a problem with and i understand why because he cusses, threatens, goes through everyone's stuff... just a menace and scary.she looked completely different and hardly spoke. i'm wondering if they put her on meds or something after that incident. it just broke my heart completely. i don't know what to think. is it that's she emotionally broken and on meds or is it the disease? i visited again yesterday may 10, 2019 and things at the facility seemed better this time but she spoke even less this time though she still spoke some to me. she said ""when are you leaving"" and ""how long are you staying in pennsylvania""... so she can speak, make sense, and knows what's going on. i just feel so horrible about all this. i don't know if this placement broke her and that's why she shut down, if it's unnecessary medication, or the disease. this is so hard.", why weren't you made her guardian in pennsylvania when adult protective services stepped in?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bntf5w/question/,Question

"hey all! i’m a producer for empowered health, a podcast that is aiming to demystify women’s health.there has been a commonly held belief that there was nothing one could do in preventing alzheimer's. neuroscientist **dr. dale bredesen** has found that your memory's fate isn't necessarily sealed with an apoe4 gene. the neurologist's research shows that lifestyle changes may actually be the key to starving off the disease before it's too late.for so long, people opted out of getting tested for their likelihood of alzheimer’s due to the fact that it was inevitable. in our conversation with dr. bredesen, he explains step by step all the ways you can prevent against this devastating disease and even tells us the exact tests one should get to determine our risk factor. decline starts 20 years before symptoms are present, so bredesen’s protocol makes it easy to start to adjust your life choices in an effort to put off the disease’s progression.we talk to a woman who’s doing exactly that. her experience with her mother has shown her that caring for a loved one with alzheimer’s is time-consuming and often frustrating. her role as a caretaker led her to research on how to prevent the disease, so her kids won’t ever have to be in her position.our sister column, also called empowered health, comes out weekly in boston magazine where our host breaks down the same topic if you prefer a print version.**links to listen:** [apple]( | [spotify]( | [google]( | [stitcher]( | [luminary]( | [website](", fuk you abusive greedy assholes!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/blxc3t/the_bredesen_protocol_is_leading_people_to/,The Bredesen Protocol is leading people to reverse their Alzheimer's

"i'm sitting down to write this because this journey is nearly ending and i had a breakdown discussing things in our imminent future: obituaries, funerals, blessing of the sick, last rites, etc. my grandmother is basically in the active phases of dying. it's been a little less (or about) 4 years since she was originally diagnosed but i truly think she might have had signs since 2012-2013 and was able to hide them. i remember her casually mentioning to my dad that she had once driven by the house 4 times because she couldn't recognize the house. this was far before we had a diagnosis. just my thoughts: i think one of the biggest things that didn't happen that i always heard happened was forgetting loved ones. she did forget the names of loved ones she hadn't seen in years or that weren't around much, but she never forgot my mom, sister, i or her sister that lives up here's name. she had blips where she would stumble over her sister's name but that's about it.declining wasn't linear....some things happened at a faster pace than others. for example, her ability to coherently put together sentences dropped very quickly whereas her motor skills were okayish for a long while. however, it seems when something fell off, it just went down to damn near bottom before leveling out for a while. dementia seems to be a long, slow mourning process. knowing that my grandmother's days are numbered, knowing she may not make it to next week hurts. i don't want to do anything at all but i can't stand seeing her like this. her breathing is irregular, she can't eat/drink/etc. she's sleep most of the time. unable to speak well. this is the opposite of what she used to be, who she used to be. however, while it hurts, i've mourned what will never be and what has been lost since her diagnosis. i knew the outcome but am far from prepared. i feel numb and scared but that's death i suppose. feelings, sicknesses, etc are more pronounced in dementia patients. utis can completely change a dementia patient until it has cleared. same with dehydration, or mental, physical, emotional stressors. when my mom got sick, my grandmother became a bit more withdrawn, concerned about my mom even if she couldn't properly verbalize it. finally (for now): while the person i once knew has long been gone, pieces of that personality came out every now and again and made me smile. those times where she showed that strong maternal instinct she always had make me feel a bit warm and at home. i don't have anyone to talk to so i put this here. i wish i could wake up and this be a bad dream. wake up to my grandmother cooking breakfast and drinking some coffee. go back pre-diagnosis, pre-dementia. hell, right now, i'd go back to a few months ago to her just calling someone in the house just to say she didn't need anything. i was blessed with this grandmother and man is it going to hurt knowing she's no longer here. i pray a cure is found so no more people have to suffer through this shit. never in my wildest dreams could i imagine this happening to our family."," oh i relate to many. my mother has recently declined so quickly. she is living in a beautiful assisted living unit but she is miserable. she has a walker but won’t use it...fall risk for sure. she refuses to shower. she also has the look of terror and confusion in her eyes...heartbreaking. many times she just has no idea where she is. she calls frequently, sometimes 10 times an hour, and is so lost in her thoughts. i feel like my sister and i are winging it...it’s something new everyday....another symptom.  i’m looking for a local support group and haven’t found one yet. thank you all for your posts, i know i’m not alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bjco2c/our_journey_through_dementia/,Our journey through dementia....

"with one anti-amyloid clinical trial failing after another, researchers are beginning to cast around for another explanation for the disease.  one of the more popular theories at present is that inflammation plays a major role in alzheimer's disease.this is a positive change because instead of seeing one cause of alzheimer's disease (misfolded amyloid proteins, for instance) it posits that there are multiple causes of alzheimer's disease leading to one outcome (in this case inflammation).  however this relatively new theory also comes with its own limitations.activated microglia (immune cells in the brain) produce hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite which contribute to the death of neurons.  however, they are not the only source of oxidants in alzheimer's disease.  furthermore, peroxynitrite itself contributes to inflammation which helps explain why most non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs have not helped people with alzheimer's disease.  amyloid plaques by entombing copper and zinc help prevent the formation of hydrogen peroxide as alzheimer's advances, but the production of peroxynitrite (in part through activated microglia) continues.  nitration and oxidation inhibit the release and synthesis of neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recogntion, and alertness.  via mitochondrial damage, dna damage, and the depletion of energy, peroxynitrite sets forth a chain of events that leads to the death of neurons.  to treat the disease, one needs to inhibit the formation of peroxynitrite, scavenge peroxynitrite, and reverse part of their damage.  compounds that do that such as cannabidiol, thc, and terpenes in marijuana essential oils, eugenol in clove and bay laurel essential oils via aromatherapy, and ferulic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, maltol, and ginsenonsides in panax ginseng have shown great promise in the treatment of alzheimer's disease.inhibiting inflammation is part of the answer, but not the whole answer.  at least, the post-amyloid appears to be arriving albeit a quarter century too late."," i'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:- [/r/earlyonsetdementia] [inflammation: a step in the right direction](&nbsp;*^(if you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([info](/r/totesmessenger) ^/ ^[contact](/message/compose?to=/r/totesmessenger))*",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bj4lko/inflammation_a_step_in_the_right_direction/,Inflammation: a step in the right direction

"i’m fortunate in that my grandmother still recognizes us. however, she is, like most with this disease, quite prone to timeline confusion. we don’t live in the same country (or continent), so while we visit several times a year, my main form of communication is by phone.  the other day on a call, she wouldn’t believe that i was who i said i was, because “you’re telling me a little 3 year old has managed to ring me?”  so she thought it was 1997. she was lighthearted about it all as she thought i was my cousin pranking her. most of my cousins on that side of the family are at least 20 years older than me so it made sense. had she seen me in person during that incident, i’m a full grown adult. i suspect she wouldn’t have recognized me nor believed who i was. so i wonder-is not recognizing people more of an issue of timeline confusion? if one thinks it’s 1960, it makes sense that they wouldn’t recognize their now much-older spouse in that moment. i imagine it’s different for each person with dementia. but i wonder if anyone has experienced similar."," i am 64 and was visiting my mom who has dementia today (at her memory care, along with my 90-year old dad who is fine). they've been married 66 years. suddenly mom asked dad, ""what about our children?"" he looked at me and i said, ""well, i'm your daughter, and i'm right here. and we are going to call my brother, your son, in a few minutes. my sister is in arizona."" ""how old is she,"" asked mom. i said, ""she's 60."" mom looked confused and said, ""i was thinking 3 years old.""so i just said that when my sis was 3 and i was 6 and my brother was 7, we had lots of fun. i reminded her of those good times and assured her that we had all grown up and were well and happy. switching the sad fact of her memory loss to focus on good childhood times seemed to cheer her up, and my dad too. i know mom's condition is lots harder on him than on me.

"hey all! coming at you from a few weeks ago (i never responded, and i'm sorry. sometimes i really just need to rant.)i'm feeling a little more refreshed as a caretaker lately, but with that comes the realization that i'm often the ""translator"" for the behaviors my mom exhibits, and the would-be problem solver. currently we're experiencing many, many issues regarding the use of the bathroom with my mom. i'll briefly outline the problems here. bear with me please, as this is a.. complicated issue with many different aspects:a. she uses the bathroom frequently. she likely goes 20-30 times in the span of 24 hours. she was checked for a uti a few months ago, but have been pressuring my dad to get her checked again. i have explained to him before that uti's are *common* and that we need to check for them regularly.b. she uses *a lot* of toilet paper at once. absolutely way more than necessary. as a family of three, we were having to buy about 24 rolls *a week*. my dad's solution was to give us each our own roll of toilet paper to use, and then hide the rest of it. naturally, this has not had the intended effect he wanted. it just results in my mom wandering, not wiping, and obsessing over finding toilet paper. it's also frustrating really needing to go pee, only to remember i left my roll back in my room.c. she obsesses over the possibility of an accident occurring. as a result, part of her frequent bathroom trips are due to anxiety. she stuffs washcloths and extra toilet paper into her underwear to ""avoid"" accidents, and has been caught wearing as many as three pairs of underwear at once. sadly, many pairs of my own underwear have been lost...d. the toilet paper that she stuffs in her underwear? she ends up using that. she will then pull her underwear back up with it still in there. sometimes she puts it in the toilet, sometimes she doesn't. either way, she's walking around with soiled toilet paper in her underwear, or worse - having it break down and get stuck. i have tried to attack the problem head on and get her to take it out many times a day, i have told my dad he needs to get her to take it out, but the other shoe has yet to drop. while my mom continues to deteriorate and do just about everything incorrectly or unsafely, she retains her insane level of stubborn and irrational anger when i attempt to get her to be clean and/or safe.i know it's not ""her"", but i don't know what to do. i've tried being kindly, i've tried being direct and firm, i've tried doing the whole ""ready to change your underwear?"" shtick, and nothing works. i can only reasonably get through to her when she's mildly confused, and it does not take long for her anger and hatred for me to resurface.e. she's wiping back to front. i recently realized this because she has suddenly become more comfortable with asking me to be in the bathroom with her if we're not at home. these infrequent trips tends to be the *only* time i can get her to be clean and safe.f. she's leaving pee all over the toilet seat, and she refuses to use the bathroom in her own bedroom. as a result, i'm consistently forced to wait for her to get out of the front bathroom, or walk into their (parents) bedroom at night to use *their* bathroom. i'm currently stressing over a possible bladder infection for me, and when i need to go, i want to go. i'm sick of waiting for her to get out of the bathroom and then being grossed out as i clean the urine off of the seat. *i don't sit on my own toilet seat in my own home anymore.* i've been squatting over it for months. what on earth do we do? we've tried depends but getting her to wear them consistently is a problem, and my dad relies on me to remind him of us being out of *anything*: toilet paper, specific foods, paper towels, diapers, cat and dog food, etc. i do a good job, but sometimes i slip up. i feel we're at the point where she needs someone to supervise her using the restroom every time, but how do you break that barrier when she's often so incredibly resentful and resistant to even gentle explanations and help? she hates wet wipes (she doesn't like being wet anymore, which is what makes her insistence on having wet toilet paper in her underwear so ironic) so i can't even get her to use those for cleaner wiping. i'm at my end. i keep telling my dad we've got to do something, we have to tackle this, we have to watch her, but nothing changes. i end up being the bad guy at 3 in the morning when i'm losing out on sleep shepherding her back into her bedroom as she wanders and goes to the bathroom 5 times in 10 minutes. my dad sleeps like a frigging log.help? thanks for reading this gigantic beast..."," okay i'm going to address these things a little out of order but in the order i see relevant to finding a solution. so your mom doesn't like wet wipes but keeps wet toilet paper in her underwear. have you ever done a psychedelic and lost the ability to distinguish between senses? it is common to not be able to distinguish the difference between something that is wet, something that is cold, even different textures and things that are generally suggestible. perhaps calling them something other than wet wipes would be helpful but the real solution is to address her apparent synesthesia and confusion. the only time she lets you help her is when she's confused. that's not exactly true because she's technically confused all the time. the solution to this would be the suggestion. if you can control the suggestibility of the things she's experiencing then you can control her reaction. of course this is easier said than done as she is going to be skeptical of you because you are her child. this is why i sometimes bringing in an unrelated third-party can be so helpful. think of them as her spirit guide. caretakers are fabulous with this but also if you have not got the resources for this another family member could help. the other option is to of course ignore her wishes and sacrifice that temporary anger and hatred she's going to feel for her long-term health and happiness. my grandmother is small and weak and if we absolutely need her to do something such as sit down on the toilet or clean herself we can accomplish it. i just simply picking her up or doing it ourselves. of course she hates it but she forgets that and then feels much better. her constant annoyance and obsessiveness with the bathroom is of course indicative of a larger problem i would guess a uti or a yeast infection. she won't know what it is exactly that's causing her discomfort because she can't distinguish between the different sensations but the fact that it is always on her mind is a definite indicator that she is experiencing discomfort in that area. getting her to a doctor would be helpful so that you can treat the root of the problem.some people have suggested that it could be even a kidney infection this can happen very quickly. she could have developed this in the course of as little as two weeks so i would highly recommend getting her the help she needs for that first. after care will involve getting her to wear the depends and use the wet wipes regularly. if she's able to, taking baths are also very helpful. i wish you luck and i hope this helps feel free to p.m. me if you have any other questions",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/beqewr/bathroom_hygiene_issues_w_mom/,Bathroom Hygiene Issues /W Mom

"this is going to be a long post, so i apologize in advance for the typos and/ or rambling.my mother was diagnosed with encephalopathy (dementia) four years ago. she is now 64. she was also a raging alcoholic her entire adult life. the only time she wasn’t drunk was when she had pregnant with myself and my brother. it is thought that her alcoholism may be the cause (allegedly) for her dementia. my uncle (her brother) had a similar diagnosis... and it was ultimately his demise. my entire family (both sides) is filled with alcoholics/ drug addicts and i somehow turned out normal. when my mother initially became ill, she was trying to sober up on her own without medical assistance due to the death of her brother. i’ve always thought that her seeing him in the coffin was what ultimately tipped her over the edge of no return. she wound up being hospitalized and almost dying due to how frail her body was. she went through the “wet brain” phase of sobering up and it was thought that maybe the damage was reversible. it wasn’t. she was diagnosed with dementia officially about 2 months after her hospitalization. so, being the person i am, i took over everything. i became her poa, handled her affairs, etc. i was 25 when this happened. i literally had to grow up in a matter of hours and i’m still angry with the world about it.she has always been a kind person with a big heart. but, when that alcohol hit... she was something else. this lead to us having a major falling out prior to her getting ill. i spoke to her maybe once every two weeks. and that was solely so i could make sure she wasn’t dead in a ditch somewhere from drinking and driving. my brother is as reliable as a football bat, so i couldn’t count on him to keep my updated. we still barely speak to this day. we just don’t get along and i try not to keep his negative energy in my life/ space. i am now losing my effing mind. my boyfriend (he’s an effing saint) has been with me before and during this whooooole process. the man has done her laundry when i was sick, brought her food, helped mail paperwork, etc. he shouldn’t have to do this, and i feel like sometimes i shouldn’t have to. i’ve never gotten the closure or apology i was holding out for for all those years. and now i’ll never get it. ever. and i’m just tired. i’m exhausted from being constantly stressed and worrying. she is in an ltc. which is probably the best decision i made for her. but now i can hardly bring myself to see her. it kills me every time. i get this surge of emotions in a matter of seconds and it’s getting harder and harder to ignore it. i just don’t know what to do anymore. i find myself crying randomly during the day when i think about her/ the situation. i get irritated with her when i know she can’t help it. sometimes i wish she would just pass away peacefully in her sleep so she could be out of her misery. and so i can be out of mine. i’ve put my entire life/ plans on hold for her and i’m just done. i don’t know what to think or how to act and i feel like i’m the crazy person even saying this stuff. any advice would be appreciated. if clarification is needed let me know. i’m just a mess and i don’t even know how to function anymore."," this is what i saw when my dad lost his mom. they didn't have a great relationship, but he really mourned when she died because then there was no hope of a better relationship. so even though your mother hasn't died, you're mourning that there is no hope of an apology or a better relationship. and that's okay. it's okay to be furious and sad that what you wanted for her and for you and for your relationship with each other is never going to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/beg4bt/just_effing_exhausted/,Just Effing Exhausted

"my mother is 82  and lives in her home with my brother and sister in england. as yet we don't have a definite diagnosis of dementia, but with a spell in hospital earlier this year and back and forth trips every week to our gp, all the medical professionals we have dealt with have basically said she's showing all the signs. we are awaiting the date for her head scans after we had a visit from the memory clinic. my brother and sister have never left home so they will continue to live there and be her primary care givers. her biggest issues are confusion and anxiety. i offer to take her out or to bring her to my house for tea and spend time with the grand children and she'll get really anxious and not wanting to go anywhere which is a complete opposite of how she was this time last year. is the anxiety a part of the dementia or is it because she's aware she's not herself?the other things i'm worried about is my brother and sisters legal rights, my mother owns her own home and all though my sister is adamant that she will do everything for our mother what if a time comes where she can't and she needs to go into a home. i've heard horror stories about homes being sold to cover the cost of care by the government. is there any legal steps we can take now to prevent any major shocks and upheavals in the the future? i've got a 1000 other questions but until there is definite diagnosis i'm holding out hope. thank you for reading"," my mother has severe anxiety with her dementia - we think it's related to her not knowing what to do - or not understanding the plot of a show, or not understanding the conversation between two other people in the room: that will trigger the anxiety attack.  it's like what's wrong w/ me spiral?  she actually has described ""deja vu"" or even an disassociation/depersonalization.  she says it's not describable.    i've been reading that disassociation is a brain defense mechanism against severe anxiety.so i don't think it's directly related to the disease, but a result of the losses she is experiencing.  we have had some success with lorazapam when it comes over her. for us, she has been slipping for a while, and like you her world is getting smaller.  like 2 years ago, she didn't want her sister to visit - that was so strange, but now looking back, her world has needed to get smaller and smaller for her to manage.  best to you",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/be6pvj/help_im_new_to_this/,"Help, I'm new to this"

"hi everyone,my mother-in-law is not diagnosed with dementia currently, but we believe she is in the early stages. she won’t seek help to determine whether she has dementia, but that’s another story. i’ve done work in skilled nursing facilities and have hands on experience with certain aspects of dementia. a lot of the behaviors my mother-in-law has are at least very similar to stage 4 of the 7 stages of dementia.anyway, other than the standard, daily things that are problematic, we are also currently having a lot of issues with my mother-in-law and technology. she has always suffered from anxiety and depression, but lately, all she does is stay at home and move from her bed to the couch and back and spends hours upon hours staring at facebook and texting and calling just about everyone in her phone. she is on her iphone non-stop, and her confusion is making her use of technology problematic.her use of facebook is both a privacy, financial, and safety concern (posting very specific personal information like everywhere she is or specific home addresses and details, and constantly getting hacked and at times even people targeting her for fraud financially), and somewhat damaging to social and professional relationships for herself and her family (she’s posted almost creepy details about friends and they no longer want to speak to her, and has liked pages for the places that family members work at and “accidentally” posts things to those pages...jeopardizing careers at times). we’ve also had issues with her confusing phone contact information, calling people she shouldn’t be calling, calling people 10 times in a row when they’re at work and can’t talk, calling at 3am repeatedly.when we try to calmly discuss any of this, she either shuts down entirely and forgets or screams at us, claims we’re trying to steal her phone, and then forgets. she then immediately goes right back to doing the same things. i know all of this seems minor, but it’s becoming a large problem. i’m also quite certain that it will get worse as time goes on and she declines more. since previous generations with dementia didn’t always use technology to the extent that people do now, i’m having trouble finding resources on how to handle the current problems and how to handle things as she gets worse.does anyone on here have a loved one with dementia who is it was an active user of technology, and how have you handled things when they could no longer manage certain or all aspects of technology as time went on?(this is coming from someone who is usually a big proponent of assistive technology and its ability to help people. i’m out of my element here!)thank you."," i think monitoring what she is doing is best. as long as she doesn't know about it there is no harm. it's probably very important to her that she be given the illusion that she is using technology normally. if she has dementia, she will likely not know the difference. now, if she becomes annoyed or enraged when she does discover the monitoring there is nothing you can do. you are protecting her and care about her and she your mother in law! that said, i know absolutely nothing about this. i would consult a professional who aligns with your mother in laws ethical framework (were she in her correct state of mind of course). i don't know, but i imagine there are many qualified professionals who could provide more help than this thread. you would of course have to be able to access them financially logistically etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bcxxz1/dementia_and_technology/,Dementia and Technology

"so my grandfather has been living in a retirement home for a year due to mobility issues, albeit, a year ago, he was cognitively ‘normal’ and possibly event decent for his age (91).he managed to do pretty well, however, is quite stubborn and took a few very bad falls resulting in hospital stays for a subdural hematoma and probably sustained some brain injury (just an assumption based off the magnitude of the fall). anyways, in return to his retirement home, he began sundowning frequently and this caused a myriad of safety issues (e.g. potential for him to fall), resulting in the home putting him in hospice care for 24/7 monitoring to prevent that.about a month into hospice care, he began abruptly cognitively falling apart. can’t stay awake, thought i was turning 63 on my 22nd birthday, generally looking very ‘distant’ etc. he also began having more belligerent sundowning episodes and fell a handful more times and ultimately the retirement home kicked him out as per him being too much of a liability.fast forward.. we moved him into a retirement home, not hours after the move are we contacted that he assaulted a nurse, and was transported to the local psych ward! anyways, turns out the hospice care had a standing order for morphine, and had been giving him morphine 3-4 times daily for the past few weeks to keep him sedated and prevent his belligerent episodes. so, the doctor told us he was likely suffering withdrawal (no morphine at nursing home) resulting in belligerence, aggression, delusions etc.skipping over some details.. he was released back to the nursing home and it’s been a few days now. he continues to have belligerent episodes though and is consistently deluded (e.g. knows people, places, confused about the context maybe) and paranoid to some extent. we haven’t gotten a formal psych evaluation yet, as the psych ward said he was ‘fine’, however, if these issues continue i’m not sure what we can do. if his aggressive behavior continues, he will be kicked out of his current nursing home. then what? additionally, we can’t afford his care out of pocket and are currently undergoing a legal process to get him on medicaid, which, in my region, can pick up the bill since he’s completely broke. his issues are bottlenecking the process and we can’t afford a single month of his care without it, so.. from a financial perspective we desperately need him to not get kicked out.i’m very stressed at the moment, as i’m a full time student also working a full time co-op, but my father can’t handle all of this sudden responsibility by himself and isn’t available 24/7 for these issues so i’m picking up some of the responsibility myself and it’s very troubling.i feel sandwiched between financial despair, losing a loved one and watching my father lose years of his life to stress and overwork due to his oversight of my grandfather essentially being a second job.if things continue as such, what are our options?", i'm so sorry to hear this. my mom is undergoing a similar battle with her disease now. let me know if you ever found a solution.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bcsp72/belligerent_and_potentially_early_stages_advice/,Belligerent and potentially Early Stages?

"my mom is in her early 70s and has dementia. she is generally confused and anxious at all times and is unable to pay her bills or make sense of her finances. i've set her up with autopay on most of her bills, but i need more control over her finances so that i can start paying for in home care because she has stopped cleaning or bathing and has lost her ability to drive. here's my issue. my mom lives a block away from a wells fargo bank. she visits the bank multiple times per week and has made ""friends"" with the bank tellers. she says they are her friends and that they take care of her and that multiple bankers have keys to her house. she hasn't been on vacation in years and i live 10 minutes away, so i'm not sure why they need keys to her house, but that's just one of many issues.i've looked at her bank statements and she appears to have accounts that she doesn't need, including an equity line of credit. she thinks she got a special deal because they like her so much and thinks it's free money. when i told her that she was paying interest on the money she was using, she didn't believe me and wanted to consult with her friends at the bank before i paid anything off.i have power of attorney, so i went into the bank with my mom and my fiancee to get put on the account and the banker acted really rude and standoffish and seemed to strongly caution my mom against adding me to her account. he asked me to make an appointment the following week with another banker to show her the power of attorney.the next morning, the police showed up at my mom's house and said that wells fargo had sent them to verify her identity and that some kind of fraud was reported. i went to the bank to ask them about what happened. i talked to a different banker and she said that the first banker flagged me as a problem because my fiancee had drawn up the power of attorney paperwork and had asked to be added to my mom's account. neither of those things were true or even implied! the poa was written and signed in 2014, long before i met my fiancee and he never asked to be added to my mom's account. i'm not sure where the banker got that information, but it's possible that my mom was confused and told him that in a previous visit. i had the poa with me when i talked to the second banker, but she told me she couldn't do anything unless my mom was there and agreed to it. this banker said that she is aware that my mom has dementia (because it's clear from talking to her), but she also said that she suggested my mom take money out of her equity line of credit to pay her bills. my mom has enough in social security to pay her bills, so why would she put them on credit? why is the banker making these kind of recommendations to her when she knows my mom has dementia? the banker also said that my mom clearly needs help, so i'm wondering why they are trying to stop me from getting involved? i'm so frustrated and uncomfortable with this whole situation.i guess i'm looking for opinions or advice on this situation. i'm worried that the bankers will try to talk my mom out of adding me to her account before i go back in a couple of days. can i still be added to my mom's account if i have power of attorney if the bankers try to talk her out of it? the poa does grant me access to bank accounts, so i'm not sure why she had to be there for me to get added to the account.if i do get added to the account and decide to close the equity line and unnecessary savings accounts and credit card accounts, can wells fargo report me again? i don't like that it's on record that i've been reported for potential fraud and now i'm paranoid about doing anything with her accounts. it's fine for now, but eventually she will need to go to an assisted living and i'm going to need to be more proactive about her accounts."," i suggest xposting this in /r/personalfinance and /r/legaladvice.it seems quite clear you probably have some official and/or legal avenues to put a **stop** to this.on those subs you're likely to get informed about clear, direct, specific steps you can take to cut these bank employees off at the pass.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/bck6br/bank_question/,Bank Question
"around 2 years ago my mother had an “episode” where she had auditory hallucinations and was confused. her pcp diagnosed her with depression (with psychosis, i assume). she was under tremendous stress because my father died and she was left caring for both his ailing parents who lived to 95 and 100.  anyway, the doc put her on seroquel. i found out a couple of weeks ago that she now has visual as well as auditing hallucinations, and she has never told her doc! she’s still on the starting dose of the med. she never received a full psych evaluation, either. her memory loss seems minor to me, but i live 4 hours away, and i’m sure she masks symptoms when we talk. my question is, does this sound like dementia or is it something more akin to schizophrenia? i’ve never heard of dementia beginning with the hallucinations. nor have i heard of anyone developing schizophrenia in their 70s.

"so for starters, she was sent to a rehab facility due to her fall risk. she was barely walking and when she was admitted to the hospital due to dehydration (she refused food and drink for several days), her doctor thought it good to put her in a rehab center to help her walk. it didn't do anything but worsen her. she wasn't on the floor with the dementia patients and the nurses barely gave a shit. she used to call us to help her to the bathroom and now will not call and messes the bed (she has on depends). she can barely verbalize now; her eating habits are atrocious (eating very little), she doesn't use her hands like she used to and she seems to just sleep a lot. while her verbal skills weren't great and haven't been great for a while now, her lack of talking and trying to do small things for herself (such as holding silverware and glasses) has me stressed and worried. i've accepted that she's likely been in the end stages of dementia for a bit but still. the skills she had have damn near diminished due to a lazy, possibly uninformed staff and realistically, she'll need more care than we can provide. is there anything we can do to bring these skills back? we have a wonderful caretaker for when we're at work/school, but we don't want her to mess up her back and body working with my grandmother. i don't know what to do at this point and i really don't want to have to send her to a nursing home permanently. please help.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/baj91h/grandmother_recently_home_from_a_rehab_facility/,Grandmother recently home from a rehab facility with greatly diminished abilities.

"her condition: my mil has been on a variety of medications for rheumatoid arthritis for well over a decade and she has alcohol abuse problems. that said, even when she has been sober she has shown some major cognitive oddness and has in the past suffered mini strokes. she claims she has had a brain scan and her brain looks normal, but she moved far from all family so none of us have heard this first hand from a doctor. she has instances of lost time about which she becomes defensive. she has outright insulted close friends and family. she makes plans to stay with family, will show up hours (or days) later after not responding to calls.what’s happening now:after living in south carolina for a year and making her entire neighborhood worry about her, she decided she was going to move back to new england (near us and other family). she insisted on driving up. the drive took much longer than expected and she would sometimes not respond to calls or texts. she spent about a week at a hotel during which time she lost a day (would not admit it when asked directly but talked as if this were the case) and showed up at our house uninvited convinced we were hosting diner for her.mil left without telling anyone she was leaving, has been on the road for several days and has made it about 6 hours away. when my husband asked her what she was doing she said she was “taking it slow” and then mentioned a fire, that someone had left a pot on the stove but just said “don’t worry about it” when pressed. she will not respond to my texts. the only information she has given us is that she’s in new jersey. we’re wondering if she’ll ever make it back to her house in sc or what we can do if she does. so that’s a rather brief synopsis. any ideas would be amazing because we feel pretty powerless to help and my husband is constantly expecting the worst."," op, i found this for my state, florida. your mil would qualify because le can make the determination based on info from your husband:*indicators of alzheimer’s disease for law enforcement are generally obtained by asking the caregiver if:missing person has been diagnosed with alzheimer’s disease or related disordermissing person has significant memory lossmissing person has experienced major changes in their ability to make decisions and conduct life affairsmissing person has been prescribed medications for memory problems or alzheimer’s disease*take note - your mil qualifies under number 2 and 3.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/baczsk/mil_possible_vascular_dementia_undiagnosed/,MIL possible vascular dementia (undiagnosed) driving for days and days.

"my grand uncle (my grandmas brother) was diagnosed with dementia a while ago and his condition seems to be getting worse really fast.he hasn’t  talked to his children since his wife died (5ish years ago) and he wasn’t close to them to begin with. my grandma had asked me to spend time with him as he is lonely and she can’t see him very often.he used to babysit me and i genuinely liked him so i agreed but she failed to mention that his dementia is making him act racist!! (for context, he is white and i am half asian) i didn’t know until i showed up. my grandma dropped me off and as soon as she left, he began to berate and insult me. i know it is the dementia and he was never like that before but the things he said were hurtful and i don’t want to go back to visit him. i mentioned this to my grandma (also white) and she doesn’t seem to understand why i’m hurt and told me i’m being selfish for not visiting him.should i just keep visiting him and try to brush off the insults? i don’t even know if he knows who i am. should i ask someone else to visit him. am i being selfish?", bumping up what all others have said. you're definitely not being selfish. definitely not. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b9ilmi/wondering_what_to_do/,Wondering what to do...
"i am an in-home caregiver. client has multiple episodes a day of defiance and verbal agression and it's continuing to escalate. her husband is seriously considering a facility as she is a danger to herself and him, and of course the caregivers. but what happens at a dementia, memory care facility when a patient gets like this? what happens if they bite or kick and hit? is this common? i'm still relatively new to caregiving. this is the worst i've seen it so far. sad and scary. she has lucid moments and is very apologetic...not that that matters in the moment when she's angry and argumentative. thank you"," we use a lot of strategies like redirection, simple attention to and sympathy with their feelings, going outside if the resident isn’t a risk for running off ( a lot of the time residents become agitated and aggressive when they feel trapped in a facility), etc. we evaluate the causes and triggers for the behavior. we use medications as a last resort, and if the behavior becomes imminently dangerous to the resident or to others, we have been forced to call the cops as a last last resort. we are not legally allowed to restrain residents, physically or medically, so the police are a resource for the worst cases of violence and/or aggression. often, once police get involved, the resident would end up in the psych ward of the hospital for a time, then be forced to transfer to a locked dementia unit which is more equipped to handle their needs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b9fxdp/aggression_in_a_facility_what_happens/,Aggression in a facility.

"hi all, first time post here so i’ll keep it brief. my 60 year old mother (who has ftd ppa and has for at least 5 years) just recently began using her tweezers to pluck hair along the natural “part” of her hair (i imagine she was focusing on the gray hairs and got carried away).  in response, we took away the tweezers.  a week later, she took scissors to the same spot, she now has virtually no hair in this 1-1.5 inch gap.  in response, we took every pair of scissors in the house this time. has anyone experienced this?  if so, how did you respond and what type of behavior did you see next?  any other advice we should consider?i always appreciate these communities because you make us think of things that we previously had not.  thank you and stay strong."," my mom has logopenic ppa. she doesn’t do anything to her hair, but she does pick at/scoop up imaginary objects (dad thinks they’re plants or animals that she’s taking care of). nursing staff hasn’t seen anything else like it before.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/b8zmgk/mother_with_ftd_ppa_plucking_cutting_hair/,Mother with FTD PPA plucking / cutting hair

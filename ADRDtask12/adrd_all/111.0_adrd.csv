"my grandma has had a pretty severe decline the last couple of years. i remember back in 2016 my sister and i would visit for sunday dinner every week, and she would cook some of the best food i’ve had to this day. during this time she was known for reusing the same dozen or so stories that she would tell every couple of weeks. we laughed it off as old age, but looking back on it haunts me now that i know it was the beginning of this terrible disease. i moved into my grandma’s last year due to financial troubles and needing to go to school around here. my dad has been living here for years and for some reason did not tell me how bad it’s gotten, and i quickly realized that being here was more beneficial for my gram and dad than it was for myself. her memory is totally shot and she can’t obtain a single piece of information from the day. she can no longer cook for herself. she gets confused about the day of the week, month, and season. she repeats the same statements and questions many times in one sitting. she does the same when it comes to locking up the house. sometimes she doesn’t believe she owns her own house. sometimes she mixes her family up for someone else (my dad as her deceased husband, me as my uncle, my aunt her childhood friend) and sometimes she has no idea who my siblings are (this causes them to shy away and not visit her, it bums me out because i feel like more family visits would lighten things up a bit)some of the things she says leaves me in awe. but from what i’ve read she can also do a lot on her own too, despite being in what seems to be a bad dementia stage. she can still eat for herself, get dressed, use the bathroom herself, do laundry and small menial things like that. she can also read and write (although sloppily)i guess what i’m wondering here is what stage you think my gram might be in, and how much worse it might get. i am really scared of any further decline down the road. she was one of the sharpest people i ever knew, and this is enough to scar me for life. i don’t want it to get worse. i’m also very grateful to have a group i can vent my frustration out to... my family isn’t exactly the best to talk to as none of us are that good at expressing feelings to each other. so thank you", there is a youtube channel called dementia with grace. it’s an incredible resource. short videos and you learn about every stage and how to handle care and different behaviors.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ewgsx0/i_moved_into_my_grandmas_87_what_stage_of/,"I moved into my grandma’s (87), what stage of dementia could she be in and what to expect?"

"my name is scott and sandy is my mother. i was her first child, born 38 years ago. i will always remember my mother as a highly intelligent being, an advocate, and a positive force of energy.over the past 2-3 years, my mother’s personality has changed. she became paranoid, negative, and exhibited odd behaviors. other family members noticed this change, and like me, didn’t know how to approach it. i experienced her walking into a restaurant multiple times and having to sit at different tables before the right one was found. this was subtle, but there was an odd component of entitlement and lack of empathy for the wait staff and other customers we were cutting off. during another interaction 3 years ago, i asked her if she was going to take a trip to belize where a friend of hers had a condo they offered. she had a concerning, nonsensical reply of, “no, because i’ve never been there.” again very subtle, but stuck out as very odd coming from someone so intelligent. while riding in my car, she would be extremely paranoid, exhibiting verbal expressions of fear during very slow driving to accommodate her. over a year ago, she asked me if it would be a good idea to send someone on instagram money to mine bitcoin for her. i was very shocked that she was even considering something that is clearly a scam, but chalked this up to her being naive about technology. looking back on all this, it now makes sense knowing her diagnosis.i think myself and other family members had written off all this previous behavior as a product of getting older or her possible unhappiness. this all changed earlier this year when we learned that she thought she was in a relationship with multiple tom cruises (yes, you read that right) and singer luke bryan, and had been sending money to people all over the world impersonating these celebrities on the internet. it was quite bewildering to be faced with such bizarre circumstances. i initially tried to talk to her to explain how these people aren’t real and how there are hundreds of predatory fake instagram accounts posing as celebrities. this didn’t work, and she pushed myself and other people away who would question her activity.as this narrative unraveled, we learned that she had been sending large amounts of money, including her claim of sending $20,000 to tom cruise that she has claimed is now owed to her. this prompted family members to take her to the emergency room. nothing came out of that visit and her activity with the celebrity impersonators continued despite our efforts to convince her that she was being taken advantage of. we sent her a news article where a lady in michigan was scammed out of $30,000 by a fake tom cruise, and sent a documentary on this exact phenomenon. these attempts didn’t get through to her.we contacted law enforcement multiple times regarding this financial exploitation and nothing could be done because she would have to report it as a crime and she to this day doesn’t believe she has been wronged. we even have the names, addresses, and bank accounts of people she sent money to… law enforcement can’t do anything because she didn’t think it was a crime. she continued to wire money, take pictures of gift cards, and talk to a whole network of alleged criminals posing as celebrities. she maintained that she was going to marry tom cruise in england and she was going to work for an orphanage and live in a mansion with him that she was picking out. she was also claiming to be in a serious relationship with luke bryan, even though she claimed that he hacked her accounts at one point. i have a voicemail of her telling me about this and about how she isn’t going to be on tom’s private jet, but just meet tom in hawaii. during one exchange when i was convincing her not to go on a trip with fake celebrities, she asked me if she could just go with fabio, because she had seen him at a restaurant a couple years ago. i asked why she would think he would go with her and she said it was because they are the same age.in june, she reached out to me for help with her homework for a class that required her to create a web page. i began helping her and asked her to write a paragraph on lavender. she went upstairs and came down with a blank flash drive, and i explained again that i simply needed a paragraph. this repeated 4 times until she finally wrote the paragraph. this was a stark contrast to her career where she wrote letters, agendas, budget documents, and even a book in her spare time.at this point, i finally accepted that whatever she was going through was extremely serious and something i wasn’t qualified for or successful in helping with despite multiple efforts. doing research, i came across the thurston county behavior health crisis line and reached out to see if a designated crisis responder could give advice. after speaking with them, they determined that they would need to detain her. this was in early july.she was released after several days, and nothing beneficial came from this detainment in terms of a diagnosis or plan to keep her safe. she was immediately back and talking with the fake celebrities. i agreed to help her get a new gmail account so they couldn’t get back to contacting her and this was immediately compromised by her emailing the fake celebrities.  myself, friends, and family have tried desperately to help her on so many fronts. we convinced her to get a new phone and that was immediately compromised. she was detained again in late july, and again released with no real outcome. the positive aspect of this second detainment was a visit by a family friend and ex-supervisor, a neurologist coincidentally. he was able to talk to her and assist us in getting her the medical attention needed. he maintained that this was likely dementia, what we had all been fearing.in august of 2019, my mother was taken to see a neurology specialist at virginia mason medical center in seattle. our fears of frontotemporal dementia were confirmed when dr. isenberg diagnosed her and deemed her to require 24/7 supervision and a guardian for financial and medical oversight. her condition appeared to further deteriorate in late august as we learned she was having hallucinations of the celebrities and family members and was contacting us for help when they “wouldn’t wake up”.  in late august my mother drove by herself and showed up at mcmenamin’s kalama harbor lodge and thought that she had driven down in her car with my sister and celebrity singer luke bryan. when she showed up, she asked what room her husband was in, even though he was not there. she also was texting other friends and family and asking them when they were showing up. the front desk staff were severely concerned and kalama police and a local dcr did a welfare check.my mother was detained for a third time in september as she was trying to leave on a fictitious concert tour with tom cruise and luke bryan. she had her passport and bags packed, and the sheriff found her in her vehicle. she was detained for weeks at st. peters hospital in olympia and finally placed in a memory care facility.now that the courts have appointed her a financial guardian, we have learned that the financial devastation is so pervasive that she had let 3 life insurance policies lapse, took on credit card debt, and spent all her resources.  we think the financial devastation might be in excess of $500,000 if you include the lapsed life insurance policies. she is now unable to afford to live in the facility she resides in because like most facilities, they require private pay for 9-24 months until they will just take medicaid, and these places can be up to $6000 per month. and, you can’t apply for medicaid unless your resources are basically gone. so, it’s a very tenuous and unfortunate situation. frontotemporal dementia has caused my mother to become a very vulnerable person with the sensibilities of child. she was exploited by multiple alleged criminals who took the resources she now desperately needs to have appropriate care until this terminal disease takes her life. she is recently fell and broke her arm, as the disease is presenting elements of parkinsonism, beyond the stark cognitive disability.  i hope that you will be able to help even a little, but i also hope this raises awareness about dementia and the rampant financial exploitation that occurs on social media. be vigilant about mental health with your family and friends.thanks for your consideration and help.", coinfirm (aml and blockchain experts) made

"my grandmother has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia though the diagnosis had been a long time coming. i'm hoping for some advice about our family's situation and to see if anyone has been in a similar one. my grandmother has never been what you would call a good person. she was a terrible mother to my mum and aunt, neglectful, spiteful and vicious. my mum left home at 16 and they didn't speak for years, my aunt left the country around the same time and never came back only visiting once every 20 years or so. my mum and my grandmother made a sort of reconciliation when my grandfather (another piece of work) died almost 30 years ago but it's always been a difficult relationship. my grandmother has never been the slightest bit interested in me and so i reacted more or less the same to her when i was growing up.the woman is the embodiment of bitter. she was set to be wealthy but her family disowned her when she married my grandfather. i think it's this that's set her up to be how she is. when she's around family she never has a good word to say about anyone, everything is shit, all of us are useless. she's the most selfish, ignorant, self-centered cow i've ever met in my life. this was all before the dementia. she never wanted much to do with us before it. this changed about two years ago when she started struggling and we all stepped up, because, even though she's an absolute horror, family is family i guess. so, for the past 2 years all of our lives have revolved pretty much solely around her. my mum and dad visit her three times a day, home help comes in twice a day, she has a cleaner, her breakfast and lunch are delivered by meals on wheels and my dad cooks her evening meal. i visit after work and provide lifts to places, took her shopping before she got to frail to go out, and generally try to help. all she does is criticise, even before she really started to decline mentally nothing was good enough. when i visit all i get is either a torrent of abuse (i know this is a symptom but she did this before the dementia), or backhanded snide, bitchiness, she's even nastier to my mum and honestly it takes me all i've got to bite my tongue sometimes and not retort. i hate how she treats my mum especially knowing the history (including some truly horrific things my mum doesn't know i know because my aunt told me). it's getting harder and harder to be empathetic with this woman. tonight's visit she was just gunning for a fight as soon as my mum and i walked in. she's resentful of the fact we both work (she's never worked a day in her life having gone from wealth to choosing to live on benefits instead of working) and started bitching about the fact we never visited during the day and she was sitting ""lost and lonely"" all day (in reality my mum had already been in twice, she had a ""lunch club"" at church, her carers had been in twice, my dad had been in with her dinner). i understand she may have forgotten but honestly sometimes she really is just trying to be a cow and laying on guilt trips - it's been her modus operandi for decades. we've all been trying to just let it slide, never stoop to her level and be as sympathetic as possible but bloody hell it's getting tough.honestly, i'm exhausted, my mum is struggling big time, it's causing a lot of problems between my parents now too because their whole lives revolve around my grandmother, who my dad has always had little patience for anyway because of how she's treated my mum. there's only the three of us dealing with this as all other family live abroad and have nothing to do with her. she's first on the list (allegedly) for getting into a home (at her request) but even this isn't good enough and we should have been ""trying harder"" to get her a place one minute and the next are the world's worst c\*\*ts for not having her live with me or my parents. my parents already have my dad's mum living with them and honestly i just don't want her living in my house. she's dirty, takes pride in not washing, and shits everywhere. again, this has been something she did long before dementia, (like in her 30s she was slovenly and gross as well apparently).if you're still reading, thank you for sticking with me. i've left a lot out because it's long enough as it is, but basically i'd like to know if anyone else has had a family member that has always been awful and now they're duty bound, for lack of a better term, to look after them because of dementia. how did you cope with it?"," my spouse dug through the info to get my mom into a home. mother treated the grandchildren like gold and they do the same for her now. wife dug through the benefits and a home accepted her based on her income and wealth. she has her mind.the first words out of the other grandmother's mouth was ""this grandma's got more to do than baby sit"" and now wonders why her grandchildren only give her a curtesy visit when they took my mom to eat, movies, etc. bad grandmom was a horrible mother to her kids, especially my wife who stood up to her mother for her ""mommy dearest"" punishments. her father traveled for work and never saw all that. his children all loved him and in turn his grandchildren all loved him too. my father loved his grandchildren dearly but died early from cancer. i have early onset dementia (you can tell from my rambling) and i worry my wife is going to take care of me when i can't take care of myself. as has been said, you owe her nothing, especially not the time you spend carrying for her.  she will treat you the same no matter the care she receives.edit : we tried keeping my mother here but she needed care for diabetic wounds and hygiene plus she fell multiple times. wife and i work. the home is 1 mile from us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ewb62p/looking_for_advice_from_anyone_thats_been_in_a/,Looking for advice from anyone that's been in a similar situation
"sorry if this is a long post....my mom's dementia leaves her with pretty much zero short term memory.  approximately 2 months ago she fell and was put in hospital.  my dad has done his best to care for her but he is 85 (mom is 83) and he just can't do it.   she is going to be pannelled and is in a transitional unit in a hospital.  all she wants to do is go home, she doesn't know why she is there (she had broken her shoulder, had an infection, and we found out she has lung cancer).   she consistently thinks she is leaving that day, she thinks she has been fine and doing everything at home (my dad has been doing everything for the last few years including meals, cleaning - all she would do was stay in a chair in her tv room as much as he tried to get her involved and go out).   visiting mom now consists of explaining why she is there (she doesn't have any recollection from minute to minute it seems of what we tell her), where she is, that we are always there (she is so lonely because no one ever visits - she doesn't ever remember anyone visiting her even though my dad is there twice every day and my sister and i try to be there alternating every 2-3 days).   she doesn't remember the people she sees every day at every meal.   i have been trying to do the distracting thing, telling her just gentle basic info that won't upset her (you are almost ready to go home, etc - although she will probably be in a pch) and then talking about the grandkids, family, weather and whatever else,  but it is getting harder and harder to distract her.   we don't know how much time she has left, and it is breaking my heart that all conversations just consist of ""i want to go home? what time is dad picking me up? why am i here?  i don't understand"" etc.   i don't care if she thinks i'm her sister (she does that a lot, and i'm fine with that, i don't even correct her - - if it makes her happy and talking about good memories, i'm all for it) but it is harder to get her on other topics.   also, her comprehension in general seems to be getting worse.     i know that everyone here is dealing with some form of dementia, alzheimers and so forth, and i'm hoping that you can let me know how you deal with a parent or loved one in this situation, and how do you get beyond it emotionally?   i hate myself for saying this, but it makes it so difficult to visit her.  thank you for any advice you can give.", i am going to visit my mother soon - lives the other side of the world though. she was hospitalised before xmas and now is in a care home (against her will). i call her every couple of days and all she says is that it is all a absolute nightmare. she doesn’t think there is anything wrong with her. her short term memory is about 1 minute. it’s going to be a nightmare for me....,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ew9s02/so_hard_to_talk_to_my_mom_because_she_has_no/,So hard to talk to my mom because she has no short term memory and just wants to go home

"im just hoping that there’s maybe someone that can help here. long story short. for one whole year i was sleep deprived, drug-abuse and some severe emotional trauma. i was able to stop doing drugs and get better sleep. after all that, i have had a couple of depersonalization episodes, am always tired, have bad memory, anxiety and feel like i lack certain cognitive capacities. i went to a psychiatrist and she prescribed me adderall which  i find weird (i thought maybe i didn’t explain my symptoms correctly) but decide do give it a shot either way. i try and it makes my anxiety and cognitive incapacities worse. i stop taking it. i decide my brain maybe just needs time to heal (i don’t know obviously). it’s been 9 months. i have never had another dp episode. my anxiety is significantly better. however, my memory still sucks and still feel like i’m missing cognition abilities (for example i was a great speed reader, now it’s hard to concentrate and i have to read things over to understand  them). its also a little hard concentrating on anything. i also get incredibly irritable when i don’t get enough sleep. it feels like there’s a sting on my brain that makes me so angry. however, i’m so relaxed when i get 8+ hours of it. im debating whether to go back to a psychiatrist or whether i should just wait and see if it gets better. it’s been 9 months and it’s gotten somewhat better, but i still feel uncomfortable feeling like i’m lacking some mental capacities. what should i do? thank you for your help."," this is a wall of words, and i know this thread is for dementia, but figured i’d reply to this poster and give them some reassurances... lack of sleep, trauma and drugs for a year? that description isn’t consistent with dementia. people with chronic drug abuse who suddenly quit will sometimes experience a sort of “post substance use disordered syndrome” similar to withdrawal but more chronic and insidious.  not saying this is what you have, but often in people who have chronically abused drugs that involve massive dumps of dopamine, the dopaminergic systems in the brain are disturbed especially in the frontal lobe, and can lead to an almost “acquired adhd”-like picture with poor focus/ inability to sustain attention (like having to re-read the first few paragraphs of an article), forgetfulness of both minor and important things, poor motivation/ follow through of difficult or complex tasks, lack of interest or diminished ability to feel pleasure/joy, disorganized thoughts/speech/planning.  and like with adhd, less than 8-10 hours of sleep can lead to irritability/anxiety and a worsening of these “dysexecutive” symptoms.  additionally, trauma in it of itself can present like adhd.  insomnia in isolation, especially if chronic (like in sleep apnea) can also manifest like adhd, dissociation, and so on.the depersonalization may be implicit in the effect substance abuse can have on neuronal systems involved with the ptsd centers of the brain - amygdala (fear), thalamus(control), and hippocampus(memory).  dissociations are common in ptsd and drugs can tap into those systems, especially if already pre-primed in someone with established ptsd/trauma.   all in all, you have 3 powerful brain irritants with similar side effects , and thus it makes sense why you were given adderall - you came across as having a frontal lobe hypodopaminergic presentation thus being prescribed something that increases frontal dopamine. ultimately, giving your brain time to heal is the best course, even if months, years.  usually stimulants are offered after a year of sobriety as it usually takes 6 months to reach the bear minimum in terms of neuronal “healing” after chronic substance abuse, and 1 -2 years for the brain to be healed enough to best discern any damage that is more long term and thus would need more powerful psychotropic help (tbi takes 2 years and then decades after for chronic healing; and the inverse, a new born takes 1 year for its brain to learn 2 word sentences - our brains are slow, even at their fastest).  additionally, get sleep, exercise esp when doing boring work/reading (great adhd hack),  eat for your brain’s health, healthy lifestyle patterns.  if you need to see someone, here are some options: maybe see a neurologist, nutritionist, chemical dependency specialized psychiatrist. if confused or overwhelmed by all of this, a neuropsychologist as your first stop, who can do testing and possibly offer cognitive training and who can give recommendations on further consultations. parallel to this, wouldn’t hurt getting a therapist to help give you support through this period and therapy is the gold standard treatment for ptsd/trauma.  getting sober was the best thing you could do, and staying sober is a must for effective healing and effective treatment of your trauma (a doped up brain can’t learn anything thus prevents the brain from learning how to not be afraid of the trauma, and thus the trauma continues to dominate the brain’s motivations unabated).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/evjzl9/how_can_i_find_good_psychiatrist_i_dont_know_how/,How can I find good psychiatrist?

"my grandpa just got diagnosed with dementia. problem is— he likes to gamble. he’s always been good at it, but the casino is over in cincinnati and he lives in a town near the kentucky border. so that’s a problem in it of itself.obviously we can’t explain to him. hes not aware of the dementia. what’s the phrase for that phenomenon? i can’t remember.i’m scared for the future. my grandma has cancer so soon it’ll get worse. a couple months ago he came crying to her at four am because he couldn’t figure out how to make coffee. they’ve had the same coffee maker for years. and he doesn’t usually wake up until 8 o’clock. so grandma has a fight with him because she’s tired from chemo.i’m only fifteen but i’ve been researching and researching, watching teepa snow videos and trying to prepare. mom works too much so she can only get down on weekends. both grandparents are strictly against going into a home. my mom says they’re richer than they let on but both of them lived through the butt of the great depression so i doubt they’ll want some live in services.pawpaw is early in the disease but if he can’t make a pot of coffee i doubt he should be driving (or gambling. what if he gets cheated at the casino?)what can i do?"," the best thing you and your family can do is to educate yourself on his illness. alz.org is a great website to check out. google the ""10 absolutes"" for tips on how to better communicate with him. make sure he is linked with a geriatrician who can help provide you and your family with support and resources throughout his disease process. dementia is a progressive disease and it helps to have a good understanding of his illness because it will unfortunately continue to get worse. best luck to you and your family!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eve3kv/pawpaw_just_got_diagnosed/,Pawpaw just got diagnosed.

"my grandmother is in the early stages of dementia.  she isn't that bad on a day to day basis.  she'll repeat something in a conversation once or twice, misplaces things, has trouble judging time (as in if something happened a month ago or a year ago and vice versa).  she normally gets a lot worse in group situations.  she's had anxiety issues her entire life, and she can be twice as bad as normal when her anxiety is up and she's stressed, like in big groups at family gatherings.  today though, despite being under a ton of stress and anxiety, it was like having a conversation with her 10 years ago.  last night my grandfather was admitted to the er with sudden heart issues.  he went to see his doctor for shortness of breath and his heartbeat was incredibly high.  his leg was also swollen.  he's in the hospital undergoing a ton of tests.  they think he might have blood clots in his leg, possibly has afib, they're really not sure yet.  my grandmother is completely on top of things though.  she is worried and upset, but being with her this morning i was amazed.  she remembers exactly everything my grandfather has told her and the doctors have told her.  she brought up how she felt like something might have been wrong going back six months.  things he's said, things he's stopped doing, etc.  she's listing them all of with dates and times that all add up, mad at herself she didn't talk to him about them at those times and push him to let his doctor know....all the while she's packing clothes for him, making herself tea, taking her medications (which she is normally confused about and my grandfather has to help her with)....i check in on my grandparents every single morning, and i probably haven't seen my grandmother like this in over five years.  it reminds me of how the body reacts physically from adrenaline in emergency situations.  obviously this is temporary, but has anyone seen something similar with a family member?    any studies on this?", yes!  my dad has been really ill with sepsis and my mom has been almost back to normal while dealing with this!  it's confusing and wonderful and horrible all at once.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ev6h4d/did_you_ever_notice_an_increase_in_cognition/,Did You Ever Notice An Increase in Cognition During Serious/Emergency Situations With a Person Suffering From Early Stages of Dementia?

"what are some early examples of symptoms of mild cognitive impairment?  i have a friend who is 65 years old who frequently becomes confused about who sent what text (thinks i sent a text when i didn't), especially in group chats, or seems to miss texts that i sent her, though she will send me very long and well written texts about art, music, literature, etc.  she also had no recollection of a couple of conversations we had a couple days prior based on questions she asked me, and when i pointed this out to her, because i was a little concerned, she became somewhat defensive and later said she did remember these conversations.  there are other little things, like misplacing things, like a ring that meant a lot to her and a very expensive and special pair of eyeglasses (spefically made for her particular vision problem), which she had placed in between the seat cushion and armrest of a chair at a concert we were at, and we spent a lot of time looking for them on the floor, under the seats, inside her bag, inside her coat, etc..   not sure if this is normal. she also suffered a traumatic brain injury about 20 years ago.   but she said she was tested for dementia last year and she doesn't have dementia and still works a job which is very client-driven and where she has to solve a lot of complex problems.  she lives by herself (no kids) and is very independent, can take of herself no problem, but i'm wondering if these are little signs.  she also got very angry at me recently for the first time ever because she wanted to meet at a cafe, but i discovered it was closed and so texted her that and tried to find another place, but she arrived late and said i should have called instead of texted.  i suppose i should have called given her history of sometimes missing texts, but she texts me frequently and texting is how i usually communicate with people.  her anger though seemed out of character and i was taken aback by it.   also when we meet up she frequently says she feels ""disoriented"" because she's exhausted from the work week and has to lie down.  she's also chronically late, like at least 30 minutes late about 80% of the time, even though i don't think she means to be rude, and then will text me like 2 minutes we're suppoed to meet saying she will be late.    perhaps this is all within the realm of normal and i'm over analyzing things?  she basically told me that she is fine, her friend who is a doctor (though not a neurologist) told her she was fine, and she is not interested in hanging out with me if i bring up anything about potential cognitive or brain issues again.  any thoughts appreciated!", op there was a post recently about early signs of fronto temporal dementia that you might find interesting: ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/euy3xf/very_early_signs_of_mild_cognitive_impairment/,Very early signs of mild cognitive impairment?

"my father has always been an extremely capable man; he has always done his own (major and minor) building work, plumbing, electrical work, car maintenance, you name it. a few years ago, he was diagnosed with dementia. in general, he's still pretty good, but it's starting to take a real toll on his concentration and reasoning abilities. unfortunately, he's still trying to do complex diy projects (think electrical wiring and heating), and i'm seriously worried that he's going to do something dangerous due to his lack of concentration or otherwise. my parents have been without electricity for days at a time, due to him wiring something up wrong. at the time it was clear to me that he'd got no idea what was wrong, and that he doesn't have the capacity to think through the problem logically.the impossible part with this is that my father won't accept that his reasoning ability is deteriorated; he thinks that he is still capable of doing the work, and that it just takes him longer than it used to; this is definitely not the case, if you try talking to him about it it's clear that it's all jumbled in his head.if i or my mother suggest getting professionals (e.g. electrician, heating engineers) in to help, he gets very angry (and is extremely stubborn; people have said that we just need to ""lay down the law"", there's an approximately 0% chance of that working). i can sometimes reason with him and get him to agree to some things, but it's equally likely that he'll change his mind later on and just refuse. unfortunately i think a lot of it comes down to personality; the same ""i can do anything i set my mind to, never give up"" attitude that made him so incredibly capable previously, have made it seem like getting outside help is ""giving up"", and he's totally set against it.we've tried diverting him away towards other jobs that don't require as much concentration (he was quite happy in the summer making a fruit cage to keep the birds off the raspberries). however, there are a few things at my parent's place that really need fixing, and we can't seem to get him to agree to accept outside help.does anyone else have any experience with something like this? we're going to try getting his doctor onside as a sort of appeal to authority, but she's been reluctant to tell him what he can and can't do.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eurz96/how_to_deal_with_a_parent_who_wont_accept_that/,How to deal with a parent who won't accept that their reasoning ability is impaired?

"apologies in advance for the length of this post.my mother has been diagnosed with cognitive impairment likely due to alzheimer's and is somewhere between stages 5 and 6. we are not yet experiencing incontinence but she is asking for her deceased mother, is incredibly unstable on her feet, has absolutely no short term memory and requires 24/7 supervision - which my father is providing for her. her cognitive abilities still test fairly high, but anxiety and no memory impede most productive conversations or processes.we are very fortunate that they own two houses in a high cost of living area, however they need to downsize out of the larger, 2 story house into the smaller 1 story house. originally, we had planned to move my mother to memory care at the same time we moved my father to the smaller house, however we have since discovered that we will need to sell the larger house before placing her in memory care due to financial reasons.her care team has let us know that she should not participate in the moving process in any way as it would be too overwhelming for her and she impedes us making any progress if we include her in any decision making. she will be confused and angry to not be involved in the move. she would also become enraged if she knew my husband and i were doing the actual coordination and work of moving them. she will be angry that “she did not know they had to move” and furious that “someone else will be moving things for them” because “she’s not an invalid and can handle her own affairs” - i’m sure you all are familiar with this.the plan is currently for my father and her to go stay in a hotel for a week while my husband and i move them from one house to the other and fully set their new home up for them. our big question marks are two fold:1) how should we tell her about all of this? our fear is that she will just simply refuse to pack and go along with it.2) how does my father handle her for the full week while she will be constantly confused and constantly wanting to go look at the houses during the moving process?my father is already worn out, we all are, and we’re concerned about adding more pressure to the already difficult situation. if there’s something i’m not thinking of here, or any tricks that others have learned by navigating something similar, i would be so very grateful for the advice.big thank you"," i had posted earlier but deleted my post because, after re-reading it, i didn't think it was very helpful. i hope this is better...i'm so sorry you're in such a difficult situation. your first plan sounds like, if doable, it would probably be easier on everyone (which is why, obviously, it was your first plan). i'm just wondering if it would be possible to get either a home equity line of credit or a reverse mortgage on the big house to raise the money needed for the memory care facility. then you could sell the house after your mother and father have moved. of course, if the seller's market isn't great in your area, that might be a risky move, depending on your family's financial situation. just a thought.if you've already looked into that and it's not possible, my thought would be to wait to tell your mother until the very last minute, if not the moment when you actually bring her to the smaller house. she will be angry no matter what. but it would make the time in the hotel easier if she thinks it's just a vacation.my experience in a somewhat similar experience is this...after my mother was in the hospital and then rehab for five weeks total following a seizure, we took her straight to assisted living, and she did not like that at all! she ""agreed"" to the move when we told her a week before she was able to leave rehab, but we don't think she really understood what she agreed to because she was still not nearly all there. in retrospect, i think we should have waited to tell her because she worried about the move a lot during that last week.understandably, once we got her to the new place, there was a lot of ""i want to go home!"" and ""i want my car!"", and ""why did you do this to me?"" etc, etc. it was heartbreaking, and my brothers and i questioned our decision many times. but over the course of about four months, she gradually accepted the situation and is making the best of it. she understands now that the move was necessary to keep her safe, and we only did what we did out of love.  and she often tells me how beautiful her new place is and how nice the people are.i agree with your care team that it's best if your mom is not involved in the move. it seems cruel, and i thought that way at first. but i know now that in our case, there was no way we could have made the move if our mom had been involved. we ended up hiring a moving company that specializes in senior downsizing moves. they looked at the old place and the new place, helped us decide what furniture, decor, kitchen gear, etc., would fit, drew up a new floorplan, packed up everything that was to be moved, moved it to the new place, and had the new place put together perfectly down to the last picture frame in just two days. the cost was about $4000 (palm beach, fl area) for a two-bedroom home. well worth it!the house just sold after about three months on the market (big sigh of relief!), so things are finally calming down.  when we started on this journey, it was so overwhelming and we had no idea what to do. but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel now, and i hope you and your family will soon, too! best wishes to you all!\*edit - spelling",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/euazgu/moving_households_with_an_alzheimers_patient/,Moving Households with an Alzheimer's Patient

"my dad and two of my aunts met with a company who sends out caregivers to check on elderly people with dementia and carter to their needs. someone from our church recommended this company, but for some reason i feel uneasy about it for two reasons.for one thing, grandpa who has dementia does not like welcoming new people in his house and he can get verbally abusive for no reason, but he would feel provoked by something. another is that i've read about elder abuse cases, mostly involving psychical or emotionally abuse on an elderly individual. in several cases, families were concerned of their elderly loved one because their behavior has changed when someone new comes into the picture. they did set up hidden cameras and discovered horrendous abuse at the hands of the caregivers. the caregivers, on the other hand, try to twist the situation by saying the elder individual did something bad. one case i'll never forget is that an elderly woman was treated in an assisted living and her caregiver was all cheerful when the woman's family came to visit. however, once the family left, the hidden camera showed the caregiver shouting all sorts of abuses at this poor woman, who didn't have the function to talk or defend herself, and the caregiver slaps her in face. the family looked over the footage and sued the facility, but the caregiver was never fired. instead, she was relocated in a different part of the facility. even though my grandpa is a former navy sailor, i don't think he would have the capability to defend himself because he is so fragile and needs assistant to help him stand and walk. should i put my trust in someone's recommendation of this company? or should i express my concern about the possibility of grandpa suffering from abuse by someone we put our trust in?"," i agree with the four comments so far. i'm in the u.s., but my experience with my parents'  (my dad had cancer and my mom has dementia) caregivers has been very, very good. we let go a few caregivers who didn't proactively help, but we never had any real problems with anyone. but we now have a great team. super caring people whom we know we can trust.having said that, my mother-in-law used to run a home health care agency and she has told us some stories about neglect and stealing (she fired those people). but my personal experience has been very good.my advice is to tell the agency your concerns and if you feel comfortable with their reaction,  give them a chance, but watch over things (and make changes if necessary) until you feel sure you have a caring team.best wishes to you and your grandpa!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eslt9y/hiring_a_caregiver/,Hiring a caregiver?

"i am the only support for my 77 yo widowed mother who has moderate dementia.  she is in assisted living (not memory care yet) but lives 10 hours away from me.  she has a handful of local friends and relatives but all are even older than her and have their own medical issues.  none can help in any way other than occasional social interaction.  this means i am attempting to manage all things including finances, legal, medical, etc...., for her from afar.  while i love her, we have never been close.  there is no bad blood, we are just very different people and she has ""disapproved of my lifestyle"" ever since i became an adult and left home 27 years ago.  until i was alerted by her panicking financial advisor that she was nearly broke 1.5 years ago, i had very little involvement with her life....which suited both of us just fine.  we perhaps talked on the phone once every 6 weeks or so and i would visit for 2-3 days once a year.  she has never had any interest in her grandchildren and could not have said what my husband or i do for a living at any point in my adult life.  after the alert from the financial advisor, i uncovered all kinds of ways mom was no longer able to manage herself, including runaway type ii diabetes, months of backed rent, driving without car insurance, pets that were in dire need of medical attention, hoarding, improperly managed meds, bounced checks and late fees all over the place, etc.... that she was unable to manage due to poor cognitive functioning.  so, a lot has happened in the last year.  i finally have a handle on most things financial/legal/medical.  now i am grappling with some secondary issues.  the most pressing being her anger towards me.  i could use some tips on how to ""enter her world"" when she is agitated on the phone.at least once a week and sometimes multiple times a day, she will call me (or my husband) about one very specific topic.  she only calls either of us when she is upset about this.  but even when i call her, the conversation often goes to this topic immediately:  ""everyone thinks i am too stupid to manage my own (fill in the blank here...finances, medical appointments, meds, meals, etc.....).""  she will go on to insist that she was managing just fine until i stepped in and that my involvement is unnecessary (not true). that she never agreed to my involvement (not true, she had the dpoa drafted without my knowledge).  that i am not managing her affairs properly (she believes this to be true because she accidentally reprograms her tv and then thinks i failed to pay the cable bill).  sometimes she will rant elaborate stories about how she selected and moved to her facility all on her own (not even a little bit true) so there is no reason for me to be involved.  she worries i am going to come take her car next (that is true but we have never discussed it).  she feels she is being treated very poorly and tells me she certainly hopes my child does not treat me this way in the future or hopes i am not treating mil this way.  once we are there, i cannot get in a single word.  i never react with anger....but even if i was inclined to, i simply cannot get a single word in anyway.  she gets more and more upset until she either hangs up on me or tells me she hates me and then hangs up on me.  these rants typically go on for 10-20 minutes non-stop.  once it was so bad and vicious that the director of the facility overheard and called me after she hung up to try and console me.  this has been going on for about 9 months.  i try not to take it personally but it does upset me....taking care of her affairs has created so much anxiety that it has (temporarily, i hope) wrecked my life....so getting this abuse on top of that is a hard pill to swallow even if i know it is the illness talking.  and obviously, she is upset too.  and from a  practical standpoint, i cannot get or give any information during calls when this happens.  i am her dpoa but not her guardian so she can and does still make many of her own decisions....which often requires communication between us.my sister, who lives even further away reports that mom rants these same things (about me) to her too.  mom does not get upset with/at my sister.  they have always had a much closer relationship and my sister is not the one doing any of these things.  so at least mom has one ""safe"" loved one to talk to.  i have started letting all of mom's calls go to vm and i don't call back aside from the very rare times there is a legit reason for the call.  but i still need to be able to call her to get business done and to check in.  any ideas on how to redirect or ""enter her world"" to set a new call in the right direction?  there are countless other things that upset her but they are far easier for me to empathize and redirect.  but since these are really about me, or more specifically my involvement in her life, i am at a loss."," you need to call her doctor’s office and ask for him to call you back.  when he calls, have an attitude and insist that she be put on medication right away. the doctor will keep putting it off until you call him on it.  my dad’s doctor did the same thing.  good luck hun.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/esgk15/help_with_entering_their_world/,"Help with ""entering their world"""

that sounds like a cold! we should go to the doc and get you checked out! can't be too careful!"" you are well within your rights to reach out to the doc ahead of time to privately express your concerns.about your mil fussing over your son, i'm afraid i don't have a whole lot of advice to offer. although less distressing, my mum did something similar with my dog. she was always concerned that he was hungry, or needed out, or was sick, and so on. she could never be convinced that he was fine. (top tip: you *can't* convince a person who has dementia...) the best we managed was to learn her patterns of wanting to help (after all, her concern was always genuine and came from a good place) and then try to include her in that activity. for instance, we would give her a bowl of his kibble and ask her to feed him; she turned it into a game and would spend twenty minutes tossing him the kibble one at a time. (we'd keep a bit of kibble back from his meals so she could feed him snacks if she decided he was starving in between meals.) or, if she thought he needed a walk, we'd all go together around the block. including her in his care built up a sense for her that she was helping and was capable, and i think that was important for her. when we couldn't accommodate her urgent sense of his needs, we'd divert like crazy. she: ""he needs to go for a walk!"" me: ""you like going for walks, don't you? what's the best park for a nice stroll in town, do you think? husband and i went to a park once that had a big dog fountain in it! maybe we can all go there one day!"" depending on your mil's progression, it shouldn't take too too long to get her onto a different subject. oof. that's a wall of text. hang in there, and keep reaching out here (if it helps) and in your own community. a friend of my mum's once gave me the reassuring counsel that you aren't on this road alone. made me feel better, and i hope it does for you too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/erosda/help_me_here_dementia_mil_obsessed_with_grandkid/,[deleted by user]
"i'm in australia, my folks are back in england. i'm almost 50, and the youngest of 4 siblings, all of whom are still in the uk. mum has dementia and so i know i won't see her in person again, but we keep in touch a few times a month using messenger video chat. over the past few months i realised that my mum was beginning to not recognise me, and when they called yesterday (my dad is still alive, and is her carer and official phone dialler) it finally clicked for me that i'm just a face on a screen. mum can't hold a conversation now, her words are jumbled and i honestly think it's becoming confusing for her to talk to a video face. we were never close as a family and a lot of stuff goes unspoken, consequently the d word is never directly brought up in conversations between me and my dad. he has never outright admitted that she is in decline to me, and likes to keep the calls short, cheerful, and tries to protect me from the reality of their lives. but every time he calls (he won't pick up if i call them first) he handballs the phone to my mum and gives her a few minutes chat with me.he always calls early morning uk time, so beyond really saying hi mum, and asking how she is today, there's just no conversation. i tell her my news, easy mundane things like birds in the garden, my roses flourishing, nice pleasant easy stuff. i don't talk about my husband or son because i'm sure she's forgotten they exist. i can't ask her what she's been up to, or her plans for the day, because she is just living in the moment, and i think a bit flummoxed as to why video face is talking to her at all. it throws her off. so then it just becomes super awkward and she starts patting her hair and wanting to gtfo and i honestly can't blame her. i don't know whether i'm asking for insights on how to keep conversing, or whether it's time i spoke with my dad and quietly fade into the background. he seems so hellbent on pretending to me that everything is fine. when things have happened in the past, they don't tell me because they don't want me to worry (eg. when my uncle died i found out on facebook ffs).sorry for waffling, and sorry this post is a jumbled mess. it's good to get it out. thanks for listening, and i hope you and your loved ones are having a good day.", i’d ask dad what he wants and needs and what’s best for him,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ero8l9/can_anybody_help_me_with_tips_on_long_distance/,Can anybody help me with tips on long distance communication?

"my grandfather passed about 8 years ago now after a slow decline through my childhood-teen years. he had dementia and parkinson's, and to be honest i never really knew him as the person he was before his disease. he always just kind of seemed out of it most times i saw him. as the disease progressed he lived with my family for a bit and then we eventually had to put him in a care facility. i knew it was difficult on my dad but since i never really knew him before the diagnosis it wasn't as rough for me. i think the hardest part for me was just seeing how empty he was and how i would never get the chance to really know him. the past 2-3 years my grandma (from moms side) has been slowly cognitively declining. nothing dramatic but she is confused easily, forgets things and seems tired all the time. she used to love to paint with me, but when i tried to get her to paint a few months ago she seemed lost attempting to recreate an easy tutorial i had found for us. she was so upset with herself for not being able to paint and didnt understand what was happening and i just had no idea what to do. she was the one to taught me how to paint so i was just kind of dumbfounded. apparently she was confused when my extended family had taken her to a group painting class but i didnt know she was having this much trouble.my grandma is the only really grandparent i have ever known, as her husband died when i was young and my grandma on the other side passed before i was born. i'm scared she will be diagnosed with dementia or alzheimers and i will have to watch her decline like i did with my grandfather, but i'm afraid about how difficult it may be because of how close i am with her. i know that these issues she is dealing with doesnt mean she is definitely going to be diagnosed with anything, i just cant help but be scared that this is just the beginning of a long road with dementia again."," that's tough, hj. are you in a position to be more proactive? would getting her to the doctor be within your scope as a family member? would you be less scared of the future if the verdict was in? i have that problem sometimes, then when the fear is confirmed it tends to be minimized because now i know what needs to be done. getting a diagnosis would be my first step, then you know what you're dealing with and how best to help your grandma live through her end-of-life. fyi... there is a fantastic art class specifically for people with dementia called [opening minds through art]( if it is offered in your area you might consider signing your grandma up for it. our mom did it for two years before she couldn't anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/er9mbv/scared_for_the_future/,Scared for the Future

"my mom has cognitive decline (shown in eeg) that will surely be a full dementia diagnosis when she has her neuropsych testing next week. she doesn’t sleep, can’t function without our telling us what to do, and fails screening memory tests.the psych doctor has put her in zyprexa to calm her. it worked a bit, now has stopped. my sister fears it makes her worse due to what we read online; the doctor says no.  she needs something for the anxiety and agitation it screams and cries all the time. they had her in remeron which didn’t work and also tried two other meds. does anyone have any experience with good anxiety meds for the elderly (she’s 77 and doesn’t tolerate meds well).", i agree with the commenter who suggested quetiapine. it' an antipsychotic that also helps depression and anxiety. i think it's known as seroquel in the us? my mum has been on it at a low dose for a week and seems a lot calmer. i've noticed no side effects. i've actually been on it myself at a really high dose (for something else) and also had no side effects. definitely recommend trying it. mirtazapine (an atypical anti-depressant that works for anxiety) was also suggested by her gp if quetiapine didn't suit her. but it can make you groggy and increase you appetite so not suited for people with weight issues.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/epizr4/meds/,Meds
"he was 83, and had been steadily declining for about 5 years. i moved in with my parents for a number of reasons, but partly to help my mother take care of him. in 2016, he could actively defy his republicanism and refuse to vote for trump. in 2018, he was still together enough to refuse to vote for any republican until trump was out. then his decline accelerated. he didn't recognize my mother, me, or anyone else. we were strangers to him. he became combative about simple things like getting dressed in the morning. in the last few months, even normal things like how to sit in a chair or which utensils to eat with became a mystery to him. any time he tried to talk, his thoughts and speech were garbled, although he could certainly demand to be left alone when we were just trying to keep him from getting into bed at night with his shoes on.it was a relief because my dad had disappeared a long time ago. i'm not exactly sure when, but the empty husk of a human that shuffled around the house was no longer my father. i know my mother and my brother (who came home last week to help because we knew he would pass very soon) feel exactly the same sense of relief. we're not happy he's gone, but we also know he wouldn't have wanted to live this way. we take some solace in feeling that he didn't really understand how far he had slipped, or at least i hope he didn't.my mom is 80, and in excellent health. she doesn't really have anything wrong with her at all, and i could see her living another 10 years, at least. i know she'll be lonely (they were married over 60 years, since she was 19), but she has friends, which she hasn't been able to hang out with for the last couple of years. so it's finally over, and we can all have a normal life again."," your post resonated completely even though my mum, having had dementia that was diagnosed in 2016, is still able to recognise us all so i do not know how long i have to go still. some days are a joy; let me quantify when she smiles and jokes, doesn’t snap at me, hasn’t insisted on going out in the heavily stained clothing, hasn’t refused a bath yet again and its nearly two months and hasn’t coughed horrifically throughout  the lunch out and hasn’t requested the toilet oh so audibly with a loud “i really need a pee!” which she would not have ever said quietly let alone out loud previously? some days are so heavy i cry driving home. mum insists on living alone still. some days, like the day she visited the best care home that i could find and that she could afford, she was so capable i looked like a daughter jumping the gun. only did so through panic that her rental was not going to be renewed, merely existing on a non spoken rolling contract right now. i am stuck in limbo awaiting a sign or drastic change of when to move to the home. i do at least now know that while still very able she did like it, thereforei have chosen well. i so wish someone else could take over the bathing and that they could insist it must be done at least weekly. i have had such low days but currently feel able to continue. i know this is only because i am not with mum 24/7, i do not know how people cope in that situation. she insists for now she wants to live alone; this leaves me feeling so awful  that i am relieved.this disease is the worst and i already know with a truly guilty heavy heart that i will feel the same when the time comes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/epdwrl/i_lost_my_dad_to_dementia_yesterday_my_main/,I lost my Dad to dementia yesterday.

"ventdad is 93, parkinsons, dementia, had a stroke 2 years ago and is a narcissist. he walks mostly w/ a walker and has at times bad tremors. he at times has choking when he eats and hes on sleep meds. he hates going to the doctor and tries to think he has no issues. they have been thru several parkinsons meds and they either didnt help or the one that did gave him nightmares.  his concept of is tremors is that he will just take a pill and they will go away.  six weeks ago she gave him a patch to try. on 1mg for a week he seemed visibly stronger and didnt use his walker. he then went to the 3mg patch. at the same time he tried drinking a coke with dinner as the carbonation could help ease his swallowing. for the next few nights he had a coke w/ dinner and he tried the 3mg patch and he had sleep issues. so we stoped the coke and he took the patch off that night and he slept. instead of trying it again he was convinced the caffeiene from the coke had no effect and he threw the patches away. i suggested he go back to the 1mg patch and he got mad and argued rather vehemently that she never gave him a 1mg patch. thats his dementia. his narcissism means he will argue that version of reality til he dies. he has to know and decide everything and he knows better than anyone. i suggested he call and get a msg to her and he refusedff to his appt todaywhere he told her that he put a patch on at 9am when he got up, started to feel bad, it got worse during the day until he finally removed the patch, very different story to what he told me. he then apologised for not calling to tell her what happened....and  that he had tried the 1, 2, 3mg patches. she never gave him a 2mg patch. once again his narcissism dooms him. he just has to feel superior. yet again anytime i try and offer something to help or clear up a misconception he immediately refuses it because it was from me. im at the point where im just going to be the chaffeur.  the sad thing to me is that he has made a series of poor decisions from his stroke over two years ago.  he also has no judgment when it comes to money.  im just extremely frustrated because i cant seem to get thru to him and i cant fix it when it all goes to hell."," *grant to* ***us*** *the* ***serenity*** *of mind to* ***accept*** *that which cannot be changed; courage to change that which can be changed, and wisdom to know the one from the other. -* the serenity prayerthere are days when i have to repeat that over and over. with pdd - parkinson's disease dementia he just doesn't remember what happened yesterday or the day before.is he in a memory care unit or some sort of assisted living?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/epb712/dads_dr_visit/,Dads Dr visit
"long post.i’m a 16 year old sophomore, and obviously i am very very busy, especially with finals and my grades about to send me to summer school.anyways, my grandmother died recently. she didn’t have dementia and was an otherwise very healthy woman (for a smoker). she was his caretaker. my grandfather could not be left alone at all, and leaving him alone for even an hour is risky, so my mom decides to take care of him at our house and every two weeks or so, give him to my uncle, then back to us.and taking care of him is the hardest shit ever. i am not exaggerating. its more than a mental toll.first, he leaks, and he smells. bad. even when he does have diapers on, and even when he does take a shower (which he has to regularly,) he stinks. i cant stand the smell. he also asks such hard questions to answer. sometimes, every 10 minutes, he’d ask where grandma is, and i’d have to tell him that she’s still in the hospital. or he’d ask where feliz is, his sister that died a few years ago, or he’d confuse me for her. it’s heartbreaking.but there’s also just such frustrating things that happen. we live rural in california, and when we let out the dogs, they have to go individually or two at a time or they’ll all run away, and we have to check when we let out the dogs so the cats won’t get out. my grandfather doesn’t know this, and lets them all out. even the cats who have been attacked and almost killed before. the dogs obviously go sprinting, and ive had to apologize to driver who almost hit them. i’ve told my grandfather so many times and even put up a paper on the sliding door in all capitals “do not let dogs out!!!” and its so infuriating when he does, it takes me hours to find them again only for him to let them all out again. he also gets angry for some reason. he woke up, and my brother asked him if he wanted to go out with my stepdad and eat, and my grandfather yelled at him and that he just woke up and to stop bothering him. he’s never had such a temper. he’s always been so mild. he does this a lot. i was playing playstation with my other brother and my grandfather comes in and says that we have to catch a flight to get registered for school, confusing us for my mom and my uncle. i explain that we’re already registered, and he yells “no you aint!! go get dressed, damn!” like what the fuck? i know he’s old and all but it’s sometimes so uncalled for, he’s never acted like this. sorry it’s such a long post. i had to get 5 months worth of stress off my chest. any tips to make this an easier experience?"," i don't blame you for feeling frustrated with your grandfather. i'm in the same boat as you. my grandpa and grandma are in such fragile condition that we wanted them to move into an assisted living because everyone in my family is just too busy to care for them and some of my cousins are moving out of state for better jobs. however, both have refused multiple times because they don't want to leave the house they lived in for over 50 years. their house is not safe and grandpa tripped and fell down the stairs one time while alone in the house. grandma came home an hour later and called an ambulance. he suffered some cracked ribs, but he was so stubborn and wanted to leave the hospital. the worst part about him is that he will argue about money. in his younger years, before dementia took over, he was so good with money, but now he has lost the ability to judge. he has fallen victim to scams and we had to clean up his mess. my dad and uncle are now in charge of his finances. every time we visit him, he would ask about his money or something of that nature, but he would say things that he has no money in his account when he has tons of money. sometimes he would ask something that would not make sense. i am frustrated that they will not move into a safer environment and have doctors monitor grandpa's dementia. so i have been praying that death will provide comfort for all of us and help grandpa's soul to rest. my family, being christian, view death as the enemy and they submit to grandpa's demands, which makes it more frustrating. i, on the other hand, view death as a great provider of relief and comfort. okay, that's my story, so i'll provide some advise. maybe help your grandpa look at senior centers where they have activities to keep him occupied. he may be old, but he probably wants to do something fun. that way he can be monitored while you are at school and your family is out and unable to look after him. i know you said you live in rural california, but there must be some place that could look after him. it will definitely prevent him from releasing your dogs all at once. maybe contact a doctor or specialist to see what could help with your grandpa's odor you mentioned. i hope this helps and all the best for you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/epanm7/so_fcking_stressful_grandfather/,So f*cking stressful.

i'll try to make this as short as i can   my grandfather has dementia and leukaemia he only has at most 6 months to live   he's now in respite turned palliative care and right from the start i did not like this because he's too lucid to be in a home he hates every moment of it and is terribly home sick i have now more or less been told to stop seeing him as it makes his home sickness worse however this is the problem   i see something in him that others don't anything he does or says is quickly dismissed as the dementia however i feel like i am the only one who actually listens to him and understands him he's not demented he's a bit slow and rambles but he isn't demented i feel like people are too impatient to listen to him i can have conversations with him quite well he may take 5 minutes of rambling to reply to something you said but he will eventually get there if you just listen   i can't explain what i mean but the best way i can describe it is with my grandmother it goes something like this  grandmother: how was your day?  grandfather: in the 70s i ummm...  grandmother: you what?  grandfather: i'm thinking i ah..  grandmother: come on hurry up!  grandfather: don't worry about it forget it   me: how was your day?   grandfather: in the 70s i ummm.... went to this little shop in ah... i think west town... that... had this... oh right yes had this erm... chicken that was very lovely  me: and is that what they gave you for lunch?  grandfather: yes! yes! the chicken reminded me of that it was very lovely (and so on)   but i seem like i'm going nuts because everyone! treats my grandfather like my grandmother does nurses doctors other family members they all treat him like garbage and then when he gets snarky and grumpy they just dismiss it as his dementia and nothing more     i don't know what i'm supposed to do here i just know i make him feel home sick he has told people he wants to see me because i'm the only one who doesn't talk to him like a child people assume he's rambling on about nothing but its just how he seems to remember things now he ties a new memory to an old solidified one as if he knows he doesn't have short term memory to recall it later   i guess this is more of a vent but is there anything i can do? any advice for me personally? i hate the fact he's going to die in that place he hates so much and never see his house or the ocean in front of it again," a digital picture frame helped my mom tremendously. maybe photos of the beach & pictures of loved ones & happy memories? music that he likes? food that he enjoys? he is dying, he needs more care than grandma can give him & he needs to be where he's safe & cared for but you are absolutely correct that listening to him, loving him & treating him with respect are paramount. i will say that despite my nursing background & my comfort & ability to deal with the needs of clients, nothing has brought me to my knees like this disease. in fact, because it is my mom, i was finding myself so short on patience...but it was masking my abject fear at the time (she was still living alone, but not independently - we were dealing with her finances, groceries, laundry, cleaning etc - & every time we went over, something worrying would happen & i would have the realization that even with all of the planning & work we were doing to take care of her, it wasn't enough). i was scared & it was coming across like impatience. i don't know grandma, obviously, but  what i'm saying is that she's losing her life partner, slowly & painfully & dementia is like grieving in slow motion, so there may be a lot more to her reactions to grandpa then meet the eye. if you can, chat with palliative care staff to see what suggestions they have to help grandpa on this leg of his life journey. i'm so very glad he has you in his life. xo",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ep6890/i_feel_like_no_one_is_listening_to_my_grandfather/,i feel like no one is listening to my grandfather or treating him like a person

"so my (23f) dad (66) is doing really bad. last week he almost didn't survive a lung infection (he also has severe copd) and his lewy body is now way worse than before the infection. also the doctors told us that he won't be able to survive the next infection because the bacteria in his lungs will be resistant by that time. which is not the news one would like to hear. i mean, we all knew it could happen more sooner than later but it still sucks big time. even though he is already living in his 'bonus time'. (they predicted exactly a year ago, that he would not live any longer that 8 months) does anyone got any tips on how to deal with this shit? i try to write poetry and sometimes write letters to my dad, just so i can pretend that we can talk like we used to do.also my other siblings are a lot like my mother and i, on the other hand, am way closer with my dad. he was/ is my best friend.sorry that it turned into a weird, not grammatically correct rant. i just feel very 'blehhh' about the current situation and i am worried for all the sad stuff that will happen in a few weeks or months."," i feel you, my grandmother, who i am named after, and who has lived with us almost continuously since i was 2 has dementia. i too turned to poetry, though i don’t share it with anybody, i find “brainstorming” (idk if that’s the word i want to use) before finally starting to write has actually helped me process my emotions a bit more. also, i don’t to this often because i don’t want to put myself in that type of headspace, but every once in a while i let myself have a good cry. i don’t like crying in front of my family esp, my mom because she is my grandmothers primary care giver and the last thing i want to do is give her something to stress or worry about. so while i do talk to my close friends about what i’m feeling every once in a while i just let myself cry and find that it does help calm me down/release any stress or sadness that i feel about my grandma’s dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eo7jg2/may_i_please_vent_a_little_bit/,May I please vent a little bit?

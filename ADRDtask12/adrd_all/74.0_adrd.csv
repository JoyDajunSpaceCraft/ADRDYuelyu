"my husbands nan has really concerned us, she has no diagnosis yet, however yesterday she got really disoriented and said she needed to go home to look after the kids. except she was home, the kids are her sisters that are grand/great grandparents now.she was convinced she had to get a coach to london. before that i'd looked in her bag because she'd lost her bank card twice in a row. she has nothing with her address on in that bag. is there a card or anything i can get for her incase she does try and get to an old house?"," best solution we found was double deadbolt locks, child safety handles or locks on the doors, door and window alarms, and prayer. dad would try to wander off at all hours. after chasing him down a few times, we just went into lockdown.

"how quickly does dementia progress in seniors ? is it expected that all of a sudden things progress quickly at some point? my grandmother who is turning 95 years possibly has dementia. it’s kind of a long story but her family doctor has done a few moca tests (latest score 21/30) and other evaluations and never came back with an official diagnosis. my grandmother has a good memory of things that happened a long time ago but her short term memory is almost non existant.  she can’t remember what her address is or what the unit is. she wouldn’t be able to drive or remember to go take her medications etc. in the past week things got worst very quickly. she would get confused and wouldn’t remember who her husband was, but she was back to her “normal” the next morning. i spent the entire day at the hospital with her where she got bloodwork and urine test which came back normal. she also got a ct scan to confirm no brain bleed or new stroke etc. i’m fussy on her past ct but it had showed atrophy a few places including or corpus calleux and an indication that she had a small stroke in the past. today she remembered we spent the day together but didn’t remember what we did. when we were at the hospital she thought i was her nurse at some point and every 5-10 minutes she would ask where we were / why were we here and that she wanted to go home. it is my understanding that this is part of the normal progress but i wasn’t expecting the random jump in progression. should i be preparing for anything else ?", i will say sometimes not drinking enough or getting restful sleep can also add to the impairment. which once it is corrected they sort of bounce back. and then sometimes i think they teeter on a line of knowing/not knowing. folding clothes is an example with her. she might fold laundry perfectly one day but the next just fold things in half. then i can mess the basket up and give it back to her and she'll fold in a completely different way. i would just be prepared for unexpected changes and you might not know what is coming next.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pkpsyd/question_about_progression/,Question about progression

so after a year and a half of not knowing what was going on but suspecting ftd we finally got a diagnosis from my mothers neuropsychologist of frontotemporal dementia. she explained that everyone progresses differently and it could be years before there was a decline. in the past 6 months there has been a great decline of motor skills which is affecting speech and movement and she’s having a bad fall weekly and stumbles at alarming rates so we are getting her a cane to try. i’m posting here hoping there are others who have experience with ftd and can tell me how fast the progression was. i understand everyone is different but the unknown is scary as shit so even a little insight can help.," my sister was formally diagnosed in mid 2018.  at the time she was living in her own apartment but just barely getting by. she went into memory care in early 2019. she’s now wheelchair bound and her language abilities are gone to the point that her speaking is mostly unrecognizable sounds.her neurologist told us that ftd often follows a stair step pattern and that’s what we’ve seen with my sister - a few months of stability, then a decline, then another plateau, then another decline. in early 2020 she had a steep decline and went on hospice but stabilized. at the time of diagnosis, the neurologist estimated 5-7 years but has since said that she is progressing faster than is typical.it’s a terrible disease, but mainly it affects family members.  most people with ftd are unaware of their condition or that anything is wrong.  even though i can’t understand my sister anymore, she is still happy and laughs a lot.  that’s probably as best as one could hope for and it made it easier - for me at least - to come to terms with it and accept the reality and try to make the best of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pk1jc8/ftd_diagnosis_today/,FTD diagnosis today

"hi all,a family member in their 60s has lewy body dementia. they have trouble remembering things past about 10 or 15 minutes after being told. when younger, this person was a normal, functioning adult who could mostly remember things ok, could use a computer, competently drive a car or operate machinery, perform home maintenance work, etc.their condition is intermediate to advanced, and their memory is fairly ""selective"" - sometimes they remember things just fine, but other things, even things they do 10 times a day, they can't remember.while they were never especially competent with computers, before dementia really set in, they could be taught how to do something and then practice that routine to perform ordinary computing tasks. most of that ability is gone, but the person still desires to use the computer.we have a samsung bigscreen tv hooked up to an m1 mac mini that they use. the tasks they have challenges with include:* ""how do i put on the tv?"" -- that is, the samsung tv is currently set to display the mac's output, not the cable tv.* ""how do i get to the internet?"" -- that is, the samsung tv is currently set to display the cable tv, but they want to get to their computer. * not only do they not remember which hdmi number to switch to for the mac (in our house it's hdmi 3 for the mac and hdmi 2 for cable tv), but they don't remember their login password, or how to bring up chrome.to try to mitigate this, the family has printed out and laminated several 8.5"" x 11"" ""flash cards"" in huge, bold font and attached them to the side of the desk on a metal ring. they stand out and have pictures and everything. however, the instructions to follow are often too complicated for this person to be willing to follow independently, so after the first step or so they'll get frustrated and call for one of us to help them.for example, if they're trying to switch from tv to the internet, they'll find the card, read it, realize they need to click over to hdmi 3 for the mac, then not to know where to look for the password, which we deliberately set to be an extremely easy to remember password (someone's birth month and day). just 2-3 years ago, they never had trouble remembering a password this simple.if we bring up the computer and log in for them, they'll still want help getting to whichever site they want to go to. ""i want to see the news"" -- ok, so we have to move the mouse over to the bookmark for their favorite news site and click it. ""i want to watch a movie"" -- ok, so we have to talk to them and figure out what movie they want to watch, then take them to netflix, amazon prime or apple tv. you get the idea.the situation is very taxing on the rest of the family because we work for a living, and it interrupts our workday to have to come down and help them constantly. it doesn't help that the person often gets bored, confused or tired of whatever content they're watching and wants to switch to something else, roughly once an hour or more. they also suffer from insomnia, so we're constantly getting up during the night to satisfy their requests.**my goal:** i'd like to have a big, giant button that we can label ""tv"" and another one labeled ""internet"" that he can just press, and sit them on his desk. pressing the ""tv"" button should switch over to the correct hdmi input for our cable tv box, and ideally also press the ""menu"" button on the tv box to get it to actually display a channel (by default, when it goes to sleep, it displays a splash screen that says ""press menu to watch tv"", but the dementia patient doesn't know which clicker to grab or what button to press.)the internet one is potentially tougher. i might be able to rig the mac to login without a password, or just never go to sleep. i might also be able to script it to ensure that chrome is opened, maximized and given focus. that way all the patient has to do is click on the bookmark they want to go to - and they can sometimes do that successfully, especially if they don't have a long and involved process to get to the browser in the first place.i am a software engineer, and i'm willing to write code to do this, but i'd like to avoid buying a whole new tv or different computer if possible. better yet, i'd be able to find some sort of open source project out there i could work with that would do most of the work for me, and i'd just have to configure it.what i'm not sure about is how to interface these buttons with the tv/cable box/mac. i realize that the specific hardware i have may not make this possible, but i'm hoping that someone has considered a solution for this before and has something commercially available.the tv is a 2015 samsung 65"" 4k smart tv. our cable provider is verizon fios and we have the ""fios one"" set top boxes. the mac is an m1 running macos big sur.if there is a pre-canned commercial solution out there, i might break down and buy it, even if it requires replacing my tv. this really grates on everyone's nerves because we have to do this all throughout the day and night.**unrelatedly, but a different tech problem.** is there any way to completely lock down the bookmarks and settings of google chrome? the dementia patient seems to go into a mindless daze and will sometimes delete all of their bookmarks for no reason, and then wonder where they are later, having no memory of ever deleting them. i know it isn't any sort of hack because the browser runs ublock origin and both the browser and the mac stay patched with the latest updates. they don't visit any shady sites.i just want a way to disable deletion of bookmarks. the browser should be protected as if to prevent tampering by a child. but i think even with the child safety features of chrome enabled, they can still delete bookmarks. i'd like to prevent that."," this is way too complicated for me and i don't have dementia. my advice is to have a tv with simple remote, and a computer that's hooked up to the internet. and expect this to not work out. someone i know with dementia ""watches tv"" on youtube and has no tv at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pjzlkd/computers_and_technology_use_for_a_dementia/,Computers and technology use for a dementia patient
"i’ve been caring for my grandmother for over a year now (and intermittently the last few years before that), as her dementia has really accelerated recently. she had a stroke about a month ago, which has left her even more confused and completely bedbound, and was only discharged from the hospital a couple of weeks ago. since the stroke, she often is awake at night and just shouts ‘where where’ and other things over and over. i’ve tried to soothe her, i’ve told her she’s safe and that she’s at home etc and whilst that calms her down for a while it starts up again the moment i get up to go back to bed. i leave a night light on, close the curtains etc all the tips that i’ve seen on dementia care pages (apart from exercise of course as she cannot physically move her legs anymore due to the stroke). i’m getting no sleep at night, and then in the day i cook and clean for her and my grandpa (he has a broken hip and is about to have surgery so is limited on what he can currently do, he also doesn’t hear her at night due to being hard of hearing so it’s only me who wakes up) and feed her etc. i feel so guilty but sometimes i just have to leave her for a few hours at night to shout it out otherwise i get no sleep. we have two carers assigned by the hospital who come 2-3 times in the day to change her catheter and move her etc but no night nurse or anything although we are on a waiting list for as assessment for one. i guess i’m not so much looking for advice rather just getting it off my chest, but any advice would be much appreciated."," i'm so sorry you and your grandparents are going through this. the sleep deprivation that comes from dementia outbursts through the night is a special form of hell. i've been there. and your poor grandmother. she must be so scared and confused.as for practical solutions: given how much distress you and she are in, it may be time for a bedtime medication. melatonin is mild but can help. cbd is another otc solution, potentially. your grandmother's distress might be beyond those, though. talk to her doctors about a night-time sedative. be careful with benzos in dementia. my dad had good results with trazodone for a time, and with seroquel after that.can she still read? a lot of people use a whiteboard with basic messages, like, ""it's night, you're at home, sofie will be here in the morning"". it seems to help orient and reassure, and maybe knowing where she is and that someone will be with her in the morning will help. of course, if she can't read, that won't work. are there any noises or types of music that calm her? you could try playing that quietly for her. my dad liked to have a familiar movie playing as he slept, with minimal volume. he seemed to find it comforting.if you just can't get her to calm down, then you might want to invest in a bed alarm/baby monitor/camera and earplugs, so you can keep an eye on her and make sure she hasn't fallen out of bed but can stay in your own room and sleep. i know it sounds terrible, but if she's yelling nonstop and won't stop, well, no human being can function on no sleep, and you need to function to care for them both, so you may just have to accept the situation until you can get overnight help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pjybu9/struggling_with_sundowning/,Struggling with sundowning

"for a preface, he is 86. so i understand some loss is expected, but he's always been very healthy and maintained his functions. you would guess he was maybe 70 at the most. over the past year, things have been getting strange. he'd leave the stove on sometimes, forget to put something away, minor stuff. but it's started getting worse. he refuses to leave the house for the most part and spends half the day in his room (which is new, and odd for him.) he gets argumentive about little things or will blow up at us for no reason. we've had the same tv set up for 8 years, but now he needs help even figuring out how to turn on a recorded show or recall to another channel. he calls his tablet that he's had a year a ""notebook"" or ""calender"" most of the time. we hate to send him to the doctors alone because he usually doesn't remember things, and although he's been going to the same office for 8 years, he forgot he had to walk across the way to get his bloodwork done. he drove to our cabin alone and forgot the dog food/pretty much everything else, and when he came home he left the entire place a mess, left all the groceries there. he has neuropathy in his feet, but his coordination has gotten worse, with him tripping and even falling when he tried to use the restroom the other night. he also has chronic shakes in his right hand now that's been getting worse. there's other stuff, but overall it sucks to see him be like this, because although i love him it's hard to be patient and not get frustrated since i have my own problems. we'd take him in to be tested, but he's very stubborn and stuck in his ways, and insists that he's fine."," you're here. you're here because you've recognized that things aren't right. that alone means that he needs to be checked. there are eldercare doctors that will do apts through various facetime apps, especially since the pandemic. i'd say someone has to be there to set it up and get it going, but maybe you can take the call and introduce it that way. as dementia worsens people tend to isolate more. humans in general are stubborn. and we feel shame when we ""do things wrong"".. so if he's getting forgetful and embarrassed easily this may be an option. another option would be.... now,  this is a bit out of the box, but (my own mom was so stubborn so everything was done in haste, which led to further complications down the road...) you could schedule a home-visit with an elder-care-attorney-nurse. (bear with me..)  if he was getting a power of attorney, they would send a nurse/dr to declare competency. you'd have to specify you want a home visit though. (i'm not saying he has to, although if he has dementia that may be necessary at a certain point.. but only if he was declared competent..)  i only bring this up because if he's too stubborn and won't go to an actual visit, you could call an elder care attorney and tell them you're looking to see if your grandfather could be declared competent. they would either have a list of their own nurses/doctors, or give you numbers of some to call. you could have them come to meet him. if they say he's not competent they would provide reason, like showing clear signs of dementia etc. then you have at least a solid answer and can begin the next steps. if he's declared competent, that doesn't mean he doesn't have dementia.. it just means that he's still able to understand and potentially sign off on much needed papers before it worsens, if he does have it.i'm sorry i know that was so convoluted. i don't know if that came out right. if it didn't i can try again lol pardon, my own brain is like fried today ☺",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pjpzy8/my_grandpa_is_slowly_declining_and_were_afraid/,"My grandpa is slowly declining and we're afraid he's developing signs, looking for information or support..."
"my mom (76) has seemingly acute onset of dementia like symptoms. we’ve ruled out drug reactions and i suspect it’s recurring uti. last month she fell out of bed, hit her head and couldn’t get up. my father called an ambulance and she was admitted for five days with dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.this morning (15 min ago) my dad tells me she fell again. he says she did not hit her head, does not seem hurt but claims she can’t remember how to get up. he’s not strong enough to lift her. does this warrant another ambulance ride? or i can go over with my 3-year-old and help get her up. we are trying to get home health to come out too but apparently they can’t until tomorrow. thank you. this is all new to me."," i had this situation last week so can completely relate. i second your hunch on the utis - exactly the reason for the sudden deterioration in my case. back to 'normal' now after a course of antibiotics. i did not take her to the er - she was lucid, though scared, and not at all hurt but could not get up. first course of business would be the urine test and antibiotics course. with no shower for 2 weeks this is more than likely. check with her primary on the memory meds - donepezil, memantine, etc. you dad seems to not be able to manage some of the adls (shower) so you should look at getting a psw coming in (personal support worker) - maybe start with 2-3x 1 hour a week. here in canada this can be arranged by the heath authorities. escalate the hours as needs increase until it nursing home becomes a necessity - needs wise or financially. this may be closer than not if she doesn't recover from the antibiotics. if she is resistant or aggressive, then look into other meds. the neurologist / psychiatrist should administer the memory tests and compare against the prior to note the deterioration (ideally after you clear the uti).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pjo98b/second_time_falling_this_month_claims_she_cant/,Second time falling this month; claims she can’t get up

"i don't really know where to begin. this is my first time posting in this subreddit, although i've read through many of these stories. in a matter of four months my father-in-law (77) has gone from mild memory issues to moderate to severe alzheimer's. his doctor is giving him a maximum of nine months to live. we're doing everything to make him comfortable and even improve his memory/slow the progression with medication and daily brain training.he's at the point where he cannot be left alone; he has nearly started fires, wandered from the house multiple times, and it's at the point where he doesn't always know who we are or what day or year it is. he cannot be relied on to take care of his daily hygiene or medication, and he's very resentful that he's not allowed to drive or be left alone. i know he resents being watched and driven around all the time, but he's honestly a danger to himself and others.this has all happened very fast and we're all trying to adjust. he lives with us, as does a young lady who we adopted. we also have an infant at home. i've felt very protective over them, especially since he's getting more and more unpredictable. i hate feeling afraid in our own home. we installed cameras all throughout the house after the second time he wandered off, we also removed his hunting guns and weapons, and he doesn't have access to car or house keys. i have a fear that one day he will forget who we were and try to hurt us. as is common with dementia sufferers, they have a tendency to mentally revert back to their younger selves, and he was a very violent man towards his family back in the day.out of the blue one night, he confessed his love for our 17-year-old adopted daughter. he acted really tormented about it and kept saying that he realized he was too old for her, but that he really wanted to take care of her and he was struggling with hiding his feelings for her. we were all shocked and i kept repeating that ""that's not going to happen because you are her grandpa and she's your granddaughter."" we thought he might have forgotten it by the next day, and didnt bring it up to him. we didn't want him to feel embarrassed. we know he's lonely, his wife of 50 years (mil) passed away years ago.lately the comments and stories have ramped up and escalated. he fully believes that they've had an affair, been in love, and he got upset one day when he thought she was seeing somebody else. he's touched her a few times in what he thinks is a playful way, but is still inappropriate. she now avoids giving him hugs goodbye, avoids eye contact, and dresses in really baggy clothes so that he won't stare at her body. we don't allow them to be home alone together anymore, but due to a miscommunication the other day they were home alone together for about 5 minutes before we arrived home. in that time, he confesssed his love for her again and said, ""i know what they're trying to do, keeping us apart. why won't you just let me take care of you?"" while coming closer and closer to her. she just kept walking into other rooms and dismissing his comments. thankfully she's very smart and kind, and understands that it's the disease making him behave this way, but she's incredibly uncomfortable. it's getting to the point where i'm afraid for her safety and can't trust him not to try act on his feelings. they both sleep in a different part of the house from us, and he's up and shuffling around at all odd hours of the night. she's nowhere near strong enough to fight him off if he ever tried to overpower her, so i recently installed a keyed lock on her door. here's where i could use some advice; half of the family doesn't believe that he's saying these things and are resistant to him ever going into a home. they think she's making up these stories even though they've heard him confess his love for her with their own ears, because ""he would never do that."" i remind them that we have cameras all over our home now, and they're welcome to see some of the footage if they don't believe us. we are the ones who take care of him and have seen the escalation of symptoms and unpredictability. we don't currently have any health aids coming to the home, but we know we're not far off. i'm not unsympathetic, but i think i checked out emotionally months ago because he's not the same man i've known for over a decade anymore, and i've entered into some kind of mama bear protective mode. with two children at home, i cannot keep allowing or tolerating unsafe and dangerous behavior. i refuse to let any harm come to them because of this disease. at what point is this behavior enough to warrant placing him somewhere else? thank you all for reading thus far. i'm sorry for how long this has become. i would appreciate any advice or tips on our next steps. tldr: fil confessing his love for our young daughter, increasing and escalating his advances. when is the danger enough to warrant placing him in a home?"," i know that this is a 3 month old post and i don't mean to be brash but please get him out of your house. he's going to end up raping her. it doesn't matter that he's old, he's still a man and he can still overpower her. no one deserves to feel unsafe in their own home and no one deserves to have to deal with unwanted touching and comments all day long. i would not want to live there if i was your daughter. also, i'm sorry but i feel like you haven't been doing enough to protect your daughter. i know that you say that they're not allowed to be home alone together anymore but as you said, it happened one day. what would you have done if in those 5 minutes, he would have overpowered her? how would you have felt then? how would you have felt knowing that you let your father-in-law do that to your daughter? his dementia is not your fault but damn it, do more to protect her. otherwise, one day you're going to find yourself putting her in counseling because she's going to come to you and say that he raped her. he no longer has the ability to decipher right from wrong and he doesn't care about how she feels, he just wants what he wants. i don't mean to be ugly but there's situations in life where you have to be blunt and this is one of them. please do more to protect your daughter before she becomes a victim of sexual assault. i feel like you know that he has dementia and you know he doesn't need to be there but you're dragging your feet about getting him out of there. who gives a fuck what the family thinks? they're not the ones who have to deal with him everyday. he's their problem, let them sort it out. i think that they know that he's a problem because none of them are willing to take him on full-time yet they want to tell you what to do. me personally, i would drop him on their doorstep and be like since you want to tell me what to do with him, here you can take care of him. do not bring him back to my house. i'm sorry, i'm just going off because i just don't understand how you could let this happen. get him the fuck out of your house before he hurts her.edit: it's possible that he's always been like this but it's just getting worse. he may be one of those men who doesn't care what a woman wants. he just wants her so he's going to have her. sometimes the dementia makes that more in your face. but as i said, get him out of your house before he hurts her. sometimes, dementia patients get violent to the point that they've been known to commit murder and not remember it. there is a possibility that he could become so enraged by her rejecting him that he kills her. i don't mean to scare you but it's a possibility. he also sounds like he's getting to that stage in general where he's going to become like a psychopath basically, he could hurt someone and not see what the big deal is. he is a danger to everyone in your home. get him out of there. i don't care if you have to call the police and explain the situation. get him out of there now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pjczqa/father_in_law_making_sexual_advances_on_our/,"Father in law making sexual advances on our daughter (Grandpa towards granddaughter) Family is split about what to do.

(then they get there and tell him 'if you don't have covid, you need to leave.' he refuses, makes my uncle sit there for a few hours just to hear 'sir there's nothing wrong with you, please go home, there's a pandemic.')if my uncle doesn't take him, he calls me and demands i take him or he ""will die"" and it will be my fault. it's becoming a real ""boy who cried wolf"" scenario. i dealt with this with my dad's parents (which... he didn't care for, i had to, so my patience is already so thin. i missed months of every college semester to take them to the doctor, er visits, etc). (this is also my mom's dad, but my mom passed when i was a kid so my uncle is the point of contact.)today, he called me and told me that my uncle was ignoring him and he was going to die. he said ""it hurts when i take my pills, i need to go to the emergency room immediately."" i should mention he refuses to drink water. says he has to go to the bathroom too much. he's 93. he's in a retirement home (not assisted living... yet) so his bathroom is about 10 feet away at any time. he also refuses depends but has a full-blown panic attack if he has to go to the bathroom and there is anything in his way.unrelated to the medical issues, 1. he told my uncle he owed me $2000 immediately and had to go to the bank as soon as they opened tomorrow.  (he owed me just over $100 and paid me yesterday.) 2. he says there's not food in his kitchen and we're letting him starve (the home provides meals and his kitchen is packed with microwave meals, his favorite snacks, all different drinks, etc.). 3. he forgets which medicine is which so we're not sure what he's taking. 4. he says he never gets to leave but thanks to the suggestion of a user here, i took him on a tour of the entire city that lasted 2 hours yesterday and i pointed out everything to him and he told me stories of the old days.he's touring an assisted living place tomorrow. wish us all luck. he seems to think it's a college dorm where ""you and your uncle can't bother me!"" but there, they'll take care of his medicine and lots of other things that he needs day-to-day that we can't anymore.if it was up to me, he'd see a therapist asap. but every time i get involved with anything like this, it becomes my responsibility and i didn't sleep from age 16-19 to take care of my other pair of grandparents. i just really really really hope assisted living works out. he needs it so bad.thanks for reading my rant. i'm sure it won't be the last. i really appreciate this community, i feel so much less alone and find so much help.", good luck. i hope it all works out.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pjbvbg/demanding_er_visit_but_hopeful_for_assisted/,"Demanding ER visit, but hopeful for assisted living tour tomorrow"

"my great grandma has dementia. she had a dog that she would forget to take care of. the dog was malnourished and had an untreated anal abscess that ruptured. the poor dog was in an incredible amount of pain and was very sick. she was kept in a cage 24/7, she was not let out to potty regularly and never got any love. my great grandma would just forget to take care of her. i was able to convince my great grandma to give her dog to me. however now she is threatening to call the cops on me for “stealing” her dog and wants the dog back. i have had her for a couple of months now, and have taken her to the vet regularly for treatment. the dog’s anal glad infection was so bad that she had to be on antibiotics and pain meds for over a month. i don’t think she ever had a bath or her nails clipped and had dreads i had to cut out of her fur. she also had ticks. if i didn’t take her she would have died. i spent hundreds of dollars to bring her back to health and i’ve also spent a lot of time working with her extreme anxiety. she has special needs due to begin neglected for so long. …so i’m not really inclined to give my great grandma a dog she is just going to unintentionally neglect. it’s a hard situation because my great grandma does not even recognize her owndaughter sometimes and is at a point where she needs assisted living or a caregiver. she is being incredibly difficult and resists moving. there’s also a lot of family drama behind that ..and her bum son who makes matters worse. all those problems are beyond me. there’s alot going on with her and my family just wants me to give her back the dog because they don’t want to deal with the drama. i need some ideas on how to proceed with this situation. i love my great grandma and i am just trying to do the right thing.."," don't give the poor pup back. i understand it's a hard situation, but your family needs to come to terms with reality. i know saying that to you does absolutely nothing to help with them. but the dog was being neglected... and it sounds like maybe your grandmother is too. who is responsible for your grandmother? her next of kin. spouse or children. in a perfect world someone in the family would notice the person's health declining, and make a plan for care. whether that's an adult child, spouse, or an aide.. you need to speak with whoever is in charge of grandma.if your pleas fall on deaf ears, you should call adult protective services, to make sure she gets the care she needs. family drama always sucks. i'm sorry you're going through this.as for the legality..if they threaten to call the police, whatever let them. if the police come, just tell the police it's your dog. *it is your dog.*or simply don't answer your door. it's not like the movies. you're not legally mandated to answer your door for anyone. and they aren't going to get a warrant and bust in to find your dog. nor do you have to surrender your pet. police may come by, but will most likely tell the other party they have to go through the courts. if you have any documentation (texts with family even) about grandma's condition it would make things easier. and save your vet bills too!if grandma gave the dog to a stranger, and then demanded it back months later, a court would not order them to do that. she gave it away. that's it.your family doesn't like it? tough. and if they do try to take you to court, that's just fine. but they will be opening a whole can of worms on grandma's care, and i doubt they want a light shown on that. i doubt it'll come to any of this. most likely just bluster from relatives going through anxiety during an understandably tough situation. drama exists in every family. some worse than others. i don't claim to know your situation, but it seems like certain folks may be ignoring their own responsibilities and trying to make you a scapegoat. typical bully behavior. don't be manipulated by them. you've done nothing wrong.best of luck 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pi9p3j/unintentional_animal_neglect/,Unintentional animal neglect

"that's the fancy term for somebody fixating on one thing and coming back to it over and over again.  my sister and i finally reached the point in april this year that we knew our father couldn't be unsupervised for long periods of time.  he can't remember that he is at his own house, gets bored and decides to go wandering and then gets lost.  at the beginning of august we were able to get him into an adult day care program, which seemed to be working well, until tuesday.  the day care place picks him up in the morning, and he decided he wasn't going that day.  on the one hand i'm glad he's not hopping into cars with strangers, but damnit.i can do about 75% of my job remotely so i went to dad sit and holy moly.  i don't know if he didn't get any sleep, too much sleep, or what but he was going a thousand miles an hour in 100 different directions.  the usual fixation on my truck-how many miles do you have on it, how many miles on the tires, what year is it (i can at least use the question about the year to figure out where he is, he thought it was 2018).  probably asked those questions 4 times in 20 minutes.  i went inside to start working (and turn on gunsmoke, which draws him in like a moth to a light bulb) and that's when the guys showed up to work on my sister's house which is right next door to his.  he wanted to know what they were doing to my house, every 15 minutes, he asked me how his sister in law's brothers were (which means he thinks i'm his brother which is pretty common), and then he says he's going to go next door to see if his brother wants to go to dinner (i'm quick on the uptake about who he thinks i am, but this move completely lost me).  he also wanted to go over there and check if our mom was home yet (she's been dead for a few years, but i'm not telling him).  my sister was running late, and in the 30 minutes alter she was supposed to be home, he probably tried to go see if she was home 10 times.  how, how in the hell can you not know who lives next door and still know that they are late?  the mind is a fascinatingly terrifying place.we are talking about moving him to memory care, and renting or selling his house.  my sister says we'll have to do something with his stuff and my mind springs right to storage unit while she says we can have an estate sale.  my mind says why would we have an estate sale-oh, because he's not coming back home.  that thought hurts."," i haven't had a relative with dementia but i work in neuropsych and a lot of our patients have dementia. we write up behavioral observations for each patient, making notes about unexpected things they might do during testing. perseverating is something that we look for. when we see it, it might be that they fixate on using the same answer for multiple questions in a row. or that they might keep bringing up the same thing over and over again in conversation. your perspective is very interesting to me. we see people for such limited amounts of time. our dementia appointments typically last half a day or so. sometimes it is hard to get a true picture of what a person is like in everyday life. usually somebody brings them to their appointment and that person can provide additional perspective. but sometimes they are dropped off, and sometimes the dementia patients drive themselves.i'm sorry you are going through this. it is scary when somebody familiar starts to become unfamiliar. i think you give a very poignant description of what things are actually like for family members. thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pgnum2/perseverance/,Perseverance

(burnout is a big deal, but that’s separate from “how do i communicate”. being pushed past your ability to give care - like maybe you’re not wanting to help with toileting, or maybe she starts wandering - is also an actual big deal.) in day-to-day life, she’s probablygoing to hit back what you pitch, so pitch her softballs. if you can manage your own emotional state, to where forgetfulness and clumsiness aren’t some bad shit that’s happening right now, then you can be easygoing when you deal with her. my suggestion is to give her the same reactions you would give a toddler who you don’t want to overreact to falling down. “oops, oh well, no big deal.” and the easiest way to do that is to decide that maybe this isn’t a big deal.

(a lot of times they can’t know for sure until they do an autopsy. sucks.)b. dementia makes your brain malfunction, and your brain communicates with your nervous system to work body parts like your muscles and kidneys and stuff. a common effect of having dementia is muscle wasting (probably bc the brain can’t communicate with the muscles for maintenance purposes).covid also screws with brain function and movement pretty badly, even in young people with normal neurology. people over in r/covid19positive talk a lot about brain fog, muscle pain, and exhaustion. so i doubt it’s entirely the facility’s fault that she’s in a wheelchair. she’s got two major disabling conditions working against her, one chronic and one acute.

i had a phone conversation with a woman at a facility this morning. she suggested that assisted living might be enough for fil. i was wondering if anyone else chose assisted living for their loved one over memory care. what made you decide al instead of mc? what made you switch to mc over al? any other thoughts? we were thinking mc simply because of the dementia and hand't really considered that al was an option.," originally we hoped to move our dad into assisted living first simply because we felt it would be easier to sell him on it. we realized, though, that he really needs memory care. he needs someone to guide him during showers to use shampoo, conditioner and soap, and he needs someone to guide him to use deodorant as well. the good thing about moving right to mc is that he is now used to everything, and there’s always someone to help him if he needs anything, which is not true of al. after moving in to mc, he also started putting on the same clothes he wore the day before. they had to start a process of taking his dirty clothes out of his apartment, otherwise he would put them on again. they couldn’t do that if he was just in al. i’m in a support group for adult children of alzheimer’s patients, and many people in my group have parents with alzheimer’s in assisted living, and their loved ones are fighting the move to memory care. i’m very relieved we started with memory care and now don’t have to fight my dad about moving from al to mc. we sold it to my dad as “an apartment with help” that is just a home base for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/perkto/question_about_assisted_living_vs_memory_care/,question about assisted living vs memory care
so i've been caring for my grandmother with alzheimer's for some time and so far she has slowly gotten worse. since caring for her she has always had issues with certain food textures and frequently spits out her food and hates most things ( except sweets lol). i've just learned to ignore it and let it be.today i served her chicken noodle soup and for the first time she said it was too hard and couldn't swallow it. i found this odd considering she loves peanuts and eats them regularly as a snack. so i pureed her food and she ate some more thankfully. my concern is her comment about not being able to swallow and if this is a sign of disease progression or just her way of saying she doesn't like the food. going forward i guess i should just puree everything? i know that eventually she will not be able to swallow foods but i expected it to start popping up much later.," might be worth getting her an appointment to see a speech therapist and have them do a swallow test to see if there is something going on. if nothing else, at least that way you’ll know if she’s just being picky or if there really is something happening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pep93z/food_issues/,Food issues

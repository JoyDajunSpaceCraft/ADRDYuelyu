"i care for my mom (70s, parkinson’s and advancing dementia) i have a spouse, kid, fulltime job. i try so hard to take good care of my mom, drive her to three different workout classes a week and coordinate with a neighbor to take her to two more (yoga) manage the 6 different meds she takes a total of 10 times a day. make sure she eats enough and at the right times with her meds. take her to so many dr appointments and ask all the important questions. help her with her tv and phone many many times a day. she’s always been an emotionally needy person, and having lived with her the past 7 yrs, i now understand why she is three times divorced :( i’m starting to hate her for her constant need for attention and hate myself for feeling that way. no matter how much i do for her, she always wants more. my spouse helps but he gets frustrated too. we’ve considered assisted living facilitates for her, but she doesn’t have much $ and applying/qualifying for medicaid seems daunting. plus i worry about the quality of care she will receive and covid. she would need fulltime memory care for sure. i’m slowly mentally and emotionally collapsing. it crushes my soul that no matter how good a caregiver i am, she keeps declining. i know in my head it’s not my fault but my heart hurts. i feel like a failure as her daughter and also to my husband and kid. my job too. just struggling with everything, all at once. i probably need a therapist but who has the time to even find one plus my insurance sucks. and to know it’s only going to get worse and in the end she will die and i will have no mom…like there is no light at the end of the tunnel only more sadness and pain.i have a brother and her sister (my aunt) that will help some but i have to be very specific with my requests to both of them and manage/follow up to the point that it’s not helpful, just another chore to manage. plus they are both super flakey, they will commit to do x then something else will come along and i’m left scrambling. sucks.not sure what i am asking, i guess i’m just venting. thanks for reading."," im sorry you're going through this! theres only so much you can do, you have to take care of yourself. i would look into other types of care available to her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/u7c7ww/struggling/,,Struggling
"i am 35 now with a parent with alzheimers. i grew up caring for other family adults with mental illness, on top of that my family has a history of domestic violence experienced from my father. me and my older sister have put our lives on hold to survive our past to then care for family members on my mother side including my mother now who has alzheimers. at this point i can't help but wishing sometimes that god can just take her peacefully in her sleep.we live in nyc and the health care services for alzheimers patients are limited and underdeveloped for caregivers to use (aides are not properly trained and memory loss facilities are another form of neglect) for so long i've had to leave jobs and couldn't move else where because of all the responsibilities of caregiving. my love life is short lived with many partners getting the drained version of me (sometimes having to leave my dates since due to constant calls from the aides not being able to handle my mom or my sister needing my help) unfortunately putting her in a home would kill her faster. she asked us to promise her to never put her in a home and she was a great single mother to us even after surviving a gunshot wound from my abusive father. this woman deserves the world but she also had us take care of other family members which created a caregiver trauma cycle for me and my sister. i am even scared to have kids because i don't want to take care of no one else i'm tired of being a caregiver and i want out but i don't see any way out other than to place her in a home which we know will kill her faster or a natural death. i'm exhausted. i love her but i can't help to feel resentful for trying to survive and not being able to live the life that i wish to have. does anyone feel the same about wishing their person died of a natura cause so they can free themselves of the responsibility? i feel guilty for this but then i honestly wouldn't mind.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/u5wzbm/i_am_a_caregiver_and_daughter_of_an_alzheimers/,,I am a caregiver and daughter of an alzheimers parent and I feel guilty for...
"in january of this year my uncle passed away and within days of his passing her daughter, my cousin, showed up at her house and bullied and threatened her into signing a poa that gave her everything. she's also printed out a last will and testament and told my aunt that it was a living will. the daughter had major recipient that will which as you know you cannot do when you are power of attorney for someone. you can in no way in which your self. i drove down from north florida to south florida and picked up my aunt to bring her home with me to keep her safe. this was with her full consent. i had not seen her since the beginning of the to baker act her so that she could get evaluated and treat it. they refused telling me i just needed to get along along with her and while i had realized everyday on the phone talking to her that they were serious memory issues going on i did not realize that there was such a depth of dementia. during the pandemic she had experienced a prolapsed bladder, within weeks of coming to my house she had a full-blown uti which causes people with dementia to have horrible behaviors and hallucination. she woke up one morning coming after me aggressively and within a few hours locked me out of the house when i tried to walk away from her to get some peace. i knew something was seriously wrong and knew that it wasn't safe to get in the car with her so i called the police here in jacksonville florida to baker act her so that she could get evaluated and treated. they refused telling me i just needed to get try to get along with her and then she had nothing wrong with her. my aunt can act normal when she chooses to because their dementia is very early and while this is unusual it does happen. it took me 6 hours and another visit by the police to convince them that she had to go to the hospital and that i was not safe. memorial hospital evaluated her and held her for 3 days and did brain scans and diagnosed her with dementia with behaviors. i already had her in a doctor's practice here in jacksonville and we had all agreed that we needed to do neurological testing and nail down what type of dementia it was and how to go forward.the hospital recommended assisted living until she could get the surgery and we made arrangements for all of that to happen this week. however there were serious problems in the assisted living facility and i brought her home with me as we were only a few weeks away from getting the surgery. within a week she had another uti and this time it was absolutely unbelievable. the police would not baker act her again, they claim they knew she didn't have dementia which is ridiculous. i was on the phone with the doctors and social workers locked in my bedroom while watching my aunt on camera to make sure she was safe. she eventually ran out the door screaming that she was going to call anybody she could find with a phone the tell the police that i had kidnapped her and was hurting her. i need the police came and took her to the hospital. unfortunately she went to baptist hospital where they decided, with no brain scans are testing that she did not have dementia because she did not present symptoms when she was there. the next thing i knew the police were called on me and d c f was investigating me for kidnapping, mental anguish, and abuse. i presented my p o a, all of the brain scan information and diagnosis for memorial hospital and yet the police still maintained the she didn't have dementia. there was only one doctor memorial it was saying this and yet the police ran with it. meanwhile i'm still caring for her, arranging for another assisted living facility and paying the bills behind the scenes. the day she was supposed to be transferred to assisted living my aunt reached out to her daughter, the one who had abused her and that dcf had found the complaints for valid and the daughter came and picked her up. baptist was willing to release her to her. at this point the police called me and told me they were charging me with stealing her car even though my address is listed as hers because she was living with me. my aunt and her daughter came to pick up the car with four police officers and i would not answer the door because i was not going to go through it. i had left the keys for them to take the car. according to the police i'm still under investigation for all this and they refuse to believe that she has dementia in spite of memorial hospitals in her primary doctors diagnosis. i have reached out to an attorney. i'm still terrified and i guess no good deed goes unpunished. jacksonville police are freaking flueless and please do not take your elderly relative with dementia to baptist hospital!!"," well, that was quite an account.  i hope things go okay with these legal charges you are possibly facing.  please have nothing further to do with your aunt and cousin -

"this is my first post here, and it probably won’t be my last. i’m leaving a lot out and choosing to focus on *one* situation, so i may mention a few things that i don’t really clarify or add on to. i’m not great at getting straight to the point, and this is a bit of a ramble because i’ve had nowhere else to talk about it.i started ‘sitting’ with an elderly lady (i’ll just call her miss c) last week. this is what the time i’ve spent with her has looked like so far:- thursday (9am-12pm)- saturday (8am-8pm)- friday (3pm-11pm)- today (9am-12am)and i’m going to be honest, i’m already feeling burnt out. all the other jobs i have had have always been childcare, and i wasn’t feeling nearly as burnt out as a nanny as i am right now. i’m dealing with my own health issues and long-term effects from having covid twice this year, including a migraine that i’ve had every day for nearly a month now. i have chronic illnesses and for many of them, fatigue is my worst symptom. i’m so tired. i feel horrible. i don’t have to **do** much of anything. grab her something to eat when she’s ready, hand her meds when it’s time, occasionally help her adjust how she’s sitting, grab her a blanket, fix her socks, and help her if she needs help pulling her ‘underwear’ up because she’s very unbalanced and struggles at moments. i literally just sit here because she watches the news and naps. i don’t care for the news for multiple reasons and it’s very repetitive when it’s on all day, so my brain is just overwhelmed and overstimulated each day that i’ve been here. her daughter is so nice, and i fully understand that she needs a break at times. she stays with miss c overnight and most of the time when her worker isn’t here. i’m currently taking over for the regular caregiver who would be here these times i have been, but miss c’s daughter is under the assumption that this lady will request less hours if she knows i can be here. so far, i have a pretty full evening and weekend schedule through the end of the month though. i’m also mentally exhausted. someone i’m close with is her regular worker (tues &amp; thurs), and i brought up some pretty big similarities between my grandma and miss c. my grandma was diagnosed with alzheimer’s last year and for the last couple years, i’ve been regularly caring for her when i can. so i was around to note certain things and to also learn how to handle some of it. miss c sees things and hears things that aren’t there. she often thinks the news people are looking at her or saying her name as well as other behaviors. i’ve been trying to handle it how i do with my grandma — not shutting her down or telling her she told/asked me something already. basically just letting her talk and making appropriate sounds or saying something when it seems needed. because i don’t want to make her feel crazy or have her get upset with me. i’m not a doctor, and i’m not trying to diagnose her. but her regular worker says the reason she doesn’t receive more care through the senior center or even hospice is because her daughter doesn’t want to admit to the fact that there may be something else going on. i’m hoping that except for maybe an occasional evening or saturday that after this month, this isn’t a regular thing. i get $10/hr which is more regular than my last nannying job, but this isn’t worth it to me mentally and physically right now. i got home at 11pm last night and didn’t sleep well, so i was up at 6am and here at 8:50am. i’m ready to go home and want to cry when i realize i still have 12-13 hours to go. i love miss c and she’s so sweet, but i am so drained. how do you deal with this type of burnout? if feels ridiculous even calling it burnout when this is only my 4th day, but that’s what it feels like. it doesn’t seem right considering i don’t even do much of anything while i’m here."," if you’re burnt out on day 4, i would look for a different job. being a caregiver is not easy money, it’s difficult to care for another human being. there’s nothing more you can do if you’re already not happy, it doesn’t get easier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/u4zvza/bunt_out_on_day_4/,,Bunt Out on Day 4
"i don’t know if this is the best place to post this, but i’m currently in the hospital with my mother (58f) who has osteomyelitis in her back after (what the doctor’s believe) having a herniated disc surgery back in july 2021. she’s experiencing mental confusion and seems agitated and has even raised her voice at me, which is not her normal behavior at all. im absolutely terrified, i can’t stop crying. my mom’s still aware of her surroundings, who she is, who i am. she can answer all her own medical questions. she acts completely normal, but then she’ll start saying that my sister or some random extended family members are outside in the hallway, laughing and crying. they’re not, i’m the only one here to visit her.im not allowed to stay over night due to the hospitals policy (i’m guessing covid related?) but last night my mom called me every hour, telling me my uncle was in the hospital and she could hear him screaming. my uncle just so happen to be sleeping over at our home and i was able to pass the phone to him after her 4th phone call to prove to her that he was in fact ok. i barely slept. as i’m also my sister’s caregiver (she has cp) i had to wake up early to get her ready so i could go and spend the day with my mom. the doctors aren’t too concerned about it because she acts completely normal, but then there’s moments where she changes. she’s desperate to go home and part of me feels the hospital is aggravating the mental confusion, but i’m afraid of her getting agitated at home and it’s just me there, or the worst for me would be that she gets stuck in this cognitive state. her mother had dementia/alzheimer’s and my mom and i cared for her 3 years before she passed away. i know dementia is hereditary and i’m afraid she’s developed it or something. i guess i’m wondering if this is something she can come back from, heal from or is this just the beginning of the end? sorry this is long, i don’t have anyone to talk to about this."," thank you to everyone who replied, i’ve had my hands full with mom, so i haven’t been able to reply but i feel so heard and understood, thank you all ♥️mom gave us a scare this morning, she was sweating profusely and he blood pressure was super high. they checked her heart and lungs and she was fine. they gave her loads of medicine to lower the bp and it worked. while she had hbp she barely spoke. now she’s back to speaking, delirious but at least she’s speaking and responding compared to earlier. i’ve taken some of the advice given to me. i went home last night, turned off my phone and slept. i plan on doing the same tonight now that’s she’s stable. the doctors believe she might be delirious because of the infection in her back or the antibiotics. so they’re planning on switching up the type of antibiotics to see if there’s a difference. they also moved her to a room with lots of windows. im feeling calm and hopeful that everything is going to be alright.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/u4ibls/mom_suffering_from_mental_confusion_due_to_an/,,Mom suffering from mental confusion due to an infection
"i'm in a bit of an interesting situation but i've already tried a million other subreddits and have had no luck ... i'm hoping i have finally found a place to put this post. i was recently hired as a teacher at a senior citizens center (it is not a personal care center or an assisted living facility but rather a place where seniors go during the day for activities) and i've been running into a lot of challenges. i'm a university instructor and normally teach undergrads - i knew going in that it wouldn't be the same and i've already done many things to accommodate, which i have absolutely no problem with and i'm happy to do. i was extremely excited to start this job and now, i'm afraid of going in. one of the people i teach (let's call them student ""a"") has been a particular challenge and class is like an emotional roller coaster, constantly shifting from one extreme to the other. ""a"" gets huffy and angry at me, things get better momentarily, the mood lightens up and then things get bad again. over and over. it makes me extremely unsettled and it's impossible to stay on task and keep the class organized. i have no idea how to handle this. ""a"" gets extremely impatient with me as i'm teaching. this is just an example, but i give very easy to follow step-by-step handouts to the students and i go over the concepts that we're talking about directly following the handout (usually numbered or organized in boxes) ... i'll start from the top, going down in a stepwise fashion and as i'm on number 1 or 2, ""a"" starts interrupting me with questions about number 8 or 9 on the handout, i'll say ""we'll get to that in a minute - i'll be happy to answer it in a second,"" and they just keep derailing the whole thing .... and then proceed to get upset at me because they're then lost and have no idea where they are. this next part i feel really bad about: ""a"" becomes extremely frustrated with themselves out loud during the class, going on and on about how 'stupid' they think they are and comparing themselves to others. i keep reassuring them over and over but it gets to the point where it's disruptive for the whole class and holds the class up. we haven't been able to finish one full lesson because of this and i've had to plan lessons around it. they had 4 outbursts like this in the last class and each class is only one hour. i absolutely don't want them to feel that way. also, i may be completely misinterpreting and i'm trying to be as differentiated as possible, but sometimes it seems like it is being said passive-aggressively in order to get me to do something differently instead of saying what the actual thing is.i've been getting a lot of odd criticism and i know that it's from ""a."" instead of filling out the feedback forms i've given the students in class (these aren't required by the way, i make them for myself to make sure i'm accommodating everyone) or emailing me directly as i've also suggested, ""a"" goes and reports me to the director of the center and when i come in to teach, they always say ""the director wants to speak with you before class starts."" last week, the complaint was that ""a"" was offended that i'm ""not looking them in the eye"" enough when i'm talking and that they weren't being ""entertained enough"" by the class. no matter how crazy some of these complaints are, the director always seems to side with ""a."" i desperately need the income from this job and every time i walk in, i feel like i'll be losing the job on the way out. multiple people have suggested that this person may have early stage or undiagnosed dementia based on the mood swings in class and other behavior and i'm trying to be extremely empathetic but it's starting to wear me out. i have absolutely no training of this nature and i give all the credit in the world to the people who do. i feel like an awful person for not being able to help feeling frustration about this - i feel like i'm getting barked at, like there's a lot of undue hostility and it's dragging me down. does anyone have any suggestions on what i can do to gently put this person in their place when they're rude to me or being extremely disruptive? or how i can manage my emotions surrounding this? it's really my first time working at a job like this."," while i don’t have any direct experience with dementia, it does sound like “ a “ has some behaviors that fall in line with that condition. check out “dementia careblazers” on youtube or instagram- she gives good, clear information on redirection, validation and deescalation. i also agree with sophess’ suggestions for managing the situation - without knowing exactly what the root of the issue is, it seems that accentuating the positive in each situation might be the best way to get by. something like “ great eye “a!” i’m making my way to number 4 and i appreciate you pointing that out!” and then making a positive reference to “a” again later when you address it : “ as (favourable adjective ) “a” pointed out ….” sometimes people in care facilities just want attention and after being lonely for so long, they no longer care if it is good or bad. you’re here posting about to handle it, so you obviously care- and i’m sure it will work out. just stick with it , you’ll win “a” over. 💕",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/u1o44o/having_difficulties_teaching_at_a_seniors_center/,,Having difficulties teaching at a Senior's Center ... any suggestions?

"i'm 20 years old, almost 21 in a few months and since i dropped out of college in my first semester in 2019, i have been living with my grandparents because they told me they needed help and wanted me to come live with them so i could help them, and they wanted me to live there with the only stipulations of being a caregiver and helping out with chores. my grandfather has parkinson's disease and dementia, and my grandmother has age-related issues as well as some minor health issues and possibly onsetting dementia, so they needed someone who could be present whenever accidents happened such as falls, and to help with various different tasks like doing the dishes. in reality, i have done everything in this house unpaid - chores, yard work, grocery shopping, being a nearly 24/7 caretaker for a parkinson's victim, cleaning, etc. as of recently, i've gotten a new job where i work nearly 12 hours a day, so my availability to do these things has decreased a lot, but i still try to help out when i can.at the time that i originally moved in, my stepbrother and his wife were also there living with them, but after about 6 months to a year they ended up getting into really bad fights with each other over my grandma fucking them over with land she was going to give them so they could build a house on, but she ended up telling them after six months of complete radio silence that it probably wasn't going to happen. my stepbrother told her to go fuck herself and hasn't talked to her since. this was in late 2020 or mid-2021, i can't remember correctly.when they moved out, my responsibilities practically doubled - i don't mind - but at the same time, this was the start of a long war of my grandmother disregarding anything i do for her and nearly always telling me that i'm using her. i've had on and off jobs through the last few years because oftentimes, either i can't hold a job because i'm needed so much, or her abuse puts me through so much depression i end up not being able to go to my job. for example, several times with my newest job, there have been several times where she will just leave to go to the grocery store shortly before i have to go to work and will leave me to watch my grandpa, and then end up making me late to work by 15-ish minutes. i've talked to my long-distance partner about this, and he believes that she's possibly trying to crutch me in a way so that i have to continue to help them because she is aware that i'm desperately trying to save up money so that i can move into an apartment with my boyfriend far away from them.some examples of the things she does that i feel are abuse are leaving me to watch my grandpa before work, waking me up early in the morning before work to complain about things that i consider very menial such as how ""you left a pan in the dishwasher last night, ugh you always just leave so much work for me"" so i end up being exhausted before work, telling me that my severe adhd and insomnia are just excuses to get out of responsibilities, and slowly taking away my rights to privacy like telling me i have to put my personal computer in the living room and taking my bedroom door off of its hinges because i told her i didn't want to. she has always told me that i never do enough for her, but over the last half-year or so, she has started threatening me with homelessness every other day and telling me that i constantly use her by living here and not doing every single thing she asks me to. her words - ""you do anything and everything i ask you to do without question.""she told me yesterday that she has completely lost any respect for me because of how much i ""use"" them, and that over the last several years the only time she can ever remember me helping around the house was doing dishes once or twice, and moving the laundry once or twice but only because i had to do my own laundry. she then told me that i had until tonight to move my pc into the living room, or tomorrow she would have someone come in here and move it without my permission and proceeded to tell me that if she needed to have the police involved to have me evicted, she would do so. i told her that if she wanted me out that bad, she could just tell me and i'll leave. i'll be homeless but i'll leave, and she told me that she doesn't want me to because she doesn't want me to be living in my car. i've tried so damn hard to be able to save up to move out and with my partner, but it's been extremely difficult because it's been really hard for me to hold a job, and it feels like even now she's trying to push it even worse. i've luckily been able to save up $1,000 so far, but i have a goal of around $8-10,000 before i feel comfortable moving to a completely different country because i'll have to spend time there without a job before i'll become eligible. i've gone into a lot of credit card debts and other debts because i couldn't work but still had to pay my bills and lapsed on some of my bills, and for a while, my grandma gave me her credit card to do her shopping and would say ""hey since you do so much for us, you can use it now and then to buy yourself something"" so every now and then i would buy lunch on my work break, gas as she said i could fill up my gas tank once a month for doing her shopping, small things like this, and often times i paid her back for it, but she has now tallied up every single purchase that isn't gas and is trying to tell me i owe her hundreds of dollars back from the ""gift money"" she let me use, which by the way i told her i would pay unconditionally and i have started a schedule of paying her back, but she still tries to use this against me. she does the whole argument of ""you owe me everything, you should be doing everything for me. do all this yard work and other stuff for me unpaid etc.""i've tried desperately to talk to family about this, but with the exception of my dad, most of the time what happens is that my mom/step-dad will find ways to twist it back on me to try and make me feel bad because they don't want to have to be in this position again. they even tried to offer me a $500 laptop to hide in my room because ""it's more worth it to keep you here"" when i was crying to her about how i was going insane doing this. like, the computer isn't even close to being the root of any of the problems right now. sure it sets a lot of fuel to the fire, but it's not the roots. there are many times when i have called my mom about it, and she will tell me ""it is her house so it's not really my place to say anything. i don't agree with what she's doing, but it's her house. you have to do everything she asks you to do."" my mom has had a very long history of abusing me mentally and trying to gaslight me into feeling bad because she tries to keep that hold on me no matter how bad she has treated me - telling me that i'm only non-binary because i'm following the crowd and i would be a plant if everyone else was doing it, telling me things like ""if you're pansexual why can't you just be with a woman so you don't make god mad,"" etc. and not only this, but constantly trying to twist words around to make me feel bad so that i keep living with my grandma to help her so she doesn't have to, but also trying to gaslight me into continuing to talk to her cause she's my mother. and for the most part, she's succeeded but i've recently realized what she's been doing to me for years and i blocked all contact with her and even got a new phone number. i just don't know what to do anymore. a lot of the things i've listed here are just the tip of the iceberg, i go through so much pain, humiliation, and depression over these things and it's really hard to be able to see a way out at this point. she succeeded for a long time in making it so i couldn't leave, and she has constantly mentally abused me and treated me like dirt shit and it makes me extremely depressed."," i live with grandparents that are like this as well. theyve kept me here on nothing but broken promises & i’ve been dealing with this shit all of my life. my dad passed away when i was 9, due to a drug overdose. & i got tied up in drugs for a while too, now that i’m sober i can see it wasn’t a me problem or a him problem, it was my grandparents’s neediness & constant abuse that sent us into a drug related lifestyle. i got to the point to where i’d rather sit in a alley with a needle in my neck than go home to my fucking grandma. they bought me a horse for helping them around the house & stuff, only to threaten to cut me out of the will..& give everything to their other son.. devin. devin is currently living in my dad’s trailer that was left in his will to me. when i asked him to move out, the whole family shunned me & made me the bad guy. my grandpa has physically abused me many times before, my grandma talks shit about me to him while i’m at work, & then when i get home i have to imidiately do their chores or i get abused by him. i took a nap one specific day instead of doing laundry for them, & i got dragged off the bed by my neck & my grandma laughed while it all happened.  old people like this are sick. there is no helping them. they use you. & they want you to feel as if you’re stuck with them & you have no where else to go.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/tz16ld/constantly_mentally_abused_by_my_grandma_and/,,"Constantly mentally abused by my grandma and after almost 2 and a half years of taking care of my grandparents, I'm just completely disregarded constantly by them and other family members."

"hey, all. thanks in advance for taking the time to read this or engage me, as i know too well how hard it is to keep our heads above water…my mom was finally diagnosed with alzheimer’s recently. i knew it was coming but my denial was coming from a place of trauma. i helped her care for my grandma when i was in middle/high school. i remember praying that it wouldn’t happen to my mom. so much for prayers… i’m their only child. i’m in the same borough of nyc as them, but not close enough. we’re working on moving them in with me. she is 100% resistant to another outside helper, which is frightening. i wouldn’t ever want to put her in a home, and i want to do the majority of the care which is what she’s begged for, but i myself have multiple sclerosis and stress=flare up and more disease activity. i don’t feel supported by the people closest to my life except for my best friend, and she has a child and her own health issues she’s addressing. i don’t know how to calm my mother down to open her mind to the idea of an aid once in a while. she had one for her mom, but if i bring that point up she has to relive that trauma and i don’t want to put her through that. my dad also has a personal space issue, but that’s the lesser of the two hurdles. because of my illness, i never finished college. i’m 30 and trying to pull my life back together and find an income after losing my last job during covid. my current job is a few times a month doing hostessing or coat check at a local catering hall. my partner has a host of his own family traumas they’re dealing with and our relationship seems to be becoming a casualty of our realities. i don’t know how to proceed. i don’t know how to make my relationship work and i’m tired of fighting for a semblance of normalcy. i don’t know how to make my mom understand that an extra helper is ok and she’ll be safe no matter what. there’s also that nagging feeling of “oh god, it’s happening again, your never gonna have your own life, you’ll never get to achieve your goals” and then the relentless guilt that comes along with that feeling. does anyone have any advice about the additional aid conversation? or advice in general about all of this? i sincerely feel as though i’m drowning. thank you again and love to you all"," as another chronically ill person working as a caregiver (ehlers danlos here!) i get the stress between balancing your own health with caregiving. one thing i recommend that you figure out what tasks affect your energy and stress in different ways. some things you may have no problem with and can do as much as you like while others might basically knock you out for the day. and that's okay! take care of yourself too. like for instance, i can usually cook without too much energy or stress, and do wound care with no problem, and run around fetching small stuff all day. but showering the person i caregive for takes a decent bit out of me, and phone calls stress me out, so i take extra care to make sure i have the energy to do those.in terms of getting her to accept extra help, it might be easier if she feels like she has a choice in it? if you could get her to befriend someone willing to help and then slowly ease them both into helping and being helped. it's scary accepting help, and even scarier accepting help from a stranger when your own brain is basically turning against you. establishing a rapport before any aid takes place might be the key to making her feel safe enough to accept it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/tykkgs/new_to_the_sub_dont_know_what_im_doing_and/,,"New to the sub, don’t know what I’m doing and feeling isolated"
"oct 15th i got a call at 6am. i missed it and saw the missed call after running inside from smoking a cigarette. i never get calls from my mom that early.  i called back and expected my mom to tell me my dad (72) had something wrong. he didn’t take good care of himself- to say the least. i called back instantly and my dad answered. he told me something was wrong with my mama. dad tells me mom is acting weird, throwing stuff over their patio gate and talking nonsense. i got in my car and drove the rice long minutes. unshowered and disgusting after three days working at home since covid fucked everything up.little did i know once i arrived and found my mother in a “psychosis” state, that this was the start of the end. five er visits and a geriatric psych stay later… from october 2020 to february 2021, mom stayed with me as i took care of her. dad is feeble and could not care for her the couple of times she came home from the hospital. she exhibited psychosis, paranoia, fear, etc. she was constantly wandering and seeing things. finally she stated several times she wanted to kill herself. (most optimistic, positive woman on earth) she thought dad and i were dead, even when talking to us. thus, the two week psych stay. from october to december 16th, were her five er trips and two week psych stay. in between that time- i got her rushed to neurologist. from the tests they could actually get done- they diagnosed her with rapidly progressing alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. wtf??? no previous signs?? needless to say, a wife, mom of an autistic son who works full time, this was absolutely murder on me. between doctors appointments, er, work, sons jr college and trying to be a wife- ending up an overnight full time caretaker was beyond comprehension. i am absolutely a mama’s girl. there was no question of taking care of my mom. but, i had no idea the toll it would take one me. from december 17th, i went from chasing my mom around to keep her safe, to cleaning her in bed by january. she went from being able to shuffle around to get to the potty, to being totally bed bound in a two week period. she could use a bedside commode for a week, then could no longer support herself. a month from that point, she finally stopped eating and drinking. february 25th, at 3:11 am, she passed- when she finally knew i found a moments sleep. in between all this- i still had to take care of my dad. (not!!! a daddy’s girl!!!) like i said he can’t drive- so it was his appointments too, food, medication pick ups- basically everything. he and mom had been highschool sweethearts and she spoiled him rotten. he didn’t know how to cook anything. to say o was completely frustrated and worn out didn’t begin to cover it. on top of this i found out my parents had zero money- they were living hand to mouth off their ss. hubby and i were going to move to tn later down the road- but after mom passed, dad couldn’t afford anything on one ss check…. so a month after mom passed, we bought a house in tn and put both our homes on the market. selling two homes at once and planning a moved from san diego to tn is no easy task. it has been a year since mom died. we are here in tn, getting used to our new life. i am still talking care of dad since he can’t do much for himself. i feel so overwhelmed and guilty for not wanting to take care of my dad, but my brother estranged himself from the family and there is no one else. sorry for the huge read…"," if dad is feeble and living hand to mouth on ss, he should likely qualify for a medicaid waiver, and get an in-home personal care aide!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/tyc8pw/my_post_from_last_night/,,My post from last night…
"my grandma passed away at 90 from dementia in march. we did home hospice and it was utterly exhausting. i've been out of work for 2 years caregiving, i have to return to my life as a 26-year-old.for decades, grandma was the primary caregiver of her son who survived a tbi and stroke in his 20s. she was instrumental in his recovery. they lived together since the 1980s. he has aphasia and like a dozen other medical conditions, and she prided herself on being the only person in the world who could understand his special language (*you can see where this is going*). when she was dying, he was angry that we were not putting her on a ventilator and feeding tubes. felt like she was declining because of us, not in spite of us (me, my mom/his sister, my brother)we moved him to an apartment across the hall from grandma's. started to create distinct spaces for his furniture and various things. untangled their expenses from each other's finances. started building a routine, social life, and activities for him, where she was one part of his day but not his entire day. made enough space to safely walk around the rooms. we even got him onto the medicaid waiver with a home care aide. tried to avoid a double trauma rocking his world. but of course, it takes a lot of energy and the more we try to clean up messes and try to prevent foreseeable disasters, the more he manufactures drama, injures himself, and creates new problems.we have to empty out her condo. she was sentimental and frugal (in theory), the disabled son tends to actually hoard. some mix of sentimentality, frugality, optimism (barely started projects), admitted his ""pre-accident self"" abilities won't ever return to 100, and likely the fear that getting rid of the items means the memory is gone. he has never wanted to get rid of anything even items that were broken beyond repair. we had to get rid of a lot of broken items directly from the basement behind his back because he would try to stop us. now the condo has to become actually empty. any thoughts??? advice???", have him select a dozen things that are most meaningful to him.  get a friend or family member to take him out shopping and for lunch while you have a hauler pull everything out and take it to the donation center or the dump.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ty4ae3/cleaning_out_deceased_grandmas_home_her/,,Cleaning out deceased grandma's home.

"i don't know what to think. i am a caretaker for both my grandparents but most of my focus has been on my grandmother and her dementia. this just hurts way worse for some reason. i almost miss the days when her aggression was my worst problem. it was sad enough to see my grandfather become affected by that. now this. for context, he had been in the hospital over the weekend with extremely low blood sugar, the hospital decided to take him off some stuff and cut some of his meds in half. so today we were going through all his meds and and a nurse came by and we all sorted out what was actually needed and what wasn't and that is how i found out the truth. i feel so bad for not knowing all this about him. he is overweight, though recently he lost 15lbs just from not eating as much anymore. i hate bothering him about how he eats too, as that has been going on for years and i feel like he is tired of it. i feel bad reminding him of it. i don't know if it's too late anyways. also he will be having a physical therapist coming 3 times a week now so i hope that will also help with movement and maybe exercise. he has so many problems, diabetes, lymphedema, high blood pressure etc. he is 82 and knowing everything he has its amazing he is still here. i'm sure he's not feeling too good about all this either. i really have no words for how devastated i am. i'm not ready to let him go. i feel so bad for him, i just want him to be happy and have an easy life. the cardiologist appointment isn't soon but i needed to tell someone because i know i will be dysfunctional and spiraling until then. does anyone have any experience with this? i know i should be telling all this to a doctor but i am desperate to help him and i need help to calm myself down. maybe some words of advice? i don't know anything about life with heart failure besides what i just read on google. thanks anyways if you read this.", i have congestive heart failure since one and a half years now. i control it with medication.  i al's eat a healthy diet. i lost 20 pounds. i am able to live a full life and enjoy time with my grandchildren,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/txzwc5/just_found_out_my_grandfather_has_heart_failure/,,Just found out my grandfather has heart failure
"looking for advice and support. i come from a large family, 7 siblings. parent, grace 80f, has developed dementia and has been the primary caregiver for physically disabled daughter for 50 years. daughter, carrie, is on longterm care assistance from the state. she talks but cannot care for herself in any way. grace does everything for her and it’s starting to impact her own health heavily. now that grace is older i started going over everyday to help cook and clean. i have my own family at home but grace and carrie were not doing ok on their own. missing meals, wearing dirty tattered clothes, the house was filthy. some of my siblings have gone over periodically but have prioritized they’re own lives, no judgements from me but there’s a lot of us and some help would be nice. the biggest issue im having now is the rest of the family want to keep them together and i think they should separate. carrie needs full time care beyond what any one of us can give her. feeding, changing, incontinence, and doesn’t sleep through the night. she cannot move on her own from the neck down and is about 130lbs. i feel that leaving them together forces mom to keep caring for carrie. i think it’s making her decline more rapidly and she just cannot do it anymore. im afraid an accident or emergency will happen one of these days and one of them will die because they are alone. my siblings think they can find a live in caregiver for both for about 5k a month. the assistance carrie receives will not cover it. full time caregivers are already sometimes unreliable at home and hard to find. realistically i don’t see this happening. it’s caused a lot of ugly arguments. the family is split. i can’t continue taking care of them everyday. im burnt out and its taking a toll. ive been outcast by my siblings who want them to stay together. they even accused me of benefiting from the situation because i take my kids over and we often eat dinner (that i make) at moms. i take them to grocery shop, medical appointments, i cook and clean and help feed, wash and change my sister carrie. i don’t know what to do anymore except step down and wait for the inevitable. i question myself everyday wondering if im wrong for thinking carrie needs to be in a care facility yesterday. everyone that doesn’t help seems to be yelling the loudest about keeping them together. any advice or support helps.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/txw9mq/family_battle/,,Family battle
"i am a care giver.. or so i thought. my grand dad started going down hill about a year ago, we had hired one person previously to take care of him but he would complain constantly about her actions. which thinking back were what you would expect of a care giver. fast forward 3 months and i have begun to take care of him instead, what i thought would be a good opportunity to become closer with my grandad in his final months has become more damaging than i could have ever predicted. i am a care giver, i scrub the sinks with a toothbrush, i dust and polish every piece of wood furniture once a week, i sweep mop vacuum and carpet clean once a week. i tend to the garden, i mow and weedeat his 4 acre land, i clean the toilets 3 times a week, i clean the windows once a week, i clean the mirrors once a week, i make breakfast, lunch and dinner, do the laundry every 3 days, drive him wherever he needs to go, clean all kitchen appliances once a week, clean the front and back porch as needed, rake leaves as needed, do all of the grocery shopping.i work on any of 7 antique cars whenever asked, im on the roof cleaning gutters and replacing shingles whenever needed, maintaining yard tools such as weedeaters and mowers, paint the walls whenever desired.long story short if there's any sort of job to be done, i'm doing it. whether it be maintenance, cleaning, or actually taking care of my grand dad. all things said and done i'm able to complete the tasks with ease, the issue comes from where even with the tasks i do, i receive $300 a week, i have my own family and home and i declined a job offer for nearly $20 an hour so i could make sure he was properly taken care of. i don't get any holidays off, i don't get any breaks, i don't get any time off. i cannot rest after a hard job such as weedeating his creek (approx 2 hours of work) or i'll get a comment such as ""i don't pay you to sit, get to work"" and constantly belittled infront of his hospice nurse and social worker because i ""don't do any work"" my goal in the post is to understand is my power of a care giver being taken advantage of? should our family hire an actual care giver instead of me? my grand dad used to hire cleaners and contractors to take care of his home, now it's solely my responsibility to take care of every aspect inside this roof, one of the biggest issues i have is being cursed at or to about the work that needs to be done. i'll do the work, but i don't appreciate being cursed for the sake of it. he is a vietnam veteran with lung cancer, dementia, copd, enlarged heart and 100% blocked inner carotid artery."," since money doesn’t seem much of an issue for him, it is really hard to understand why he doesn’t hire people to do all the maintenance like he used to. the simple answer seems to be - he is taking advantage of you. and while there are certain difficult situations where there is no other solution, this is not it. you should see yourself not as a servant, but as his house manager. if he says - repair this or that, you are responsible for hiring someone to do that, not to do it yourself. it seems that could apply to most tasks.and please, negotiate a decent wage, there is no reason to hold your grandad as more important than your family. in the long run, it can very badly backfire on your relationship with your own family. you are already burnt out, and that will soon spread to your partner.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/txqii1/am_i_a_caregiver_or_a_maid/,,"am I a caregiver, or a maid?"
"**before reading**: this will be a long and detailed story. i had to share this with someone and share our story. i ask for any advice and help from anyone because i don’t know what to do to help get us out of this situation. my family is everything to me and i refuse to let our lives be ruined once again. i’d like to first give some background about my family. there are four of us kids, ranging from 17-20. two boys, c and e, and two girls, m and p (me,18), and our single mother, d. we live in ohio. we are all white for clarity. we have been below the poverty line our whole lives, have been homeless before, gone through recovery, and all of us have severe mental illnesses and some physical problems. d has incredibly debilitating asthma, to the point she cannot function at all. i’d like to say that even though we’ve been through tough shit before, we’ve learned to handle it pretty well and stick together no matter what. we bought a house for the first time in 2019 with the help of our grandmother. at the time, d had a full time job and a full time gig as a babysitter for our family friends. for once we felt secure and steady. however, the family ended up firing d as their babysitter, after 4 years of raising their daughter in 2020. due to covid, d also lost her full time job. everything started going downhill after that. my mother decided to get back into caregiving for elderly and disabled people. this was really hard for her considering that she has intense ptsd. she was responsible for taking care of her very sick father for her entire childhood and throughout adulthood until he died in 2013. d also went to nursing school and worked as an emt for a couple years until she had to drop out. so she absolutely is qualified and knows what she's doing.  while working gig to gig throughout the first part of 2021, in august, d found a listing for what she thought was a younger man who was taken care of for the most part by his parents. the listing was $10/hour, three days a week, and evening/nights. combined with other gigs, this was good enough. when she was later interviewed, she found out that the man (h) was in his 60’s and supposedly taken care of by his sister (j), and two other caregivers, one of which was more need-be. seems normal enough, so she ended up taking the position. up until october, everything was totally fine and matched with what she signed up for. during october, s, the other caregiver gets fired for using while working. our family is very understanding of that type of situation, so no judgment. the need-be caregiver kind of just slowly stopped coming as well. j is also nowhere in the picture and my mother wasn’t even given contact information for her. h’s parents also don't really touch base. us kids realize that mom is not coming home. from october to december, d was left to take care of h, who needs 24/7 care. obviously my mother knows what is happening, yet because of her ptsd with this kind of stuff, she is literally unable to differentiate reality and the past. she is constantly arguing and begging with h that she needs help. he ceases to ask his family to help, hire another caregiver, or do anything. she was still able to function when she had to, but she was slowly dying and no one cared except for my siblings and i. my sister and i would come over multiple times a week to help her with h. at this point, my mother is unwillingly stuck taking care of h 24/7 with no way out. since we were never expecting this to happen or wanted it to, my mom is sleeping on a couch every night, doesn’t have access to her daily meds, has a weeks worth of clothing, paying out of her pockets for h’s medical supplies, paying for two houses worth of food, alone (for the most part), and losing her fucking mind. where it gets even better is that since october, h is either flat out not paying my mother, or is paying her an average of $3 an hour. we were already poor and now we are quite literally broke. not only that, h went to the hospital at least once a month because of how sick he was. because of his special ventilator and the lack of knowledge from the medical professional on how to operate it, d was required to take the ambulance to the hospital with him every time. for the first couple of visits, she would stay there the entire time. mostly because she was worried that the hospital wouldn’t take adequate care of him, which they didn’t. if she wanted to leave, to visit her kids for example, she would have to uber to and back, which was deducted from her pay. and at that point, she was so broke that she had to use h’s card. she also didn’t have access to the account info, nor was she told how much was spendable or not. so any accidental overdraws she made would also be deducted from her already non existent pay. because of how much h manipulated her, she believed that she needed to be there for him every time.around december, d was so desperate for help and company from another person, h finally agreed to have my sister move in, after weeks of begging from my mom. m at the time was working at petsmart and living with her boyfriend. agreeing, m quit her job and broke up with her boyfriend (which was coming regardless) and moved on in. h guaranteed that he was done with his bullshit and would be paying both m and d fairly. surprise, surprise, and shame on us, because of course that didn’t happen and continues to not happen. around january (2022), even though i knew what i was getting into, i decided to also move in. i wanted to be with my mom and make sure she knew we loved her and would always help her. once that happened, mom was finally able to have the time and ability to work on getting this shit fixed. she was able to reach out to h’s parents and sister to explain what was really happening and what h was doing to us. did they care? no. not only did they continue to let it happen, but they had the audacity to judge d for not doing well (physically and mentally), not believe anything she was telling them, turning a blind eye to the lack of pay, and blame d for what was happening to us. they also started to show up to h’s house without any notice or warning to just bash my mother for *her* wrong doings. during this, our car was repossessed making it even harder to be able to pack and leave, we don't have the money to even be able to pay one months worth of mortgage, lost our food stamps, and have been going through incredibly hard mental health. our plan as of now, which isn’t even solid because there is no stability whatsoever, is to get our house repaired and sold before it gets foreclosed on at the end of april, find whatever car we can, and move to texas where our grandmother is. if we can’t manage to sell our house in time, my grandmother will have to file bankruptcy for the 2nd time and will absolutely disown us, which will most likely leave us homeless and financially ruined.we now know that h is not mentally stable enough to be making these types of decisions, and most likely has some form of dementia. which may excuse his actions in my mothers eyes, but not mine. about a week or two ago, j decided to come back into the picture to take care of her brother. based on her decisions and actions, she doesn’t listen to my mothers medical opinion on h’s condition and health, nor the doctors’ recommendations. she quite literally is not qualified for any of this. and of course, my mother has communicated with j as much as possible. however, she continues to not communicate with d about anything. this past week, j has been offering other caregivers hours and out of pocket cash pay at the end of each shift, which is 12 hours max, including sleep. has she offered or mentioned these shifts to my mom, sister, or i who are very much still living here and taking care of h when j or the original need-be caregiver from the beginning is here? no. this is where we stand as of now and all we can do is see what happens next. although there has been more bad than good during this situation, i want to mention the silver-linings that we have been lucky to receive. when our car was initially repossessed, h’s parents let us borrow a car for a couple days so that mom, c, and e could work on our house. our friends have kindly given us rides when they can. m has a part time job that is making us more of a stable income. i have given my small savings to my mom to help. our tax returns came quick and contained about 2/3 of our budget for a car. j has apologized for her actions and will hopefully treat us kindly now. i’ve learned much needed medical experience/knowledge. i have learned to read lips better (due to a trach tube, h goes between mouthing words to talking).i am so beyond disgusted by this whole thing and it has changed my entire view on life. it has shown me that a lot of people are awful and selfish, that i need to always stand up for myself, and how important family is to me and how many sacrifices they are worth. thank you for listening."," you sound like someone who has been able to hold yourself together and assess this rapidly deteriorating situation. that's a good thing and it will carry you far.h needs a very big team, capable of making decisions rather than maintaining the status quo even as the ship is sinking. his sister, not your mother, needs to understand this, and needs to coordinate with social workers, doctors and whomever else she can get.your mother has done her part and it's time for her to leave.your mother is stuck in a dangerous cycle of ptsd. she can't extricate herself because of her mindset, so you. have to do it for her. get her home, call h's parents and say one thing: ""she's not coming back."" then make a second call to social services elder care unit and lay out the situation. you do not have to identify yourselves to them. just make the call.  it's time for them to step in.best luck with your move to tx.  you're making good choices surrounding the house. you all need to go where you have more support, and while h's family has been nice in loaning you the car, again, you are reliant upon a family that has a very bad track record of making decisions. texas will be better, though make sure you all are getting the medical and mental healthcare you need, and that each of you chooses a career path. vocational or professional, these are incredibly important years for you, and you should be looking to gain skills that will be applicable in a growing industry in a few years time. don't be afraid to shoot for the moon. you sound smart, capable, and resourceful. just remember that teamwork, networking, resource gathering, as well as knowing when to change course (which includes an exit plan) will be the way to continue in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/tvp7oq/my_family_and_i_are_stuck_and_we_need_help/,,My family and I are stuck and we need help

"hey gang, bare with me while i try to verbalize this lol.as brief as i can make our backstory/journey: a year and a half ago my mil passed away very unexpectedly. my fil has dementia and 2 terminal lung diseases. so, we became his caregivers. you guys don't need all the details of the hell and trauma we have been through navigating all of this, i know you get it.all of that basically thrust my husband into being the patriarch of his family. he is the youngest of 3 boys and has a younger sister who is an adult. i'm certainly biased but my man is the cream of the crop. everyone has financial issues, kids scattered about with varying parents, just all kinds of life stuff. we have half joked that we're slowly being given custody of everyone in his family, adult or otherwise. it's been a lot.his dad wasn't the greatest dad before the dementia. lots of manipulation, lies, cheating on his wife, emotional and verbal abuse, physical fights, you name it: being a dad was never a priority to him. how my husband came through all he has and ended up this... just fucking phenomenal man is beyond me. he is loyal, hardworking, caring, every good thing you can think of. he will drop everything to help a friend or family member whenever needed. i could write a whole novel and still not tell you how much i love and admire him.i point out to people a lot that when we lost my mother-in-law, my husband pretty much lost both parents. having to provide care to his dad and absorbing the emotional abuse, not to mention seeing his dad abuse me as well and supporting me through that. making medical and financial decisions all the time, all of it. and all of it for a man who has never once in his life been kind or caring to him. now we're also put in a position of potentially being given custody of his 2 nephews from his sister too. and are involved as support while a niece is in foster and about to be given to a family member (of the niece's dad, not ours) as foster to adopt. so every week there's meetings and phone calls and court hearings with all of that. i know, i'm so sorry this is so long. i promise there's a trillion things i'm leaving out lol. the stress and anxiety is taking a toll on him now. he has never struggled with mental or emotional health previously. but this is all just too much on us and we're navigating it without our rock and unfailing support and unconditional love from his mom. he's getting older too so there's body pain, his stomach stays upset, he has trouble sleeping off and on. i'm looking for guidance and ideas of how i can care for him. i know the normal stuff like plenty of sex, encouraging video games, cooking comfort foods, you know the go to stuff for fellas needing some care. he won't get professional massages, we've tried that lol. i've offered to give him one myself but he's so unused to being cared for like that he turns me down.i love this man absolutely endlessly. we've been together half our lives and i would still marry him every hour if he asked me to. i'm very vocal about that, publicly and to him of course. i just need to crowdsource some different things i could try to provide care for him. little, quiet things or big gesture things. i want him to feel pampered and treasured and just... cared for deeply. if you made it this far, thank you and if you have any ideas for me then thanks in advance for those too! i hope all of us have some moments this weekend of feeling rested, relaxed and cared for."," awww. op, he sounds like a gem, a prince among men. i'm worried though that the ""getting older, being stressed"" stuff will make him ill—not just burned out.

"hi, i was wondering if anyone here could offer me some ideas or advice on what to do about my grandma. i am her caretaker (my job). she is in the stage of dementia where she has episodes of being very hostile and aggressive with brief moments of clarity sprinkled in. it has not been diagnosed because she believes the family doctor is a nazi so we gave up on trying to get some medication for that. she is usually nice, just confused often and asking many questions (where is the bathroom? where does that door go?). but when she becomes hostile she yells at my grandfather that he is a fascist, kills jews, all this crazy stuff and she hits him, throws things at him, and pushes his walker repeatedly into him. he is not in the best health with very bad legs (lymphedema) and has trouble moving around and i am afraid she will seriously hurt him. she also runs into the hallway of their apartment building (senior community) and screams what a bad person he is. we are worried someone will make a complaint and she will have to leave. my grandpa is very adamant about letting her go somewhere and says he will endure the abuse as long as possible. i can see it is really affecting him and see an otherwise very optimistic old man has now become very depressed on a regular basis. it hurts me so much to imagine how much it hurts him to see his partner acting this way and there is nothing to make it better. i cannot live with this and feel like i have to do something but i really don't know what. i am looking to find a new job immediately and find someone who is more skilled to take my place as i am soon to be 25 and think i should move on now. when she is acting aggressive she suddenly is able to move around more quickly and without a walker, knows where the door is to the hallway, how to work a lock and such things she can't do normally.  i can't figure out how to create some barrier for her to at least be unable to go into the hallway. if anyone has any ideas or advice it would be greatly appreciated. i am at my wits end. sorry for the really long post. thank you."," at my work if someone is acting aggressively we try to figure out the why e.g toileting, in pain ect. but sometimes people get aggressive because they've gone in their pad and their too abusive to change it. as horrible as it is sometimes you just need to leave and try again later because the aggression will only escalate if you stay there. is there any way that you and your grandad can leave the room whilst she is acting that way? both of your safety is important and i've seen people with training for this struggle too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/t0190h/advice_for_dealing_with_an_aggressive_person_with/,,Advice for dealing with an aggressive person with dementia

(she had lived with an older brother the past two years and absolutely hated living with them - bad fit - so the one sibling who said, ""live with us!"".......she hated that.)but maybe she will hate assisted living too and just hates getting old. i can't really blame her but it is heartbreaking to see someone be so unhappy all the time. i guess a side note is that she is very depressed, understandably. thank you for reading and i am sorry to whine after only such a short time caretaking. i wish i were a better person, honestly, i feel disappointed that i can't handle this as well as i had hoped. i hear stories of the loved one being mean, ill tempered - and geeze, here i am struggling so much and my mom's being nice! i can't even imagine. not saying she's a saint, but honestly, this is just hard right now and it's just not her fault. it just is."," something that helps me is remembering how my parent changed my poop diapers, cleaned me fed me, all during those ages i was incapable birth -4yrs. even if your mom did not do those things you still camped out in her uterus for an extended stay. i know your just venting hang in there. its everyday issue till one day its not.💖",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/sopki1/new_to_caregiving_and_wow_i_dont_know_how_people/,,"New to caregiving and wow, I don't know how people do this!"

"shortly  after the pandemic began in 2020, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. i  was in a position where i was able to take a break from work and moved  in to take care of her. when my mother was undergoing treatment, she was  high risk for infection, so for almost a year and a half i barely left  the house. she's been cancer free since about may, and i've been making  arrangements to move out.one  of such arrangements is that a family friend will be renting me an  apartment for significantly under market rent, though they have had  multiple setbacks to actually being able to rent the place to me (each  one is justified- they're not stringing me along). however, because i've  been waiting for their apartment to become available, i've been living  with my mother (and, admittedly, not paying rent) for a few months after  she's been cancer-free and no longer needed my help. earlier in the  year i was told i could move into the new apartment this month.concurrent  to this, my maternal grandmother has been in a nursing home for the  last decade, and for the last five years she's had advanced dementia  that's necessitated her being in a specialized care facility. i made  peace with the woman that is my grandmother having died long ago, but i  don't begrudge my mother for still caring for her. i do, however,  begrudge hearing my mother constantly whine and moan about the financial  stress her mother puts her under, whining and moaning that i absolutely  could not escape while living with her.my  grandmother's health has been rapidly declining over the last few weeks  and we got a call from my grandmother's doctor saying she probably  doesn't have long to live. and my first thought was ""oh god, i hope i'm  moved into my new apartment before she dies because i just don't want to  deal with my mom during this"". and i realize... this is pretty callous.  my mom is losing her mother; under any other circumstance i would be  happy to emotionally support her. but i am so, so drained from being a  caregiver for the past two years, coupled with the long isolation and  just some general negative personality traits of my mother that have  been amplified due to my close quarters with her.i  basically feel i need two sets of advice from you guys- on one hand, if  i have managed to move out before my grandmother dies, i'd love advice  on how to set boundaries and keep them firm, while also acknowledging  that, \*hey, if you love your mother maybe you shouldn't have super  strong boundaries while she's grieving her own mom\*. i want to reiterate  that while my mom is annoying at times, i do love her and want to help,  i just feel i have significantly reduced capacity to do so. and if i'm  \*\*not\*\* moved out by the time my grandmother dies, i need advice on  staying sane while my mother's grieving and i, clearly, will not be, and  how to cultivate what little bits of ""caregiver energy"" i have to best  direct them to support my mom.\---\*\*tl;dr\*\*:   i spent the past year and a half caring for my mother and have an  extreme case of caregiver fatigue. i currently live with her. i've been  told my maternal grandmother is dying and because of the fatigue i do  not believe i will be able to adequately attend to my mother's emotional  needs when her mother dies. how can i navigate this?"," i don’t think this is callous at all. i think this is so human. you’ve been carrying a heavy load for a long time, and it’s ok to want to unburden, as well as not take on any new burdens.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/sis9a4/i_29m_put_my_life_on_hold_to_care_for_my_mother/,,I [29M] put my life on hold to care for my mother [62F] while she had cancer.

"man this is a long story, bear with me! about 3 years ago my fil had a stroke. i've made a couple of posts about this in the past. after he got out of rehab we moved into his house with our 2 year old son and we're taking care of him(trying to anyway). we had made it very clear to him that if we moved in and it didn't work out we would be in a very tough position as rent in our city had doubled. (and we had been paying a very reasonable price where we were living at the time) we told him to think long and hard about it before deciding, and he did. he thought on it for about 4 months in fact, leaving us moving in last minute in the dead of winter when the rehab hospital told him he had to leave.the rehab hospital he stayed at was not very forthcoming in terms of his recovery and we quickly realized that he required a lot more care than we could reasonably provide him. ( he is completely hemiplegic and incontinent, he also suffers from vascular dementia, so his memory is very poor)his house was not handicap accessible. we did renovations to try and make it more comfortable for him (put in a stair lift, redid the bathroom, ramp outside). believe me when i tell you that we bent over backwards for this man. it was by far the most exhausted and broken i've ever been. we also had to co-sign on a home equity line of credit in order to pay for all of this. they still didn't give us much even though my husband and i both co-signed. ultimately he used the stair lift twice and it was a struggle. took one shower. he eventually decided to move to a nursing home that had round the clock staff/psws. we didn't even know he had made this decision until he'd already picked a place. right after he moved covid happened. (he moved in january 2020) i also got pregnant with our second son around that time. we admittedly, did not visit the nursing home a ton with the kids, for their safety and the safety of the other residents. in fact through most of the pandemic kids under 16 years were not permitted to visit even.(we brought our oldest son a number of times when covid counts were low but only brought the newborn once and not until he was a bit older) he has visited us on many many occasions at the house though and comes for every holiday.about a year ago he expressed to us that he was thinking about moving back into the house. (because the nursing home kept putting him in isolation and he desired more freedom). we reminded him that living in the house wasn't really working for him before, and told him especially with the new baby, we can't live with him again. we would have to move. we suggested perhaps he get a regular handicap accessible apartment, or to sell the house and try to find something more appropriate. it was never brought up again and we thought maybe he'd changed his mind.well on the weekend he had a complete meltdown. he accused us of abandoning him in a nursing home and waiting for him to die. he accused us of pressuring him into letting us move in in the first place. he said he'd been talking about moving back to the house ""for a whole year"" and we'd done nothing and should have moved by now. he tried to give us only 30 days to get out (yelling and swearing at us) we are absolutely going to move and have already found a place but, i'm really hurt and shocked that he's convinced himself that this is how everything unfolded. all we wanted was for him to be comfortable. he is very much not equipped to live in this house on his own. he can't even get out the door without help. i asked him how he plans to do yead work/take his trash bins to the side walk, he has no access to his mailbox, who is going to shovel snow ect.? he just said he'll ""figure it out"". i'm scared he is going to hurt himself living there alone. my husband is also really mad at him (he said a lot more hurtful and mean shit to us than i even mentioned) and doesn't want to be around him anymore. also because we have co-signed on his equity loan, there is no way we will be able to buy our own home until it is paid off (which will be like 20 years, or when he dies/sells the house, whichever comes first)have any of you had to deal with a family member with dementia turning on you like this? he thinks we are lying to him when we try to tell him that's not how this happened. is there anything we can do to try and salvage our relationship with him at this point? i'm so stressed and anxious and sad at this point i'm having chest pain. this is exactly what i worried would happen and why i was apprehensive about moving in with him in the first place."," not quite the same but we did experience similar issues.  owned 1/3 of father's home,  spent money on upgrades,  installed a chair lift, costing 9k only to be told a month later that he was moving to a retirement home.  such a slap in the face. dementia is such a horrible illness.  at around that time, my father treated me like i was the caretaker of the house and not his child. i had, however,  already moved out of the house a few years before to leave room for another relative to move in. this  person didn't help in the least, of course. the best option would be for the house to be sold and a condo apartment bought so there's enough money to hire caregivers.....and pay off the line of credit that you should never have been responsible for since the modifications to the house were for his benefit and to meet his needs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/sex1h8/lost/,,[deleted by user]

"i am my grandmothers caregiver while my mom and stepdad are at work. she has dementia. we have a schedule and never have a problem sticking to it. between meals, snacks, tv time, music time, and picture time, we take bathroom breaks. even if she doesn’t need to use the bathroom, it gets her out of chair and gets her legs moving for alittle bit. she is still mobile but i walk behind her just to make sure she doesn’t trip and fall. between all these events, if she wants to rest her eyes, that’s never a problem, until today. it’s not unusual for her to talk about her siblings coming to see her (who’ve all passed away 6+ years ago) but today she was sure her brother was coming for her. today i just entertained the idea because she wasn’t upset about it and was just excited for her plans to see him later. everything goes fine today until her last bathroom break before i leave to head home. she was talking to me in her chair, talking about the people on the tv, then she closed her eyes. i think nothing of it because it’s beyond normal. but i try to wake her up 5 mins later and she’s not responding. she’s breathing perfectly, hearts beating, warm to the touch as if she’s just asleep, but is not responding to anything. i pat her leg, nothing, move her arms, nothing, move her chair from sitting up to reclining back, nothing, wipe a cloth across her head, nothing; but she’s still breathing fine and heart beating as usual. i take her o2 and it’s 98, take her bp and it’s 76 which is normal for her. i call my mom who tells me to call 911. paramedics get there and aggressively rub her chest and she wakes up yelling not to touch her (also normal if she’s spooked) and tells them that a man put something in her mouth but she spit it out. they look for this imaginary thing an imaginary man put into her mouth. they get her loaded on into the ambulance and give her narcan which wakes her up. because of covid, i couldn’t go see her in but my mom was able to go back after 3 hours of her sitting alone in a room. they ran a drug test but the machine was “down” and just told my mom that my grandmother got ahold of opioids. my mom challenges their idea with the fact that we don’t have any opioids in the house and nothing even close to an opioid. but the doctor said that she must have gotten ahold of some or else the narcan wouldn’t have worked to wake her up. the doctor said if it happens again, just bring her back to the hospital or let her “sleep it out”. she’s not on any new medicine and other than two prescription medicines for her brain, she just takes vitamins and a cranberry pill to help prevent uti’s. so, does anyone have any idea as to what happened or what i should do if she does this again. all together, she was “asleep” for about 40 mins between me noticing she’s not moving and being loaded into the ambulance (still not physically moving but verbally upset) i know these things happen and she’s 88 years old but i have a hard time just not stressing over new things she does. i’m sorry this is so long."," i would stress over that, too.  she is lucky to have you as a caregiver.you can expect some sudden declines from time to time.  you think everything's going along fine and then you get an event that is very concerning.best of luck to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/s15mbh/a_scare_from_my_grandmother/,,A scare from my grandmother
"as caregivers, i know we all have them.my dad is ""new"" with his dementia. before october, his only cognitive issues were bad short term memory (usually in the for of asking or telling the same thing many times) and occasionally saying something inappropriate. the night of his hospitalization, it was like a switch was flipped. he went from very mild symptoms (me thinking he might have the start of vascular dementia and had a neurology consult set up) to moderate dementia symptoms. the agitation, getting grabby, trying to get out of bed without help, not himself, having hallucinations, etc.dr's think the severe decline was caused by being septic from an infection...where his only initial symptom was some nausea, and then at the hospital started shaking and couldn't sit/stand. 1st hospital even missed the infections completely. there was hope for improvement once the infections were addressed...he had 2 surgeries in late october, iv antibiotics until the week before christmas, and now perpetual oral antibiotics because of the type of surgeries he had to have.however, his cognition has not improved as much as were hoping. he has some good days and some not so great. he has not got to the point of being combative, but he has a lot of bad moods with agitation and being mean/yelling.last night was a bad one. tried to have bedtime (for both of us) about 10:30p. this is around the time we usually turn in for the night. he had all his meds, and i even toileted him before we settled down for the night. from then, until a bit after 1a, i was constantly having to come back downstairs to keep him from crawling out of his bed, and to cover him back up with the blankets. he said he didn't need to pee. i asked him if he needed anything, he said no. i asked him why he kept trying to get up, he said he didn't know. i could see him through the motion sensor cam i use to watch him, either trying to scratch the wall beside his bed or he kept trying to reach towards the ceiling and grab something out of the thin air.about 1:30a, i ended up coming downstairs. i tried toileting him again, but he did not go. i ended up just grabbing some blankets and sleeping on the floor, so now my neck and shoulders are killing me, and my back is not happy. about 4:30a, he threw off the blanket, ripped his attends down, and tried to climb out of bed. me asking him to not get out of bed was met with him being mean and yelling at me to not tell him what to do. he did pee a bit more into a urinal, but not much more...because he had already wet himself...and because he had ripped the attends down, they were dry, but his bed pad and shirt were wet.got him all taken care of and settled back in...but now cannot fall back to sleep myself, so now here i am! i was planning on getting up at 5:45a anyways. i think i am going to need a good amount of coffee today. i know we have all been there...so thanks for listening.", i can relate with the septs.back after a hospital stay. it took 6 months to see some improvement but my elder will not get back to their pre-hospital status. also i had to sleep in the other bed in my elders room for a few nights and i basically scrolled.my phone and jumped at every move or noise they made. i am sorry things are so challenging right now and thank goodness for coffee.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/s0gzan/rough_nightmorning/,,Rough Night/Morning

"hello all,the newest update in my chaotic lifestyle as a caregiver is that now, a magic ingredient has been sprinkled in called ""romantic relationship decline"". my boyfriend is getting his usual round of winter seasonal depression, this time flavored by my unavailability because my mother who recently returned home and my grandfather got covid back to back. we haven't had any aides since december 22nd. my mom tested positive on christmas. the shortage of home tests and appointments caused further delay, as i wasn't able to test my grandfather until the thursday after xmas.and of course he is positiveso the quarantine continued and we won't have our first aides until the 12th. pop had to go to the hospital this friday that just passed because his sundowning was completely out of control (swinging at people), and then the night before, he had a vasovagal episode as i had never seen before----i thought for a moment that he had a ministroke/tia. i cleaned up vomit, pee, feces, and blood all in one night. and then the sundowning...17 hours of aggression, rudeness, anger, bitterness, and pacing and swinging so he fell twice.i already have an appointment with a lawyer to consult about my options, because taking care of him at home is getting out of hand. my mother has stepped up, gotten sober, and is now helping, but she is still fragile and not able to cope with the intensity---she knew he became demented, but had no idea how intense it would be. so she just has frustration fits and crying spells. they had a very bipolar relationship with each other, and so i understand how being someone's child comes with closer attachments and drama than being one's grandchild.he is in the hospital for a severe uti, and possibly his prostate blocking catheters and emitting seminal fluid into his catheter line. one day the bag looked like it was full of egg drop soup. naturally, i was horrified by this realization that i was now cleaning up seminal fluid probably. his body is a mess. he has a cancer appointment coming up to check for remission, but now the prostate thing is a mess. anyway, the pt at the hospital wants to send him to rehab for a small stay, because his mobility has gotten worse since he got covid, and his pt home service isn't available right now because of covid.so all of this is starting to destroy my relationship. i'm sure my boyfriend feels sidelined, and i don't blame him. we had a wonderful vacation while my pop was in respite care, and now its right back to my absence and hell. he watches me have to be patient with people who have treated me like shit, and i can tell he's getting jealous and bitter. i managed to upset him with a text message about how i was upset and had a day full of grief, and i was bummed that it felt like he wouldn't have reached out first, even knowing i'm free right now while pop is hospitalized. and now he is stonewalling me. he is seasonal depression-prone and shy so this is within his character, but insanely painful for me. i had to counter it with the ""i'll give you space and check-in tuesday, so that i don't spiral from a lack of control/being ignored, after begging him to tell me what is going on. his behavior sucks but i sort of don't blame him.so do i send him to rehab, semi-selfishly? i know people with dementia get derailed by rehab, but my life is completely getting jacked up from this, and i need a minute to think. i wouldn't have him stay past ten days. what do i do? why does dementia have to be this brutal? wish he planned for his own care more with long-term care insurance. ugh."," is their anyone you can talk to that is not a family member or friend that can help you sort through these feelings? it’s hard to process alone and more objectively when we are in it. i know we can feel guilty if it feels like we are turning our back on loved ones by not being available 24/7, but why don’t we feel guilty for turning our back on ourselves?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/rzwn0r/dementia_caregiving_is_beginning_to_ruin_my/,,"Dementia caregiving is beginning to ruin my personal life, do I take the week off when the hospital suggested PT rehab?"

"hey all,this is an exquisitely hard thing to talk about. about 2.5 years ago, my husband (let's call him e) was in a major car accident and suffered a severe traumatic brain injury (tbi). as an indication of scope, he was in a coma for almost two weeks, then in rehab for for four months before coming home (still multiple times/week therapy while living at home). pre-tbi, he was an extremely gifted pharmacist with a rare specialty, much sought-after for consults etc. post tbi? he suffers from hypersomnia and spends most of his days lying in bed, reading or watching media. if he is up and moving it seriously wears him out, and he will spend even more time resting/sleeping. i try to help him limit his physical exertions for maximum utility with moderate success.e's been working on his pharmacist license renewal. this involves  a lot of continuing education (ce) credits. he brought it up-  ""i need to have 30 cu done by next february, i need to work on this.""  i applauded this as a medium-duration, self-directed goal of his- it's a good thing for him to focus on, feeds into his desire to return to work and a return to normalcy, all systems go! so we signed him up for one of the ce websites and he's been working through the different modules, with indifferent results. frankly he's failing most of the quizzes, and it's really pissing him off. i hear him swearing profusely at every quiz he's failing, it's a systemic problem.i don't know if it's just trouble with calculations or reading comprehension or flat out disconnect from his professional knowledgebase, but he's seriously struggling with the ce items. he stopped asking me for help once i walked him through two sets of calculations that he'd fucked up and that i got correct on my first try. i'd help him if he'd let me, but he isn't.  this is basic knowledge for his field, i can't ignore this. i can't in good conscience recommend he try to get back into pharmacy as a profession in his current state of comprehension. i can't have the specter of dosage miscalculations or inattention-caused medication swaps potentially haunt his workplace. i know my niece's experience with pharmacy fuckups (almost a year on the wrong medication, they were next to each other on the shelf- she was a pediatric oncology patient getting an adult dosage of thyroid-suppressing hormone) and their aftermath is a huge player here for me mentally, but i just can't encourage him into a path where he'd potentially cause others injury. without a technician riding herd on him 100% i can't guarantee better than that, and i can't think of any pharmacy that would staff that way, regardless of how  many eeo boxes he ticks.  it's hard to say out loud, but one of my biggest ongoing fears around e's injury and recovery has been and continues to be that he'll hit some wall (in therapy or in real life) that he finds unforgivable and responds with suicide. he was so adamant as a younger person that if he developed dementia he'd prefer to off himself quickly and neatly instead of dragging us though the whole dementia decline. we'd experienced it with his grandparents, in nauseating detail, and he has been adamant that he won't put me through the same ordeal willingly.  even with his current cognitive difficulties,  he'd be able to easily assemble a wide range of chemical cocktails that would kill him easily and relatively painlessly. it's so hard. i can't in conscience support him in return to work stuff, but the failure to support him might take him from me anyway. how can we move forward together?"," you don't have to support him returning to his previous career, up have to support his studies. it's a nuanced mind shift, but it's important because it allows you to be on the same page.i'm assuming a recertification exams (and the failing of that) will stop the return to work...you don't have to get involved in that; only support the effort.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/r66fl7/acknowledging_posttbi_learning_difficulties/,,Acknowledging post-TBI learning difficulties?
"as a woman with personal issues that make me private and anxious with strangers in my home, i'm beginning to panic as they get closer to starting. i am beginning to wonder if my anxiety / fear of that small chance of a bad person is not worth the care and if instead i should pay for cleaning services and meal delivery and just suck it up with the day to day cleaning and laundry. to make matters worse, i just found out it will be a male caregiver. i feel guilty saying this but it just increases my fears - not because i think men are more prone to crime, just that i'm particularly fearful of the crimes they're more capable of committing and i feel too ashamed to request a female because this is just a guy who is looking for a job like anyone else.i'm scared of people knowing i live alone with an elderly man who has memory loss, i'm scared of my key getting copied or the passcode getting given away. i'm scared of identity theft/people going through my bedroom. (i'm going to lock important documents in my bedroom closet and put a camera in my bedroom that would only capture a person if they entered. the cats hide / sleep in my room so i don't want to shut the door but i could.) the agency does background checks and caregivers are insured. i have renters insurance. background:my father lives with me. he is functional but had a tbi that caused short term memory loss, so he has a lot of the traits of early dementia patients described in this sub. he needs a lot of reminders to shower, eat, clean up, change his clothes. kind of like a small child, but in every other way he's functional. his condition makes him a forgetful slob, means he has poor hygiene, overeats, misses doctors appointments because he says he cancelled when he didn't and is still a lot to take care of on my own. he doesn't leave his bed for days at a time even with me asking, so i thought it would be good company as well. i have to do all the grocery shopping, meal prep, laundry on my own.i have signed up for non-medical caregiving services to come 3x a week/4 hrs at a time. i think this is more than i need but it's a minimum- not covered by medicaid, so we are paying with his disability and my money and it's as much as my rent every month.i guess.. any advice? wisdom? good or bad experiences? is this worth it? i know that my fears are not fully rational but it feels very uncomfortable to me and i'm considering not going through with the service."," your fears aren't irrational. my dad gets a variety of home care aides helping with perineal care and respite and while some have been amazing others have been terrible despite background checks. it might be different  for us because while we have a few regulars, others are just whomever can fill the shift.we haven't had anything too major in terms of theft/privacy violations other than one of my dad's favorite workers stealing all of our ppe that was given to us for staff while my dad was awaiting covid test results. workers weren't allowed in our home unless they donned the full get-up (shield, mask, gown, gloves) and this one worker (whom we have had for a year now) stole near all of it on her way out one day. she left a single shield and gown for all the workers coming on the weekend. she left us in a really awkward position of having to request more ppe without going into the details of what happened with our previous stock. we kept her on because my dad loved her but the theft destroyed whatever trust we had in her. it sucks feeling uneasy in your own home.the major issues i ran into were hygiene/care related like people spilling urine from a catheter bag all over the carpet and not telling us about it, people running out of gloves so deciding to touch my father's genitals with their bare hands, or people being so rough with my dad while changing him you'd think they forgot they're assisting another human being. but that being said the staff who are amazing bring such a wonder peace of mind. like any industry you'll encounter a mix of good and bad. don't feel like you have to sacrifice your security - request a female caregiver if you think that will help. there may be trial and error involved in finding the right worker for you and your dad, but they are out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/r5v1vq/privacysafety_fears_over_caregivers_in_my_f31/,,Privacy/Safety Fears Over Caregivers in my (F31) Home.

"i'll try to make this as short as possible...i am the sole family caregiver to my grandfather--he has a complication of health problems, but the biggest challenge so far has been his acutely increasing dementia (i suspect he has vascular). i do have hired agency help as of november, but i am not able to get more than one night off a week because of agency staffing and his ability to be a complete and total nightmare to each of the three overnight aides who have come so far. this past week, there was scheduling confusing and my tuesday caregiver was not scheduled on her end. i almost cried i was so frustrated---i had appointment to see a respite care facility, errands to run (all for my pop's benefit), and i knew i would then be stuck at home until last night. i was exhausted by thursday, as his sundowners starts very late, somewhere around 8 pm, and it is hell through the night keeping up with his uncanny ability to get out of a hospital bed with guardrails. the doctor gave me risperdal and ativan to be taken incrementally at night until his max of 1.5 ativan. usually telling him that i am minimizing doses to respect his autonomy make him agreeable to taking it---it still doesn't mean that he sleeps. the night before thanksgiving, he would not sleep---i finally gave him his last ativan dose at 3 am, and then he was so tired and slept through most of the day. he was an angel all thanksgiving...until my boyfriend left. then it started again. i was still patient, but exhausted from 2-5 hours of sleep every night the whole week before. his escape artist activity is endless, and he is on blood thinners, so a fall isn't great for him. he also unexpectedly was able to get off a catheter, which is great, but added more checks for wetness, etc. he is very clean and using a commode, so the briefs are just for emergencies if i happen to fall asleep. the night before last, he was being a monster, and i was fed up. no drugs were working, and finally he became combative to them concept of taking them. i warned him that not taking them, not sleeping, could put him in the hospital, and he still refused. it turned into him talking to himself, and me repeating, ""please go to sleep"" over a course of two hours. i decided to try to see if he would take another .5 dose of ativan. he was very spiteful and paranoid, pretended to take it, had a closed fist that i asked him to open, and the ativan fell out. i gave up, and i was exasperated and said ""fine, do what you want, i'm not bothering for the rest of the night, go to sleep."" an hour later, he is crying for attention, saying ""i will take it now, i'll be good"". by this time, if i gave it to him, he would sleep all day (the cycle would then repeat) so i said ""no, its too late to take it"" from upstairs in the bedroom i sleep in above the stairs with the door open and security camera facing me. i checked him 30 minutes later, and he was snoring and asleep. finally i could at least get a nap. kaboom. he got out of bed, somehow got his slippers on, the walker from across the room (which then flew to the other side of the room) and i found him on the floor. i was not sweet and empathetic. i was tired and calmly scolding (but the aggravation in my voice was obvious). he fell once before and got himself up, so i encouraged him to do the same. he started crying, his ass was completely wet, i put a bed mat under him to avoid piss all over the untreated wooden floor, and let him worm around to the guardrail. i was not sweet or caring. when he got to the guardrail, i tried to lift him onto the commode to change him---he would not do it. i couldn't get him in bed, called the fire department. i grumbled the whole wait about ""this is why i nag you, this is what happens when you don't listen to me, i can't live this way etc"". then he called me a fucking bitch under his breath and i lost it. i told him no man talks to me that way and i don't care if he has memory problems. paramedics came, i was just going to get him into bed and sign a hospital refusal, until the doctor on the phone talked to me and i mentioned blood thinners, even though he didn't hit his head. i then felt insane and decided to have him go to the er just in case. i then took a nap. the er doctor cleared him for any broken bones, head injury, etc, but mentioned his hemoglobin was pretty low (he is in lymphoma remission) and he has a slow gi bleed. now i am exhausted, and letting him stay to check out his gi to decide if a colonoscopy is appropriate in his condition, and to see neurology to stage him. his respite care interview at home was scheduled for tuesday morning. i can reschedule to thursday, but i am distraught that the hospital stay will make him no longer approved for the 10 day stay and i am beside myself. i feel selfish, i want my break. i had to get travel insurance for the expensive nature of a trip, but my boyfriend and i have been getting through the day looking forward to this. also i feel like a monster for being unsympathetic when he fell----on round three of the ativan attempt, he also told me ""i don't like how you look"". he has been verbally abusive when sundowning before. i am overwhelmed with guilt for getting stern, then short, then exsperated, and i am crushed at the thought my trip is screwed. he probably needs memory care, but i'm also just so exhausted with financial errands, getting to a lawyer, etc. this trip was meant to save my mental health, and also my relationship with my pop so my irritability doesn't get worse. am i a monster for being numb to his fall, and concerned with the loss of my escape"," you are not a monster -- you have done more than many others in your shoes would do.  if at all possible, take the trip.  you

"i (closet ftm 23) am a caregiver through an agency for a non-related client (f 81). for privacy i’ll call her deb. deb has early alzheimer’s, she can still take care of her own bathing, toileting, dressing, etc., but she doesn’t know what a brownie is. i take care of her 11 hours during the day, 4 days a week, she is alone at night. deb is generally easy to care for, but she has a complicated situation. she is currently living in the house she raised her family in, after being gone for 3 years. after being widowed, she remarried and moved in with her high school sweetheart those 3 years. after a health scare we had 3 months ago, shortly after i started caring for her, her daughters made her move back into her home, so she would be safe and close to her daughter wendy, who handles all her finances and medications. everything is going well except for one big thing. deb and her husband are still married, and they still love each other very much. because of this, deb wants to move back in with her husband and doesn’t understand why she can’t go back. her husband understands, and he’ll visit her for a few hours at a time but not often.  and then… last night she told me he was going to visit sunday (tomorrow) night and they were going to have sex. she was worried about having privacy during that time since there are cameras in her bedroom and bathroom for safety. she was asking me if there was any way for her to cover or unplug the camera. my question is, should i tell her daughter wendy? i’m afraid she’ll get hurt. i’m worried about liability, since now i know he’ll be over, and i’m worried they’ll try in one of the other bedrooms without cameras. at the same time i want to respect deb’s privacy; surely she’s done this with her husband before, and knows her limits. i also want to retain her trust, she’s distrusting of wendy for not giving her back her gun, and won’t tell her certain things she’ll tell me. any advice or options are welcome. please be kind."," sadly, she’ll probably won’t remember and it’ll never happen . her husband could be facing serious charges if her daughters push the issue",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/r3ia9q/privacy_vs_safety_nsfw_text/,,Privacy VS Safety (NSFW text)

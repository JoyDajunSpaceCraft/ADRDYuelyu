"not impressed at all! this may be tmi, but a lot of you go through so much with your loved ones, it might not be. the ones i tried were size xl ""maximum"" absorbency.  that is bs! unless you have been blessed with a bladder of a chickadee, it just doesn't work for mom... i found they were glorified  stretchy one use underwear with a thick pad that is about absorbent as an overnight maxipad.  i'm sure they are perfect for small leaks, but if there is maximum urine, forget it!  i won't go into too many details, but pj's and bed protection under her is all wet.  we (a close friend and i) kind of make jokes about the female astronaut who wore astronaut underwear while she drove cross country to find someone she was stalking... something similar to that would really rock! now for the 2nd use for them, it is ridiculous. if she can't race her arthritic body to the bathroom quick enough, well, forget it.  she has to cut them off, its a mess, and its just not right! especially if its loose bm.  so tell me, are there better ones to use? some with velcro?  she doubles them up at night. she has arthritis and for her at night changing them is quite a feat.  its very sad. she still has independence.  she would even go out for a drive, but is embarrassed to go.can we get samples of other kinds? what do you recommend? are there kind of special underwear to wear over the disposable ones?  astronaut ""underwear "" would not fit our budget but i am dying to make it easier for her!help??"," i'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:- [/r/adultdiapers] [took my mom's depends for a spin... i would like to share my post on this sub. to get more information. thank you! i hope i did it right!](&nbsp;*^(if you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([info](/r/totesmessenger) ^/ ^[contact](/message/compose?to=/r/totesmessenger))*",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hr7a3e/hows_this_for_an_interesting_title_my_mom_uses/,"How's this for an interesting title?

my dad called asking if i could help calm my mom down.  she was in the background yelling at him.  you don’t love me and i’m leaving...  i start talking about what i did with my son today but she won’t get on the phone to hear.  dad says she’s been beating him on the back.she was diagnosed in 2015 with alzheimer’s.  never had a positive base level of happiness but mightily pretended till she couldn’t anymore.  she doesn’t do much of anything at home now.  dad is overwhelmed with her and multiple aging animals at home that all take meds.  i’m 40 mins drive to their house but don’t want to take my son over to witness whatever scene is going on.please if anyone has advice i can share with my dad to calm and reassure her she is loved.  i think it’s probably a waiting game and just try to keep them both safe.  thanks in advance., thanks.  they called me today to let me know they are going to put down the cat who hasn’t been eating.  the dog will have a tumor removed and spend some time with my brothers family while it recovers for a few weeks.  if the dog makes it thru surgery that is.  that leaves one older cat who just needs a pill for thyroid.  hopefully these things go smoothly and mom doesn’t twist reality turning the decision on dad.  stupid disease...i’m prolly going to get some day.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hr6uwh/help_for_parents/,Help for parents

"my dad has always been very private, and he did have brain swelling two years ago, but he has been in and out of the hospital wanting to harm himself and me the caregiver, his daughter. we made the connection that he's violent and wants to leave the house, goes the hospital, they take care of his sugar, and then he is friendly and wants to come home.  i learned today his pen is broken. so far the last six months he hasn't been taking his insulin except when the hospital gave it to him (he would go like a few times per week) and he would just sleep when he couldn't get his insulin pen to work.so i have unfortunately been dealing with the news my mom has brain cancer, she can't really do much i have to caregiver to the fullest extent with her and now i have to basically do my dad's insulin for him.it makes me wonder how many other diseases out there can mimic dementia or rather severe dementia. i can't say for sure he doesn't have it as he was displaying a little confusion after they fixed his sugar but he definitely isn't homicidal, suicidal, or trying to break everything around the house. my condolences go out to everyone who lost a loved one and had to watch them go through dementia prior to their passing, and to everyone out there currently caring for a parent with dementia you're doing amazing and they'd be proud of you of they were still themselves and able to express it.why does this disease have to be so sad? and the fact it's in your brain makes me think it can manifest various symptoms making a unified treatment difficult."," my mom was so far gone with dementia that my husband and i became her full-time caregivers and couldn’t leave her alone. since she was pretty absent we started her on a keto diet because she horribly mismanaged her diabetes throughout her life (never took insulin and literally ordered four desserts at a time for delivery). her doc then put her on aricept generic and within two months it was like she was coming out of a fog. she had such a 180, which i describe elsewhere in this sub. i realized how bad diabetes induced dementia could be. she’s no longer on the aricept but now that she controls her own food intake i’m worried. we’re still taking care of her because she’s childish and seems to want to behave like she did before all of this and put herself right back down the path of poor self-care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hqvizp/his_dementia_may_have_been_mismanaged_diabetes/,His dementia may have been mismanaged diabetes this entire time
" when i was the support group facilitator in my prior job, i met two caregivers in different time frames. one thing that these two caregivers had in common, aside from their loved ones being diagnosed with alzheimer's was that they were the main caregivers, they wouldn't accept help and as a result, their stress levels affected their health, so much that they passed away suddenly from heart attacks. they were under tremendous **stress**, trying to handle every single thing having to with their loved ones' care. please learn to say: i need help or can you please help me do..... become familiar and love delegating it will change your life, and how you take care of your loved one.it is well documented in many medical journals that ***stress if not managed can and will kill you!***  learn what symptoms to be aware of [ "," i'm enormously stressed at the moment dealing with mum and i'm aware that people like social services think they're trying to help.  but the ""help"" they're offering isn't necessarily assisting in any way, often it's adding to the stress without offering any benefit.i'm not great at communicating what we need  and the truth is, i don't know what would be helpful, but it seems the people that are supposed to help just go through a checklist of things regardless of any feedback we give just hoping something on there will be useful.  help isn't help when it's being forced on us",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hqu44d/being_a_caregiver_and_stress/,Being a Caregiver and Stress

"i was on the phone with my so the other night and he expressed his and his mums concerns to me about his dads mental state. he’s always been absent minded but it seems to be getting worse, they kinda want to just think it’s because he’s getting older (he’s just turned 60) but they know that’s exactly how it started with so’s grandfather (his dads dad) who passed away from dementia a few years ago. me and so were together when his grandfather passed but our relationship was quite new and his grandfather had been suffering dementia for many years prior. i did my best at the time but didn’t really know what to do other than let him talk about his feeling about the situation, and encourage him to see his grandfather, especially once he was in care. this obviously is very different since we’re just seeing what could be early symptoms, meaning for the next how ever many years so is going to be relying on me for support as things get more difficult. it’s also made more complicated since we live around 200 miles from his parents (we’re in england so that’s half the length of the country) and though his mum wants to move closer to us, his dad is against the idea and is set on moving to scotland (a couple hundred miles in the opposite direction). it’s also hard as his father is a very stubborn man who will not want to go see a doctor, regardless of his families concern for him and that fact that his own father suffered the same. me, so and mil all understand that the earlier he can be diagnosed, the better treatment he can get to slow down the progression, but fil won’t want to hear any of that. so yeah, i’m kinda stuck for what to do. i know my opinion on doctors and such will have no impact on fil, so i just want to be there to support my so. i just don’t really know how to start other than listening to so concerns and encouraging him to talk to his dad about it all. thanks for reading, any advice would be greatly appreciated"," me and so are similar to you, we’re still quite young (both 23) but have been together nearly 7 years at this point and i’m very close with his parents, especially his mum, and know how important his family are to him. unfortunately we don’t live together yet as i’m still at uni and he’s graduated and working, but we only live about 45 mins away so it’s very easy to see each other. plus i’m hoping that when he moves in october i’ll be able to stay with him more (he’s currently in a shared house so i can’t stay longer than a couple of days), especially while most of my uni stuff is online due to covid. i guess just the small things like laundry and washing up can make a big difference, as you say it’s one less thing to worry about, so once he moves i’ll be sure to help him out with all of them when i’m over. and yes i’ve always tried to listen to him when he’s upset, i never want him to bottle up his emotions or feel like i’m not there to support him. i figure that’s going to become more and more important as things progress. i know i’m going to have to be his rock, he’s a very emotional person and it was hard enough when his grandfather was suffering dementia, i can’t imagine how hard it’s going to be with his own dad. having a list of details is a good idea, he’s also quite unorganised so i might get him a pin board and put important information on it for him, as well as keep a list myself on my phone in case he manages to lose it or isn’t at home. thank you for the advice, i really appreciate it",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hqch4z/how_to_support_my_so_whos_father_may_have_dementia/,How to support my SO who’s father may have dementia?

"hey guys, i am trying to figure out how to deal with not being able to talk to my mom. background story, my parents live in another country and they left due to my mom being diagnosed with early signs or onset of dementia. she has a lost a lot of her memory and motor function. my dad and sister take care of my mom for the most part but because they in another country i try to face time them a few times week, my mom cant talk to me or will just start crying and she just leaves or just gives the phone to someone else for me to talk to. i know that its more on her that she doesn't want her son to see her in the state that she is in but it hurts me so much that i cant talk to my mom and that im not there. &amp;#x200b;i just dont know how to help or how to cope with the feeling"," it's hard to know why she is behaving this way. when my grandfather was first diagnosed, he was very avoidant especially with his grandkids. he was embarrassed and ashamed and upset, and didn't want us to look down upon him or pity him. perhaps he too was afraid of us seeing him in that state. we don't mention his dementia, but instead focus on him and try to make as many memories as we can while he is still more or less ""there""",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hoinx7/trying_to_figure_out_how_to_cope/,trying to figure out how to cope?
"my dad has ftd, and i think it’s actually been there for 40 years (he’s in his 80s). my brothers refuse to even read about ftd. they prefer to be  angry with him. my mom (his ex wife) still hates him for things that happened years ago. but she’s been helpful to me anyhow because she’s awesome. has her limits re hearing about him, of course. but 100% of  the hands on care is on me. and, my boyfriend, who lives with me and has bpd, is jealous of time i spend with my dad, and is annoyed by the behaviour. there are other medical issues needing attention, too (for my dad). bf whines and keeps saying crap like “i wish we had a normal life”. like i can’t even call a doctor without my boyfriend rolling his eyes or sighing. i want to punch him when he does that.i told him, this is just a part of my life going forward that you have to accept. and it’s going to get worse, so buckle up. if you can’t actually be supportive, i need you to at least learn to manage your frustration and stfu and let me do what i need to do in peace.  tall order for someone with bpd, under covid, sure. but still, fuck you if you think i’m going to not do basic things i need to do for my dad and talk to you about bullshit.tbh if it weren’t for my boyfriend living with me i’d find a way to live with my dad (would move to the suburbs to live with him, because he knows that area). only reason i’m not suggesting that is my bf has had a rough time  over covid. has had suicidal feelings actually. i tried suggesting taking a break of a few days, with him at his mom’s. it’s depressing there, he says, bc she repeats herself (she also has memory issues for sure) so that’s frustrating to him, plus he’d be lonely.  btw this is his own mother who he says he loves... so ok if he can’t even be responsible and cool when it comes to his parent of course he can’t deal with mine. (he can’t afford to live anywhere else, it’s my place or his mom’s.)and, then he hears stuff from my siblings about how bad and annoying my dad is. and gets more resentful. fucking assholes, all of them. my one brother has adhd, and everyone’s supposed to watch videos and be understanding when he rages on a dime. when it comes to my dad’s brain disorder “he’s evil”. whatever. go back to middle earth if you’re going to use language like that, is what i want to tell him. anyway. i have ftd on one side and occasionally suicidal bpd on the other. i get panic attacks now, because i’m terrified for both of them, and i can’t be in two places at once. so i’m running from one place to another.  but the resentful whining, holy shit do i want to pop him one when he goes there."," also my bf makes things worse for himself (and me) because he’s trying to lose weight and refuses to eat enough to forestall a mood shift. “no! i’m fine with ten  grapes, i don’t need dinner”. yeah you do,  you’re going to be irritable and grumpy and sad if you don’t eat at least half a sandwich. or i’ll leave him money for groceries while i’m away doing stuff for my dad, and he’ll spend it on *records* instead and eat nothing but peanut butter. by day two, he’s starving,  and i have to deal with the unregulated behaviour, the depressed texts, anger, guilt (because i left him aloooone and he can’t be aloooone). so i send him an uber to join me because i’m scared he’ll harm himself, and get him to eat and suddenly he’s in a better mood. aaaaaaarghi’m losing empathy for the bpd in all this tbh. if he would do what he could to manage himself, i’d be more responsive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hoicuq/no_one_in_the_family_can_deal_except_me/,No One in the family can deal except me

"first off let me start off by saying i am no stranger to dementia or alzheimer's.  my mom's sister died of early onset alzheimer's at age 56. (she was diagnosed at 50), and we watched as the disease swiftly took her and although it was 19 years ago, i have never forgotten.  now my mil, who is 86, was just brought home to die on july 6th.  that was her final wish.  she wanted to die at home.  she is currently in the final stages and i am all too familiar with what that looks like.  my husband however, is not.  so i calmly show him to look for facial expressions and respond to them in a way that you are somehow able to communicate with her  and how she searches you with her eyes.  but she can barely talk.  she mouths ""yes"" when you ask her something, but other than that, she says nothing.  however, if you say something to her, and you ask ""if you understand, squeeze my hand"".  she will squeeze your hand! repeatedly.  she doesn't grip it, she squeezes on and off on and off.i want to believe she is still in there somewhere knowing we are there.  i also played some music for her. when i played some music that she knew from back home in europe, she blinked her eyes, and looked directly at me and they lit right up.  but then it was like she was gone again when her eyes drifted off somewhere else.  i can't bare to see my husband as he watched his last living parent die of such a horrific disease.  i know what the disease does and i know what it looks like, but i can't relate to him, as it was never a parent i have lost but only a relative (who for all intents and purposes i was extremely close to).i just need some support on how to help him start to accept and get used to how she is at this point in time and this is how it's gonna look like as she transitions into the death stage.  she is currently only sipping water from a tiny sponge and eating baby food.  her eating or drinking has not stopped yet.i am just grasping at straws here.  i found this sub in hopes i could just let my feelings out. thanks for listening.", [removed],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hob2ax/86_yo_mil_in_final_stages_of_dementia_bed_ridden/,"86 y/o MIL in final stages of Dementia.

"a little info; i strongly suspect and can point to many examples supporting that my very abusive mother (53) has dementia but she and her husband refuse even giving the thought any acknowledgement. now, 2-3 months ago my mom would occassionally forget very recent info (i.e. i would say i need shampoo and she would say “didn’t you buy one last week?” when it had in fact been 2 months, or often fail to remember a word, but today she made it clear she forgot a very distinct and numerously discussed common memory (of her treating me to paragliding, which she would never forget solely because she paid for it) from 2017. i did a lot of research on dementia and to me it seems like it’s progressing somewhat fast.i would like to clarify that i am not a medical worker but have been to therapy myself for mood issues for 15 years and have decent psychological knowledge. i have pinpointed and observed only to confirm existense of certain hallmark symptoms (mood and personality change, memory issues, rage, increased paranoia and general abusiveness, incoherent speech and difficulty driving &amp; speaking english as a second language which she used to teach before, etc.) but they still refuse to get help or discuss it. am i being paranoid? is it really progressing fast? any advice or words of comfort? when should i panic and call health care workers? how long before she gets lost somewhere or worse?thank you in advance and stay safe everyone."," before i comment on anything dementia related, i will say some of the symptoms you listed are common with people who have unchecked mental health issues, or a brain injury, or a stroke. not to scare you more, but just to say that it could be numerous things. people see ""memory loss"" in a family member and suddenly jump to dementia/alzheimers disease. the biggest issue here is that your mother and her husband won't give it a thought. would they consider seeing a neurologist in general? this would kill 2 birds with one stone-ensuring she hasn't had any recent brain injuries or a stroke and ruling out/confirming dementia. unfortunately, with stubborn family, you would have to wait until they reach a point where it's obvious to you, doctors, and others that they cannot care for themselves and then get a court order to be a power of attorney. now: if your mother has dementia, it will fall under ""early onset"" because she is under 65. early onset dementia has its own issues as sometimes it's genetically caused and other times it's not (i.e. she suffered a stroke, brain injury, etc). so that's a rabbit hole that no one wants to really get into. i don't have much knowledge of early onset dementia, but in general, different dementias have different life expectancies, though again, early onset may be different due to the people being a bit younger. alzheimer's disease is the dementia everyone thinks of and has a life expectancy of 10 years post diagnosis while vascular dementia (which is what my grandmother had) has a life expectancy of about 5 years. how bad someone declines again will depend on type, if there are other health issues/neurological issues at play, etc. my grandmother had a lot of changes in the first 2-2.5ish years then plateaued with small changes for the remaining 1.5-2ish years until the very end. dementia isn't like other mental health issues so psychology isn't really the most helpful in diagnosing. you need to sit your parents down and express your worries. if your mother is abusive, i think it could realistically be an unchecked/poorly cared for mental health condition but again, i'm not a doctor. if they will not get help, you just need to check on them, give your mother's husband tips about making life easier if it gets worse, etc. i'd really try talking to them about seeing a doctor for evaluation. you don't have to say you think it's dementia but mention the changes and go from there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hn8pyx/question_about_the_speed_of_progression/,Question about the speed of progression

"i am writing this because i’m taking on trying to help my mom’s mental health/cognitive situation sorted out and, frankly could use some insight and support.about five years ago, my family started noticing that my mom was repeating the same stories, seemingly forgetting conversations she’d had with us and having some issues recalling names etc. she’s 69 now so my sister, aunt and i didn’t think much of it at first, that maybe she was just experiencing some age-related decline but  that it was likely nothing to get too worried about. we also noticed, independently of one another, that her already volatile moods (her side of the family has a history of bipolar disorder and we’ve long suspected she’s got some of those traits) started getting worse. she has stormed out of family gatherings for no known reason, had screaming fits where she has rolled on the front lawn because my sister didn’t appreciate her babysitting my nephew enough and had multiple episodes of that nature. the trouble is, because we’ve all had difficult run-ins with her and we have all had very busy lives far away, we have had only occasional contact with her. mom, who has essentially lived alone on a mountain for the better part of a decade, hasn’t worked, had hobbies or done much of anything for almost all of that time because she got a good deal when my parents divorced and hasn’t had to worry about money. she really has not been good about keeping herself occupied, and because of her sometimes cruel and manipulative demeanor, she has been pretty isolated. she is a histrionic person in terms of personality, but fails at close relationships because she lashes out those closest to her all the time (and always has).about a year ago, after speaking with her on the phone a few times, i started to feel like things had taken a turn. when i asked her, she didn’t have recollection of basic things (when she’d last been out, what she’d eaten that day, when she’d last taken the dog for a walk). i was concerned enough that i found time to visit her and, when i got to her house, i was shocked at just how bad things had become. it was clear she was starting to not take care of basic things like hygiene, feeding herself etc. her dog was both severely overweight and seemingly ravenously hungry i later found out that it was because she would forget to feed him for days at a time and then, alternatively, forget she had fed him and over feed him some days. when i had conversations with her, she would repeat the same story/anecdote, often within a few minutes and then completely forget everything we’d talked about moments later. whenever i mentioned that we were going over something we had just discussed, she lashed out and accused my of gaslighting her. it was shocking and i felt terribly guilty that i’d distanced myself enough from her to not notice how bad it was getting. on the drive home from that trip, i called my sister and aunt together to get their input on the situation and find out what they’d noticed. like me, they had each been distancing themselves from her due to episodes of cruelty and hostility. i should also say that my mom has, until recently, been very cunning and sharp in her interpersonal relationships, which i think did a lot to cover her decline effectively from everyone around her. she is sharp in many ways but her memory is rendering that cunning part of her less and less effective. on that call with my sister and aunt, i found out that she’d gotten lost multiple times on familiar drives, gotten in major fights with each of them multiple times after seemingly small memory lapses were acknowledged, had major mood swings and even made half-hearted suicide threats with them.cut to a few months ago. i had a contract job come to an end and managed to arrange some things so i could come live here in nc with my mom in her house for the time being and hopefully get some treatment figured out. it hasn’t been easy and i’m met with constant resistance, but i’ve managed to get her to see her primary care doc, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, have a neuropsychological exam (as referred by her primary doc), got her a ct scan and, as of late week, finally got her to a neurologist. the primary doc had apparently expressed concerns about her memory to her in september of last year but my mom never followed up or told anyone. the neuropsych testing showed severe short-term memory loss of an unknown cause and also revealed a lot of the ways she guesses/fabricates to cover those memory losses. according to the testing, she retains virtually no information (of different types) minutes after learning it which tracks very much with my experience of conversations with her etc. the ct scan was clean but the neurologist ordered an mri which will happen monday. the psychiatric nurse practitioner, her primary doc and neuropsych tester all also brought up mood lability and histrionics, so much so that the tester put “suspected bipolar disorder” in his written test report.so far, everyone thinks we are probably dealing with a mood disorder and some form of dementia, both of which are feeding each other. she was prescribed 2 mg of abilify but hated taking a drug for a mood disorder and demanded to go off it, and then was prescribed aricept yesterday to hopefully curb some of the memory loss and associated mood issues.i realize this is a wall of text, but i needed to let it out and hopefully hear some encouragement. right now it feels like i’m fighting against my mom to try to get her help and, really, without getting her declared incompetent (which i really don’t want to do unless i absolutely have to) i am powerless to actually mandate anything. i should also state, she doesn’t really have a valid powers of attorney for either medical or general duties. my mom thinks she’s fine and continues to think it’s everyone else making it up. i know that there is a part of her that’s terrified but she covers it with meanness at almost every step. i’m frustrated/fried and feel stuck with what to do next.", this sounds a lot like my mom. she has tried many things including zyprexa for the mood disorder which helped but had too many side effects. she’s now on gabapentin to help with the mood and aricept for memory and ativan as needed (which is bad for dementia but she has major panic attacks).  she’s still not okay. we’ve tried so many meds. when we get her calm her memory worsens. it stinks.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hjjq4j/advice_on_getting_my_mom_help/,Advice

"f)so my (36f) grandmother's  (84f)  dementia has progressed aggressively in the last year, to the point that her short-term memory is pretty much gone and her long-term memory is also fading. in the last few months, especially, we've seen a lot of behavioral changes, such as sundowning, paranoia, and general nastiness toward her friends and nurses at her assisted living facility.  i've known two other people with alzheimer's/dementia and was prepared to deal with these symptoms.but she's also demonstrating a symptom i haven't seen before- not memory *loss*, per se, but memory *shift,* regarding something pretty significant. her attitude about my grandfather has dramatically shifted in the last few months, from missing him terribly (he died in 2005) to outright resentment and sometimes hatred. she won't articulate exactly why she's changed her mind so quickly, although once she did say that she felt like he'd abandoned her when he died, which i get. and while she wouldn't tell me, she's apparently divulged some disturbing things about him to my mother that are completely out of character. this man waited on her hand and foot, and neither my mom nor i can ever remember seeing him angry, let alone violent. so, i'm wondering if she has somehow conflated something she saw on tv or read in the newspaper with her own memories and that's part of this shift? in the past, she's watched a lot of cop dramas like ncis and csi, and i suspect some of this has bled into her memories as a justification for her feelings. has anyone else seen this kind of thing happen? and if so, how did you deal with it?"," when my dad was in the hospital and his dementia symptoms were made worse by the icu, he was *living* in an episode of ncis. he watched reruns of the show all the time and i had also watched the show so when he began telling me about a guy that came in his room and was really nice, but then he walked off and cut those people up and fed them to the pigs, i knew it was from the show. but he kept telling it over and over and acting like he couldn't believe he saw it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hiqeow/memory_changes_in_later_dementia/,Memory Changes in later Dementia

"my mom is in her early 70s and it's hard for me to see how childlike she's become. i know this is early days and that a lot of my mom's personality is there but the woman i used to have long conversations with...it's harder for her to follow or engage. which leaves us with superficial stuff including inane questions that is partial nosiness on her part but i'm sure is her attempt at making easy conversation. i have this emotional boundary wall up between her and myself because i'm not sure she knows she has dementia. my dad has made some comments to my husband that she does but when i tried to bring it up with my dad he brushed me off. supposedly they get tested in the summer and so this month i hope they are getting tested. she has a hard time remembering stuff such that having identical ten minute or so conversations (occasionally) on two days close together (i can't remember if it was two back to back days or if it was three days apart) doesn't even trigger any deja vu. she simply forgot the exact same conversation. she does stuff that oftentimes is very innocent or with a childlike joy but it also comes across to me as selfish or her being the center of everyone's world. and if i could simply act like she was a young child i feel like i could handle it better.but it's so hard because this person is not my mom!  obviously she is and yet she isn't. and i am so angry and have so much frustration and grief that i have to keep her at an arm's length because i know she's not capable of logic in a lot of situations or taking in evidence or being more aware of being considerste of other's feelings.  and it sucks because it totally feels like punching down when i get pissed off at her for stuff she has childlike joy for but also comes across to me as very selfish and inconsiderate.i know she can tell at least sometimes when she has messed up and it pains her. and then i feel, not necessarily remorse because i know she was in the wrong but just so shitty that i can't let things roll off my back more easily like i could if this wasn't my mom. my husband's dad also has dementia and i can deal with his batshit crazy fairly well. but my mom...you know? it just hurts so badly and i know that her dementia is very likely going to get worse or it could be as bad as alzheimer's and so this time with her, while she still retsins a lot of her personality and joy, it's important to appreciate it and use this time with her.but i just feel like the bond is very badly damaged because her form of batshit crazy (besides the day to day memory issues or being inconsiderate) is religious/political stuff like watching political/religious conspiracy videos or subscribing to emails that are just insane along the same line. luckily, as far as i can tell, i've gotten her to stop watching fox so for the most part she's stopped parroting stuff. but she also thinks she's some kind of spiritual warfare expert, so just imagine going a couple weeks with things being fine and then my dad feeling very poorly physically and wanting to skip a church meeting and then my mom railing at him about how that's the voice of satan. like truly what the fuck stuff that they never would have pulled growing up or even ten years ago.  we've been able to discuss evil and how you have to search yourself and talk to god for guidance but her arrogance just amps up to 11 and she honestly thinks telling someone who's in much worse physical shaoe than her and in a lot of pain that not going to a church meeting is basically bowing down to satan's influence.i will lose my patience at stuff like that but like i said, largely it just feels like punching down because her ability to interact and understand reality is...well, if you didn't know her you'd probably just think she's completely normal, but seeing it up close over the past few months (because i'm staying with them rather than coming in for a week or two a few times a year) it's really clear and disturbing.i wish i could just stop having the ability to cry or that i could deaden the grief inside me to just suck it up and interact with her and appreciate the time i have with her."," hi, i just wanted to say you're not alone in this and i know exactly how you feel.my mum is only 52 and suffers from a type of an early onset dementia called frontotemporal degeneration. i am 21. i cannot hold any kind of a somewhat reasonable conversation with her anymore. her illness has progressed extremely fast. she's very childlike now, has classes with a neuro-speech therapist (not sure if this is the correct term in english) 2 times a week and after each session she's given homework. the tasks remind me of ones i'm guessing would be given to children in primary school (connecting words to the categories they belong to like tulip->flower or forming words from letters in an odd order, etc). it's heartbreaking seeing that without my help she wouldn't be able to do most of the questions. i also can't stop thinking that she'll most likely soon forget who i am and will never witness me getting married or even graduating university. in the beginning i was in denial and getting extremely frustrated talking/listening to her when we had no clue what the other was on about or when she wouldn't understand simple questions or statements.with time though, i have realised that my role now is to provide her comfort and support and do anything i can for her to be at peace, live a comfortable life surrounded by love. there's no point getting irritated at something that's beyond her control and is just not her. she's not aware of her illness, therefore all we as her family can do is just be there for her, stimulate her as much as possible and just be supportive, sort of live in the moment and accommodate to her new needs and new personality. she's not suffering, she's very happy and cheerful in a childish way most of the time and that's what really matters. i am very sorry to hear that your mum's beliefs/opinions/personality have been affected.  my mum's character has altered a lot but on the contrary to yours, my mum is very passive, agrees to do anything you tell her and is in a good mood most of the time. i've begun to treat her more like a best friend, a person i love and would do anything for, just be patient and try give her best life possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/himrw2/i_dont_know_how_to_stop_being_angry_that_my_mom/,I don't know how to stop being angry that my mom doesn't feel like the mom I've known my whole life.

"i am not sure of all of the connections made in this article, but the following is very probably true:a combination of antioxidants at increasing doses was more beneficial at preventing the debilitating disease than any other treatment currently available \[vitamin c is likely an exception to this rule\].  [ evidence is also accumulating that combinations of antioxidants may be more effective, taking advantage of synergistic effects of appropriate antioxidants as well as a nutrient-rich diet to prevent and reverse ad. this review focuses on nutritional, nutraceutical and antioxidant treatments of ad, although they can also be used in other chronic degenerative and neurodegenerative diseases. ["," another study along similar lines: # antioxidant treatment in acute ischemic stroke may delay the onset of alzheimer's dementiawith normal ageing oxidative stress increases and is involved in causing degenerative diseases like alzheimer's disease. an ischemic stroke significantly increases oxidative stress in the brain, and this may increase the rate of neuronal degeneration. the authors hypothesize that antioxidant treatment in acute ischemic stroke, by diminishing this oxidative imbalance, may delay the onset of clinically overt dementia...to date there is growing evidence of the association of vascular risk factors like hypertension, high cholesterol levels or diabetes mellitus with cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease. unfortunately, simply managing these risk factors had little effect in reducing the incidence of dementia. these factors, however, strongly increase the risk of a patient to suffer an ischemic stroke and incident stroke approximately doubles the risk of dementia. from the study of saver published in 2006 we know that ""each hour in which treatment fails to occur the brain loses as many neurons as it does in 3.6 years of normal aging""...there is a considerable overlap between the oxidative stress-induced pathogenesis in ischemic stroke and alzheimer's disease including mitochondrial dysfunction (the mitochondria being the main generators of energy in the cells), calcium overload of the cells, activation of different destructive enzymes by the excess intracellular calcium, aberrant gene transcription and expression, induction of autophagy (a process by which cells degrade their own cytoplasmic proteins and organelles) and activation of inflammatory responses...in view of the implication of oxidative stress in the genesis of ad pathology, the authors hypothesize that with aging, in the presence of well-established vascular risk factors, and possibly with a genetic contribution, ad pathology develops slowly without clinically overt cognitive impairment. however, after a stroke there is a sudden burst in oxidative stress which accelerates the pathogenesis of dementia and leads to clinically obvious cognitive impairment. if this hypothesis would be proven the reason for reaching antioxidant treatment in acute ischemic stroke would be reinforced. further studies in this direction with long follow-up periods would be needed. nonetheless, in view of the high incidence and prevalence of the disease, the results could be rewarding.[**",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hi1oww/antioxidants_in_the_prevention_and_treatment_of/,Antioxidants in the Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease
"my (29f) grandma (73f) has been staying with me and my mom for the past five months. in february, she was in horrible condition. we had just found out about her dementia and she called us in a panic about it. told us a man broke into her house and that she was at the police station. they were going to take her home but she refused and they were going to just put her out. at the time, i think covid was ramping up but we didn’t know that yet. regardless, my mom insisted on picking her up several hours away to get her. since then with the stay at home orders in both states and with her condition, we’ve been basically keeping her inside.....which she hates. she has diabetes, hbp, and a really bad knee. with all of that, she still wakes up every morning in full clothing with her duffle in hand ready to “get away from us.” as she puts it. she can’t take care of herself, she wasn’t eating before she stayed with us. she’ll get on the phone and talk to family and strangers for hours rather than talk to us. she’ll tell them we’re ignoring her and that my mom took thousands of dollars from her. and whenever i try to calm her down, she calls me a liar and that i’m in this with her. i’m at my wits end. she refuses to go to a doctor. she won’t go to be evaluated, so we don’t even know what type of dementia she has. she refuses a poa any time we mention it. she keeps saying she’d rather be alone again and i tell her she literally can’t be alone. she gets angry at me! i try to make up a story or coax her into help but she refuses again. she forgets about covid every day as well. one day she even said that it “can’t be that bad.” very frustrating. i think the worst thing is the berating my mom gets from her. i see people mention how their loved one changed personalities due to dementia. well, my grandma has always been this way. i remember her just berating my mom through my childhood, always bringing up the past and never getting over anything. my mom is definitely getting caregiver burnout as well. i’m trying to pick up where she leaves off but it’s so hard. my grandma doesn’t believe a thing we say at all and i’m unsure where to turn. what advice could you all give? i’ve been trying everything!"," contact your local council on aging, they should have help for you.i got my parent to the doctor by telling them we were going out to target together.  it sucks have to deceive my parent but its for their own good and safety.it felt bad but it was the only way i could get them a diagnosis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hi1ayp/ive_tried_everything_with_my_grandma_to_get_her/,I’ve tried everything with my grandma to get her the help she needs and she flat out refuses.

so basically my wife and i live in a condo complex with six units. one of our neighbors on the first floor is an elderly man with his wife and son who is about my age(mid 20s). they are a european family with the older man having a thick accent. the first couple of months that we moved in the older man would always be ready at the front door to open it for us when we came home. our parking spot is right in front of his unit. didn’t see anything wrong with it. later on we noticed he had a habit of always looking outside whenever anyone from our building would walk towards the building. one day my wife and i came home and when we walked inside he had opened his door and told my wife to park better. after several times of this happening we tried to explain to him that nothing was bad with her parking and he would not listen and get mad with her. this is when i noticed he would only ask her to park better even though i did the same thing. eventually his son caught us outside and told us that he has dementia and was just crazy. told us to just ignore him and apologized. fast forward to now and he still has a problem with my wife and every so often will yell at me whenever i move our cars (we have two cars).  we’ve heard him say anything from “she should get her eyes checked” to “he has a friend that can show her how to park”.  some weeks he will tell us great job on the parking and i have no idea if he’s being sincere or sarcastic. unfortunately i raised my voice with him defending my wife and that got me nowhere. for the last two months we have completely ignored him and made zero eye contact with him but he just doesn’t get it. we will go through dry spells (winter time since he isn’t out at all) with no contact with him to a summer of him being outside all the time. don’t think he ever leaves the house or drive. we’ve talked to one of our other neighbors and they told us that he was like that with them for a while and to just ignore him. they also told us that he likes to confront women and hardly ever confronts men (which explains a lot). in this last year out of all 6 units he has only had a problem with us for some reason. we like to keep to ourselves and try to be respectful. when his son told us he had dementia we felt horrible for making assumptions of him but it’s been getting really difficult for her and i keep getting angry. bless my wife because

"my grandfather was recently diagnosed with frontotemporal degeneration. he is not accepting the diagnosis but it is very clear to the whole family that he is need of a lot of help. his doctor is not being very helpful in giving my grandmother support, so i am very worried about her. does anyone know of a virtual support group that she could join? their hospital hosts a phone call once a month, but of course we just missed it.", i recommend checking out [the caregiver space. ](www.thecaregiverspace.com),https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/hgbc6p/virtual_support_groups_for_caregivers/,Virtual Support Groups for Caregivers?

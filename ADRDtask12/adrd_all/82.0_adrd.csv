"i (f19) was visiting my grandmother today after a few months again because i moved and covid. prior i was living in the same street as her and she was very important to me because my mother has mental health issues and i needed a female in my life. well last year she already had started having dementia but it was fine, she was a little confused but she knew most of the information.she would always tell me to sit down next to her bed and comment on my looks and ask me if i was hungry, as soon as i entered the room.but today i came in and she just stared at me for a while, then she asked me if i'm here because of her diapers (she's mostly bedridden)i told her my name and that i was her granddaughter.i was so overwhelmed and started crying, but she just looked at me confused.i stayed at her place for 1 or 2 hours and tried talking to her but didn't really know about what because she always forgot who i was, this just feels so surreal...she sometimes managed to form a few sentences but mostly she driftet away and said unrelated stuff.i just don't know how to deal with this, i wish i could do something with her but she can't really move much.i have to cry every half an hour or so, i feel like i lost her even if she's still here.i really need some advice how to handle this it makes me so sad.."," i have discovered for myself, that i recognize my husband much more if he is wearing green uniform (he worked for parks) and covers his bald head with a hat like he used to wear. if you have changed your hair or clothing style, it will probably make it more difficult for her to recognize you.  i am looking for the man i met and fell in love with.  and i am looking for my sister with long dark hair, and children grandchildren.but there is often a thing they can do or sing which will trigger the recognition -- for my sister it is singing the song ""they call the wind maria""",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nw6fm5/my_grandmother_didnt_recognize_me_today/,My grandmother didn't recognize me today

"i want to start by saying that this thread has comforted me during some really dark moments. i'm so glad this forum exists. my mom had a fall in august of 2020 that changed everything. broken ribs, a knee that she wound up needing knee replacement for, and a torn rotator cuff. she just never fully recovered from that. in april 2021, she had another bad fall and injured her back. she's now in a nursing home but in and out of the hospital for various ailments. she has parkinson's with lewy body dementia. she still recognizes me but her memory ebbs and flows. she talks to me about the crying baby at the foot of her bed or the people talking about her after she asks about my dad. when she's lucid, she will tell me how lonely she is and that she wants to go home. if only i had a magic wand...while going through my phone, i listened to messages she sent every time she was having a crisis or hallucinating in the middle of the night. then i came across a message she left that i had never listened to. it was from the night before she fell. her voice was clear and the memory issues weren't too bad. she said in spanish ""hi honey, it's your mom. just wanted to call you and wish you a good night. may god bless you and keep you."" i play that message every night...and i say goodnight to her from my bed every night. i miss my mom.", ‚ù§Ô∏è,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nvjxc4/her_last_message/,Her last message.....

"im a young man visiting my great grandmother for probably the last time. she‚Äôs had pretty severe dementia for the last few years and i‚Äôve only seen her about 4 times since her diagnosis, and she‚Äôs recognized me and known who i am probably half the time. how do i talk to her when i visit her if she doesn‚Äôt recognize me? should i say, ‚Äúdo you remember who i am?‚Äù"," one thing i'm learning with my mom, whose dementia is moderate, is not to go in with any expectations but to have several loose plans ready depending on what kind of day she's having. is she up for a walk? yay, let's go for a walk! no walk? okay, how about an activity she might enjoy? that has to be flexible too, because as she loses memory and cognitive skills, her range of activities she can genuinely enjoy goes down. so, no more jigsaw puzzles, but i can sort things with her or ask her to read an article from reader's digest or do some chores like folding laundry. how about out for lunch? these days, it's not that she's avoiding social interactions, but her appetite is so poor, she has no interest in food. and if none of that works, let's put on a british mystery series like father brown or poirot.play it loose, and remember, it's okay if you stumble. managing a neutral or positive reaction when your loved one shows a deficit you weren't expecting is hard. be kind to yourself as much as you are kind to her. even if she doesn't know who you are, you clearly love her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nv9mij/talking_to_my_great_grandma_with_dementia/,Talking to my great grandma with dementia

"this discussion might be a bit much for this subreddit, but i‚Äôve been sitting on this for a few hours now and want to share my thoughts. the most common caregiving advice seems to be ‚Äúget some respite/take a vacation/get some help‚Äù or a variation of those common phrases. the thing is, that line of thinking assumes people have access to good healthcare, money, and/or have family/friends.not everyone can afford to take off work for a vacation. not everyone has access to good healthcare. not everyone has the financial means to hire in more help. it‚Äôs so important we keep these things in mind as we offer blanket advice to folks in this subreddit. i understand we all mean well and want to support each other, but a little thoughtfulness and perspective can be the difference between helpful and unhelpful advice."," i agree with you to a certain extent. i believe most people who come to this sub with a question are looking for tips and tools to take care of someone they love who has dementia. saying: ""just take some time off"" (or: ""just give them these meds"" for that matter) doesn't help with their primary question.however, caregiver burn-out is a big factor in having difficulty handling certain behaviours. i think most people in this sub know the feeling of thinking you can not handle it anymore and then the person with dementia behaving even worse, and so on and so on. people with dementia can generally sense the atmosphere of their surroudings and emotions of their caregivers even better, but often don't have the capacity anymore to react to it in an empathic way, rather than a primal reaction of sadness or anger. this all contributes to their problematic behaviour and the burn-out of the caregiver. i think taking a step back, even mentally if you can't physically, is good advice. ultimately, if you can't function anymore because of burn-out, you can also not help the person you want to help. of course, it is hard to organise help especially in the us, but that doesn't make the advice itself problematic. it is ok to feel overwhelmed as a caregiver and you can't expect yourself to do give care 24/7 that in a professional setting is given in shifts of max. 8 hours.i think if people give the advice to take a step back, it is because they too were in this situation and it has helped them deal with it. it is to help caregivers see that they are humans too and are maybe expecting too much of what they can do. it might empower someone to seek help if they didn't already. sometimes you need to get this advice in order to seek help. just like not everyone having access to this help, not everyone might have thought to look for it (and might be able to find help if they do).  so i get your point that not everyone has access to extra care (which saddens me), but that doesn't mean it can't be good advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nv42ey/a_lot_of_caregiving_advice_is_problematic/,A lot of caregiving advice is‚Ä¶ problematic.

"i am an only child in my late 20's that is currently living under my father's roof with my grandfather who has dementia. my father and i are the sole caregivers of my grandfather, and i find it's incredibly stressful and hard to put my needs first because both my father and i have our lives revolving around taking care of my grandfather. to put some information into perspective, my grandfather is in his early 80's and cannot walk and is beginning to forget the english language as his native language is spanish. he is unable to go to the bathroom unless a psw or my father carries him to the washroom because he no longer tolerates standing on both of his feet, resulting in me having to assist the psw's with transferring my grandfather to the bathroom. my grandfather forgets that he's unable to walk and often asks where is mother is or where my deceased grandmother is. my father works outside of the family home and i currently work from home as a result of the pandemic.this has given me the opportunity to monitor and care for my grandfather until my father returns home from work in the evenings, however, now that i'm in my late 20's and in a serious relationship, i would really like to consider moving out. my biggest issue is talking to my father about the possibility of me eventually wanting my own life and independence, because my father relies on me to look after my grandfather during the day. the psw (personal support workers) that do come to our home only stay for about 15 minutes to transfer my grandfather to the washroom and return him back to his recliner. i carry a lot of guilt about potentially leaving my family home because i don't want any additional stress put onto my father when it comes to my grandfather. as most of us know, caretaking is a full-time job and isn't easy when it's in regards to a loved one with dementia. how can i overcome this fear of discussing me moving out without the guilt of wanting to live my own life?  i love my father and grandfather so much, and i feel so much guilt for considering wanting to move out. i'm mentally tied and don't know what to do."," nothing happens in a day, it will take some time for those feelings to lessen.  and a lot depends on how your father takes it.  but you are not a bad son/grandson for needing your own life outside of theirs.  covid created a time for you to be home and willing to shoulder some of the burden, but that time is coming to an end and that is how you should word it to your father, it's time to return to your life.the situation sounds like the time is coming when your grandfather can no longer be cared for at home, i'm sorry.  wish you well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nue2fc/i_am_a_caregiver_to_a_loved_one_with_dementia_and/,I am a caregiver to a loved one with dementia and I feel guilty for wanting to move out of my family home.

"my mil is currently in the process of being tested for dementia, among other things. she has had the delusion for a while now that somehow her neighbors are breaking into her house and stealing from her. my partner and i realize that all the camera systems in the world won't prove to her this isn't happening, and we know better than to argue with her about this. however, we used to be able to redirect her fairly easily, and get her out of the house to go on walks, see her granddaughter, ect. recently, she has declined to leave her home, citing fearing her neighbors. is there anything we can do to help encourage her to get out of her house, a house that honestly only adds to her anxiety and paranoia. also, since she does not yet have a formal diagnosis, she is not medicated (and i highly doubt she would take medication willingly). i also realize the time for her living independently is rapidly coming to an end, but until she has a diagnosis, there is not much we can do to compel her to access services. thank you in advance."," my dad gets things in his head and is convinced they are true and warranted. nothing deters him. so far he has dropped em all except for getting a new mattress. he has an antique wooden bedframe and it creaks. he was convinced it was the mattress. he got a new one, frame still creaks but magically dad doesnt hear it. sorry, i have no fix. does she not know her neighbors? might ask her doctors office if theres someone you can talk to and get some ideas. best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nt0t2u/how_to_get_them_outside_of_the_home_when_they/,How to get them outside of the home when they refuse?

"my grandparents are 90 and 91. my grandfather, you would probably think is in his late 70s or early 80s - he's still very healthy and active (or was until lockdown anyway). he still drives, they still live in their own home. but my grandmother has been declining over the last five years or so, and rapidly over the past year. at first it seemed like typical old age stuff, like forgetting a word here or there. but her memory and mood have dropped off noticeably over the past year. apparently she no longer cooks, and she spends most of her time in her chair in the family room even though we try to get her to do stuff. it is heartbreaking because she was also very active all my life. her no longer reading, knitting, cooking, playing cards etc. is definitely out of character.mental illness runs in that side of the family. my dad and i are both medicated for depression and anxiety. i know she has had anxiety issues all her life, and was also on ativan at some point (she revealed this to me when i was first having trouble), but never really got a proper diagnosis or therapy because it was a different time. her anxiety has been the worst to deal with, and i thought until last night that it was an untreated anxiety disorder that was the problem here. last night my dad called them, and my grandfather sounded exasperated. apparently she had been pacing and agitated, and wouldn't say what about when he tried to help. my dad talked to her and she just kept saying she was very anxious, but didn't know what about. he helped to talk her down for a while. he checked in today and grandpa said she couldn't remember what happened last night in the morning. she said she knew something happened but wasn't sure what. and her mood was fine today.after searching i understand this is classic sundowning, and it will probably become more frequent. i told my dad and he said he has believed for a while now that she is in early dementia. he told my grandfather to call the doctor and make her an appointment about the incident last night, which we believe he'll do. but he tells us that he's tried to raise her issues to the doctor at previous appointments, and she just denies everything, and is ""together"" enough during appointments that i guess there's nothing the doc can do. my grandfather is worried and asks my dad for help often now and we don't know what to do. about two years ago they were looking at moving into a retirement home, my grandfather was ready to do it even though he is fine independently, and recognized that she needs some assistance and it would be good for her. they went on tours and were almost going to commit to a place, but she changed her mind and refused at the last minute. now of course, i am glad they weren't in a home last year... but now that it's safer, it's probably a good idea.what complicates things is that my aunt is nuts. we're all fairly sure she is undiagnosed borderline or something like that. half the family is alienated from her. she is very clingy to my grandparents and calls them multiple times a day, every day. she has definitely made things worse, constantly seeding fear about my grandfather's health in my grandmother's mind, for example. she convinced grandma about a decade ago that she couldn't go anywhere unassisted because she might fall. yet she is also in denial about her cognitive issues and was the main person who talked her out of moving into the home.so yeah... i just needed to vent, because i am very sad about all of this, and we don't really know what to do. our family has been pretty lucky with health, lots of long-lived relatives and nobody has had significant problems with dementia. so i guess if anyone knows what we can do as a family, talking to the doctor or getting resources when she won't accept outside help, that would be helpful. or anything about dealing with family members that are counter-productive too.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nsnolu/pretty_sure_my_grandmother_is_developing_dementia/,Pretty sure my grandmother is developing dementia - how to start getting care (in Canada) when she refuses?

"dementia really reverses the parent-child relationship, where the child caregiver has to put aside the emotional side regarding what's required in caring for the parent and any former concepts of dignity that were applicable prior to the onset and progression of the condition. in having to carrying out daily caregiver duties, specifically concerning hygiene and maintaining the cleanliness of the parent, it's kind of horrible the completely vulnerable position in which the child has to see the parent. i'm referring to the point at which the child caregiver jarringly has to completely undress the parent and see and wash areas of the parent's anatomy that the child shouldn't if this was a merciful universe. undressing the parent, and cleaning the parent's private parts, which the child had never seen and the completely vulnerable position to which the dementia-stricken parent has been reduced, is haunting, and i hate that dementia reduces the parent to such a state. in a just world, a child would never have to change the adult diapers of the parent, cleaning *that* area of the parent's body of urine and feces. i hate that i have to view my mom's body in a clinical manner when changing her diapers, that i have see those parts at all. my mom who grew up in an orphanage from 3 years old with her two sisters, who was on her own by the age of 16. my mom who used to attend every parent-child luncheons, to which i always looked forward. my mom who used to take me out of school for the day to go to the ringling bros and barnum &amp; bailey circus, where i didn't so much want to go to the circus but more spend time with her. my mom who custom made our christmas stockings. my mom who made, from scratch, a star trek costume. my mom who tie-dyed our easter eggs. there's so much more that only exists in my memories and not hers due dementia. i hate the disease.", bless you..,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ns4egz/dementia_and_the_reversal_of_the_parentchild/,"Dementia and the reversal of the parent-child relationship, especially regarding issues of modesty and dignity"

"hi all,my father has lewy body dementia. he lives with my mother and my brother recently moved back in to help with him. i call him frequently and visit when i can, but i will be moving next month to live with my husband who is stationed elsewhere in the military. as far as i know he is capable of taking care of his basic care needs on his own without a lot of assistance (ex. showering, going to the bathroom, etc.) but he is starting to spend most of his time hallucinating or in delusions. my mother and brother also contact me and an older sister who picks him up on many weekends whenever he gets upset and needs to be calmed down. sometimes it helps, but the police are starting to become more frequently involved. he will run out of the house and try to flag down people outside in the middle of paranoid delusions, which sometimes involve bouts of mutual aggression between himself, my mother and my brother. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;my brother has started to say that ""giving it back to him"" is what deescalates the situation, but it's becoming obvious that this situation could become very unsafe as his condition progresses. with that being said, i do not blame them for sometimes reacting the way that they do to the frequent aggression. our house wasn't the calmest growing up and i recognized early on that, compiled with my work and school responsibilities i would not have the patience or ability to consistently and effectively navigate it in-person in a way that would be safest for the situation and my own mental health. he was taken to the hospital at one point and my mother immediately went and picked him up.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b; she has been talking about getting additional in-home care for the last year and a half but nothing has developed on that end. she mentioned at one point that she does not have legal power of attorney over him because she didn't think he would sign it. they are both strong-willed, independent people. his moods have started to fluctuate wildly through the day and he is often resentful and paranoid of her (hence the leaving the house, trying to drive away, etc.). it has occurred to me that she very likely does not have medical power of attorney over him, and does not have a care plan in place for him. she seems to be wanting to arrange care for him as this progresses outside of formal systems, but based on what i have read and who i've spoken with, this is an especially dangerous way to navigate caring for someone with the disease due to the neuropsychiatric components that necessitate a certain level of education/training and what could happen in the event authorities take him after an incident and she doesn't have those legal protections/authorities over him. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;i realize this is an enormous burden on her, but the cycle of unsafe incidents happening over and over again, her soliciting assistance from other family members but not taking long-term steps in regards to his care despite insisting on maintaining complete control over this situation has created a significant amount of anxiety and frustration in me and it seems ultimately self-sabotaging for both of them. it probably goes without saying that cps was involved at our house multiple times and there was a history of alcohol abuse, verbal/emotional abuse and occasionally physical abuse growing up. they are financially well-off and my mother is socially savvy which has allowed her to mitigate/control things moreso than other people may have been able to in her situation, but i recognize that underneath there is a massive amount of untreated psychological illness as was the case with her mother/my grandmother--she recently passed away in a state of isolation and medical/psychological self-neglect, unwilling and uninterested in accepting help from others.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;all of this is compounded by the fact that she does not respond to his delusions and hallucinations as recommended by most professionals--she will tell him what he sees isn't there and correct him on his memory. prior to things getting worse, he would frequently tell me that she tries to ""get him to think the way that he used to"". when i've asked her about changing how she responds to him, she has said that ""i promised i would never lie to him"" but i also think there's just an understandable lack of capacity to respond to the decline in a way that contradicts her reality of who he was. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;the tipping point for me in this situation occurred after my brother texted me saying that he had been extremely agitated for almost a week and nothing was calming him down. i fell into this emotional narrative of my brother ""protecting himself and my mom"" from him being a bully and becoming extremely hypervigilant before snapping back to the reality of these ongoing issues that are potentially exacerbating this situation.  i got a group text from her planning his birthday after a few days, so i assumed he was doing better. i called and he didn't pick up, so i texted her asking her to have him call me back because i wanted to see how he was doing. she called me the next day at 4 in the morning. i asked her why she called so early, and in a irritable/malicious tone she said ""you wanted to speak with your father, didn't you?"" when he got on the phone, he sounded depressed. i asked him how he was doing and he said ""i've been pushed around a lot"". it was an emotional response, but that moment made me start to call agencies and professionals in the area as opposed to continuing to engage in the waiting game that's been going on for the last couple of years. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;after talking to them, the fact that my mother likely does not have a power of attorney over my father and her way of engaging with him is apparently a bomb waiting to go off. in the words of one of the professionals, ""i have seen this happen many times before and it usually escalates to a very dangerous level"". i collected a large number of resources and agency coordinator contact information, forwarding it to her and explaining that they did not need a medical power of attorney to come in and work with him and that some of these resources might actually be able to help her obtain that. while i did this, i had a sinking pit in my stomach knowing that she will likely never utilize these resources, will continue to try to find someone ""off the books"" to help care for him and that things may end up escalating in a really terrible way. &amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;the other thing i realized is without a power of attorney, she will not have the authority to place him into long-term care when things necessitate it. her only avenue would be a guardianship through the courts which from what i have read would require her to present evidence of a care plan. at this point i am worried that she doesn't the psychological capacity to take steps towards this and will enter into a state of angrily resistant medical neglect or worse with him, similar to what my grandmother did with herself.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;plainly put, what should i do? i do not want to call aps, but i also feel like i might have no choice but to emotionally detach from this situation and focus on my own life--i don't think i have it in me to go to birthday parties and pretend like everything is okay knowing that this is going on. when i have spoken to her about this in a more assertive way, she guilt trips me and brings up that my brother and older sister ""help"" her more and implies that because i'm not as involved (i work full time, i'm in a full time graduate program and have been diagnosed with autism and post-traumatic stress disorder) i don't have the right to say anything. my older brother was there more frequently, but she stopped letting him come over when he ""questioned her authority"" by telling her that she needed in-home care for him. as much as i want to distance myself completely from the situation it feels emotionally impossible. the other part of me wonders if i'm massively overreacting and that she, like my sister and brother said the few times i talked to them about it, ""is working on getting help/will get help when she needs it"". any feedback or thoughts are greatly appreciated, and thanks for taking the time to read

"hello, i'm new to this forum and i hope that people with experience would be able to help. i have a 70 year old mother who is still working, for the past year during this covid pandemic her health has declined as she refused to leave the house. shes never really taken care of herself healthwise and is very avoidant when it comes to these things. however the last two weeks she has been sleeping alot, and i mean a lot more than 12 hours a day which is very strange of her as since we were kids she's been like a college student sleeping for only 4-5 hours a day. she has been stressed with work and other financial things. last week, it came to a point that she was so exhausted i'm guessing that she just slept for two days straight, hardly any meals. when she was awake, she would talk to us but not really able to formulate her sentences and she was also very forgetful on what she was talking about during conversation. she has always had a bad memory so we were always chucking it up to old age. but this sudden onset got me worried and i forced her to see a neurologist. the doctor then tells me that she was about 80% sure that my mother had mild dementia and that she would be in denial about this..which she is. the doctor requested her for an mri and she initially said yes to it. however she had forgotten she was claustrophobic and now is doing all her power to not get the mri not to mention that we have other relatives who are scaring her regarding getting one. my sibling and i are at a loss now since she's gotten her sleep and is back to pretty much how she was before but still with the lapses in judgement and rationale. we went to see another doctor today, but he seemed like a quack imo as he started recommending her ivermectin as prophylactic to covid. she was also dumbing down all her symptoms and what not with the doctor whenever i would mention what had occurred the past few weeks.. also the fact that he told her she shouldn't go see a neuro and that she was fine. have you had any experience that dementia patients would show signs and all but be totally lucid with strangers? like they're fooling other people about it? i'm at a loss right now, on what to do as she is adamant to not see a neuro for confirmation or get her tests done."," there are a lot of quacks out there, and other docs who just aren't well-versed enough to see past the veil of normality that many early dementia sufferers can present. before taking her to any more doctors, read their reviews and reach out for recommendations on people who will take it seriously, have a lot of experience in dementia, and ideally offer gds or similar evaluations. we've had a similar experience with a doctor saying my grandma's dementia was mild at worst, nothing to worry about, and that was even when she wasn't hiding it as well. a week later, a specialist we got a recommendation for from family friends told us she was a 5/6 on the scale of 7 - needing full time supervision and care. you have to advocate hard that they don't know what's in their best interest right now and that you're seeing very concerning things at home. i've said it a million times on this sub, write a letter with examples, symptoms, etc. and highlighting your main concerns, and drop it off ahead of the appointment. it can help the doctor be prepared for what they're dealing with, and lessen the 'her word against mine' aspect of some appointments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nq1pb1/help_mother_may_be_in_denial_regarding_dementia/,Help: Mother may be in denial regarding dementia onset.

"so to preface this there needs to be some back story. my family has been slowly dwindling since 2019 when my dad died then in 2020 my uncle (dads brother) died the reason, i bring this up is because these were the people who when my grandparents got bad were gonna be taking care of them the rest of the family is out of state and cant feasibly be expected to come all the way to take care of them, so that leaves me the most immediate next of kin. just a couple months ago my grandpa who i dont think has dementia (he doesnt have any diagnosis and isnt near as bad as my grandma) hit a motorcyclist while driving to the store and screwed his leg pretty badly, long story short theyre more than likely being sued by them and now it has fallen on me solely to take care of them. i do nearly everything for them they arent allowed to drive i have their keys so i take them 2 times a week to the store/bank/post office etc. etc.  the problem is they insist that they can drive themselves they insist that they can shop themselves (after shopping trips they thank me like im their savior because they realise how bad it is, but immediatly forget afterwards how much i helped) but if they did any of this for themselves they would have killed someone or been killed by someone. i dont know what to do anymore i know i have to continue helping them but i have a life and its taking a toll on my mental health and social health but what can i do. they call me every day multiple times a day asking to go places and i just cant uproot myself to do things for them every day all day its becoming a full time job that im not being paid very much to do i love them very much and plan to never stop helping them even if i dont get paid much or at all but it is hard, is there anything i can do to help them understand im just trying to keep them and everyone else safe?"," oh, so sorry for your losses, and for becoming sole carer for grandparents, that's really hard, and sad!   they're lucky they have you!   idk, in your country can you access any in-home care services?   contact your dementia .org and/or alzheimers .org for advice.  there are orgs in many countries that have lot of great info online, resources, tips, advice, telephone helplines, etc, they can help you find some possible solutions or assistance or something.sometimes there are local church groups, that volunteer help with some small things like home visit, go out to supermarkets, even when the person isn't a member of their church or religion...could you write it out clearly on their calendar in the kitchen, or on a note taped to the kitchen counter or on the fridge, something like  """"""gungoidfever shopping center & errand trip with you,  tuesday 6 - 8 pm ;  saturday  1 - 3 pm""""""  idk, sometimes it helps my mum when i write her notes, or on her calendar, when something will happen, it stops her pestering me asking a million times, and calms herself when she can see exactly when something supposed to happen.and join a carers network, it's sure hard being sole carer, i really feel for you!   i'm same situation with my mum, actually.   often there are local dementia-carer facebook private groups you can join, it's some sort of feelings that you're not alone, and can pick up some good tips from other people, how they manage their memory lossed loved ones.best of luck!ps - there's also r/caregiversupport , fwiw...",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/npkgaz/i_need_help/,i need help

i finally went to visit my mom. she‚Äôs still living in her 3000+ sq ft house in a nice neighborhood (very safe). she has an underlying mental illness/paranoia/depression and now dementia (like stage 6). she can still use the bathroom. we have aides come in to help 4 hours each day. she throws a fit on any suggestion she should change her clothes. the doctor believes that a psych team would be needed to get her to bathe. we‚Äôre trying to keep her at home but it‚Äôs a lot to maintain (and she doesn‚Äôt have a lot of income) but i feel it‚Äôs time for her to move on and get additional care. i do worry she‚Äôd have to be highly medicated and potentially injured but an impatient nurse but i‚Äôm just kinda tired of having to take care of things from a distance. i also think it‚Äôs unfair on her neighbors to have to look out for her (and deal with an unsightly house). the house i could help improve but i‚Äôm just not sure it makes sense to do so. but she‚Äôs comfortable there and still recognizes it... what to do?, thank you all for your comments. really appreciate it. i feel like i‚Äôm between a rock and a hard place. i also feel like an awful daughter fir not wanting to take care of her myself but i have my own life/family/career. i‚Äôve worried about her and helped her since my dad died 20 years ago. i‚Äôve pushed myself to work and save so that one day i could help her. but honestly i haven‚Äôt spent much of my savings on her. many people say don‚Äôt do it... but her situation needs to improve one way or another. just need to figure out what ‚Äúimprove‚Äù actually looks like.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/npgued/mom_hasnt_bathed_in_years_and_hasnt_changed_her/,Mom hasn‚Äôt bathed in years and hasn‚Äôt changed her clothes in months

(b is still convinced that her memory problems are related to her fall she had in 2019) they did a memory test that was 2 days long. i don‚Äôt know if it was inconclusive or what but no diagnosis came from it. this past april she finally had the eeg and mri and met with the doctor this past monday to discuss the results. we (so and myself) have not been told what the results were but i‚Äôm highly suspicious that she has dementia/ad. b has been going to speech therapy for a few months. she goes three times a week but dislikes it because ‚Äúshe isn‚Äôt getting better‚Äù. she still thinks that her memory problems started after she had the fall in 2019. i‚Äôve noticed memory problems way prior to ‚Äúthe fall‚Äù but i‚Äôm only the daughter in law. b hasn‚Äôt driven since they moved away (about 15 years ago). i understand, it was a new area and she wasn‚Äôt sure so her husband drove everywhere. now that they‚Äôre back down here (where they‚Äôre originally from) she still hasn‚Äôt driven. right before the pandemic started, b and husband went on a trip to see the oldest child out of state. on the flight home, the plane had to return to the terminal because b was having a medical emergency. her blood pressure was super high and she was having chest pains. she was having a panic attack and also forgot to take her bp meds that morning. i did a little research and found a ‚Äúpill machine‚Äù on amazon. as annoying as it is, it has really helped b. her taking her meds was an issue when her husband was still working. my father in law retired about a year ago. and bless his heart- he has the patience of a saint. he is now in charge of the whole household. bills, appointments, grocery shopping, etc i feel sorry for him because even though he‚Äôs the mentally 100%, he has post-polio syndrome so his physical capabilities are somewhat diminished (and will most likely get progressively worse)i come from a medical background and am currently a nursing student at 35. i witnessed my ex boss‚Äôs cognitive decline into alzheimer‚Äôs first hand and my grandfather had ad also (he was in his late 80s when diagnosed). i feel somewhat responsible for being a medical liaison for my in-laws. they usually come to me with questions or concerns. i try my best to answer questions. my concern all along has been - no one in the family is acknowledging that b has ‚Äúdementia‚Äùi‚Äôm hoping that the results from the mri gave them an actual diagnosis so there‚Äôs not this ‚Äúit will get better, why isn‚Äôt it getting better‚Äù mentality. i‚Äôve watched some of the teepa snow videos and i love her. i‚Äôm so thankful to the people on this sub that recommended her. i think that will be a great resource to share with b‚Äôs family (her husband, my husband, and his sisters). i also learned that b has had 3 siblings that have passed already that all had alzheimer‚Äôs. i‚Äôm pretty sure that was never told to any of her doctors but that‚Äôs a gigantic red flag to me. i apologize for my lengthy story. i just felt like i needed to get it all off my chest. i‚Äôve been lurking on here for a little bit and reading everyone‚Äôs stories. i truly love how supportive this community is. to quote my best friend who is a hospice nurse, ‚Äúdementia is a bitch‚Äù."," this is a fakespot reviews analysis bot. fakespot detects fake reviews, fake products and unreliable sellers using ai.here is the analysis for the amazon product reviews:>**name**: medcenter (70265) 31 day pill organizer with reminder system >**company**: medcenter>**amazon product rating**: 4.4 >**fakespot reviews grade**: a>**adjusted fakespot rating**: 4.4>**analysis performed at**: 10-07-2020 [link to fakespot analysis]( | [check out the fakespot chrome extension!](*fakespot analyzes the reviews authenticity and not the product quality using ai. we look for real reviews that mention product issues such as counterfeits, defects, and bad return policies that fake reviews try to hide from consumers.**we give an a-f letter for trustworthiness of reviews. a = very trustworthy reviews, f = highly untrustworthy reviews. we also provide seller ratings to warn you if the seller can be trusted or not.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/no4d7w/suspected_dementia/,Suspected dementia

"i just posted on here not long ago saying that my mom had moved into a stage of being angry and insulting, it looks like now she‚Äôs in the phase of thinking we are all conspiring against her. i know this it totally normal for dementia and i was expecting it. unfortunately, i waited too long to get her a diagnosis so now we are in this stage of paranoia and anger and i have yet to get her to the doctor for a diagnosis. she‚Äôs done her primary doctor but has her first neuro appointment next month.to make things worse i live 8hrs away. she lives with her boyfriend but he is almost useless (alcoholic, depressed, etc). how do you force a grown woman to go to a doctor? i may have to drive home and take her (right now the senior bus is set to take her to the appointment) but i don‚Äôt even know how i will force her to go even if i‚Äôm there.she‚Äôs not far gone enough mentally for me to tell her it‚Äôs something else like shopping or lunch. she is rebelling against the idea that she even has dementia so i‚Äôm afraid she will never go. we need the diagnosis in order to do things like medicaid and poa i assume. any tips?"," i'm in the same boat! i live halfway across the country from my parents. i came to their house in early may assuming a one week visit was enough, and it looks like i'm here for  most of the summer (i took a leave of absence from work). the first week i was here it was apparent that dad couldn't handle this alone and that mom hadn't seen a neurologist for almost 2 years.  she'd been canceling her appointments, telling my dad that they cancelled, not her. i got her an appointment and she said she'd go - then changed her mind. she had a massive meltdown for almost 2 hours. she was out of control and actually came at me as if to hit me - yikes. my dad is absolutely baffled and has no idea what to do - so i told her that she was seeing a doctor of some sort that day. her decision. get in the car and see the neuro, or i'd call an ambulance and they'd take her to the er (the local hospital has a geriatric psychiatric area). this of course elevated the tantrum to an entirely new level. i just kept my cool and told her that she did have a choice, and that if she didn't make it, i would. car or ambulance. we had to dress her. she tried to lock herself in the toilet. it was awful. we finally got there and found out about the cancellations, etc.  the doctor prescribed thee medications, two of which she should have been taking for 2 years now (he was her neuro back then and prescribed aricept and namenda). the meds helped - i think (or we just got lucky) for a few days then the paranoia and acting out came back. this is hard. i had to take the ""tough love"" approach which sucked - but we got her there. i'm thankful her doctor is so good at what he does.   i'm sorry you're dealing with this. hopefully knowing you're not alone helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nnsqam/how_do_you_force_them_to_go_to_appointments/,How do you force them to go to appointments?
"during summer last year, my mum started hearing things accompanied by delusions. i had a word with the gp and this lead to the process of having her assessed for psychosis or ""something else"". she's 80, so i was expecting the ""something else"".the process was slowed down by lockdown, but after a brain scan, memory test etc. last week the nurse phoned me to tell me the consultant's diagnosis was vascular dementia (predominantly) with ad.she asked if i wanted to tell her, but asked if she could visit to tell her. for a week i kept this to myself. so much worry.the nurse was great. mum's short term memory is quite bad, but she can do her usual routines and tasks well. i keep her occupied in the evening watching television, sharing snacks, watching youtube animal videos and having chats where i encourage her to tell me about articles she's read in her magazines.the nurse didn't go into great detail about what all the things she could experience as she ages, but told her the basics like why the disease happens. she discussed some medications and asked if she'd like to be in touch with a support worker who will check up on her every few weeks.mum reacted to the news as i thought she would. her sister has dementia also, so she has some idea what might happen. her attitude is that she's 80 and at that age she has to expect her body deteriorating as her mobility is limited too.i told her to not worry about what the future holds because she knows i'm always there to keep her safe and make sure she's looked after.fortunately, when my parents dealt with their will, they made sure i had been given lpoa and arrangements regarding possible future need for a care home.it's not pleasant to know mum has dementia, but i'm taking a day at a time. when declines happen, i'll deal with it then.i'm posting this just incase anyone's worried about breaking the news to a loved one.  it helped enormously to know someone else could do it and also reassuring to know there are resources available so you don't feel completely alone in this.sending love and strength to you all x", i'm so sorry about this news. what a blessing your mom made arrangements for herself.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/nnsefa/the_mental_health_nurse_broke_the_news_to_mum/,The mental health nurse broke the news to Mum yesterday.

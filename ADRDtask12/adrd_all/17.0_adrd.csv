"if someone is diagnosed with early onset, how long can they continue at an office job on average? the person is 55 years old."," it depends. my mom was a little older - showing the signs in her early-60s - and was still working. i know she was on the first of the two alzheimer's meds she takes. two years after she started the first of those meds, she was working closing for the cash office for a grocery store and was always the last to leave. one night, she left work without putting things in the safe, closing the safe, or locking up the doors when she closed the office for the night. someone walked in and stole the cash bag. the owners told her retire quietly and nothing more would come of it. it seemed very sudden to have her go from functioning to forgetting something so huge, but that's exactly how it went.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/la8jla/timeline_to_hold_down_an_office_job/,Timeline to hold down an office job

[removed]," diagnosis of alzheimer's involves ruling out other things, except after death, with an autopsy: from what i've gathered about peoples descriptions on here and my experiences with it in my fam, how thorough a doctor or team is in doing that elimination can vary a bit, and probably depends on what they have available to them, and what kind of connections they have (as in research, or to certain facilities). no doubt it could be slowed down by covid stuffs. it can be frustrating, but if they are super thorough, maybe they will find something causing his symptoms that they can actually fix. once he gets a dx of alzheimer's, its just symptom management, maybe slowing the inevitable a bit, but not curing. regardless, especially if you're the primary caregiver you shouldn't feel in the dark about whats going on. call and ask them to explain whats going on. 1 year does sound kinda long to me but.. covid times man. id just ask. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/l7jt46/alzheimers_diagnosis/,Alzheimer‚Äôs Diagnosis

"  hi all.my father-in-law has been diagnosed, it‚Äôs not too bad yet, but it‚Äôs progressing. my mother-in-law has tasked me with finding a gps tag type of thing just in case he goes for a wander. i‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a service or product that could work. ideally, it‚Äôd be something with multiple tags, like it‚Äôd work on his phone and on some sort of pendant/keychain? it also has to be fairly easy to use, she‚Äôs not great with tech or english and they're in hawaii and we're in the mainland us so i can't help with the setup.i‚Äôve done some looking but there are so damned many things and services that just look like scams or a way to separate desperate people from their money i‚Äôm at a loss.and just randomly anything else we can get or set up to help them?any help would be appreciated."," hey u/slipperedhermit, i'm sorry to hear about your father-in-law. while i'm late to the discussion but maybe i can help. i work for a company which makes these sort of trackers. gps tracking is definitely not a perfect solution, but it can be helpful as things progress. the one we make in the us might be a good fit for your family. the app is pretty straightforward and you can set up geofencing alerts (so if he wanders off, your mother-in-law will know)i shared this already on another thread but i thought it fit here too. a few weeks back a customer sent us this story about finding her mom. don't hesitate to reach out in dm if you've got any questions.""it was an incredibly stressful day! my parents are very independent people. our (my sisters and i) original intent in purchasing the gps device was for peace of mind for us. my sisters and i all live outside of our home state. we wanted to make sure my mom never became lost when driving. she is becoming a bit more forgetful than we are comfortable with and is not a cellphone user. we placed the gps in the glove compartment of my parent's car. my older sister linked it to her phone. one day, my mom had been gone most of the morning. my sister, out of state, looked on the gps app and saw that she was not just far from home, but heading towards the neighboring state! my sisters, father and i did a group ft and decided we needed to call state troopers to locate and stop the car. with the help of your device my sister was able to give the troopers specific enough information that the vehicle was found within a half hour! and this is with the car driving on a freeway! the trooper called and let us know when he found her and was safe. my father rented a car to pick her up and the first thing she said was """" how did you find me""""? she was absolutely stunned, surprised and grateful we found her. we hate to even think how our story would have ended had we not purchased your gps. happy endings indeed! it really worked perfectly! seriously, we have been singing the praises of your company ever since. we give it an 11/10. üôèüòÉ‚Äù-matt from invoxia",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/l6yjre/gps_tracker_recommendations/,GPS tracker recommendations

"we spent much of friday arranging for my mother to come home, which is what she desperately wanted. once it became clear that she was no longer able to swallow and talk and the doctor assured us this was not going to improve again, all that mattered to us was to bring her home and keep her comfortable.thankfully, the at-home nursing organization that already helped my mom with a few small tasks was able to fit everything into their schedule and they arranged for a movable bed to be delivered and also a morphine pump and everything else that was needed, including them stopping by several times a day to help care for her.my mom was brought home by an ambulance late saturday morning and she was awake and aware for the whole ordeal. and while she couldn't talk anymore she was clearly very happy and relieved to be home and to see all of us. in the afternoon her brother and family visited for an hour, and my sister and i stayed with her until a night nurse came to remain during the night so we could get some sleep at home.my mom stayed awake for most of saturday, even if you could tell that she was exhausted. in the evening she was given some medication to help her sleep. she never woke up again on sunday, she just slept peacefully. our family doctor stopped by and recommended slowly weaning her off the supplemental oxygen she was still receiving, which we did during the day. he also predicted she would likely not see the next day.her other brother and family visited sunday afternoon and in the evening i stayed to wait for the night nurse while my sister went home earlier so she could return at 7 the next morning. once the oxygen was shut off completely in the early evening we noticed her breathing changing. it became quite shallow but it was still even and regular. i was watching some tv when her breathing started hitching around ten thirty (cheyne stokes) and her complexion became first pale and then grey. i quickly called my sister, who lives very close by, which was a good thing. my sister got to my mom's within five minutes, and barely five minutes after that my mom passed away in her own home with both of us by her side, exactly as she wanted.i'm feeling very conflicting emotions right now. i'm heartbroken that i've lost my mom, but i'm also desperately relieved that she's been spared the horrible future that awaited her. my mom was terrified of the idea of having to go to a nursing home eventually, but now she's been spared that.i'm also still in shock that alzheimer's can progress this quickly due to a secondary illness (covid, a uti, and a lung embolism in this case), turning a mid-stage alzheimer's patient still living at home into a late-stage patient unable to swallow or speak and progressing to death in less than a week.it's been an emotional and hectic journey since she became ill with corona. now we're going to take a few deep breaths and arrange her cremation.thanks for listening."," i'm so sorry for your loss.  but it was nice to hear that your mother expressed, non-verbally, how happy she was to be home.  i'm glad you have some family support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kzqnto/update_on_mother_with_covid19_and_alzheimers/,Update on mother with covid-19 and Alzheimer's.

"i'm sorry, i just need somewhere to rant, to tell people who understand what this feels like. so my grandma has alzheimer's and she caught covid along with the rest of my family in california. my mom and i live in a different state and taking care of them, especially her, like this is so fucking hard. she doesn't want to eat, doesn't want to get up, doesn't want to do anything. i understand that this is mostly because of the alzheimer's but it's hard because she needs to eat since she's sick with covid. thankfully, it seems like all of them caught a mild case. we call her everyday and she looks so different. i haven't physically seen her in over a year because of the pandemic but most of the time she doesn't know who i am. she just smiles and laughs. they called me while i was at work today because they said she wanted to talk to me. she didn't recognize me at all. i had to take a minute because i just wanted to cry about it. does it always feel like this? it feels like the disease is progressing so much and a couple months down the road she'll completely forget us, forget how to function. how do you guys do it? i'm sorry for this rant. i just needed to tell someone about it"," i‚Äôm sorry to hear your family has covid. my mom has alzheimer‚Äôs and it‚Äôs a daily struggle. in the beginning i cried a lot- especially after talking on the phone with my mom. she doesn‚Äôt remember where i live or what i do. and we have the same conversation every time. while the disease is progressing, it does seem to hold constant on a phase for some time. all i can do is appreciate how she is now; oh, and hearing from others who are going through this now as well. helps me to not feel so alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kxiqe8/alzhemiers_and_covid/,Alzhemier's and COVID
"my mother was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's just over 2 years ago. my dad passed away in 2014 and my mom lived alone in an appartment within walking distance from myself and my sister. while we noticed a gradual decline my mom still had a great quality of life. she spent 4 days a week at daycare in a nursing home, which she loved. they went on daytrips, shopping, to a garden center or the market and even to the christmas circus in 2019. my mom no longer cooked but still managed to prepare microwave meals. she couldn't do a weekly grocery shop so i did that for her. she forgot to clean but she got a cleaning help 3 hours a week. and while we mourned the mother we were slowly losing, we still had her around and were still able to visit and have a chat.two weeks ago wednesday the nursing home called to tell me my mother was short of breath and was running a mild fever and i had to come get her. my sister was able to get her tested that evening and the next day we got the result that she tested positive for corona.we have no clue where she got it. could be anywhere, since my mom never remembered to wash her hands regularly.from wednesday to monday my sister and i visited her several times a day each to care for her. we were given a huge box with protective gear to use on ourself but it wasn't enough since last week my sister got sick and tested positive, and in turn infected her husband and youngest teen son, oldest son still pending. i've been tested 3 times now, all negative.anyway, my mom had high fevers for days and eventually breathing got even more difficult and on monday our family doctor decided to send her to the hospital for oxygen and fluids. it was decided by a doctor there that my mom wouldn't be sent to the icu should her condition worsen, because she wouldn't be able to go through the rehabilitation process following intubation because of her alzheimer's. we agreed with that. she was allowed 1 visitor once a day and since my sister was sick i was in and out of the hospital all week. at first she was very ill, and we realized there was a very large chance covid might kill her. my mom is 77, has survived cancer and is a smoker. but what do you know, fysically she recovered somewhat. she still was weak and needed some oxygen but the fever passed and she seemed to do better.on monday i got some videochats going with some of her cousins whom she's always been close with. and while she was convinced she wasn't sick and she didn't have a clue where she was, she was still able to have a chat and she was lively. untill she wasn't. over the past week her alzheimer's seems to have progressed a year's worth or even more. she no longer understands where she is or why, she didn't recognize her own brother when he visited, she had a huge problem talking and forming coherent sentences, and worst of all, she was no longer able to swallow food or water.this afternoon we had a talk with the doctor there (my sister via video chat since she is still too sick to travel, no matter how much she wanted to be there), and we all concluded that my mom's quality of life was no longer there and that there was no hope of that improving in any significant way.the only solution was giving her food through a tube up her nose but she keeps pulling out her oxygen so we doubt she would accept such a thing, not to mention that it would only prolong her suffering at this point. so we have decided, with the agreement of the doctor, to seize all attempts at feeding her.this afternoon, right before the meeting with the doctor, her condition had worsened so much i was genuinely convinced for a second that i had entered the wrong room, because i didn't recognize her. she did still recognize me for a moment, mask and all, and whispered my name but that is the only coherent thing she said.i am still in shock how fast this virus has turned my mom into an advanced stage alzheimer's patient. how she went from still living on her own to no longer being able to speak and swallow in the span of two weeks. since the start of this pandemic my sister and i have been very worried about my mom catching the corona virus because she's such a high risk case, but we never could have imagined how this horrible virus could end things for my mom.i'm still mostly in shock. tomorrow we're talking with the hospital to get her out of there, maybe to a hospice or even back to her home since she is now officially corona free, so we can make her final days more comfortabele, since that is all we can do now, aside from waiting for the end."," ours was a kidney infection (started as a uti but antibiotics didn‚Äôt work the first round, and it develop e into a kidney infection). my mom went from walking, talking, and feeding herself to none of that in pretty much the course of a weekend. luckily she was only about 6 months in that last stage. as someone who had seen both her parents go through dementia into the late stage, i‚Äôm guessing that she would have been glad that last part was not as long as what her parents went

"howdy, this is a master post of what i've learned about caring for a relative with dementia.  i'm not a health care professional, i've just been through this four times and want a post to give to those who are new. this post combines six other posts.  constructive criticism is welcome.  it's written without covid in mind; it changes things, of course, but most of this is still applicable now and the rest will be again.  there's not a lot of sugar-coating here so if you're in a bad headspace, read this later.  dementia is a progressive, incurable disease that results in death.  half of everyone who lives long enough will develop dementia.  there are multiple types of dementia, but absolute diagnosis of the specific type usually cannot be made until after death.  specific things will make dementia worse: infections, dehydration, surgery, radiation/chemo, hospital stays, changes in routine, traveling, broken bones, alcoholism, etc.  most sufferer's progressions follow a similar pattern, but everyone's specific journey will be different.  note that this progression can take months or decades.  there are things that can be done, we think, to prolong or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms.  a diet low in sugar and alcohol but high on plants and fiber like the mediterranean diet can help.  exercise is essential.  those who speak two languages are half as likely to develop dementia, and people with higher educational attainment develop debilitating symptoms much later than those with less educational attainment. &amp;#x200b;# begin the journeyonce you suspect dementia, get your elder the best long term care insurance you can find.  use their most recent physical you can get; if it's too old, get a new one asap.  do not mention to the doc your suspicions about memory issues; family seems to pick up on these 1-5 years before they show up on the actual diagnostics, and it'd stop you from getting good ltc insurance.  read the contract and see how long you have to wait to get a dementia diagnosis after the policy goes into effect, so to not invalidate the insurance. this is the time to get your legal paperwork in order.  get your power of attorney or equivalent, and get the different forms the different institutions require.  your bank will usually have a notary on hand who can notarize things for you.  speaking of banks, consider moving finances to a credit union.  cus are non-profit: they don't make money off you by charging fees.  this small difference every month can save a lot of money for later, when you really might need it.  care homes are expensive.  also, get your long term directives in order.  what does your elder consider important to her quality of life?  what daily activities does she consider necessary: if she can't do that, it's not worth it?  does she want cpr?  life support?  for how long?  how does she want her body handled?  where to be buried/ashes to be scattered?  your doctor may have a booklet that will help you go through all of this, which can be filled out, notarized, and filed with your doctor/hospital so they have to honor her wishes. then get a dementia diagnosis.  many times a simple problem like a uti or other infection can appear as dementia-like symptoms, so rule out other (solvable) problems first.  if your relative is resistant to going to the doctor, offer to take them out to lunch, or ask them to keep you company while you get a prescription from the hospital's pharmacy, and then take them to their appointment.  yes, it's devious, but nothing happens without a diagnosis.  once you're sure of dementia talk with your resources both professional and family.  your healthcare may have a memory care or elder care group that can help you understand what's going on and what's going to happen.  bring your relatives, or bring them back the brochures.  there will be a lot of very difficult questions from relatives/friends who are not in the loop, such as ""what can we do"" and  ""what's the cure"".  the answers are ""take care of her until she dies"" and ""there isn't a cure"", which they won't like to hear, but will have to accept from the professionals.  so having someone else answer those questions is usually a lot easier.  if they know generally what the progression is you're less likely to come up against issues with them later.  so many relatives think ""oh, they're just hanging with grandma, how nice!"", when the truth is so much darker.  half of all caregivers will develop diseases or die while caregiving; it's often one of the worst, most stressful things we will do in our lives.  get a support group going for yourself, early, while you're still able to find time.  get a therapist if you can.  look around for what help is available where you are.  you go to [alz.org]( and use their resources.  out where i am we have a lot of local resources for home care and supplemental care, i hope you have the same or better.  you can find this by searching for ""elder care"" and your city, county, country, province, etc.  day care, respite care, and other programs are, frankly, essential. this part is important and ongoing.  start looking at where she is in the progression of the disease and make plans for the next step.  not planning for the future is the biggest mistake most families make.  they're so incredibly busy just barely taking care of today's needs that they're not ready for the next step.  my aunt was  literally hoisting my grandmother onto her back to get her from her bedroom to her chair in the front room, and then took care of her during  the day... and that was all she could do.  when grandma caught a cold, the coughing kept her from holding onto my aunt's shoulders so she couldn't get out of bed.  that led to the beginning of bedsores, so she had to go to the hospital.  instead of letting it get to that point aunt should have had in-home carers, lifts, equipment, supportive mattresses... so many things would have made life easier for both of them.  but aunt was too busy -- or overwhelmed -- with the massive job of caregiving.  prepare for the next step while you can. apply for government-paid in-home caring/recompense/assistance now, because by the time your requests are approved, she'll probably need them.  apply for a place at the best memory care facility you can find/afford now, because you can decline placement over and over and over, and just be put back at the head of the list for the next available spot.  during covid we found that the places with union workers had the lowest numbers for covid infections, controlling for many variables, due to the workers having access to ppe, so that's a consideration you might want to look for.  your country/states' department of social services will probably have a rating on all their care homes that might be helpful. many places are big enough that they provide multiple services, from respite to simple assisted living to locked wards, often via different wings.  respite is like checking your elder into a hotel for a weekend: the facility will take your elder for a bit to give you a break, and will help familiarize her with the facility.  these facilities will be able to transition your elder from one stage to the other via professionals.  this is very helpful because caregivers just compensate and compensate and compensate, burning themselves out far past the point where they should have transitioned.  keep in mind that these places run from 60k to 200k per year.  that insane price, along with the proof that elders are healthier longer at home, are why most people keep their elders at home with them for much longer than we used to.  but sometimes a care home is just necessary.  there are placement services which will take your elder's requirements (ostomy care, diabetes, hoyer lifts, meds, etc), distance from your home, and prices into consideration and get you a list of facilities.  they're very helpful and usually take recompense from the homes themselves so they don't cost you anything. save what you can.  talk to your mom and get recordings of her voice.  get tapes of all the family histories and stories you'll ever want to hear.  get her involved in alz groups as an aid or an assistant  so when she's a participant she'll still want to be there.  find out what her favorite music is, download it onto an easy-to-play format for when/if she has bad days.  get out the old pictures and see if she can identify the mystery faces. if you have access to it, look into high-cbd products to see if your elder has a good reaction to them.  dementia progression typically includes depression and anger, and most patients also experience sundowning, sleeplessness, and/or agitation.  cbd can help with all of these if it's well tolerated.  please check with your doctor first, there are a few medications that interact very badly with cannabis.  i have personally had very good luck with mary's medicinals' ""the remedy"" and a high-cbd edible but had to try a few things to find what actually worked.  and boy howdy they really do help. these are things you can do instead of worrying.  i do these things because not doing them is a bad idea, and they help me work through the grief.  activity helps dispel fear and anxiety. &amp;#x200b;# the progressionthe sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  they know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  the ***best prepared*** progression is usually:1. ""impaired  cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my car, i don't remember where i parked it"" situations.  electronic gps like a tile can help here.2. poa/healthcare poa signed by sufferer3. all financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated4. dnr, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time5. long-term care health insurance attained (asap, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be)6. shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, ada furniture, doorways, hallways etc)7. patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage8. this is usually when their driving starts to suffer.  taking away their keys usually provokes horrible rages, there is another option.  go to your country/state's department of motor vehicles site to submit their form for retesting an elder's capability to drive.9. medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.10. medications to help with actual alzheimer's prescribed.  they are usually not very effective, but are expensive and have serious side effects.  some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from hmos for 7-10 years  from now.11. driver's license revoked, usually automatically after diagnosis &amp; medication12. apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  this may take many tries and many years.  talk to your hospitals' elder care representative.13. if sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local authorities so they can be prepared.  this may not be appropriate in certain jurisdictions or for certain families. 14. get an electronic tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.15. around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  this is not common with boomers and silent generations as they generally believe suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in patients who are younger.16. this is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders. it was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in care homes.  now we know that they decline much faster when institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home, where they get better  care.17. in-home care becomes necessary during the day.18. 24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be admitted to a memory care facility.  this is a locked ward where trained professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  this step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver, patient injuring self, etc.  memory care facilities are not cheap, they can run between $4,000 - $14,000+ a month.  &lt;&lt; this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare access burn out... badly.19. patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity20. patient loses ability to feed self21. patient loses ability to swallow&amp;#x200b;this will be posted to both r/alzheimers and r/dementia.   i hope that anyone else can chime in if i've missed anything.", i think it's more appropriate to publish this as a blog somewhere (there are numerous free hosting sites) and link to it.  i read about the first 3-4 paragraphs and then reminded myself i don't come here to read books.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kv7vb9/dementiaalzheimers_disease_progression_for_family/,Dementia/Alzheimer's disease progression for family caregivers

"my husband has been going through so much lately. a year and a half ago he went through a deep depression. he told me he wanted a divorce yet has no recollection of saying that now. then started saying he wanted to separate to collect his thoughts. he‚Äôs been a very angry person and horrible to me for close to two years. he constantly insults me. last july unbeknownst to me, he rented an apartment two hours away on the beach. well he was talking about getting away for a couple weeks or months, he signed a year lease. i‚Äôve seen him on a few occasions but it‚Äôs always on his terms. he says now and this is not about divorce but just figuring life out. it‚Äôs been six months. he‚Äôs in therapy and i am in therapy. he said that we will do therapy together once he is out but he keeps pushing back on that. this is the thing, he has alzheimer‚Äôs on both sides of his family. i just started thinking that his irritability and depression could be an early onset symptom. i haven‚Äôt said this to him but did express my concern and did ask him to do a ct scan and see a doctor yet he refuses. other than the depression and irritability he has no other symptoms. there‚Äôs no memory loss or anything like that. i love him so much but he‚Äôs been horrible to me for so long. a small example of this is just last week when i visited he asked me what i wanted for breakfast (he was cooking). i said ‚Äúwhat are my options?‚Äù he said ‚Äúi asked you what you wanted. make a decision.‚Äù he is constantly negative towards me like this. i have been very supportive but struggling lately."," no- if it was years down the line, then i would say so. i don't know how someone leaves someone in the middle of this disease. but that isn't the case, and if it does happen in the future you should not be stuck with everything for someone you don't love and has been horrible to you. to me sounds like symptoms are caused by a depression. but that is just my opinion. all i am saying is my dad is going through it now, and i love him so much, and so does my mom, and it is infuriating, so i wouldn't wish someone to go through that with someone who they don't feel that way for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kti1jq/am_i_horrible_for_considering_divorce/,Am I horrible for considering divorce?

"hi everyone~~~ i was just wondering what some of the early signs of alzheimer's might be... my mom is 61, and she has been foggy lately with her memory. we weren't too concerned because we just chalked it up to aging, but today she wrote down an exclamation point upside down... i was telling her to write down something that included an exclamation point, and she wrote something that looked like the letter ""i""... i questioned her, and she looked confused for a minute, and then shocked. of course we laughed about it, and she kept wondering how she could have forgotten how to write an exclamation point, but i'm a little concerned to be honest. to be fair, she has been under a lot of stress being a caregiver for my brother who recently had a stroke, so i'm hoping that this is just stress-induced forgetfulness, but i wanted to reach out to see what you all might think. thanks in advance for your insights!"," thank you everyone for your feedback and responses! a couple weeks prior to this incident, she gave my brother the wrong meds.. luckily he noticed and they swapped it out, but that really freaked her out because she doesn't want to do anything that would jeopardize his health i'm any way. i have adhd, so i have trouble figuring out what amount of forgetfulness is strange since i'm always forgetting things. i tried to book her a massage to help her relax, but she refused. ""not until he is better!"" she says... i will definitely keep my eye out. i stayed with her when my brother was in the icu, and i was taking care of all the logistics stuff the first 2 months because she doesn't speak much english.... i still go over twice a week ish, but since i don't live with her, i don't really get to notice much. i may recruit my dad as my observer... i am kind of afraid to ask my mom to see a doctor because i'm worried it will just stress her out even more.. :/",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ksxrxv/early_signs/,Early Signs?
"hi everyone--if anyone has traveled this road further than we have as a family, we could use some ideas. two 92 year olds. dad, type a personality, has vascular dementia and paranoid delusions, so probably reasonably late stage, and completely unable to accept he has dementia. diagnosed mar 2020 after a fall, likely stroke, but he'd been paranoid for a year or two earlier. md declared mentally incompetent oct 2020 in letter to attorney. mom has alzheimers, but she is pretty good. fuzzy short term memory, but she is very much mentally competent still. they moved into a full service care home in nov 2020, right now in independent living (apartment) but option to progress to memory care. issue is that dad's delusions have progressed to accusing one family member of trying to poison him, in cahoots with all the doctors. this was investigated in apr 2020, and obviously this family member's feelings were pretty hurt, so she's not seen him or been in contact with him (lives 90 min away). but that hasn't stopped the delusions, and dad is now at the point of looking for a lawyer to bring charges against this family member and the doctors. the attorney who received the doctor's letter back in oct 2020, dad's estate attorney, appears to have been taken in by dad's story, and so she didn't do anything with the letter. she now seems to understand that this was a mistake, so we are finally going to be able to trigger a power of attorney this week, and she's now saying we need to get a judge to order conservatorship. meanwhile, dad is in a constant rage and is probably right on the edge of coercive control of mom--won't let her speak to anyone, have access to money, leave the house, has to watch her all the time, thinks the doctors are also trying to kill her. she's reaching out for help, and family is willing to do whatever we need, but no one can really speak to her alone because she'd have to be willing to cross him to talk to anyone and she's too afraid of how he will react. but what do we do? mom doesn't want to leave dad, but he's only going to get worse. do we (after as judge orders guardianship for dad) insist he get moved to memory care? he'll be a flight risk the doctors say and will probably have to be on a locked ward, which seems horrible and on day to day things, like food and bathing he's still ok living with mom. is there any way short of that to help mom? the care home is lovely and they are all very nice, but they have not been able to offer any help. and what do we need to do to help protect our family member from the false accusations? she's already been investigated after dad's first set of complaints, and now we're hearing from mom that dad is planning to call the police. they have little kids, and this is putting a lot of strain and hurt on them too. she knows dad can't help it, but police showing up is still really hard, and dad has just focused all is rage on her for some reason (they always had a great relationship before). at wit's end here...  ideas??", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ksrc2q/need_help_figuring_out_what_to_doparanoid/,Need help figuring out what to do--paranoid delusions in vascular dementia situation

"my mother moved into a memory care facility this month and i haven't been to visit her yet. the last time i saw her, dec 19th, she had me confused with my niece and was asking me why i didn't bring my baby so she could see her...i don't have any children. she was very upset and crying because i didn't bring the baby and said she next time i come she wants me to bring the baby. she said i don't care if you don't visit me but i really want to see your baby please. i'm going to visit her tomorrow and i'm very anxious and scared that it will be a repeat of the last visit. i've had her forget who i was before and that's upsetting but this time was different because she was so heart broken that i didn't bring the baby. i can't stand seeing her upset or crying. all i want is to make her happy and i don't know how. does anyone have any suggestions on what i can do to possibly make this visit easier?", i would probably tell her the baby is home sick and not well enough to visit and divert her by asking if she has any home remedies for a baby with a cold. perhaps getting her talking about her experiences raising children will distract her.  it does no good to argue with them.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kn2qw5/im_scared_to_visit/,I'm scared to visit...
"my mom is 55 and both her and i recently moved back to her birth country in europe. covid was unexpected and we're living together now and i'm really startled at her behavior. she is convinced she is just stressed about the move but i feel it's deeper than this. i feel she has about half of the ""10 early warning signs"" i see online. she often seems to forget things i've already told her and then gets mad (i.e. someone was coming over at 2pm). she also gets extremely stressed about planning and doing pretty normal tasks, like preparing a guest room for someone visiting. she'll be stressed and have explosive anger and anxiety 24hrs before the person should arrive, although it's just a matter of cleaning the room. the most obvious sign is she has been losing things. she blamed some workers on stealing her coat and then found it in a box. she also hid organic eggs so i would use them in baking on accident and then thought i ate them, only to find them later. things like this happen several times a week and we argue over them. what do you think? what can i ask her or try to look for to get a better idea? can i contact her doctor? she will not go doe a check up. should i voice my concerns to her? i worry she will be more stressed or angry."," hi op, i'm so sorry this is happening. i'm a few days late but your situation is similar to mine so i wanted to share some insight. my (30f) mom (64) was formally diagnosed at 53. the asinine anger/anxiety combo stands out to me even more than the confusion. what was your mom like in her earlier years? is this anything like her past behavior? i'll first echo start260 to suggest a neurologist visit. this is really important, and i think you should try to find out why your mom won't go the the doctor. getting something on paper from a physician made my life so much easier when trying to work with difficult family and legal issues, even before the formal diagnosis. when the time comes, you'll likely need a physician's support to deal with any public safety concerns (i.e.: drivers license cancelation).if there's another person she is close to, maybe her sibling or close friend she talks to often, consider speaking with them to get thoughts or insights. do other people notice these issues? if they're as bad you think, someone else will notice (assuming she has talked to anyone else during covid).for your part, this sucks on every front and i hope you are finding the support you need.also, consider surrendering to the arguments and accusations when you can. it's not fair (nothing is :/ ), but it won't make a difference. she's probably already experiencing a enormous amount of anxiety she hasn't expressed, and the emotions she feels toward you right now are the ones she'll remember.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kmnkm3/early_onset_symptoms/,Early onset symptoms?
"he hasn‚Äôt been officially diagnosed yet but there‚Äôs family history and he‚Äôs certainly showing signs. he‚Äôs 79 this year. any conversation from him is either an opinion i hear multiple times a day (that politician is a horses ass}, many i agree with, many are batshit crazy, or just a simple observation (it‚Äôs snowing, hey?) or {they got a vaccine, hey). i‚Äôm exhausted having to hear this all day when i‚Äôm home. would like to make conversations more enriching for him and for me, and my mom who gets iso frustrated with him, and of course she deals with this every day)thank you."," older people have witnessed so many changes it might be interesting to ask more details about his childhood and how he grew up, all those memories are intact and he‚Äôd probably enjoy reminiscing and you‚Äôd provably learn things about him you never knew and get curious about others :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/kmnjc2/how_do_i_facilitate_more_enriching_conversations/,How do I facilitate more enriching conversations with my dad?

"we have an alarm system on. it‚Äôs me and my grandmother living here as well and we have responsibilities (e.g., school, work). apparently last night he woke up at 1am and woke my grandmother up presumably for breakfast. she told him to go back to bed. then he woke her up again at 3am for breakfast and she told him to go back to bed again. he then woke her up again at 6:30. in general he wakes up early (6:30ish) in the morning and if someone doesn‚Äôt go downstairs in time he‚Äôll set off the alarm by opening a door (and if someone doesn‚Äôt get down there soon enough the company calls the phone. if someone doesn‚Äôt answer, then the police come to the house). looking towards the future (if this behavior continues) this can be disruptive for both me and my grandmother (e.g., for getting to work/school). any suggestions? even if we leave food in case he wakes up early he‚Äôll likely still set off the alarm. my grandmother proposed the idea of sleeping pills, but we already give him haldol twice a day. i feel like that might be a little too much daily drugging.i can see this becoming a possible new routine. in the past he has made it a routine to insist to cut up the trash, water the bushes at 12am, sweep the deck, incessantly knocking on doors/jiggling door knobs in the morning when he wants something until someone answers. i‚Äôm really hoping it‚Äôs not one though, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to be prepared."," sleeping pills.  worth it cause your health and your grandmas health is being affected.exercise him like crazy during the day so he's tired.also, you could try what i do.  i have an amazon flex speaker with motion sensor mounted in the hall right before the front door and then i have a yolink door sensor right at the front door itself.  the motion sensor where the speaker is triggers a voice announcement to my dad telling him not to go outside and gives him the reason why.  it's only the front door sensor that sends me an alert so if the flex speaker and motion sensor discouraged my dad from opening that door, then i don't receive any alerts.this has worked very well for me going from him always trying to escape to rare incidences of opening the door.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n6z8at/what_to_do_about_grandfather_with_dementia_who/,What to do about grandfather with dementia who wakes up several times in the middle of the night?

for some reason this post wasn't allowed in r/askdocs which is mildly infuriating so asking here and hopeful a doctor will respond. my mom was diagnosed with lewy body about six months ago by her neurologist with input from a psychologist who tested her. she was prescribed medication to deal with hallucinations. no follow-up appointment was provided and although it wasn't explicity stated that no more appointments would be necessary there was a general understanding that there simply wasn't anything to do be done about the onset and progression of the dementia. we've since moved her in with us and intend to look after her for as long as we are able.her symptoms have progressed and at my mother's insistence we've reached out by phone a few times about meeting with the neurologist but we don't hear back beyond his assistant telling us she'll check to see if he thinks an apointment is necessary. we never hear that an appointment isn't necessary.i don't want to pester a doctor if there's no point in scheduling a follow-up. i know this is incurable and we know where this is ultimately headed. but i don't want to give up scheduling follow-ups if they're any way helpful for her either.what position are in here?, definitely contact the lewy body association.  there are meds that are commonly prescribed that people with lbd do way worse on (like some anti-psychotics).  they will have the list and also tell you what to expect and what type of doctor to follow up with,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n69gyj/should_we_not_expect_followup_visits_after_a/,Should we not expect follow-up visits after a dementia diagnosis?

"i'm just whining and there's absolutely nothing positive in here. i'm esl so sorry if this isn't readable. my grandmother died 4 years ago, my grandfather died 2 years ago. they have both had multiple strokes, my grandfather was deteriorating steadily since i was 12 and my grandmother started deteriorating after a bunion surgery when i was 15. my mother was their only caretaker. the only 'help' we had was a nurse from the public hospital who came to our house once every few weeks and took blood pressure readings, i think she was actually sent there to check for possible abuse after my grandmother complained to doctors. when i started high school they both required full time care. my grandfather was practically mute and mostly babbled, sometimes he managed to say a single word. he was pissing himself multiple times a day, which resulted in my mother yelling at him, even when a friend or relative came over. the entire house reeked of urine. he just took his pants off and stood there in a puddle of pee making infant-like noises. sometimes he shat himself too, but this was a rarer occurence. my mom had to force him to bathe, and this resulted in arguments (as much as you can argue with someone who can only moan and mumble the occasional swear word) and screaming. she had to argue with him for every night to put his pajamas on too, sometimes she was so out of it she would beg him on her knees to just put his pajamas on and kiss his fungus-ridden feet. he spent all day sitting on the couch half asleep and when you looked in his eyes you could see there was absolutely nothing behind them. sometimes he smiled at me but it only felt creepy because of the hollow, mindless eyes. he was prescribed rivastigmine patches but my mom didn't give them to him because 'they were making him groggy'.my grandmother was nearly blind, had no sense of time and would wake us up at night or ask about things that happened months ago thinking they happened yesterday. she was screaming at me calling me a whore, or accused my mother of allowing me to get sexually abused in preschool, which never happened, and claimed that was what made me a lesbian (the most disgusting thing in the world and a mental illness according to her). she kept screaming that the house was on fire and it was us who set it on fire. she would get into nasty arguments with my mother, who resented her for being overbearing, and they would insult each other. my grandmother would then cry and scream for her mother for hours. whenever she was taken to a doctor she claimed we were beating her, that's when the nurse started coming to our home.as soon as this began i became severely depressed, i was falling asleep in class and started getting terrible grades. i was put on meds and they helped enough to make me able to go to school at all. every day when i came home from school i was immediately hit with suicidal thoughts. i'm not proud of this but i would fantasize about them falling down the stairs and dying. every day there was screaming and arguing. my mother once told me that she didn't feel she was human anymore. at some other point she told me she won't stop me from killing myself.one time my grandfather fell and couldn't get up when i was home alone. i thought he was having another stroke i called the ambulance and the paramedics arrived and chastized me saying 'you could take care of your grandpa a little bit'.even after they died i was constantly nauseous with stress. i still felt like my grandfather was about to come in my room and piss himself and cause another session of screaming and yelling. i flinched when hearing footsteps at night. just hearing a similar tone of voice to my grandparents' (the kind where you can tell the person is barely capable of understanding what they're saying) made me want to throw up. i had panic attacks over my mother possibly developing dementia. i was constantly on edge. i couldn't even say the word 'grandparents'.a few months after my grandfather died i developed an eating disorder, lost a lot of weight and became suicidal and extremely agitated. ultimately i had to be hospitalized. at the hospital they just changed my meds and claimed that 'i was just stressed out about having to talk to people at school'. i feel really bad for my mother because she had to be an unpaid 24/7 caretaker for both them and me, and i won't blame her for the nasty things she said when she was taking care of them because she was going insane from the stress, but i feel bad that she doesn't understand why the entire situation made me feel awful. at some point she kept accusing me of 'hating my grandparents just because they got old' and now she says that i'm talking about them like they were strangers. that's because they were strangers. my actual grandfather who was an aerospace engineer and taught me math and my actual grandmother who was great with kids and loved my art had nothing in common with what they turned into. when i try to think of the positive memories i have with them my mind immediately comes back to the negative ones, so i mostly push them out of my mind.my mom says she couldn't have placed them in a care home because 'they were like children' but at 15-16 i was an *actual* child. i am 23 now and i made multiple attempts to go to university to get my dream degree in biotechnology, but every time i tried i quickly had to drop out due to the mental health problems that were caused by me living with my grandparents. i have finally made progress with my mental health (mostly thanks to an insightful trip on mushrooms), i'm no longer depressed, and i'm redoing my hs finals. if i get into university i'm finally going to move out of the house i lived in with my grandparents. but also i have hardly any friends, i'm 23 with no higher education, and no ability to deal with stress. i never agreed to sacrifice 7 years of my youth to people who were one foot in the grave already. this is the first time i'm even talking about this, because for the last few years i would almost vomit when i tried to mention it. i can't talk about any of this to people who haven't experienced living with a demented person firsthand, because all they'd get from it is that i don't love my grandparents. even a psychiatrist i saw recently didn't get it, she just said that 'i can't get over my grandparents dying' when this isn't true at all. they were basically dead for years before they actually died and i spent several years expecting them to die at any second. i'm writing all this because while i have progressed enough to be able to live in their house without being reminded of them constantly, finding my school notes from the time they were alive immediately brought back all the memories. i'm just trying to get over it. i would like to finally start living my own life. that's all idk"," > they were basically dead for years before they actually died and i spent several years expecting them to die at any second. that is a powerful statement and something which many care givers should realize at some point.  if you need someone to chat with, feel free to ping me.  i pray and hope that your mental state continues to improve and you can finally live a life free of the burdens put upon you as a child.we don't get it!!!  as care givers i mean!  we believe with all our heart and soul that keeping our loved ones at home, in our house or their house, around the family is ""the right thing to do"".   the sad part is that we can't let go and it's a selfish wish that some miracle may happen.yeah, that's really what it boils down to.  its all love, no doubt.  we just can't think of our lo's living the rest of their life in a facility.  but oh the damage this has on the family.the mental, physical and eventually medical issues that come from this.  no one understands how difficult this is.  no one can feel the pain it causes and eventually when they physically die, no one remembers the torment, anger, frustration and evil that was.  it just all blows away.but the care giver and those around them involved still live with the pain and suffering of the struggles of this journey.your story is an issue much larger than most deal with, however, it's a great story to teach a lesson to the rest of us.  we can't do it alone and those with the disease need to be in a place where they get the attention ""medically"" they need.i wish you all the best in the world for your recovery!!  you are not alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n39qlv/i_dont_know_if_im_ever_going_to_recover_from/,I don't know if I'm ever going to recover from having to live with grandparents with dementia

"my family is about to put my dad into memory care. it's past time. he's frequently agitated, aggressive, keeps trying to leave the house, constantly hallucinating, and has generally just worn us all out with really difficult behavior. he has lewy body, which i understand tends to come with difficulty behaviors. we tried to keep him home, but can't do it anymore and don't feel safe now that he's hitting.unfortunately, we don't feel that we can tell him or involve him in the decision due to his anxiety/agitation/aggression. we stopped telling him about doctor appointments ahead of time, because he'd fuss and fixate and his anxiety would kick into high gear for the 2-3 days leading up. the last time we told him about a dentist appointment ahead of time, he spent the days leading up to it trying repeatedly to run out of the house and spending most of the rest of his time pacing the house, refusing to eat or sleep, because he believed that someone was coming to take him away and cook him in an oven. (we realized the dentist was the trigger because when we asked him when this oven thing was happening he gave the exact date and time of the appointment.)so, we need a lie that he might believe but that won't freak him out and lead to aggression. has anyone else been in this position, and if so, how did you handle it?"," i thought about it for a long time, then i steeled myself for the truth. i am the most qualified to take care of dementia dad. i don't sleep most nights because of his wandering, falling, etc., i'll sleep even less wondering if he's getting the care he deserves from an absolute stranger making minimum wage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n0w0bp/how_did_you_manage_the_transition_to_long_term/,How did you manage the transition to long term care?
"i'm in a difficult spot, my dad is starting to show signs of some kind of dementia. he is no longer a safe driver (he disagrees) and he gets very confused by things that he used to do really well (computers). plus, he's been increasingly susceptible to agresive sales people and making really expensive purchases as a result. currently, dad lives with me and his fiance susan. susan is really struggling emotionally because she's already the primary contact/poa for a friend of her with severe dementia. i'm of limited help because dad doesn't really listen to me about taking care of himself and because i'm disabled myself and can't drive or hold down a job. i'm freaking out because i'm entirly dependant on dad and i was one of mom's primary caregivers as a kid and i don't think i can emotionally go through that again. susan is freaking out because she's facing the idea that she's going to have to sacrifice her entire social life to manage dad (who doesn't think he needs it).i suppose what i'm asking is how can susan and i help dad stay out of a home without sacrificing our own mental well being?"," first of all, you may not be able to. if he keeps doing things that put him or other people in danger, a home environment may not be the best place for him.that said, you can try hiring home health aides. you can try to sell it as a personal assistant to make his life easier, and that really is what they are. they can't, unfortunately, deal with any financial tasks, but they can provide companionship and help with housekeeping and other tasks, as well as giving the family a break.does he have long term care insurance? if not, you may have to pay out of pocket. if you go through an agency, you'll pay more, depending on your area. (example: rates near me are $25-30/hour.) the advantage is that the aides should have gone through background checks and are bonded and insured. also, the agency may have an easier time finding aides than you would if you tried to direct hire. the disadvantage, obviously, is cost. in the us, a home health aide is paid $10-12/hour, so it will require more legwork but cost a lot less to hire one yourself.for help paying for an aide, try contacting your state office for the elderly. they may be able to point you towards assistance. if he's a veteran, fit example, or on medicaid, he'll probably qualify for some assistance.good luck. it's a rough road, and if it gets to be too much, there's no shame in recognizing that his care needs are too much and too complex for in home care to be viable. you need to sleep and eat and work and live your life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n0ry7g/caregiver_options/,Caregiver Options
"my grandmother died a few months ago, after struggling with dementia and all of the issues related to that. she lived here during her final days when she needed round-the-clock care.she was on hospice and the nurses had just resupplied us with a box of wet-wipes when she died. you know, those big ‚Äúadult sized‚Äù ones that are thick and often used for sponge baths in bed.i have toddlers so i threw the box in the bathroom closet and occasionally dip into it for big messes or when i‚Äôm running low on baby wipes. but jesus christ the smell of those things is like a slap in the face. every time; it never gets any better. and i‚Äôm constantly surrounded by things that remind me of her so it doesn‚Äôt make sense?i cook with her casserole dishes and corning ware. i look through her books and photos. my kids wear clothing and play with toys she bought for them.these things bring back fond memories but they‚Äôre fleeting and far away, like from a (literal) lifetime ago.whereas the smell of those godawful wipes instantly place me in a room with her during her darkest days, when her mind and dignity were gone, along with my patience. i‚Äôd use them while manually removing fecal blockages after she‚Äôs eaten too many pain pills and stopped drinking her boost. or i‚Äôd use them to mop up the chocolate boost she spilled all over herself, the bed, and the carpet.or when she was able to drink the boost and  i‚Äôd wake up to big blow-outs all over her and the bed, using the wet-wipes as a shitty replacement for a bath because i couldn‚Äôt pick her up and she refused to stand or walk.idek why i‚Äôm making these posts, months after she‚Äôs gone? if i didn‚Äôt know better i‚Äôd think it was ptsd but i think that trivializes people like soldiers and violent crime victims, who really have suffered.i just wish i could recall the wonderful things about my grandmother as easily as i do the horrible parts that i‚Äôd like to forget."," ptsd, i think. plus, smell is a really visceral memory trigger, more so than sight. looking at her photos doesn't bring you right back to those terrible moments the way that smelling the wipes does - especially because i'm sure that changing/cleaning/bathing were some of the most upsetting moments for both of you. those situations are triggers for some of the most difficult dementia behaviors. case in point: my dad fought us off and tried to run out of the house and into the street when we went to change him this afternoon. how his mind can interpret being clean as a mortal threat but sitting in his own shit as an ok state of affairs will never fail to boggle mine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n0rjcz/why_do_the_bad_memories_hit_so_much_harder_than/,Why do the bad memories hit so much harder than the good ones?
"hi everyone,not sure if this is the right place to ask this but here goes anyway! my grandmother has dementia (diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago) and yesterday she saw her lung specialist (as she also has lung issues). the doctor took my mom to one side and said that my grandmother has critical bone mass loss which is linked to the brain shrinkage. he also said ""its not long now"" but my mom was taken aback and didn't really ask him a lot more. just wanted to know if anyone had dealt with or has a bit more info on the topic? thanks and keep strong", i would leave a message with the office and ask if the doc can clarify their comment a little more.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n0ndsj/bone_mass_loss/,Bone mass loss
"now that lockdown is over in the uk, we visited my dad 2 weeks ago and he was shaking (no idea why). he said he was cold (but he had two jumpers on, a coat and a hat). my guess was more that he was shaking due to his illness but he wanted to find a reason for it that he could accept (he is in ""denial"" that he has dementia). he keeps saying 'there is nothing wrong with me'. last week we went to see him again and... no shaking. he was perfectly fine. i wonder if this is to do with any medication they give him and i wonder how consistent they are?my mum spoke to him on the phone today and he seemed completely normal. he can hold a conversation, use the mobile phone and tablet. also - he remembers *everything*. he remembers the clothes he has at home, who bought them for him, his textbooks he has at home... it just seems odd to me. we have asked the care home manager and she says 'that's how it is with patients, it comes and goes'. i haven't seen it 'go' apart from when he was here but i strongly feel it was the effect of him having an extremely slow and irregular heartbeat due to not having taken his cholesterol/blood pressure tablets for 4 months - *deliberately*, i might add. i know i'm not in the care home so i have to take the manager's word but i'm not sure.once a patient is in a care home can you ask for a reassessment? does the care home have to approve or can this be done independently? i want them to assess him again without the care home manager or carer in assistance just to be sure.just to be clear. i am not in denial. i was the first to accept his condition. i am just a tad suspicious right now."," you can have anyone independently assess.  we just had an independent assessment done from an outside company yesterday. my sister is struggling with the placement decision, and she seems a bit better (because in place with regular schedule) but not enough and not if you are there or talk to her after 3-4pm. additionally there is an outside neuro psych nurse that visits all patients every 2-4 weeks . he is associated with a hospital but works two days a month there .both confirmed she belongs there. best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n0nci1/have_any_of_you_had_your_relativepartner/,Have any of you had your relative/partner re-assessed after a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's?
"hi reddit,i have entered an art competition, where i have to pick one of two topics - fragments or interwoven. immediately upon hearing the topic  fragments i thought of dementia. namely in the area of memory loss. i feel it correlates with the idea of losing fragments of what you know and recognise. how loved ones‚Äô faces become unfamiliar fragment by fragment as an example.i don‚Äôt have enough background information on dementia to know whether i‚Äôm accurate or not which is why i‚Äôm asking you - people who have family members that struggle with it. is it an accurate comparison? does it feel like you‚Äôre losing touch with your loved one fragment by fragment? i‚Äôve found a few poems on dementia to use as a stimulus, and i have a general idea of what i would conceptualise and eventually draw. i would love to hear your experiences and ideas. thank you for reading this.", something i‚Äôve noticed in my loved one with dementia and i know others have experienced as well are the missing brain connections that end up creating bizarre speech. for example if what they meant to say was ‚Äúi got up to close the window‚Äù but the brain connection for window was no longer present they would say possible say ‚Äúi got up to close the bed‚Äù because that was the next available brain connection for them. missing fragments creating incoherent speech but to them they are unaware that its incoherent. it‚Äôs an incredibly cruel disease to slowly lose yourself. i also imagine darkness but with small fleeting moments of colorful memories.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n0k33z/dementia_in_art/,Dementia in art

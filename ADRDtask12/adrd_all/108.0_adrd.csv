"she is only in her 50s but she keeps forgetting words, referring to me with my brothers name. couple days ago she said something about blender as if she was talking about herself, can't correctly recall but it seems as if she uses random words at times. also sometimes it feels like talking to a rock when trying to explain her something and she just zones out. but otherwise she still looks 100% fine except in this odd moments. it creeps me out and i hope it's because of stress and iregular work schedule/sleep pattern.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g4zwrb/im_starting_to_worry_my_mother_might_be/,I'm starting to worry my mother might be developing dementia
"today i saw my father (56m ftd) up close for the second time since this insane covid battle started. we call each other daily and he has always been my favorite person in the world, my hero. today we went on a distancing walk with him and my mother. it was so hard not helping him find his way. so hard no grabbing his hand to guide him over tough patches on the path. what was even harder was at the end, when he came in for a hug. i had to tell him no and back away, all while tearing up. being apart everyday is a battle on it's own, but today showed me being near (even if it's more than 6ft apart) is even worse. i would give anything to hug him right now. what scares me even more is what if this is his last memory of us. he does not understand that we are both immunocompromised, to him i just denied him love. p.s. i am immuno deficient and just got out of the hospital and finished fighting a three month long battle with what should have been a minor cold right before this started.p.s.s. my sister that lives with them is not taking this serious and still sees her boyfriend and goes out which puts me and my father at a higher risk. so even though my father has been ""isolating"", because my sister that lives with him isn't, he is at high risk."," i’m so sorry you have to go through this. social distancing is making what is already a heartbreaking experience even more unbearable. please know that your actions in no way make you a bad person or a bad son. part of loving someone with a chronic disease, especially something like dementia, is making sure that you are healthy enough to continue providing them the love and support they desperately need. my deepest sympathies go out to you and your father and i hope this pandemic ends quickly so you both can have that hug.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g4mveo/the_last_hug/,The Last Hug
"hi,my mother is not my smartass mother that used to roast me forever, i wonder why, and i'm kinda sad and worry for her,  no family history of any form of dementia at the best of our knowledge, her father died as the age of 93 and he still was sharp, her mother died at the age of 76 of liver failure and she was recognized most of her visitors, but i dunno why my mother this last 2 weeks is not herself, maybe stress over the coronvirus? it seems like everyone in the house didn't notice beside me but i'm the closest to her in term of friendship, i have to slow down when i talk to her lately, i just had a 30 minutes of silent thinking not awhile ago and i'm panicking.."," my grandma’s first symptoms were full blown hallucinations that grew progressively worse. she also had no family history. it is fully possible that dementia can set in that quick, however, you must reach out to her physician to make the diagnosis. you are entirely right that current stress can bend a mind towards such symptoms. my own grandma experienced a rapid decline and i encourage you to talk to relevant medical professionals about this matter. that said, please don’t hesitate to message me with any updates. my deepest sympathies go out to you and your family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g4k0m8/my_sweet_mother_is_63yo_and_shes_not_as_sharp_is/,"My sweet mother is 63yo, and she's not as sharp is she used to be 2 years ago?"

"i'm not even gonna start on her arguing/physical aggravation. my mother is starving herself. she believes my dad and i are poisoning her so she'll only eat food from a fast food place. i believe its a childish excuse, anyways shes sickly skinny and i'm gaining weight from making high cal food that she picks at. i honestly wouldn't care if she only wanted to eat fast food but coronavirus, what she orders, and when she blames me after for letting her buy is a major problem.if i make food that's not fried or cooked ""restaurant style* she won't eat it, she'll excuse me of lying, stealing, or breaking something of hers (sometimes of mine that she claims because i'm 17) and then say i poisoned her,  gag herself, and then scream at me to order 25+ dollars off of postmastes, forget bout it, then when she gets the pay slip from her bank blames me for buying something and lies about the amount. example, i made club sandwiches today. i sat there for 2 mins and watched her take one bite, chipmunk it in her cheek and when i got up to get her water she gave half the sandwich to the dogs. i came back and asked where the other half of her food went? a normal question, she said she ate it...the dog had mustard on her mouth. she then got combative when i pointed it out, it escalated into her saying i took her iphone (my phone, she's never had an iphone) and that i broke mine 3 years ago. she wanted a pizza instead.  no biggie i said i have one in the freezer, and she said no because i'll put poison in it. she wants me to get one from domino's. and i refused. shes absolutely pissed off  right now yelling through the door.  saying i'm a liar and that im not gonna keep her phone 💀 i'm done."," you should give cbd a try, not just for her, but also for you.it was a good tool while my mil lived with us. yesterday my sister in law called asking how much i was giving her, they did not listen no me and 4 weeks into she living with them she is now calling asking for the same advice she dismissed earlier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g4gkid/my_mom_wont_eat/,My mom won't eat.
"a bit of a long one, greatly appreciate anyone with any insight regarding our situation as i’ve not been able to find much in past posts or other resources around the internet.my mother (71) has been formally diagnosed with alzheimers for about three (going on 4) years now - after years of significant cognitive decline and a battle to get her to go to the doctor. i believe she has had the disease for at least 15 years.she was most recently assessed in november 2019 as a stage 5 (out of 7). since this assessment her cognitive and physical abilities have dramatically declined. right before the pandemic hit we moved my parents from their current home to a smaller, single story residence that they had lived in previously. we made the decision to move for many reasons, one of the biggest being that my mother had begun to fall down the stairs somewhat frequently. of course, when the pandemic swept across the us her daily routines were further disrupted - which added to her disorientation the recent move caused.her mobility is now terrible, she’s a constant fall risk and we’re working to implement a walker. her speech ability has deteriorated significantly, while she previously couldn’t follow a conversation and had trouble here and there with a word she is now having trouble accessing most words and speaking. while we have not had consistent issues, there have been one or two incontinence moments with greater question on if there are bathroom issues she is hiding from us.most notably, and where my questions are based, is that she is now sleeping around 18 hours a day. she has always napped and slept more than average, but she now truly is almost always asleep. when she is awake she seems completely exhausted. we try to wake her up and get her engaged in something, but she just has no interest or energy.we’ve shared this with her medical care team and they do not feel that its related to any medicines she’s taking - which i would have to agree with, she doesn’t seem drugged or foggy. they’ve had bloodwork done and did not find anything noteworthy there either. she is just exhausted and completely without will to do anything at all.she’s commented that she feels dead. honestly this is something that i had anticipated toward the end of life, but it feels like we skipped some behaviors/stages and are jumping from stage 5 to 7has anyone else experienced anything like this with their lo? does this sound like she is entering the beginning of the end?tldr: mom (71) is sleeping 18hrs of the day, feels like we're jumping from stage 5 to stage 7 - has anyone else experienced something like this?"," have her checked for a uti, if you don't want to take her to the doctor because of a chance of exposure, you can get home tests. they can cause all sorts of problems, my mom frequently had them and it affected her negatively quite a bit. but yes, sometimes they can skip stages. it could just be disorientation is causing issues because of the move. it's really hard to tell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g3u2na/has_anyone_experienced_an_acceleration_of/,Has anyone experienced an acceleration of Alzheimer's that seemed to 'skip' a stage of decline?

"our resident used to chew gum while watching television, during downtime, etc. recently he started swallowing copious amounts of it and also falling asleep with it in his mouth. for health and safety reasons we’ve decided not to give him gum anymore, but now he’s really anxious and distraught over it. he’s constantly looking for things to put in his mouth- paper, bits of trash, anything he can find on the floor. i once walked away to switch laundry and he took some of my embroidery floss and startedchewing on that 🥴. feeling really frustrated as he can’t be left alone for even a few minutes without trying to put something in his mouth that he shouldn’t. i’ve been researching things that might help sooth his fixation but all i’ve found is those chewy fidgets for persons who self-stimulate. that sounds nice but i know that he’d try to swallow those things if they’re small enough and have no interest if he couldn’t fit the whole thing in his mouth. any ideas or solutions? ps: a few months ago i posted about him putting his hands down his pants constantly and you all suggested we get him jumpsuits to wear. happy to say that we did and it works tremendously! thanks for your help :-)"," how about chewy sweets? like fruit pastels, jelly tots, starburst, haribo etc? they aren’t the best alternative but they could satisfy him in that he could put the whole sweet in his mouth and swallow them without them doing as much damage as chewing gum would?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g3qec6/resident_with_frontal_lobe_dementia_has_an_oral/,resident with frontal lobe dementia has an oral fixation that he can no longer soothe with chewing gum

"i don’t know if this has already been posted or not but i couldn’t find anything similar so i thought i’d make my own post. my mom was officially diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2016. i was 16 at the time, 20 now. i’m having trouble remembering what she was like before. i remember all the things we did together, the family trips, when she brought me to school, literally everything. but the only thing i can’t seem to remember is what she was actually like, her character, the way she acted, mannerisms, etc. i’ve tried remembering so many times but it’s like i forgot.a few years ago when the symptoms started to get more noticeable, my dad decided that they would stay in my home country half the time which would be easier for him and her since all my family still lives there, since we can’t afford to put her in care. when they do stay here i care for her most of the time which isn’t always as easy. the way she is now is how it feels like she always was. whenever they arrive after their stay out the country i see a noticeable difference and that is the way i see her from that point on, it’s like all my memories of the way she was before are overridden. i have no idea how to properly explain this but i hope i got my point across. does anyone else have this? i find it so weird that my mind just seems to block out everything about her. i know i still have memories of her but they seem locked or something. any thoughts on this would be appreciated"," i’m so sorry you’re dealing with this too :( as so many others have said, you’re definitely not alone. my father has an autoimmune disease where a side affect of it is dementia; he got diagnosed when i was 19. we lived 2000 miles away from each other throughout my whole childhood until i was 23 and moved to be with him. i feel like i barely even got to know him before the dementia started setting in. when i was younger i didn’t have much interest in getting to know him - he and my mom had a *really* messy breakup not long after i was born, and she made him out to be a terrible person. of course by the time i realized my mom had ulterior motives and he actually wasn’t *that* bad, his dementia already had set in.it seems to be affected by the seasons - either he also has seasonal depression or it’s somehow related to his dementia. a couple of weeks ago i got to spend a night with him where he almost was like his old self again. it felt really nice and i got a little closure getting to see at least a hint of who he used to be. i know it’ll never be the same as being with him when he had his full capabilities; i can’t take that version of him as a real glimpse of who he was.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g2t9ez/cant_remember_what_my_mom_was_like/,Can’t remember what my mom was like

"hi and thank you in advance for reading my long text! my father was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (fda) a couple weeks ago. we (me &amp; my siblings) started to notice his weird behaviour almost three years ago, but for my mothers actions the diagnose was put off for many years.dad had always had a good memory and he was this ""jack of all trades"" since had done pretty much everything both at home and at work. however, three years ago he started to forget small, kinda meaningless things, such as where he used to sit in the dining table, what he was supposed to buy from the store, how to unlock his phone, how the accounting was made at work etc... seeing these things made us children really worried and we asked our mom countless times to take him to see the doctor. here comes the catch: my mother is the kind of person who thinks that bad things will go away by not paying attention to them. she also wants to give everyone else the impression that our family is flawless. so she never took him to the doctor.after almost 2 years of seeing our fathers worsening condition he lost his job. things got pretty ruff between our parents: mom couldn't handle that the man who had always been this smart, helpful and funny person became slow and in need of continuous supervising. she started nagging and being very mean to him like he was doing everything intentionally. by the peer pressure of our family, after almost 3 years of the first signs, mom finally took him to see the doctor. while they tested him for months, she was telling around how there wouldn't be anything wrong with him and the doctors appointments were just going to be a waste of money. as we anticipated, there in fact was something wrong with him. after the doctors appointments my mom failed to tell anyone that he had gotten a dementia diagnose. my sister found out by seeing the doctors papers in our parents house and my mom just laughed it off by saying something like ""oh yeah he has this umm.. something frontal or so dementia."" she doesn't talk about his illness unless we ask her something, so it seems like she's just trying to ignore the fact that it exists. when i asked her about dad's diagnose she said that she hadn't read about it and asked me to ""google it yourself."" my brother is a doctor and he has tried to push my mother to seek peer support groups in our area, but she laughs it off by saying they're useless. today the illness is in this state that mom needs to supervise dad 24/7. i can clearly see the toll it takes on her but she doesn't accept any help and still keeps ignoring his illness by for example planning stressfull vacations and chores for him. i feel sorry for dad since all he hears everyday is nagging and yelling about how he is ""fooling around"" and forgetting things or doing things incorrectly. she tries to teach him the correct way of doing things but doesn't seem to understand that he won't remember. i would love to talk about the illness openly among our family, but it feels like it's some kind of taboo. we are all still young (parents in their 50's, i'm 20 and my siblings 26 &amp; 25) and i don't know how i can help while still keeping my mental health in order: this feels really overwhelming especially when everyone is just ignoring the fact that dad's not going to be around for much longer. i'm not completely sure what i'm trying to achieve with this post, maybe some peer support or ideas on how to help my mother to accept dad's worsening condition or something...? anyways thank you for reading this, it feels actually so good to open up about this to someone. also english is not my first language, so sorry for all the misspelling. tldr; dad diagnosed with fda and mother doesn't know how to handle it. need support or advice."," i can't tell you how sorry i am to hear this.you're doing the right things.  no, this won't go away by itself.  no, it (sadly) won't get better.  yes, your mother is probably making it harder on herself, and definitely making it harder for him, by pretending the ftd diagnosis doesn't mean anything.  but it may be a challenge to change her mind.i don't have any great advice at the moment.  i'll think on this a little.  but the others seem to.but i just had to share my sympathies, for now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g0i6py/dad_50_diagnosed_with_fda_and_mom_doesnt_accept/,Dad (50) diagnosed with FDA and mom doesn't accept his condition
"made a post a few weeks ago about my father who suffered a pretty large hemorrhagic bilateral stroke. it was also revealed he has several micro strokes that we didnt know about along time which affected the vasculature of his brain.i realized since hes been home for nearly 40 days now, and 110 days post stroke that his progress has basically stunted, he is very forgetful for short term, cognition is poor. i started reading and just from a read it sounds very likely he has vascular dementia. i talked to his in-home pt who said that sounds about right, and so did our family's interventional radiologist. when i spoke to a family friend neurologist they said he will get better- which doesnt sound right/and doesnt sound true. being that is family/friend i believe the neurologist may have been bluffing to keep morale up.&amp;#x200b;i need to know the full truth and understand the situation. it sounds well and aware that vascular dementia greatly shortens life span and if so is true, i would like to investigate further on what to expect. **which doctor did you go to for this diagnosis? and what kind of specifics did they ask for?**", neurologist. they send him through a cat scan and then do a few cognitive tests in office.  you’ll have a solid answer by end of week.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g07777/vascular_dementia_or_any_type_of_dementia_and/,Vascular dementia (or any type of dementia) and getting the right diagnosis from WHO?
i'm new to this subreddit and have only been in contact with people with degenerative mental health as a guest and have a question.is it common for people going through dementia or alzheimer's to spend a few hours knocking on all of the walls and windows? i have a neighbor that is doing that almost everyday. it sounds specifically like a knuckle knock to open a door and not the bonk of a head against anything or i'd be more concerned about self harm. it's a new behavior from someone we have lived next to for almost 4 years and i like her. my wife and i try to stay more quiet than we would if we lived in a house because we know it can disturb her and are looking for ways to be better neighbors.edit:formatting for mobile," some patients develop repetitive behaviour. some are scratching surfaces, others keep waking despite being exhausted. other like to fold. it's probably a sign of their dementia progressing, but i don't have any advice on what to do for a neighbour.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/g01xj3/knocking_neighbor/,Knocking neighbor

"my family is coping with the big elephant in the room - people don't generally die of dementia. my nan (in her 80s) has late stage dementia but is otherwise not unwell. she's currently at the point where she doesn't know the names of things and doesn't recognise people, she lives in a care home but doesn't realise where she is. a few weeks ago i went into her room to bring her some supplies and found half-chewed bars of soap, used incontinence pads and other people's belongings in her cupboards. she's not had a shower or bath for weeks (i wash her hair once a week which takes about half an hour but she straight up refuses to bathe, last time she showered it took myself and carers 2 hours to coax her in and let us wash her). but she's a tough cookie. she's never been the healthiest of people - spent her days watching tv, drinking pop and secretly smoking (although everyone knew!). moving into the care home has actually done her well - she paces around the hallways all day long and is much more active, she eats well and has forgotten about the smoking. what happens next? the care home has just informed us that 3 of the residents have corona virus and they're doing the best they can to isolate everyone. if hate the thought of nan being in pain and i haven't even begun to think about how much distress it would cause her to go to hospital or have medical procedures. if she doesn't get it, will she just continue to become less healthy until she's ill? what happens at the end?"," hello, i'm sorry to hear that you're going through a very confusing and scary time at the minute, compounded by the fact that many family members aren't able to visit loved ones in residential settings currently. it can make the whole situation even more worrisome.i'm not a medical professional but i do work with a lot of people with dementia, and from my experience it doesn't sound like your loved one is yet in the very final stages of dementia - she still has her mobility, is still eating etc. but it does sound like there has been a deterioration in her cognition. this could be as a result of the dementia or something else entirely - many things can increase confusion in the elderly. i'd query if a medical practitioner has assessed your loved one as they could have a uti, be constipated etc. which can contribute to changes in cognition.if this has already taken place or it is deemed due to a deterioration in the dementia it is now generally about understanding what is happening and why, and what can be done to minimise risks.a good way of looking at the situation is to break it down into specific concerning behaviours and attempting to understand these individually.for example, as they are eating bars of soap, a few questions come to mind. does the person have access to food all of the time? it may be that they are hungry and don't recognise that the soap is not food. does the soap have a scent that is associated with food? for example a fruity fragrance.has the person had a recent eye test, a lot of issues can attributed to the person having difficulty in actually seeing the object, so it may be being mistaken for an item of food.there is going to be a lot of trial and error, as everybody is different - which is especially true with dementia as people's prior experiences often contribute to the specific issues that they are having.i'd recommend working with the care home to understand what is happening and what can be tried to mitigate this whilst maintaining dignity and freedom. don't be afraid to ask for support from the local social services authority either. if you haven't already, speak to your loved one to ask why they are doing what they are doing, though this will need to be done with tact as we don't want them to feel like they are doing anything ""wrong"", but it could help shed light on the situation. i also include a link to the alzheimers society to help you with your actual question (never put a link on reddit before so i hope it works). i don't know what country you're from so some of the information related to the support available may not be the same as the uk, but the deterioration of dementia is generally universal across borders.i hope that everything goes well for yourself and your loved one, and that the home is successful in their attempts to isolate the virus.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fz14lp/the_final_stages/,The final stages

(there is always that added stress of elderly needing a bathroom and it being an emergency, but not today. not on my watch!)i intervened from work telling him to lock the garage door (they have an opener but no key) and get the kids so they don't open the door, but allow them to speak on the phone through the front window.my husband was 110% annoyed and i was torn between setting the tone of not rewarding their bad behavior and kindness since she will not retain any lesson intended by not allowing a visual window visit.i prepared my kids and husband with an easy excuse of having to get back to a video conference call for school to prevent them from staying too long and the inevitable emergency bathroom need.in the end, they dropped off the package, said happy easter at the window and left. this was after a half hour of sitting at the school parking lot trying to prepare the cards for my youngest's birthday and easter for both of my girls. so, what was in the package after all of the hoopla?4 cards, 4 envelopes, none signed, no cards inside their envelopes, no gift for the youngest's birthday, and some easter candy.my husband sent me these pictures to vent his disbelief: much ado about nothing so, yes they came, and yes they left. it was uneventful.however...after they left, the locator showed them going in the wrong direction! they were headed to the other side of town and they have now been at an 89 year old aunt's house for over an hour.i can't help but wonder if she let them in to be polite, or if she was just as oblivious as they are. i wonder if she was afraid when they said they were coming to visit but didn't have the assertiveness to tell them to stay away. i wonder if my mother told her version of the truth and said she had been staying home, when in reality, they have not spent more than 2 days in a row at home since this started. they have been to multiple grocery stores every couple of days, yet still ordering takeout frequently - when they never used to spend much eating out at all. they have even visited 2 separate walmarts in 2 separate counties on the same day. my mother cannot sit the f#$k down and stay at home. she is anxious and agitated naturally, with nervous energy coursing through her body. the fact that they are supposed to stay at home is festering in her and driving her out in public more than she would have if there were no orders.but, they are adults. unfortunately, he won't stand his ground and do what is needed to protect themselves and others. she has always worn the pants in the family and now it is the inmate running the asylum.", wow. i don’t think i could have done that. i’d have given in.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fy07rc/mom_and_the_easter_candy_an_update/,Mom and the Easter candy - an update

"my dad has recently been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, he has days where he is completely reasonable, and days where he is loonier than the whole loony bin. but in the last week twice now he has been very angry over small stuff, the other day he came in my room and asked when i was taking my brother to go get something we had planned to do, i told him 2, it was only 11:30 and i knew i would take forever to get the motivation to get going. but he went off the deep end and started acting like a 15 yo brat with an attitude. i tried to keep calm and not make things worse but he was treating me like crap and we ended up fighting and he ended up getting about 6 inches from my face with his hand raised ready to slap me, he didn't and finally walked away but it left me hurt and in tears. and now today my mom told him she was gonna sell some of our eggs (we raise chickens) and she was gonna sell them for $2 which we've done for years, and he got upset and told her that was unacceptable she tried reasoning with him and he finally just went and did something else. and when we got home we thought everything was ok, it was a small disagreement but nothing big right?, nope he all the sudden got really angry and told me we weren't gonna eat supper because i had set the table (i didn't realize he wanted me too, for once it wasn't just me being a normal lazy teen and ignoring his request, he didn't ask me at all). he then got even more mad and acting like a absolutely snot, and i held my emotions until he started attacking my mom and i lost it, it hurt seeing him tear me and her to pieces and he honestly didn't care, this wasn't a he had a bad day and got mad this was he truly didn't realize he was hurting us so much. and i left and went to set the table thinking that would make him happy, and he walked back in the room laughing and talking about facebook. while my mom and i stood there with tears streaming down our faces. he truly didn't care, no empathy it was gone. that loving kind man that raised me was gone, he was now this giggly asshole. i didn't know what to do, he was very disrespectful and hurtful and he didn't apologise even when i outright told him what he was saying was hurtful he laughed. im hurt im worried about my mom and im wondering how we are ever gonna survive this. i have my own mental issues, i have adhd and so does my mom, and i have rejection dysphoria its seen in most people with adhd and it basically makes me more sensitive to rejection and such than i guess other people idk but either way i struggle a lot and im not sure what to do", take a deep breathe,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fxjc6x/how_am_i_f16_supposed_to_handle_my_dad_54_with_ftd/,How am I (f16) supposed to handle my dad (54) with FTD?

"reading the posts here, my issues seem kind of minimal - so initially, an apology if this seems trite.my mum is 76 and in a home. she has what we think is some form of ms (although it has never been entirely clear) so physically she is pretty bad - can't walk, limited mobility all round, etc. she spent my whole life living independently (my father died when i was very young and she never re-married) - then had a fall, 3 months recovering in hospital, moved up to a flat nearby, another fall and deteriorated so we moved her into a nursing home nearby. after a couple of years she got bored there - so i then moved her from this (very small) home just up the road from us into another one which is further away but very much bigger and more professionally run, knowing that they do more activities - and hoping that she would see this as an opportunity to get out of her room, do more, get more involved and so on. they have a lake, a bar (!), a library, lots of activities, etc. she is a very bright, very intelligent, very artistic woman. also - incredibly feisty, and i'm an only child (son), and - it's taken me years to be able to come out and say this - really very controlling, too. since arriving at the new place, she has now (with a terrible irony attached to it...) decided to stay in bed - as far as i can tell this is pretty much all the time - it's a bit of a muddled picture as her memory is terrible, but i think this is what's happening. my issue is this: pretty much every time we speak (and i ring her every night at the moment what with cv and so on) she asks when she is going to be coming back to our town, to live in the small flat she owns around the corner from us. i have had this conversation with her easily a hundred times, probably many more. it is at least 80% of the conversations i have with her. she is far too physically disabled to be able to do this on her own; i have investigated her having a 24hr carer but it's too expensive (and not really practical - it takes 3 to 4 people to get her off the floor when she falls over); the flat has 10 steps leading up to it which she can't get up; there's literally nothing about being in the flat which would be better for her (apart from in her imagination!); she couldn't feed herself or get out of bed or anything on her own. i'm on the cusp of renting out the place in order to help pay for her care (she gave me her agreement on this a year or more ago, and i have poa in order to help facilitate this) but still she continues to ask me every time we speak when she can move back in. what's weird is that although i try to stay calm and non affected by this, sometimes our conversation gets quite heated - and then suddenly she'll go quiet on the phone and just start watching the tv - and then be totally ""oh well, let's not talk about this any more""...what i can't work out is if this is her suffering from some kind of early dementia, or just being my feisty mum wanting a bit of a fight with me, or if it's a power thing, or a control thing, or just the moment at which she realises her life has changed irrevocably, or what.and: to my real question - do you have any advice as to my best strategy for dealing with this? i am getting better and better at letting this just pass over me but it's still a real waste of our time and i wish she could relax into her life in the home, embrace the things that are going on and get involved in it rather than wishing for something impossible that can never happen. how should i cope with this - just gloss over it when she asks? tell her the flat is rented out and there is no way of her returning (this is almost true anyway!)? tell her ok, no problem, knowing that she'll never have the wherewithal to do anything about it? ignore her? engage with the debate? your advice would be very much appreciated - and i hope this is on-topic enough for this sub."," i used to tell my dad that once he could perform all of his ""acts of daily living"" without assistance and walk up and down five steps confidently we could talk about him going home. of course, i knew it was impossible but it gave him the incentive to work with his physical therapist.  i use the same tactic with my mil- she hates exercise so it just shuts her up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fv0n65/effective_strategies/,Effective strategies
"my mum is 74 and she has dementia, however since the new year it has progressed significantly, this week however it's taken a turn i am quite sure many people here have seen many times over.she's started running to people and saying me and her husband \[i'm her youngest son and primary carer\] are out to get her and she needs help, she then refuses to co-operate with us in any way.on **wednesday** we were shopping and things were fine, she really is a joy to be with most of the time, i have come to terms with what is happening and will happen going on. however when we came to the tills **she just grabbed the person on the till shouting she needs help because i'm out to get her**. fortunately the staff were incredibly understanding and really, really good about it, however she still had to be brought home by the police.now my mum in 5 foot 1 and i am a former rugby prop at 6 foot 4 inches tall and well built with a big beard, and my dad is 74 but 6 foot tall, there's no way i can engage in situations because of my size without coming over as an abusive bully.on **thursday** she went out early for a walk with my dad at 8am, due to the lockdown they stick to very quiet areas and walk around the block, down the next street and back, my dad went into the shop to get a bottle of drink and asked my mum to stay outside and **she shot off into the road and ran to a police officer at the other side of the road.**the police brought her home, and the usual questions, i'm not just saying it but we are both really good with ma, we don't yell, we absolutely do not blame, we both know she can't help what she does when those wires get crossed.however **today she ran from the house, she bolted in a split second, we were having a laugh with her walking up and down the garden playing with next doors dogs, then she said she was going to toilet and bam i heard the door slam but she ran onto the main road**, i bolted after her, and she can bloody shift for a pensioner, i managed to catch up to her but she stopped a passerby on a bike and grabbed him. luckily for us one of our neighbours who is a nurse at a care home saw me run past and came out to help us get her back into our house.what was different is she had her slippers on... ***but*** she had her actual shoes in her handbag. that shows some premeditation in my eyes. we all really love her and are doing all we can.we never, ever leave mum alone, one of us is with her in the house at all times, unless she is out with her other sons or at her friends houses.we have put screws next to ther patio door lock we installed and we've decided to just not use the front door at all, we're going to get the locks changed when we can so this is a temporary measure.what else can we do for security and our peace of mind?, we don't want to make mum a prisoner, but we can't have this hanging over our heads, the police twice and social servies involved."," get her accustomed to a bracelet with her name and adress on it. that will tip people off that she's not well, and help her get home.read up on sundowning and see if this fits her behaviour. if she doesn't recognise you, approach her like a stranger. call her ma'am etc. allow her time to recognise and find her memory of you.gps tag her?involve the police in advance, let them know about your situation, so they can help. they'll know what's up when they pick her up, and may not have to ask all the questions again.not overpowering her is the best way to go, but safety can't be ignored. you seem to know your priorities, so trust your gut here.venting helps. keep on :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fuzqob/tips_for_safety_in_the_home_with_mother_with/,Tips for safety in the home with mother with dementia.

( with the exception of my mom going to work) nevertheless, my grandma is just....wow. she lives out of state and has been staying with us after a health scare. but now it’s been months because of coronavirus. she has dementia but refuses to acknowledge that she does. she keeps saying she wants to go home.....no not her current home, her childhood home. she gets ready in the morning to go to the grocery store, every single morning. when we tell her she can’t go out, she starts screaming at all of us. she’s on the phone alllllllll day with different relatives or customer service reps because she says “she can’t trust us and needs to talk to people who understands her.” and the biggest thing is she treats me okay, but treats my mom and sister like absolute shit and i have no clue why. she called my sister a bitch the other day and said she wishes she wasn’t born. my sister has depression so she can’t really disassociate my grandma’s words from her dementia. that’s left me with a lot of pressure. sometimes she won’t talk to anyone but me in the house and she’s always asking me to do things for her when my mom is already taking care of her??? the biggest thing too is refuses to let my mom become poa to help her move back to our state. so just a run down: - she calls our house in february in a panic saying she needed my mom to come pick her up bring her to our house. she lives 4 hours away- two months later she has no recollection of this and thinks we’re just keeping her here- she acts like she can do everything herself yet will fall on the ground or have accidents just to prove she can do things herself. we all didn’t have a great relationship with her to begin with and she pushed everyone away years ago to move to a senior housing place. she doesn’t remember anything she did before like how she once said i was a failure and my anxiety was fake and how she told my mom if she ever contacted her, she’d call the police. now out of the blue, here she is! i have no clue how to help honestly. she’s adamant that she wants no one to be poa even though she needs one and every day is a new argument about something crazy. how can we help her if she refuses help? tl;dr: grandma is staying with us, refuses to acknowledge her dementia, refuses help with anything. how can we help her even though she doesn’t want help and doesn’t trust us?"," for the doctor appointment, don’t tell the real reason you’re going.  tell her it’s for her annual physical, or her blood pressure medicine needs renewed, or whatever you can make up.  however, definitely tell the doctor ahead of time, what is going on with her.  be sure to mention the part about wanting to go home to her childhood home, that’s a classic sign.  that way he can assess her without drawing attention to it.  where she goes next will depend on what the doctor finds.  best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fuw7uh/covid19_has_got_four_women_in_different/,COVID-19 has got four women in different generation cooped up in one home.

"i work at a childcare centre as a pedagogical assistant. since the corona outbreak in the netherlands, we function as an emergency shelter. this means that we take care of children of which at least one of the parents is working in vital sectors. you can imagine that in this day and age we take care of fewer children than we normally do and therefore we are present at work with too many people, or that there are colleagues at home because of this. we, as a nursery, are part of a foundation.this foundation has several nursing homes, and we offer home care and palliative care. we encourage independent living in several of our homes as much as possible. independent, sheltered and safe living means that residents can live independently with customised care until an advanced age. in this way, we ensure that our residents have contact with other residents and that all facilities are close by and that they can participate in various activities. the problems started when our government decided to lock down all nursing homes. no more visits from loved ones and family. no more contact with the outside world, to protect our elderly from the virus as much as possible. corona has been detected in a number of wards, these wards have been completely locked down. our best care personnel have been put on these wards, causing shortages on the other wards. our volunteers have been sent home, because we try to prevent the infection from outside as much as possible. this of course causes our elderly to become lonely. i have decided to no longer work at the nursery, but in one department within our houses. wem in de childcare centre, have too many staff, the rest of our company has too few.nu, het volgende probleem, ik heb geen zorg achtergrond met oudere mensen. en al helemaal niet met dementerende mensen. ik denk dat ze al heel blij zijn, dat er iemand bij hen op bezoek komt, sinds dat zij al bijna twee weken in hun appartement opgesloten zitten en er geen gezamelijke activiteiten meer plaats vinden. maar alsnog wil ik graag van de profesionals op reddit weten:now, the next problem, i don't have a care background with older people. and certainly not with demented people. i think they are very happy that someone is coming to visit them since they have been locked in their apartment for almost two weeks and there are no more joint activities. but still i would like to know from the professionals at reddit:what kind of activities can i do with older people?how do i keep 'a safe' distance?what can i do to make their day a little better?please, enlighten me!"," play music from their life - it’s been known that some unable to speak can sing songs from their 20’s or 30’s without missing a single word.  help others dance to that same music.  anything that helps them relive that earlier time of their life (since that’s a common place for their mind to dwell).the women still like beauty treatments: nail polish, rub lotion on their hands and arms, brush their hair.  for some, this is very calming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fu8654/help_needed_coronacrisis_and_activities/,Help needed coronacrisis and activities!

eat anything but these expensive yogurt parfaits from the grocery and icecream most days. so she goes to bed hungry and no amount of medication helps when you're hungry. which means she wakes up and roams the house. but she literally refuses all the food i offer. and frankly i'm done trying to cook special for her because every time i do she rejects it anyways. she forgets who we are to her frequently. calls my dad her dead husband's name or just simply forgets his name (her son). she gets so anxious when my dad leaves for the day that i dont know how she could possibly live in a care home without being put back on the heavy medication we've worked hard to get her off because she was like a zombie on it. the list of things is a mile long. but basically its really fucking hard to be around this 24/7 now that we're all on social distancing time.my dad is resistant to my moving out because that would mean either he moves in or we put her in a home. with this covid stuff we're all anti homes right now. but i'm losing my mind.  i didn't agree to care for her when i first moved in here 3 years ago. it just became what was expected as we realized grandma was losing her mind. i dont know if i'm looking for advice or just needed to vent.tl;dr// she was in a paranoid mania and told me to shut up and slapped me as i tried to explain why i wouldn't take her to the er. she doesn't know who we are to her a lot of the time anymore. wont eat proper meals. is a model of bad behavior for my 3 year old. i'm going insane having no break from this because of social distancing and i want out but my dad is all ""well it's not in your head"" no i just have to carry the weight of it. and also he doesn't want to have to move in here and take on the job full time."," oh love. what a difficult position to be in & no wonder, with all of the pandemic panic adding to the stress, that your night took a detour. the way i see it, you need more help. now, if this wasn't officially the weirdest time imaginable, my advice would potentially look different, but that's the gist. you need more help. now. family meeting time. yes, it is dad's mom, but the reality of your grandmother's situation is that, sadly, it is going to decline, so if he can't handle it now, the 2 options are to (a)get more help in-home (family and/or professionals  and/or (b) find an alternative, appropriate out of this home arrangement for her (at this stage, a memory care unit would be a likely route). i get why option (b) is a hard sell at present, financially and in terms of the news, but as another commenter already said, not all care homes are created equal, & some are taking this very seriously (my mom's place among thrm). day programs are also cancelled currently & with social distancing & potential lockdowns (not sure where you live?), your likely bet is option (a) at the moment. we're in crisis times, everyone is under extra stress & when you add dementia to the mix, it can be almost too much at times. so, as you know, your grandmother cannot reason through why you're getting frustrated. she can't be expected to understand that obviously, violence is not ok. have a virtual family meeting with her loved ones & explain that somethjng needs to shift because eith a 3 yr old underfoot, the potential for problems are rife. you would be better able to teach him not to play aggressively around your grandmother than you will be able to reason with her. routine is really important, usually when they complain, theres an underlying reason that they may not be able to articulate - hunger, need to use the restroom, fear, pain loneliness etc. i think 100% you don't just go to the er, but distraction, an arm put around her, seeing if she needs the loo, all of those were great instincts.   in terms of the food - calories count, but if she's rejecting most of what you cook, let's strategize. the earlier suggestion to get dad to encourage her through a heavier breakfast & lunch is smart. she's lost the ability to properly perceive hunger or how to navigate the routine of eating alone but support can make a world of difference. also, many people with dementia have a bitter taste in their mouths that is only relieved by something sweet. play to that. with my mom, fruit is not a draw, but if i put even a touch of whipped cream on it, gone. milkshakes/smoothies- fruit, not expensive yogurt, milk,  protein powder (sweet & higher calories). nutritional supplements- pudding or drinks. if the cbd oil is helping, great but if you or dad haven't called her pcp or geriatrician, please do. there may be some other meds that can help, especially given the limitations we're under because of the pandemic. for yourself, if this isnt something you can handle until....knowing the situation is going to get harder & you do have a small child to consider, be honest. dad (if he is her power of attorney) needs to be aware that this is a temporary option, & one way or another, more help is needed immediately. please, talk to the alzheimer's society & grandma's doctors. ask if (depending on where you all live) you can talk with a social worker, a nutritionist, a behavioural observation team member, ot & pt as these professionals may have some great tips & tricks that will make navigating the present a bit easier. then, start talking about professional intervention - either hiring a psw or the equivalent to assist in home, if family can't  or won't step up or in addition to more family support.(again, this may of may not be wise currently, depending on availability, your grandmother's health status, ,& whether the helper is already working via community contact in another setting) or options for long term care. the latter is not  an easy choice or transition  but, as other redditors have rightly  stated, your loved one can thrive in the right kind of home for them. my heart is with you, i'm sending you huge virtual hugs, & please let me thank you for what i know can be a very thankless job. we're here for you if you need to chat.

"here's a list of some weird things she does. the main point is, she lacks normal self awareness, is confused all the time, and cannot communicate properly. when you tell her something, it is like it gets filtered by her, and then her answer is based on what she thought you were saying. so communication is nearly impossible. she's also very paranoid and thinks everyone is doing things to annoy her. when they're actually just doing their own thing. she thinks everything has to do with her. she's obviously a narcissist as well. here's a list of her weird quirks.edit: a great example of her: we argued once in my room. i asked her to leave. instead, she steps forward towards me. i say again. please leave. she steps forward again. when i try to walk out she blocks me. she's trying to get me to do something so she can call the police. she has assaulted me in the past too. grabbed my arm and grabbed my chin and yelled ""fuck you"". i reported this to the police and they said it isn't considered assault. i'm sure if i was a husband and did that to my wife, i'd have been arrested. looks back at me when i crack my knuckles to show her annoyance. is like dr. jekyll and mr. hyde. super nice and loving when happy. but turns into a literal psychopath when angry. i have videos of this. it's clear from the video, that she enjoys when people suffer, if she's mad at them at the time. you can't being up anything to her if it's about her or her actions. immediately starts excusing her behavior and usually gets angry and starts an argument. i could say something as simply as ""can you please lock the door after going outside?"". that turns into ""i have done everything for you and this is how you treat me"". ""i'm sorry i'm such a horrible mother"".repeats things multiple times. says ""i like this movie"" 3x within 2 minutes.randomly announces what she bought me, despite my already seeing it. or announces that she did some cleaning and you're supposed to thank her.stares at me from across the room. when i meet her gaze, she will break the awkwardness by asking you a question that shows she cares. like ""how's your back"".wears improper clothes for cold weather yet complains about the cold.at night wears thin dress yet she always complains about cold.can't find things that are right in front of her. thinks it's funny and cute.can't remember things well. forgets entire events. answers questions in a way that indicates she is assuming what you meant rather than actually what you mean. she always presumes the motive or intent, rather than just listen. and the motive or intent is always against her. she looks for insults and if she implicates that you might be insulting her, she goes off.repeats a few dozen quotes throughout the day. unaware of her surroundings. does a fake 'startle' when she's ""surprised"" and thinks it's funny.drives poorly. will look left or right and drift into another lane. or at least drifts around her lane.loses things frequently. rarely knows where her keys are especially. thinks it's hilarious. makes snide remarks to others while driving.leaves lights on, and when asked about it, says it wasn't her. she forgets that she ever turned the lights on. has left the stove on 3 times. takes a long time to finish a sentence. stutters and stops at every word or two, as if she already forgot what she was going to say. always trys to ""help"", even when it's not wanted. if you decline her ""help"", she either says in a manic voice ""i'm a helper!"" and laughs like it's funny. or, she gets upset and slaps her thighs in exasperation, or says passive aggressively ""ok, whatever"".thinks (knows) that people do passive aggressive things to her. like if someone stops at the road, and puts on their seatbelt, she says they're ""putting on a big ""display"""" for her. when they're actually just going about their day, not thinking of her at all. drove into oncoming traffic at an intersection, and denied that she did anything wrong. the lane in the middle was yellow. stops at intersections when she doesn't have a stop sign. grabbed my thigh tightly when she couldn't stop the car. i reacted like anyone who gets their thigh grabbed, and said woah what are you doing? she got frustrated and yelled ""i was trying to stop!"". as if grabbing my thigh and stopping the car are synonymous. update: she asked me about it later. she asked how i am and i said better. she complained about my reaction to grabbing my thigh. i said i was just startled. then she went on about how i didn't say thank you for paying for tommy, even though he's ""not her dog"". now she's having a pity party. saying she might as well just leave. and she said ""and you come home and make sure to go right on to your phone"".any inquiry or question is always met with a sigh or slap of the thigh in exasperation. as if your very question and existence make her unable to live. melodramatic is an understatement.doesn't want to waste electricity with a florescent bulb, in a commercial refrigerator that has 4 items in it, and those could be stored elsewhere. the cooler uses probably 30x more electricity than the bulb. (illogical thinking)""i'm glad you're happy, because i can't be right now"". indirectly admitting to believing that external circumstances can and do affect your mood and attitude. e.g., things are going well so i'm happy. things are going bad and so i'm not happy.does things based on flawed logic and distorted thinking. we need to leave the back door unlocked because what if we lock ourselves out. wait, so you would rather leave a door unlocked, than remember to have keys on you either all the time or when you leave? most people don't worry about locking themselves out because forgetting things (keys, locked door) is not normal. rarely locks doors at home. leaves her car door unlocked at home almost every time.everything she does is ok. if you do it it's wrong. literally anything you can think of, this is true. she sounds like an elephant walking upstairs. but if i drop something, she runs upstairs and tells ""what was that!?"". god forbid i ask her to be quiet. she would start a tirade on me about all my flaws. it's like she can't take a drop of criticism. i'd appreciate any help."," this sounds a lot like my mother, who i’ve always suspected of being on the autism spectrum but has never been diagnosed. she’s also always had terrible social anxiety and never had any friends/basically lived as a hermit. she had a mental breakdown when i was 10 and was put on antidepressants (effexor), which she has not changed up in over 20 yrs. she refuses to seek help from a mental health professional. she gets her meds from her general physician whom she used to work with. her personal hygiene is terrible, has been since her breakdown in her early 40s, as well as her ability to maintain a clean, healthy home. she’s 66 now and seems to be getting a touch of dementia. it’s hard to tell because she’s never been “right”. talking to her is like talking to a child. she’s cut herself off from the world so much and caused my own social and emotional development to suffer growing up. i basically went no contact with her because i was tired of having a dead mother who is still alive. she angers me and causes me tremendous sadness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fqo71a/please_help_my_mom_has_very_obvious/,"Please help.

"my mum (now in her 50s) was diagnosed with vascular dementia after a series of mini strokes around 10 years ago. she has never been on an aeroplane in her life due to fear of flying. however, i have convinced her that if she is able to she should give it a go (i flew for my first time just a few weeks ago). she’s worried that due to her health conditions she will be unable to fly, her reasoning being that she can’t go on rollercoasters now due to the pressure in her head. i’ve asked her to go to her gp and see what advice he has. i’m just wondering if anyone here has any experience with vascular dementia and flying? p.s we do have other ways around travelling, eg. we drive and only go to france, northern spain, germany, belgium etc."," my grandma also has vascular dementia and a slew of other health issues wanted to visit her home in mexico, but it’s about a 20+ hour drive and she can’t handle being in the car for that long so we consulted w her doctor to see if she would be able to fly and he said as long as she continued to take all of her medication like she was supposed to and everything was under control that she could. so we picked a flight time that wouldn’t interrupt her wake up/sleep time that would allow us to get her fed, changed and ready without rushing. this is a tip that a gate attendant told me after she upgraded my grandma and i for free, but if you can’t get front row seats, check with the gate attendant about possibly upgrading your mom and the person sitting with her, obv if it’s a full flight that might not be possible. they upgraded my grandma and myself to first class on our outgoing and return trip which really helped me out when she needed to go to the restroom. so again, as long as you make sure any other health issues your mom might have are under control and you give yourself enough to plan things, you should be fine! fingers crossed!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fpaf5f/can_my_mum_go_on_an_aeroplane/,Can my mum go on an aeroplane?

"so maybe over the last year or two my dad has been forgetting things he normally wouldn't forget. maybe small things/events that have happened recently, or sometimes words. they aren't a huge deal, but it is something my mom and sisters have all noticed. are these signs of early dementia? or are they just normal with aging?if he is potentially in the early stages of dementia, how quickly does it progress? he is 55, so pretty young, and i just want to what to expect.also, how would we even bring this up to him? none of us really have because we don't know how or if we even need to."," bredesen protocol! see what is or has aggravated memory loss, and go from there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fp43ne/is_my_father_in_the_early_stages_of_dementia/,Is my father in the early stages of dementia?
"hi everybody,i wanted to share my grandfather’s story in regards to dealing with dementia because i’ve found over the last 2 months that after all of my research and all of the online communities i’ve turned to, a lot of the information i received didn’t apply to us. it became more and more evident to me that people really are unique in how the same disease can affect countless people in different ways. my grandpa had been struggling with short-term memory loss for about 3-4 years. very standard stuff: couldn’t remember where he kept his keys and wallet even though they’ve been in the same spot for 40 years. a few times he took his truck to the shop, but a few hours later panicked because he thought his truck got stolen from his driveway.there were no other dementia signs, just the short term memory loss. early last month my grandma got up in the morning and asked my grandpa if he was ready to go to the grocery store. my grandpa said “i didn’t realize it was saturday and forgot we grocery shop on saturdays. go ahead without me.”my grandma returned home with the groceries to find out my grandfather had a stroke while she was grocery shopping. fast-forward 7 weeks and he has a few days left to live. the stroke caused the dementia to escalate from early stages to late stages. in the last 7 weeks weve seen him hallucinate, cry out for help for hours at a time, forget the names and faces of everybody around him, become delusional, lose the ability to walk without constantly falling, lose the ability to feed himself, lose the ability to sleep, and last week he stopped talking, stopped understanding us, and now he cannot eat or drink anything. two weeks ago he was able to sing and laugh and crack jokes. seven weeks ago he was able to drive himself to the grocery store and shop, go to the bank by himself, he was knowledgeable about world affairs and politics, able to have intelligent conversations, he was completely “normal” except for maybe asking the same question 4 or 5 times (he used to ask me 4 or 5 times in a day if it had snowed recently where i live). since he hasn’t eaten or had anything to drink in a week, he likely won’t live much longer. we (and the doctor) would be surprised if he lived 3 more days. he is very “out of it” and extremely frail and thin. he looks like a skeleton and is exhibiting signs of approaching death. not everybody gets a clear-cut beginning, middle and end stage of dementia. not everybody exhibits all of the dementia signs. it was so hard for me to understand that because everything online shows a clear stage-by-stage guide to dementia. but after having experienced this situation, i’ve come to learn that the people who kept reminding me that “everybody is different” were all right. i so badly just wanted a chart that would break everything down for me so i could follow the chart step-by-step, but it really doesn’t work that way. i’ve found that my family and i have been driving ourselves crazy trying to narrow down exactly when he will die. we feel like we need to know so we can be prepared and so we all can be there with him when it happens. but unfortunately we don’t get that luxury. my advice: take it a day at a time and at the end of the day be thankful you got one more day."," like you, my dad was just living his normal slightly forgetful 70 year old life when he had his stroke. he was rushed to the hospital..tests done, meds given. after a few days he was alert but could not read or talk and he never went home. his care was bullshit.  a year later he died in a nursing home. i lived far away and was not able to be wholly involved with his care although i did speak with his docs many times.people don't care about old people in general.  my dad's doctors gave bullshit responses to my very specific questions. they just sedated my dad. that's all they did. he should have been rehabbed.  they didn't do anything and his insurance was excellent. this happens all the time in the us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fp0j6i/beginning_to_endstage_dementia_in_just_weeks/,"Beginning to end-stage dementia in just weeks after stroke, no middle stage"
my father was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's and was caught in a scheme with a phone scammer. we're fortunate they did not take more money than they did but i'm trying to prevent this from happening again. it seems that the bank cannot refund him. do you have any steps set in place for loved ones?, we're setting up a white list on lo's phone - only trusted family members' phone numbers are allowed to ring through. everything else goes to voicemail (which lo is no longer able to navigate).,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/foshnl/im_looking_for_suggestions_on_how_to_prevent/,I'm looking for suggestions on how to prevent Phone Scammers
"my grandmother has had a rough patch dealing with my grandfather lately. she keeps asking why this had to happen to him. before dementia, he was the most loving and goofy man. wouldn't hurt a fly. now, as many of you know from my other posts and comments, he's become his own antithesis. i come from a catholic family, but am myself atheist. for me, this experience has cemented my lack of faith. my jewish spouse has seen this as a reason for more faith. my grandmother is angry and filling with doubt. just because i don't believe in a god doesn't mean i don't believe in a spiritual realm. and it certainly didn't block my ability to understand a religious perspective. so in the midst of her crisis of faith, i said this to her and it seemed to be comforting, so i hope it helps some of you feel at ease, if only for a moment;""so normally, a person's body dies and then their soul departs from their body. for some reason that we don't truly understand, sometimes the body remains even after the soul has departed. that's what's happening to grandpop. his soul is ready to move on but his body is still here. his soul gets farther every day, but his body is unchanged. our job is to take care of his body during this time so that one day, when both soul and body have moved on, he will get the memories of this time and know just how deeply he was loved. that's how i find the strength to help him. that's how i remain calm. i want him to know that i tried. i don't want him to doubt, ever for a second, how much i love him."""," i cant speak much about the spiritual side  , i would focus on getting your grandma some help especially some respite care to alleviate her workload.. caring for someone with dementia is very draining and the caregiver needs regular breaks..",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/fopfzg/a_different_perspective/,A different perspective
"disclaimer: i know very little about dementia. i don't even know if i'm just making wrong assumptions, or if this is only related to certain types of dementia like alzherimer's. sorry for my ignorance.i just watched this video: she keeps asking: ""how did we meet? am i really your grandma""? and whenever he explains: ""you are my grandma. your husband was my grandpa"", she just seems to roll with it and accepts those answers. but if she truly didn't remember it, wouldn't it make more sense for her to seem confused or object to those answers?and from my experience, if you tell them a nice, fun story that make them smile and then ask ""do you remember that?"", they often say yes. or at least, that's what i've seen in videos.i wonder if it's because they actually do remember it for a split second? or maybe they're just so sick that they don't really have much.. consciousness and thinking capabilities left for them to really question and analyze confusing situations like being told something they don't believe is true?"," i was told that the emotional memory is much stronger that the memory of events and people, etc. she might trust him because he's her grandson but doesn't remember the details just how he makes her feel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/foms82/why_do_people_with_alzherimers_often_seem_content/,Why do people with Alzherimer's often seem content with the answers and explanations?

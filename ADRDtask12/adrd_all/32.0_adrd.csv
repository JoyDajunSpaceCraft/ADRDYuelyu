"we got the call today that things got really bad in the early morning, and after making sure my mom didn’t have a stroke or a seizure, the doctors have determined she is going through terminal restlessness and she will likely pass in 24-48 hours.   they put her on multiple sleep medications along with morphine, which finally got her to sleep around 6pm today.  did anyone else lose a loved one with alzheimer’s in this way?  honestly just trying to mentally prepare myself for what i’m about to go through in the next 48 hours. this whole nightmare has been constant waves of unknown things happening, and it sounds like this is about to be the last one. any advice is greatly appreciated."," no advice here, swichts, just want to send you peace as you work through this with your mom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/b6envx/terminal_restlessness/,Terminal restlessness

"hey everyone,i am a documentarian, and i am currently working on a documentary about alzheimer's, and how it has a more traumatic effect on the families rather than the actual person with the disease. let me tell you a little bit about why we are doing this: my grandmother passed away from alzheimer's in 2017. she had it for 11 years. i was there when she was diagnosed, and i watched her progress all the way up until she died. i took care of her every single day, from making sure all of her laundry was done (even when she lived in assisted living), to making sure that she got the proper care she deserved. to this day, i still get extremely choked up when i talk about her -- it was so hard to watch this person that i loved dearly, whom i'd also consider my best friend, slowly forget the world around them. and then i realized, that i'm not the only one who has had to deal with this. many other people share similar stories to my experiences. at the end of the day, we all need to support each other through this terrible journey. so, with that being said, me, and a colleague of mine, want to tell other's stories. there are so many documentaries on why alzheimer's is a public health crisis, and why it's just bad in general -- but no one ever thinks of the families, and those that have to experience this, even though they don't have the disease. we are looking for families in the **central/upstate new york region (northern pennsylvania is also acceptable)**, that currently have a loved one living with alzheimer's. it does not matter their stage of progression. in the event that you do not live in this area, but you think that you have an extremely exceptional story (a very uncommon case), we can possibly work with that. what we would need:\- interview with the person living with alzheimer's\- a few shooting days so that we can capture the day to day life of someone with alzheimer's, as well as those taking care of a person with alzheimer's.\- interviews with family members\- old photos/videos of the person pre-alzheimer's, etc. if you think that you fit into this category, or can perhaps offer a connection to someone else that you know, we are more than willing to connect. we want to tell your stories. let us preserve the memory of your loved one, and also share a message that alzheimer's needs to be made a top priority in solving. thank you!&amp;#x200b;"," i'm in se wisconsin, my mom is 57, and we *just* got her diagnosis;she's got stage 5. i've had to watch this decline happen practically alone, as her ""friends"" (people i grew up calling aunts and uncles) never really understood what was happening, and they never really acknowledged the hardships i'm going through. i had planned to move out to japan after coming into some serious money in 2016 but was thrown for a guilt trip. things like, ""you're going to leave your mom all alone?"" and, ""how would your mother feel if you left?"".i gave up an entire possible life to stay and take care of my mom. when i did get that money, i was so unhappy i started going heavy on retail therapy. i bought ten different vehicles, along with countless other material things i hoped would help make me happy.now, i'm still living in the same house, with my mom, fiancé, three-month old son, and two roommates.it's still incredibly difficult to get her to remember things, and her short term memory is faulty, too. i often refer to her as my ""ten-second tom"" (50 first dates reference, go watch it, definitely relevant).honestly, i could go on and on.

," heya. so, it depends on the type of dementia, which they usually can't tell unless you've done done some sort of biopsy or if you've got a really strong family history of the disease.even then, the thing with many dementias is that most genetic testing will not provide a conclusive answer. for stuff like alzheimer's or lb, you might find a couple of genes that increase your risk factor, but even then, those risk factors are minute. you could come up with no risk increasing genes and still get dementia- there's just still so much we don't know about the causes. where i'm from, for example, there are some dementia genetic tests that are govt funded- but most aren't because there's no clear line between getting tested and being able to make a selective change that can benefit the next generation. so in short, no. most dementias won't automatically lead to any benefit or need for genetic testing. it didn't mean you can't do so privately, but you'd need to consider the benefit of doing so. there's a good chance that genes won't be able to tell you much.

"he’s always done exactly what he wants to do, regardless of what anyone else thinks. was never able to sit still, always had to keep moving and that hasn’t changed. staying at home = “being in prison”. he’s in fantastic physical shape (walks 10k+ every day). he’s usually ok if he stays in the suburb where he lives, but sometimes ventures further out and gets lost. ends up taking buses around the larger city with no idea where he is (and sometimes where he’s going). he lives on his own. i can only see him once a week, and don’t always manage that.  (he’s ok with taking medications as long as i put them on the “nighttime” or “morning” shelf. he feeds himself, that’s ok. can bathe himself. all of which means he’s not eligible for a care home or assistance from the government.) we could arrange a ride in theory - except he forgets our instructions or decides he doesn’t want to wait. i mean he rarely communicates his plans anyway, he’s used to doing what he wants when he wants. so what happens is when he gets lost, i end up chasing him all over town based on very unclear information on his location. (he might not know cross streets or which bus he’s on.) i don’t drive by the way so this happens on transit or via uber. i have siblings in the area but they refuse to help. they think a) he’s just being a jerk or b) he’s fine because he’s always been fine (he’s not). even if i arranged things to live with him, i couldnt stay with him all day and i couldn’t lock him up. so what do you do?! we’re getting him a flip phone with gps, and a medic alert bracelet. beyond that, what can we do to keep him safe? (that ideally doesn’t involve me chasing him all over town on buses? he loves to get around on sundays especially when service is the worst.)"," you're literally playing with fire to be very honest. my uncle was the same way to a certain point - until he lost his driver's licence and then walked to the mall which was 5 miles away from his house then walked to my house another 8 because he didn't remember how to get back to his house.  it was literally the worst 5-10 mins of wondering where he went for my cousins.  you never know when the next level would start and ... if you can hire a helper and have them walk around with him, i had to do that with my mom until she had to go into a home recently ... or even go with a adult day care.  i always recommend going to a local alzheimer's support group in your area and see if anybody has had similar situations and their solutions.   i wish no one that thought of their loved ones going missing ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/b54mbr/85_yo_dad_w_alz_doesnt_want_to_stay_home_but_gets/,85 y/o dad w Alz doesn’t want to stay home but gets lost

"hello all,newbie here, and this is my story. i (25m) live with my grandmother (65f), who at the same time, is a parent to me as i have been living with her since birth. over the past five years or so, she has slowly been experiencing cognitive decline. her memory is foggy, she forgets where she places things, forgets what day/time/month/year it is (and is constantly asking me what day it is etc), and suffers from symptoms of paranoia regarding theft of possessions and things of that nature. the reason i am posting here is because, about a month ago, she remarked to me how she wanted to go see her sister (who, for context, lives 2000 miles away) and how we had already seen her that past weekend. when i told her that was not the case, she flipped and got argumentative with me, so i dropped it. i try to explain in succinct and helpful ways about things etc when she asks, but to no avail. most of our conversations either begin with her yelling at me, getting mad at me for being so ""abrasive"" towards her, or end with her telling me to shut the hell up (or bringing up past transgressions i have made against her in the past). it seems that she is extremely distrustful of me because of these past issues, and as a result, she seems to believe she is fine. however, i have talked with her sister, as well as her counselor and medication prescriber about these issues, and they agree that it is not a psychosis, but appears to be dementia. she also has trouble taking medication properly (she takes more than the prescribed amount and often runs out before she should).however, my grandmother firmly and adamantly believes that ""she is not that bad"" and that ""it's just adhd""... furthermore, a neurologist who she saw a few months ago suggested a neuropsychological examination to be done, both in order to determine what is going on, and also have a more broad picture of the underlying issues... i just do not know what to do anymore, and it's gotten to the point where her providers are asking me to look after everything for her. and remembering my own issues or appointments etc, on top of her stuff is becoming frustrating, unbearable, and exhausting... i do not have poa or anything of the sort, but her medication prescriber has mentioned to me that we should look into getting that set up.. i just don't know where to turn, what to do, or how to proceed because she fights me and her doctors at every fucking turn... because of this not knowing, i have begun to just give up on helping her and have developed an apathy towards her issues, but at the same time, i want to help her... i just don't know how...

"i know this is long, but i felt compelled to write about my experience. i grew up surrounded by alzheimers. my grandfather, grandmother and aunt all had it and died from it by the time i was 15. shortly after they died, my mother was diagnosed with early onset alzheimers. i was 16. she was 48, but had been exhibiting symptoms for many years earlier. she declined rapidly, but since she was so young she remained relatively healthy otherwise and lived for another 5 years after her diagnosis. my father worked anywhere between 80-100 hours in a week, so my sister and i became the primary caregivers for our mother, taking turns going to school. it was absolute torture watching her decline and we had no help from any adults. we didn’t know what we were doing. we were living in the u.s. at the time (my mother was dual canadian (french) and american my father norwegian), and there was no help from the government. my mother was too young to apply for medicare or receive social security benefits, and did not validate for help from hospice because patients must be imminently dying. care homes were too expensive and we had no family near us, so my sister and i were truly alone. it was too complicated to move back to canada or norway for other reasons. our roles switched, we becoming like parents and her becoming like a child. it was like watching her die a little bit every day, but there was no closure because we watched her forget us, become confused, suffer, lose weight, look like death all while living. i started wishing she would die, so i could mourn her. it’s been 5 years since she passed, but i can still see the skin of her face pushed up against her bones, the look in her eyes as she would stutter, the stiffness of her limbs as she would shuffle her feet endlessly around our kitchen. she would not sit down. just walk in circles all day and into the night even in the days before her death. we would have to sleep on the floor of her bedroom through the night to make sure she wouldn’t walk off somewhere and hurt herself. i don’t think i slept for those 5 years we were taking care of her. i still have a hard time sleeping. giving her showers were always awful. i can’t stand the smell of bleach any longer because she would often end up pooping everywhere in the shower and we would have to clean the tile with it after we had rinsed her of it. she fell one time while i made her breakfast, and i can still hear the crack of her skull on the hardwood floor and the confusion in her eyes from the shock of it. everytime we would go to hospital or email her doctors they would tell is there was nothing they could do for us. we had emailed her primary doctor and she told us ‘what do you want me to do? she’s terminal anyway.’ the lack of care on her part was horrendous. she had written my mother off completely, which i can understand to an extent because she was terminal, but she could have at least helped her to die in dignity. we tried our best. we always put her in clean diapers, fed her what she would eat, brushed her hair, kept her warm, cleaned her, did what we could, but we were not doctors. three days before she passed we had noticed she had stopped pooping or eating. we took her to hospital and she weighed 30 kg (roughly 65 lbs). they gave her fluids and helped to remove the poop from her bowels. she looked so much more comfortable afterwards. as we were leaving, i helped her into the car and she looked me in the eye more coherently than she had in years and told me ‘thank you’. i think about that sometimes, that perhaps if we were able to have given her better care she would not have declined so horribly. i knew when it was her time. i watched my grandparents and my cousin take their last breaths as well, so it was familiar to me. i thought i was ready for her to pass away, but i wasn’t. it’s odd how you’re alive until your dead even if the person is not wholly there. it’s like life no matter how feeble gives hope and there’s a finality that hits so strongly when death finally comes. i don’t remember my mother before she was sick. i can only see her in death or when she was sick. the desperation and confusion in her eyes haunt me. sometimes i wonder if she was in there understanding everything, but not able to communicate. i try not to think on it. after she passed there was an emptiness and a freedom i was not ready for. i had experienced something many adults, especially my age, had not and there was no one to talk to. i had no friends and could not relate to people. my sister and i had been completely isolated other than classes and each other, and we went straight to and then home. at my mother’s funeral, her siblings and their spouses were all together for the first time in years. they wanted a picture together. it hurt because my mother was not there and then they did not invite my father to be in the picture. i started crying and my cousin asked me why i was. he couldn’t even understand that it might be because we were at my mother’s funeral. he said that she had been sick for a while and that it was expected. i still can’t make sense of that. i left the morning after her funeral til norway. i went alone. i was supposed to reconnect with family while there, but instead i went off on my own, finished university, and kept to myself. when i started working my coworkers would make fun of me calling me grandma because i was so out of touch with everything. it hurt every time because i wanted to go out and drink, make friends, have meaningful relationships, try out this thing called ‘sex’, and just live the life of a young 20-something, but i couldn’t relate to anyone and i had way too many things going on in my head. it took 3 years, but i eventually did come out of my shell. i began to confront it instead of trying to pretend none of it happened. i joined an orchestra and made friends, even found a boyfriend, who i love very much and is very supportive. it’s odd to think of myself even 2 years ago and see how far i’ve come in healing. i’m proud of myself. i still have never met anyone who has experienced what i have other than my sister. i don’t like to talk about it often because even though i have close caring relationships with people now it’s hard for them to understand, and it hurts to see them not be able to. i don’t blame them for that. it’s not their fault. i just can’t make sense of what happened. it feels like a completely different life. like a nightmare. it’s not as bad as it was. grief doesn’t grip me every day, but every once in a while an expression on someone’s face, a sound or smell will suck me right back into it, and i’m right back to taking care of my mother again. i just wish i could remember her before."," i was a caregiver for my mother along with my brother and dad. although i am older (35) i can relate to so many things you said. i’m so sorry for your loss and i feel your pain. i just watched my mother take her last breaths on friday. i am having a strange sense of relief and grief at the same time. my mom was pretty bad for the last year if not more and i feel like i had been grieving her death since then. she was alive but this shell of the woman she once was. the last few years have been mostly dedicated to taking care of her and after the craziness of what’s going on now dies down i don’t know what i’m supposed do with myself. my life is going to change and i haven’t processed how i truly feel about that yet. anyone reading this that is going through any stage of this horrible disease and caregiving, i’m here to talk if you need to.

"hey all,sorry in advance this post is going to be rather long. honestly i just want to know whether her behaviours are a cause for concern and if there’s anything i can do to help her (obviously besides a visit to the doctor which we are planning to do it’s just tricky as my mum works full time and i don’t own a car) my grandma lives with me and my mum and recently i’ve noticed she’s deteriorated a lot. she’s been on a downward spiral ever since she moved in with us (around 2 years ago now) before she came here she lived in a flat alone and would cook for herself and was pretty independent for her age, she wouldn’t leave the house alone due to arthritis but other than that she was doing well. but as soon as she moved in here she became very dependant on us, during the week while my mum works i stay at home to bring her food and drink and make sure she’s okay, she has a carer that will come and help her wash and dress but other than that me and my mum are the ones who care for her the majority of the time. recently i’ve noticed her memory has gotten worse, she has a chair with a remote that operates a leg rest and helps her to stand up. it started off with small things like a couple times she mistook it for her tv remote and would try and use it to operate her tv, but now she forgets her chair even has a leg rest and when she does she can’t figure out what button to press despite it having pictures for each function. she has poor circulation and bad arthritis and finds elevating her legs eases the pain so recently when ive gone to check on her more often than not her legs are down and she’s in a lot of discomfort and i have to remind her that she can elevate her legs. she’s also been saying a lot of things that don’t make much sense. a most recent example was that i came home from being out and she called me over and told me that i had a missed phone call. i had my mobile with me and had no missed calls but she said it was on her phone, which makes no sense as i’ve never given out her number or associated it with my name. i asked who it was and she said the hairdresser (which again makes no sense as our hairdresser doesn’t have her number) so i asked if it was our regular hairdresser and she said no it was someone else (we only have one hairdresser and she works alone) so unless she misheard the caller or something i’m not sure where that came from. i’ve also noticed she will get confused mid-sentence and start talking about something else which makes our conversations tricky. i always try to humour her and not point it out as she gets very depressed when she realises she’s forgotten something or isn’t making sense. my last concern is she’s forgetting names of family members, the other day she couldn’t recall the name of my uncle (her son)’s wife who he’s been married to for over 30 years. she’s expressed fear in the past that she’s losing her memory and i’ve always tried to reassure her and at that time it was only minor things but now i’m very concerned because these changes have occurred very suddenly and seem to be getting worse. me and my mum have talked about it and we agree she needs to see a doctor and we are trying to formulate a plan to get her there as she doesn’t like to leave the house and has missed her passed few appointments and other planned outings because of this. (i suspect she could be agoraphobic)i just wondered if there’s anything i can do to help her with her memory? i’m thinking of making her a sort of cheat sheet for when she’s forgotten how to use her chair and tv remote for when i’m not around to help. she’s also going away for a week to visit some other relatives which always does her good but she forgot about it until we reminded her this evening and she’s gotten in a state because she doesn’t want to go (she always enjoys herself when she’s there and it’s both good for her and us if i’m honest) so i wondered if there was anything i could prepare while she’s away? obviously our main focus is getting her to the doctors asap but i just wanted some advice on what i might be able to do for her in the meantime? thank you in advance", cheat sheets of any kind are a great idea. anything to keep them organized and oriented. even stuff you might see in a kindergarten classroom.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ayxkxj/worried_my_grandma_is_showing_symptoms_of/,Worried my grandma is showing symptoms of Alzheimer’s

my grandmother has onset alzheimers and just found out she have missed a dose of medication almost everyday. she had a prescription bottle half full of medication from june 2018! definitely my fault and i should have been more aware of her taking her medications. i previously bought two from amazon (the circular one that dispenses per day and has an alarm that would shut off after you turn it over to get the pill) and they both broke within 6 months of using them. i'm trying to see if anyone have good recommendations for one that would last hopefully more than a year. i see some really good rated ones that are very expensive...over $300! thank you everyone for your input.," we use med-e-lert round one that's programmable, like your broken one. bought it 4 years ago for maybe $130. the battery door broke within a year, but we taped it with packing tape. still works.as an aside - eventually my mom stooped recognizing the alarm as reason to take her pills, and now its more of an alarm for us. but its easier to see if/when we miss a day. the paid caregivers are unsure if their allowed legally to take it out of the dispenser, so we just put them in a small bowl until she's ready.

"bit of background...husband has been having memory/anxiety issues related to mci/poss early-onset dementia for a couple of yrs now. has had an assessment with the memory clinic nurse, then referred to specialist psychiatrist. now has an assessment appt with specialist neuropsychology dr in a couple of weeks.later at night and early in the morning are the most difficult times, for him and me. he is more confused and anxious at these times than the rest of the day.he often wakes up ages before he's supposed to, usually around 5am, with terrible anxiety about things. this morning, he woke up really upset, thinking he had lost his money, because he couldn't see his wallet. the wallet was in his bedside drawer, right next to him. i gently told him this, and gave the wallet to him, but he still thought he'd lost money, because..... i don't know why.i'm getting so bloody tired of being woken up, my sleep is messed up and i can't settle down again either.i'm thinking of sleeping downstairs, just so i can have a little bit of quiet time.i know this isn't anyone's fault, i know it's not his fault, but i can't help feeling the way i do. i'm tired. all the time. when everyone else has gone to bed, i stay up late so i can have peace and quiet, as its the only time i can do. as he doesn't have a diagnosis yet, this makes things more difficult in terms of support and related stuff. and he's only 61.just wanted to get this crap out of my head, just for a bit. thankyou."," one bright outlook based on what you stated is that most dementias would have greatly advanced within the timeframe you discussed.  his neuropsychological testing (typically 3-4 hours long) will be quite beneficial in determining this.early-onset dementias tend to be more rapid than late-onset and if he has had mci for a couple of years then it is less likely to be a neurodegenerative disease.how is he, psychologically speaking?  depression and anxiety can cause remarkable cognitive impairments but it does not typically advance greatly over time.  you did speak of fairly significant anxiety and if his sleep is inadequate this too can cause impairment.  hopefully, he is able to improve and i wish you the best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tv9ylw/i_bloody_hate_mornings/,I bloody hate mornings
"been taking care of my husband for several years now, he is not progressed to the point of not being able to do some things for himself but i am still on duty 24/7.  yesterday he was rude to me in the grocery store for no reason, just out of the blue mean.  we got to the car and he started to apologize and i started screaming at a volume and pitch i have never done before.  it was shocking to me but i couldn't stop.  i guess the burden of what is to come and all we have lost and all the times in the past he has been mean just came together in a furious ball of anger.  it took hours for my heart rate to go down and i slept on the couch.   i had no idea that kind of rage was living inside me. please, no one tell me his being mean is the disease or that i need counseling and support. i just needed to get this off my chest so i can start new today."," omg! you sound just like me! while my husband is a kind man he has always had a terrible temper and it‚Äôs horrible! he is perfectly able to care for himself at this time, but his temper has gotten much worse, constantly apologizing, which makes me crazy! to me if your sorry then stop it!!!!! i constantly remind myself this is the disease, and will get much worse. it still hurts and makes life so very hard. i can tell you though that through my prayers, god is helping me to not be so anxious all the time. god bless you my dear as the road ahead is long and hard, from what i understand. üòèüôèüèº",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tv8gdm/venting/,Venting

im thinking of putting my dad in a nursing home.  the one im thinking of still doesnt have any activities provided.  they say its because of covid.  they are constructing a new building right now and say activities will start again once that new building is done in may.  is this normal in the us or are they just bring super cheap and trying to save money?  but would open activities again cause they are heavily marketing right now due to the large number of vacancies needed to be filled.," yes, covid would be the reason. i think the real question is why they will start up in may in the new building. why not start now? my mom lives in a senior apartment building that had all sorts of activities before covid. those got shut down and i really think management is stalling starting things up again because they realized how much easier it is for them to not be in charge of things like movie nights and super bowl parties.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tv64z2/activities_and_covid/,activities and covid

"i'm sure others have experience with helping your lo get dressed. i typically help my grandma because she does not remember to take her overnight pull up off and dress correctly. some mornings she just stands there and does not try to dress herself. i'll prompt her to remove her nightgown (she has to pull it off over her head) and she will just stand there and shrug her shoulders. then i prompt her by touching it/pulling it up slightly at the shoulders and repeating that she needs to pull it off. i don't like to remove it because she has back issues and not great range of motion in her shoulders. then once i do pull it off she just kind of stands there. and the process just becomes more difficult because then she pretty much refuses to help. she has incontinence so most mornings her nightgown is wet (or will be shortly from her sitting) so i don't want her left in it. but when i'm met with her uncooperative attitude, i'm not sure what to do. other than just getting her dressed and hoping that changes her attitude. how do you handle these situations?", she doesn't have an attitude just an inability to remember how to do things.  seems so simple for us but so difficult for them. maybe a dressing gown which buttons or zips up so you can undo and it drops to the floor?  maybe use pull ups and unfasten (or tear) from the sides so those drop to the floor also?  sometimes we just have to keep doing more as they are unable to take care of themselves.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tu9618/dressing_issues/,Dressing issues

"hi everyone    question... my parents are paying me a visit (first time in years, due to covid) and my mother is displaying very strange behaviour. with all respect, she has always been a unique character (no education, very limited social connections her entire life, never worked, anger management issues, diagnosed bipolar, chronic depression, etc...). i am grateful for the sacrifices and care she gave me. i am a successful, well-functioninf adult because of her, but truth off my chest - it took me years to get my own mental health straight after some of the damage she has done, i do not love her, and although i don't want to deny her access to my family, i want to keep a healthy distance. anyways. she doesn't strike me as massively different as usual, she is her natural self. but some of her bad temper/behaviour seems just... ""amplified"". i am starting to wonder if this is a medical condition. it is hard to explain. a couple of examples in the last 48h.   she wanted to cook a roast chicken and chips for us at dinner (great!). she asked how to prepare it, i recommended she just put the chicken in the oven a 180*c for 1h30 and leave it (keeping it simple). an argument ensued (she always gets angry very quickly, it is unpleasant but nothing unusual). she wanted to know what to do for the stuffing (we don't need stuffing, it's good as it is), if she needed to cover it in butter (no, it's not a turkey, chicken is fatty enough), how to cut the chicken (no, keep it whole, we'll carve it at the end), etc... i just stuck to the simple instructions. she kept entertaining suggestions until, in the end, i lost patience, insisted on my simple steps and she reluctantly agreed to just put it as is in the oven. anyway - fast forward half a day, my family arrive to her holiday rental for dinner. it all smells good, i go check on the chicken. she decided to turn the chicken upside down at some point during the cooking. whatever. she left it for 2h30 (and it would still be roasting had i not asked her how long the chicken had been in the oven). when it came to taking it out of the oven, we had another argument about what cloth to use. i recommended against using a thin polyester cloth she randomly grabbed to take out the hot tray. for reference, this was not at her home, so it was not the equipment she is used to using. she insisted and went for it, the cloth started to melt immediately on the tray and i had to actually forcibly step in and intervene to remove it and stop her from burning herself. she got angry again, saying that she had lived more than me and could take a chicken out of the oven. i took over (with a thick cotton cloth), which made her cry. oh and she had forgotten to cook the chips (so we ate the chicken while the chips were cooking).     another argument was about her laptop. it refused to turn on (blatantly, the battery was empty). she told me it went in ""security mode"" (... what?! -,-') and she needed to bring it to the repair shop (... what!!??). i tell her it just needs to be charged, and ask her where the charger is. she says the charger is in the laptop, because it is portable. we argue about chargers/batteries for a while, she gets angry again. i show her the charger, connect it to the laptop, put it in her hands, and tell her to just plug it in and leave the laptop be for a while. she tells me she doesn't know how to do that, gets angry, goes back to ""the laptop is in security mode"". i tell her to plug it in and that she knows how to plug something in. she gets angrier about me being ""unhelpful"" but as i walk odd, she reluctantly complies. lo and behold - after 15min the laptop just boots normally. we discuss further (calmly this time, yay), and she tells me she regularly goes to the local computer shop and pay $40 to get her laptop out of ""security mode"". yes, i want to kill the shop owners.    anyway, i could go on. it is like this all. the. time. my mom has always got angry quickly her entire life, i lived my childhood in-between shouts and arguments. but it's now happening for everything. and i mean every thing. she argues about opening the car door. she can't peel a carrot properly, gets angry when i peel them further when she is ""done"". when my young son greets her with a white blouse, green scrubs and a stethoscope around the neck, she asks me what he is dressed up as (and gets angry when i am surprised she can't see it's a doctor costume - ""how am i supposed to know"", she says). i don't know if it is me being shocked by her attitude because i have lived a long time with no contact with her or if she has got worse. but it is exhausting. it is impossible to have a conversation on anything that is remotely non-basic, it goes completely over her head and she just doesn't understand what it is about. my dad confirms the type of interactions i describe is his daily life. he is numb to it. i only admire his patience explaining the simplest of things again, and again, and again, in spite of being shouted at in the rudest of ways. i can't stay calm like he does. his relationship with her is clearly beyond repair, but he stays at his post, sticks to his principles/duties like a boss and won't leave her despite all she does to him. she never worked, has no pension - if he leaves she is absolutely f*cked, which he will not allow. i am in awe about his ability to remain steadfast.  my parents live abroad, i can't do much with their medical support. but i wonder. my dad says she had multiple brain scans, and they were all ok. is what i describe dementia?

(we we‚Äôre a tiny bit jealous, as we wished it wasn‚Äôt 2016, but so it goes.) he was oddly calm about it, but would act like he had time traveled without knowing it‚Ä¶ for about 5 minutes, and then reset to the beginning. he went to neurologists, he had tests. they told him it was nothing. but it happened several times over the next two years, and meanwhile his memory got worse and worse. then he began to have seizures. i think that it was seizures all along, but he crashed his car for the first time 3.5 years ago. that time he convinced everyone that he fell asleep. the next crash was 2 years ago, and that time the paramedics witnessed a seizure. not grand mal. he often seems awake and agitated. sometimes combative. his license was suspended and he went on meds. and he thought he was fine. but his memory got worse and worse. and whenever he sees a doctor he just charms them, and they never diagnose any cognitive decline. so he thinks he‚Äôs fine. right before new years he totaled his brand new truck. this time he had a grand mal in the er. i forbade him to drive again, and he agreed, but reluctantly. i went to the neurologist with him this time. once again all scans were clear. they changed his meds and seem willing to let him drive after 6 months. but he can‚Äôt remember when he has seizures. unless he crashes a car he doesn‚Äôt really seem to believe that they happen. and now he is behaving on a day to day basis like he has dementia. he nearly burned down my stepsister‚Äôs house the other day trying to light a broken wood stove 1 hour after being reminded not to use it. many other examples. the thing is, i don‚Äôt live very nearby. i only see him occasionally. i have arranged to legally take charge of financial stuff, but i can‚Äôt be there all the time. and none of his doctors seem to think there‚Äôs anything wrong except seizures. how can i approach them in a way that they will take seriously when he is so invested in convincing them that there‚Äôs no issue? everything is landing on my stepsister, who is also dealing with her mother‚Äôs physical decline. especially since now neither of them can drive. i am really getting worried that he‚Äôs unable to care for himself."," in california, where i live, doctors are ‚Äúmandated reporters‚Äù to the dmv if someone has dementia or seizures.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ttla04/the_doctors_dont_see_it/,The doctors don‚Äôt see it
"hi everyone, this is my first time posting to this subreddit, and i‚Äôm hoping i can get some advice on how to handle this. so my grandmother, who is 78, has had dementia for about 10 years now, and she‚Äôs a pretty ‚Äútypical‚Äù dementia patient. she has gotten significantly worse over the years, and she now requires around the clock care from feeding to bathing and everything in between. it‚Äôs certainly been hard to adjust to, as she only started living with my parents and me about 5 years ago. it fell to me at first to help her around whenever i would get home from school as my parents work full time jobs, but back then she was much more capable and didn‚Äôt really require much help. now we‚Äôve struggled to find her a caregiver who can accommodate her since she does not speak english, and it‚Äôs been up to our extended family to provide care most of the time since no one of us can afford to always be with her. luckily, we‚Äôve recently found a care giver who speaks our native language and is able to  be with her most days when we can‚Äôt.now new years is a very major holiday where we‚Äôre from (albania) and it‚Äôs always been my grandmother‚Äôs favorite to boot. about 1 month ago she seemingly woke up and decided it was new years and kept going around asking everyone what the plan is and where we‚Äôre going, what we‚Äôre eating, where are the gifts, etc. she has had delusions in the past, but they never stuck stuck around, and we figured this one would be no different, but then, the next day, she had the same conviction, that it was new years. this happened the next day and the next and the next day, and it‚Äôs still ongoing. it‚Äôs gotten to be a big problem, as since she thinks it‚Äôs new years everyday, she expects there to always be festivities and gangs of hoodlums roaming around like it was when she was younger in the old country, and she always becomes extremely anxious when anyone leaves the house because of this, as she fears for our safety. she never used to mind, so long as someone stayed with her, but now if she realizes anyone is gone, her anxiety causes her to become agitated and lash out constantly. we‚Äôve tried telling her it wasn‚Äôt new years at first, but that went as poorly as you might expect, then we tried giving her a calendar to mark the days, but instead of using it whenever we put it out for her and cross off dates she just hides it somewhere in her room, and even when we find it and show her it doesn‚Äôt change her assertion that today is new years. she does always trust her phone, but even when staring right at the date on it she still won‚Äôt believe it. my parents and i are at a total loss for how to move forward, as her belief that everyday is new years had put serious stress on us and her, and it is starting to become debilitating. do we just have to accept this is a part of everyday life from now on? my theory (and hope) is that it‚Äôs mainly due to the weather, and once the trees get their leaves back and it‚Äôs not cold and cloudy everyday this will end. i would really appreciate some advice on this from anyone willing to give some.tl;drthe first two paragraphs are skippable, but otherwise the title tells all you need to know."," dementia robs the afflicted of their reason. you will not convince her it is not new years for a couple of reasons: first, dementia confuses the sufferer and they know things are ""not right"". so they are very suspicious of everyone's motives around them. they think someone is playing a trick on them, but they just haven't figured it out yet. second, they do not arrive at the decision that it is new years via a logical path of reason. they just ""know it"". and there is no way to counter that.with dementia, every day the person can change. significantly.your only role is to make each day as comfortable and pleasant as you can.so when she says it is new years, you go along with it. ""yes! what is your favorite thing about new years?"" or ""what was your favorite new years celebration?"" or ""what did you always want to do on new years, but never did?""all of these questions will make the dementia sufferer happy. they will happily reminisce about their best memories and tell stories of their favorite times.... and then forget it all later.and then you can repeat it.your grandmother will have a lovely time remembering great times in her past, and it hurts no one for her to think it is new years. you don't have to tell her it isn't, because it doesn't matter if it is new years or not. just ask leading questions - what would you like to do? - and let the person live happily in their best memories.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ttjxd0/my_grandmother_thinks_everyday_is_new_years/,My Grandmother thinks everyday is New Years

"hello everyone! i am a 24 year old living in a bit of a complicated situation. for some background context; my homeless uncle was moved in with us for his health and safety. he is 60 years old and has had speech issues for a while (stuttering and making nonsense or talking about random things totally off subject). we could tell his memory was not where it should be but we thought it was normal for his character. he refuses to go to the doctor or address a few issues but i believe it is dementia but i am unsure of what stage it could possibly be. recently my family and i have been having issues with my uncle. almost every time he goes to the bathroom there is feces smeared on the toilet seat and i am the one that usually has to clean it up. i‚Äôve spoke to my mom about it and she basically has took the turn a blind eye pretend it‚Äôs not happening route which i can understand her logic behind but the issue is still occurring. i went to the bathroom tonight and there was feces smeared all over the toilet seat and toilet. this time it was considerably a much more in depth issue to handle. a few days ago i had to bleach and scrub our shower because of a fecal issue all over the bottom of the shower, i just cleaned it up sort of did what i had to do and brought it to my moms attention. he does not shower, we have reminded him many times to shower but he refuses and goes without a shower for a month or two and we honest to god try so hard to get him to shower but i don‚Äôt know how to force him to shower. he can shower on his own but just chooses not to. he is very similar in changing clothes as well, will only change his clothes once a month despite us pleading with him and trying to find compromise. i am trying to understand how feces is getting smeared all over the toilet and the only explanation that makes sense to me is he soils his clothes and sits in it and it just transfers to the toilet. i‚Äôm not sure what else would be an explanation for it. i have no knowledge on how to care for someone with dementia, this is all new to me. my mom is more of an authority figure for our household and she works a lot so she‚Äôs not at home or handling these issues as much as i am. i understand that as we get older we have accidents, we lose our memory, etc. i am not blaming him by all means and i am not out to embarrass him or shame him in any way. i‚Äôve read about different stages of dementia and to me it sounds like he could be in the late stages. again, i am new to this so i would not exactly know. i have tried so hard to get him to go to a doctor, pleaded and begged for him to shower and change clothes. i have tried making compromise like using wet wipes or a damp wash cloth. we have unfortunately had arguments and small fights about showering, changing clothes, bathroom hygiene, and going to a doctor. i am sort of the one that is handling these situations primarily and i feel like i am truly lost. we are a low income family so it‚Äôs extremely difficult to be able to put him in a care home or have in-home help or aid to come. i would be extremely grateful for any tips, advice. my mom could do a little bit more to assist in help and support in my opinion and we are working on that. i am concerned for my uncle but i can‚Äôt force him to go to a doctor or change clothes, no matter how hard i try i just can‚Äôt seem to get him to understand."," he needs a doctor to prescribe him medication to make him more amenable. he is at risk of slipping on his body fluids in the bathroom as well as uti. also he may take the suggestion of bathing easier from strangers much easier instead of his family, strangely. if you share your country/state people can suggest social resources. for the state programs that are available in the us he alone needs to be low income.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tsxjfb/my_uncle_may_have_possible_dementia/,My Uncle May Have Possible Dementia

"my mother has been living with bipolar disorder her whole life (mainly controlled with medication), unfortunately she had to come off meds due to damage caused and in 2021 had a manic episode which required hospitalization. usually her episodes are \~3 months, but this one went on for over 12 months. in addition to bipolar she had regular tias 'mini strokes' for several years and had covid-19 last year too. there has been a significant decline in her cognitive function and she has now been diagnosed with dementia at age 68. the doctors indicate that bipolar disorder combined with tias and other health issues have collectively damaged her brain over time. before the latest manic episode she had fine cognitive function except for the occasional memory slip.it seems like very sudden onset, more like a stroke than what i understand from dementia. she has lost most communication, all motivation/interest in anything, poor mobility, a good chunk of memories (although hard to test since she doesn't communicate much). she paces back and forth, has panic attacks, rocks back and forth, but doesn't really do much or speak much and it's hard to get her involved in anything. basically the symptoms seem quite advanced for her age and the fact this has come on following a manic episode is leaving me confused - it feels like she has jumped forward about 20 years over night!i also worry about my family as my dad is now essentially a full time carer and he's not young either. i am trying to offer support but don't know how. i am still coming to terms with the diagnosis, but i am interested to hear from others whose parents have had dementia, and especially anyone who has seen bipolar with dementia or experienced this speed of progression."," my husband (59yo) has been a bipolar 30 years. 4 yrs ago he had a bad manic episode and it took multiple hospitalizations over 2 months to stabilize him.  the resulting meds caused him daytime sleepiness (he would sleep 20 hours a day) and constant tremors, falls, short-term memory issues, & high-level thinking was impacted, etc.we had to move to another state (formerly nm, now md) to find competent drs. to help him change meds.   he isn‚Äôt well, but is gradually becoming more functional. he is seeing a new psychiatrist who has slowly reduced and changes some meds (benzos).we have seen a neurologist and now another that specializes in movement disorders.the reality is, there is no magic drug combination, everyone is different. he will always have tremors because of the types of meds he must take to keep from going manic. this movement doctor did prescribe a tremor med, and suggested a further reduction in benzos and removal of lithium over time.this gives us hope.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tqn1wj/dementia_and_bipolar/,Dementia and bipolar

i came across something a few weeks ago that suggested to reduce cholesterol levels or some marker in the blood that begins with t and keep it within range in your 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s to reduce your chances of developing dementia and alzheimer's. i'm in the early days of thinking my mom might have dementia. it isn't showing up as a typical forgetfulness.  is showing up in mood swings and crazy ranting that doesn't make much sense.  it's not every day.  i was getting ready for work this morning and she had all the laundry appliances running on high even though we have some hight energy costs looming and i made a suggestion to turn of the laundry appliances because the clothes must be dr by now.  the clothes were already air dried but she had them in the tumble dryer for longer. she was using the tumble dryer without a care in the world towards the rising energy costs.  then she started shouting at me and it was just crazy making.  all while i was trying to get ready for work. i recently found out that her doctor is concerned about her blood results that showed high cholesterol. she said this. she said she refused medicine and she wants to control it through the diet and she wants me to find out how on google. sometimes i question my own judgement and now i am thinking if dementia is setting in but we don't know it yet., fyi[[[[,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tpmenu/does_high_cholesterol_have_a_correlation_towards/,Does high cholesterol have a correlation towards dementia

"sorry if i'm just clogging this place up, i have a lot on my mind after i visited my grandmother yesterday and i need to get some of it out somewhere.i'm twenty years old and trans ftm. i've been out for around 6 years now. as my grandmothers dementia progressed, i knew that one day she would forget about my transition. i also knew that it wouldn't be personal if she did forget. it's just how dementia is. even though i'd told her it's okay if she slips up, and i don't mind what she says or whether she calls me her granddaughter or grandson, she still did her best. in january i visited her, and i was unsure if she remembered me due to her seemingly avoiding talking too much to me. afterwards my dad spoke to her and asked her upfront if she knew who i was. she apologised to him, saying of course she knew who i was, she just couldn't remember my gender and didn't want to upset me by making a mistake. it was sweet, but also sad. and i felt really bad about it, too. despite her mind working against her, her top priority was my comfort. i visited her again two weeks ago and this continued.then yesterday, me and my dad went to visit her in her new care home. she couldn't tell who i was, and she asked me to take my mask off, which i did (with staff approval.) upon seeing my face, she immediately grabbed me and pulled me into the tightest hug a frail 83 year old could possibly give, repeating things such as ""my beautiful granddaughter"", telling me how much of a pretty woman i was, and talking about how she'd been waiting for me to visit her for so long. she probably got a lot of confused looks from other residents and maybe even staff, but i didn't care. and i didn't care that she forgot, either. i always told her it was okay if she did. it's a sign that her memory is still obviously deteriorating, but really, that's to be expected. she has two types of dementia at once (dual dementia) so sadly, things are probably going to decline quickly. but right now, i'm just glad she doesn't have to worry about ""slipping up"" anymore."," i just got off the phone with my dad, he didn't remember who i was, so yeah, maybe you shouldn't mind if your grandma forgets which parts you have. literally the last fucking thing you should concern yourself with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tpkstz/my_grandmother_forgot_i_transitioned_and_i_dont/,"My grandmother forgot I transitioned, and I don't mind"

"tl;dr: how to explain guardianship process to loved one, and looking for ideas on how to convince her to go to assisted living without poa or guardianship due to guardianship process taking too long.summary:my first concern is if/how i should explain the guardianship process to my aunt. she is going to be served notice of the guardianship application next week. she is extremely savvy. her logic may not be largely intact, but she owned a nursing agency for 30 years and was a very successful, independent woman, and her drive and tenacity have not left her yet. she's aware enough to know the objective of guardianship is take control of her finances (in addition to her medical care). any ideas on how to spin it so it's not as threatening to her? lastly, does anyone have experience convincing or coercing someone who refuses to leave their home into assisted living (without poa or guardianship)? guardianship will likely take another 6mo, and we don't have enough liquid assets to keep her in her home that long. a caseworker mentioned telling my aunt she needs to stay somewhere for a couple weeks while the house is fixed up. it's a good idea, but my aunt has already figured out it's a rouse. my fear is she'll completely cut off all contact if i try to do anything and then we won't be able to care for her.details:i am in az and going through guardianship process in harris county, tx for my aunt that has lewy bodies dementia. she has no children, no poa (too late now), and will not add anyone to her bank accounts. she requires 24/7 care as a fall risk and she's losing the ability to care for herself. the issue is she is almost out of liquid assets to fund her 24/7 care and refuses to go to assisted living. she says she ""will die in her home"". she has other assets (home, car, misc. collectibles) that could be sold, but she refuses to let anyone help her with finances or selling assets. i'm applying for guardianship, but i'm concerned it will destroy what little goodwill i have left with her. she believes her current condition was caused by a family member assaulting her a few months ago (she actually had a uti and fell in her home while alone), and that we (family) are trying to put her in a mental institution and steal her assets. i don't take it personally, although my mom (aunt's sister) and other cousins do. my mom is not capable of handling the financial situation, and my cousins are out because my aunt 100% believes they're trying to kill her. i know everyone thinks their lo's suspicions are next level, but my aunt tells every caregiver, medical professional, basically anyone, that we are trying to kill her and steal from her. she spends hours every day talking about it. she has already been committed once due to her paranoia, but they discharged her at first signs of being stabilized. and now she's back home and refuses any medication or treatment. i'm afraid she'll cut off all contact with me and my mom and we won't know if she's being cared for or not."," whew. this is a terrible situation. i‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to navigate such a crisis. dementia is such an odd thing because it‚Äôs both the same as others‚Äô experiences and completely different. you clearly know and understand your aunt better than anyone else, so if things i say don‚Äôt precisely jive with her, try to tweak it to fit more with her personality. my mom was extremely proud and very resistant to any notion that there was something wrong with her. it‚Äôs harder in the early stages when they still sorta have their mind in tact. my mom was difficult to adjust to things along the way, not quite as intense a level as your aunt, but with some things, yeah she was totally impossible to handle. we sorta had to wait until she had declined enough to move her, otherwise the ruse wouldn‚Äôt have worked as well. it just takes time. we had her best friend pick her up and take her out to lunch while we set up her room at memory care. then a few days later her husband took her out again, but at some point he started mentioning (possibly faked a phone call?) that ‚Äúthere was a burst pipe at home and the whole place was flooded - absolute chaos. so for the time being we‚Äôve got another great space set up where you‚Äôll be more comfortable while the construction crew works.‚Äù add whatever kinds of details that would be of concern to the person or seem more plausible, etc. just try to maintain a positive disposition and meet any fear or resistance from her with confidence and ease. be reassuring and just keep moving the goalposts, as she‚Äôll inevitably wanna leave and go home for the first few weeks, months. basically you wanna gaslight her‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs a horrible way to put it but it‚Äôs essentially what you have to do. you gotta get real comfortable with lying to her. to make the transition to the new space easier, we used a lot of her own stuff to decorate it in a familiar way, so it felt as much like ‚Äúhome‚Äù as possible. but i don‚Äôt know if your aunt is so paranoid and suspicious that she‚Äôd immediately notice if some of her things weren‚Äôt there‚Ä¶ ok, i‚Äôm thinking‚Ä¶ oh! i might have an idea. quick story first to better help illustrate what i‚Äôm thinking: so, my mom broke her femur in 2015, had surgery and long recovery. the trauma of the leg break plus the time in hospital and rehab, and just the process of being ‚Äúput under‚Äù anesthesia ‚Äî it all was the kickstarter to her cognitive decline. when i was visiting the hospital one day back then, after surgery ‚Äî and again, this was pre-dementia anything. i didn‚Äôt know the first thing about dementia ‚Äî she was very upset just being in the hospital at all, wanted to leave and was so anxious and no matter what i did or said to distract her to make her happy, her anxiety wheels just kept turning and she just incessantly was wanting to leave, begging me to take her. after trying so many times to reason with her, i looked around the room suspiciously, then leaned close to her and whispered ‚Äúlook, i‚Äôm gonna sneak you outta here‚Ä¶but you gotta be patient. we have a whole plan - me and the siblings. everyone‚Äôs gonna help out but we gotta wait for the right time so just try to stay calm and we‚Äôll get home soon enough.‚Äù her whole face lit up man. ‚Äúreally?!‚Äù she said. and she got so giddy and excited about it, happy that we were being devious and breaking the rules. she was totally quiet and calm, eventually fell asleep. so i don‚Äôt know, i‚Äôm thinking maybe you should do something like another commenter mentioned, and use her suspicions to manipulate her into trusting that you are the one who wants to help her? i don‚Äôt know exactly what would seem believable to her, so you be the judge. but if you can somehow form an alliance with her where there‚Äôs no doubt in her mind that you‚Äôre on her side? you gotta start small, but eventually you maybe could convince her to start letting you move stuff into storage to hide it from greedy family, etc? then maybe you can start selling things to make money to cover her until the guardianship goes thru? i think i saw someone else here or in another post talk about the ‚Äúfoot in the door approach‚Äù‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a sales thing but it‚Äôs usable with dementia stuff too. if you can get her to agree to smaller things, easing her down the road she‚Äôs on little by little, you‚Äôll have a much easier time with the bigger transitionsquestion: this will be served to her by a clerk or process server? or just mail? is it possible you could intercept? cause i think you‚Äôd be best off if you could control the pacing of everything, and not have it just happen to her one day. another big piece of the puzzle i learned from being with mom, was that she was much much easier to keep calm and happy if we didn‚Äôt let her get to the worked-up/anxious states. you do this by anticipating needs and just having her world be exactly how she likes for her to be content. or more simply, just keep the bad shit away from her, whatever that means in her situation. i realize your timeline isn‚Äôt long, with the money running out and such. if there simply isn‚Äôt enough time to get her fully comfortable with all the changes,  the best you can do is just be reassuring and kind. smart, independent savvy women like your aunt and my mom will fight tooth and nail to not be seen as weak or not in control. unfortunately the high intellect makes it easier for them to cover up the signs of cognitive decline, and more stubborn during the most critical early stages. if everything fails and she locks everyone out and refuses any help whatsoever, i think at that point you have to get professionals involved. i don‚Äôt know which is the right govt agency for this but it would be my next step. the good news is that eventually it‚Äôll all be forgotten by her, so don‚Äôt worry about her hating you or being angry. she‚Äôll get over it. just play it cool and when she can‚Äôt be reasoned with or tricked, just agree with her and move on. keep trying later. i hope some of this is helpful to you, but it‚Äôs not easy to get every little nuance from a single post about someone. so i‚Äôm sorry if i missed anything or misunderstood details. please feel free to reach out if you need anymore brainstorming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/toy57i/experience_with_the_guardianship_process_in_the/,Experience with the guardianship process in the US with a loved one that has ninja-on-steroids-level suspicion of family and friends trying to steal?

"my grandmother (77) has been acting strange over the past year or year and a half. it started with her forgetting little things more often, having more problems cooking, and needing more help with technology related tasks. not unusual, except sometimes these tasks were things like changing the batteries in her remote. then she wanted to add mom onto her bank account to help her make sure her bills are paid and everything. in all fairness, though, she was preparing to go stay with my aunt for a few months, so it made sense to have us handle that stuff. she's back from her trip, though, and it's a lot easier to see the changes. still nothing massive, but she's repeating the same stories a lot, the dogs got fed twice the other night because she forgot mom had already fed them (she was in the room when they ate the first time and definitely saw), things like that. she's also been kind of mean to my mother lately, and the other day, she accused us of throwing some of her cups away. that also isn't like her, but she and my mother have fought before, she brought it up to me earlier. someone with alzheimer's happened to come up in conversation, and she made a comment about how she knows she's going to end up like that someday, she just doesn't know when. it's worth mentioning that she knows a good bit about alzheimer's. she was a psychiatric nurse for awhile, and both her mother and her husband had it before they passed, and she was their caretaker. she also said that she knows my aunt thinks she's having memory problems, but she doesn't think they're that bad yet. i asked her gently if she's seen a doctor about it, and she said no, she didn't think it was necessary. i suggested that it might be a good idea, because maybe she just needs to use oxygen for her copd more often or something similar. she just said that she doesn't think she's out to lunch yet, and that it isn't that big of a deal yet. i wasn't sure what to say and i agreed. i figure that it's still kind of true because aside from maybe needing a little more guidance in her finances just to make sure everything is covered, nothing is preventing her from taking care of herself yet. but is there a best way to talk to loved ones about this? she's not the type to be afraid of talking about this kind of thing. she's been continuously making adjustments to her will to make sure everything is right just in case for the past 20 years, at least, she has already paid for her funeral and picked everything out (except for the flowers, because she doesn't know what season she'll pass in), toured several nursing homes for herself as well as papa, and let us know which one she'd like to be in if it was impossible for her to stay at home, etc."," it‚Äôs great that she has been so thoughtful about planning the future and having her adult kids help with bank accounts and finances. this is rare. many patients live in denial. but you need to harness one of these conversations she brings up about planning in case she needs more help in the future. eventually, she will never talk about it willingly again.if you/family haven‚Äôt got durable poa (if in the us) you must get that done. poa must be signed while one is still ‚Äúof sound mind‚Äù so by the time you need it, it‚Äôs too late to acquire. i do not advise saying ‚Äúthe time when you need more help is now‚Äù.  continue with the ‚Äúin case you got hit by a bus tomorrow‚Äù line of thinking. paranoia is common as the disease progresses. many patients do not see their own symptoms and they believe that when other people tell them they have dementia, that they are being gaslit and duped to get their money stolen etc. so this obviously conflicts with signing papers such as poa. if you do explain mention that she will get home care aides or move to a nursing home because she needs help, i advise focusing on any physical ailments she has, or prevention against risk of injury. not the memory problems.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/toc93u/talking_to_loved_one_about_the_memory_problems/,Talking to loved one about the memory problems

"sorry this could get long. mostly a vent.first post here. my mom is showing signs of dementia. she has been for a year or two now. she remembers who we are, who she is, her past, even her bank account numbers and things that have been the same for several years. but she often forgets where she is, how long she's lived in her apartment, the day/year, current events. she has an appointment with her doctor soon to discuss everything and seek help.yesterday i became exponentially worried. she fell for a computer scammer. i had to leave work early to come help her reset all of her passwords and call her banks to make sure nothing was compromised. i spent six hours there in total, and tried my best to drill it into her the steps to take to avoid it. we agreed that leaving notes above her computer was a good idea so that she'd see them warning her and be able to stop it in its tracks if it happened again.well, today, not even 24 hours later, she did it again. she called me crying because she doesn't want me to remove her computer. she self isolates due to depression and doesn't have contact with the outside. she orders all her clothing and groceries on her computer and phone, but i would rather take them away than risk her losing what little financial independence she has left.she lives in independent living right now and if she would just leave her room she'd be able to have church service, watch movies, have dinner, play games and more all in the same building! but she hasn't left in over two years because she's depressed, so instead she non stop orders things online and is living almost like a hoarder (not unsanitary though), and now falling victim to scammers left and right.this isn't the first worrisome thing. a few weeks ago my husband, son, and i went to visit as a surprise and came into a smokey apartment because she'd left a pie in the over for who knows how long and it was black and burning in the oven. she had no idea because she forgot she put it in there and couldnt smell the burning or see the smoke. if we didn't show up she might have started a fire and the worst could have happened.she's fought us left and right about taking away any iota of freedom. she's physically capable of caring for herself, she can bathe etc. but she gets confused and forgets extremely important things from one second to the next and even today she told me she doesn't know how to protect her from herself.i don't know what to do. i'm barely 28, just got a good job, my son is under 10, i'm trying to go back to school and i'm so tired and overwhelmed. i don't know how to help her. i didn't sign up for this. not to mention, the first 17 years of my life i had to watch my dad suffer through parkinson's before he passed away at 81, so i know the horrors that can come next. now it feels extra traumatic watching the only parent i really had with me during my whole life going through the early phases of memory loss too.i've looked into memory care but i don't know if we could afford it, especially since she's still somewhat independent physically. we want to buy a house in the next year or two and have a special ada suite added on for her so we can care for her and also utilize her ltc insurance to help. we don't want to just put her somewhere and let her rot away, we love her and are scared for her and just want the best.yes i was raised by my grandparents and no the rest of our family isn't in the picture. it's just me, my husband, and my son. we don't have any other support or resources. thanks for letting me vent.tldr my mom is showing signs of dementia and is at risk of being scammed and i'm too young to be prepared to handle this and it all makes me very sad and scared and i don't know what to do."," you mention that she is in independent living, and that you can't afford memory care.  is there an in-between level that might work, such as assisted living?also, if you are going to take on this responsibility, you absolutely must have a power of attorney (poa) signed right now.  she cannot grant it if she is incompetent.  so if she gets worse, you would have to go to court to get it, even if she were willing and not opposing it.  if she refuses to give you poa, then you should seriously think about stepping away.  i am in that situation personally, and it is an unbelievable nightmare.  there is nothing like being screamed at and accused of stealing by the person who is currently taking up all of your life with their needs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tndzi9/im_only_28_mom_is_80_im_overwhelmed/,"I'm only 28, mom is 80, I'm overwhelmed"

(meanwhile he was kicking us out a few hours before). it definitely hurt that he didn‚Äôt remember me, i think it may have clicked as i was out the door as he gave me a cheerful wave. this has never happened before and i can‚Äôt help to think these are subconscious thoughts‚Ä¶ (don‚Äôt want that to sound empathetic i just kills me to hear that from my previously loving grandpa) but then again i haven‚Äôt been around him for an extended period of time in about three years. i wish i could understand where the rotten words were coming from‚Ä¶ or if he‚Äôs at the ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù stage he thinks all of this because he can‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶ anyone have any insights?"," i hear you. my dad was the gentlest person i'd ever known. never raised his voice to anyone, much less raised a hand. the dementia turned him into a violent, psychotic maniac. he raged. he threatened and attacked us. he ranted about the most over-the-top insane conspiracy-theory type stuff. just so, so far removed from the person i used to know, it was impossible to reconcile. and sometimes, like you, i wondered: was this what my dad was always like, and just hid it, or are our core personalities so fragile that a little swiss-cheese-brain can turn us into different people entirely? neither idea is pleasant to contemplate. i just try to tell myself that it was the dementia talking, not my dad - basically, it killed my dad before he was dead, and the person who did and said all of those terrible, scary things was not him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tnbzhi/dementia_turned_my_loving_grandpa_into_a_rotten/,Dementia turned my loving grandpa into a rotten rude evil monster
"i'm hoping someone else out there has some experience with this. i placed my mom with (i'm guessing) about stage five/six alzheimer's in an assisted living facility back in september. in december, they moved her into memory care. in the six months that she's lived there, they've sent her to the emergency room in the middle of the night three times. for reasons that don't seem medically necessary:visit one: the facility staff said that she was wandering and they were afraid she was going to wander out of the building. (this was before the move to the locked memory care unit.)visit two: she was found in another resident's room without clothes on. they actually didn't even tell me she was sent to the er. i got a notification from the hospital's patient portal app. the facility refused to speak with me to explain what happened for about 24 hours. when i finally got a hold of someone, they claimed that she got aggressive when they tried to remove her from the other resident's room, and that's what triggered the er visit. (turns out, she had a uti.)visit three: this one happened tonight. there's a stomach bug going around the facility. my mom was sick and threw up. supposedly, my mom asked about going to the hospital. i talked to the head nurse, and we decided mom would not go to the er. (if she was still stick tomorrow, i'd take her to urgent care.) less than two hours later, i get a notification from the patient portal app indicating that my mom's in the er. then the facility night shift med tech called me after that. i'll admit, i went off on them a little bit. the first med tech i talked to claimed that my mom was threatening to hit herself, and that's why they sent her. the second med tech said nothing about behavioral issues and said they just sent her because she was sick and that they sent all the sick residents with the stomach bug to the er. she also said that if my mom says she wants to go to the hospital -- despite having alzheimer's and me saying no -- they have to send her.from the early test results, seems like she has a uti now too.is this normal? do other memory care facilities frequently send residents to the er for reasons that are not medical emergencies?the facility she's in is private pay. but these hospital bills are starting to add up. i just got the bill for the ambulance ride from visit two. it's $700! plus all the tests and x-rays and whatnot. each visit probably costs more than $1,000 even after insurance. we just can't do this every other month. maybe it's cruel to even be mentioning money, but i just don't know how long she'll need care and don't want to burn through her savings.and sending a woman with alzheimer's to the er all by herself seems cruel. on top of this, after the first two er visits, i noticed a drop in cognition that she never quite 100% recovered from.this is supposedly the best facility in the area. and i'm worried and angry, but also afraid that my being difficult will end up getting my mom labeled a problem resident or something. does anyone have any advice??"," (i'm in the u.s., so my response is based on what's typical here.) after they make the call for the ambulance, they should be calling the healthcare poa (you, i presume) to inform you of the situation. then you can drive to the hospital and meet her there so she won't be alone.  this is one major reason the healthcare poa should live close to the patient. behavior changes that turn out to be utis are a very common reason for mc patients to wind up in the er.  and it's not uncommon for it to happen repeatedly. unless she's on hospice, and you have written agreements with the facility that she is never to be sent to the hospital, then they have a responsibility to send her to the er if they feel it's warranted.  there are liability issues here.do they do uti testing (including culture) at the facility? if it's positive, can they quickly get her the appropriate antibiotics (specific to what shows on the culture) prescribed and filled by using their in-house md?  if the answer to either of the questions is no, then the er visit is definitely warranted. you might interview some skilled nursing facilities (rather than non-nursing memory care facilities) to see how they would handle behavior changes/suspected uti.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tnbc5l/memory_care_keeps_sending_mom_to_the_er_in_the/,Memory Care Keeps Sending Mom to the ER in the Middle of the Night.

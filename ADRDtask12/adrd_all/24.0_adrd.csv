"something i'm wondering about lately.  as mum's condition has got worse it's fairly common for her to be convinced she's not at home towards the end of the day.   when trying to talk to her about it she's not really coherent but often talks about when ""they"" will let her go home and she seems to think there's other people around who will steal her things and mess things up when it's only the 2 of us in the house.mum has always has a certain amount of irrational paranoia, albeit minor enough that she led a normal life.  so now, while i know this kind of behaviour is fairly typical for alzheimers i'm wondering if it could be an underlying psyche issue being magnified?  admittedly, it's probably a long shot on my part, just hoping it might be treatable, but does it sound feasible?"," my mom says the same exact things. she was at home with my dad yesterday when i asked her how she was doing. and she always says the same things...

"hi  everyone, my name is aya and i'm writing this message from kazakhstan. my grandma is 84 years old, for around 4 years she is suffering from, what i believe alzheimers. doctors in our country don't give that diagnosis, however all symptoms present. she wasn't living with us, but now she is with us. there are no medical centers or special care houses are present. now, our life is like hell. everyday she wakes up and says that she wants to go to her home, but there is no home of hers. she says that she lost this and that, she imagines that she lost her staff. sometimes she is super aggressive. to be honest, we don't know how to deal with that.  my parents are super nervous, they don't understand why she is acting like that. they argue everyday.please, help me. what should i do? i''m more concerned about my parents mental state. are there are some useful techniques for dealing with the things i described above? any medications? thanks a lot", my grandma has the same issue. what works with me is taking her on a small walk around the neighborhood. she recognizes the outside of our house but not the inside so it helps. it also helps to keep her distracted with solitaire or watching tv shows she really likes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/g8b2vp/i_need_some_help/,I need some help

"we were all set to move my mom from our house into independent living on march 14th. then the virus hit and we decided it wasn't safe for her to be moving in at a time like this. she is driving us crazy and we need to get her out asap. it sucks not knowing when this thing will be over, or at least to a point where it will be safe to move her into the new place. in addition to the obvious difficulties that come with caregiving, we've learned the hard way that she's just a bad roommate. she's a complete slob who never contributes to any cleaning, cooking, or any housework. my husband and i work full-time, and she's retired, so quite a bit of resentment has been building up for the past year of her living with us. we've tried talking to her about it to get her to start contributing more, but it doesn't work. she has a million questions about how to clean anything (why hasn't she learned this skill by now?), and then the bathroom will somehow wind up dirtier than before she ""cleaned"". when we try to gently give her feedback about this, she becomes overly sensitive and pouts. i can't win.she's also really bad about personal hygiene. she is not in the habit of washing her hands. ever. even after using the bathroom. we're worried about this because we have a baby on the way and babies have very sensitive immune systems when they're first born. how has she not developed this habit by now? and good luck getting her to learn new things at this point. we've resorted to hanging a sign in all the bathrooms in the house that says, ""wash your hands"", which seems to be working ok for the bathroom, but what about in other areas of the house? there's not a great place to hang a sign in the kitchen that she'll be guaranteed to see. so this means we have to be compulsive about cleaning in the kitchen. we can never leave dirty dishes in the sink, all counters need to be clean at all times, etc. it causes so much extra stress and anxiety. i'm about ready to just move her into the facility regardless of the risk. i just don't know how much more of this i can take."," id also just point out that since you both work full time, your just as likely to bring it home to her, if not more likely than putting her into an assisted living facility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/fusyh6/had_to_delay_moms_move_into_independent_living/,Had to delay Mom's move into independent living due to Covid
"so. everything is falling apart currently, and was even before the covid-19. i am 99.99% sure my husband has alzheimers. he refuses to go to a doctor for a ""checkup"" and i don't know how to bring it up with him in a straightforward way because it is his greatest fear and i am terrified. he has in the past always said if he gets alzheimers he will kill himself.his father died of alzheimers and his older brother is about 4 years into alzheimers. about 8 months ago he retired and was home full-time with me. i work from home and have a disability, i am much younger than he is. i'm in my mid thirties. we have a 4 year old child with some sort of emotional/sensory issue we are currently getting a diagnosis for. after he retired i thought he was entering a depression, which i know is common when retiring. at first i made sure to force him out and about with me, window shopping or to a restaurant for lunch, hiking, etc. but then over the next few months i started noticing things. here's a general list, every day he does maybe 5-10 things that are abnormal:- forgets the bank cards- forgets the pin numbers for them. sometimes he calls me three times in a row at the store at the cash register and i tell him the pin each time before he can get it right. same pin he's used forever.- gets confused where familiar stores are- gets lost in parking lots finding the car even if it is close to the door- can't solve a problem/find a solution to simple things- is doing the dishes differently, had never done them that way in 6 years.- suddenly can't see well, eye exam says his eyes are fine- can hear but not understand what is being said. i have to repeat slowly every time.- hangs up laundry in the wrong spots, i find my clothes in our daughters room, i find my clothes in strange places, he hangs up pajamas with shirts- leaves cupboard doors open- does odd things when cooking, almost caught the stove on fire one day when he put a pan filled with oil in the oven. takes him 45 minutes to coom scrambled eggs and makes mistakes. i have to supervise cooking now.- doesn't flush the toilet, leaves the door open, pees around the bathroom floor and doesn't seem to notice- unable to put any visual artwork or puzzle type things together even when just shown how (as in shown the exact piece and where)- gets very irritable especially in the evenings, can't handle any noise/activity- says he is going to go do something in the house yet 15 minutes later is elsewhere and i have to remind him he was going to do that thing- can't notice if i am in distress due to my disability and need help, i can be literally sitting beside him and pushing him for help, he has no idea. he gets sucked into the tv and is unaware of everything else going on.- makes strange decisions. for example we had an important appointment over skype with someone. he then sits on the floor like a child staring at the screen as if that is normal and i have to tell him to come sit in a chair. - i can give him specific step-by-step instructions or a list with detailed easy instructions and he gets very confused and needs help the entire time.- puts things in the wrong places (kitchen, etc)- leaves things all over the place and doesn't notice them after. i have to go around picking everything up.- mistook a strange child as a relativeanyway a lot of other things.with my daughter home and him home i am at a loss and frankly near a breaking point. someone please give me input/advice."," perhaps an appeal to his practical side might help? maybe you could acknowledge to your husband that this is super scary but you and your daughter need to know what the plan is for the future. alzheimer's isn't going to stop just because you're afraid to get a diagnoses (and maybe it's something else, so let's figure that out too). let's get this figured out so we know how to plan for the future. not sure if this will work, but just a thought. an appeal to helping his daughter might be useful.  side note: check out teepa snow on youtube. she's an educator for alzheimer's/dementia and is really great at explaining the disease and why patients act the way they do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/fu1g49/i_need_to_ask_for_help_figuring_this_all_out/,I need to ask for help figuring this all out.

hi! i don't see much on reddit about the coins for alzheimers research trust. i'm looking to make a \~1.5k donation to an alzheimer's charity and i like this one because its mission to fund research resonates with me. i mostly see people talking about alzheimer's association though.. thoughts?," i think its likely legit. it appears to be an activity of the rotarians, which off the top of my head, i recognize as a well known international community service org (like kiwanis or lions club international). also i remember reading something in a nih plan last year that they planned to use community service groups like both rotarians and alzheimer's association to expand community involvement or something: i don't know if cart is a result of that tho. they are a 501 3(c) so they are a legit registered non profit (as opposed to randos asking for money. their status as a 501 3c also means (in past years anyway, you should always double check current tax laws) that a donation of $200 or more can count towards itemized deductions. but some 501 3c orgs can be ""bad,"" as in the ceos pay themselves a lot or use money to throw parties. so...you can use sites like charitynavigator to evaluate from a third party if you like how they operate. i dont know how reputable these sites themselves are, but its something.  rotarians scores wellcart is unscored.alzheimer's association also supports research (  )and i heard they are the second largest contributor to alzheimer's research, after the nih itself (i used to volunteer for them though so maybe my info is tainted lol). my understanding, just from conversations, is that alz assoc might be more likely to fund ""cutting edge"" or less mainstream avenues of research than the nih.in research in general, there can be trends, and ""popular"" ways of thinking that aren't always right, but are mainstream, so they get funded, while research based on less trendy thought won't get funded.  i think there's even been some news recently about how stubborn refusal to stray from established/popular models of thinking of the disease and treatment targets has delayed or resulted in slowdowns in progress. so, i guess alzheimer's association would be more likely to fund research that would hit a wall because of that kind of institutional inflexibility. thats just my informal understanding though. here is their charitynavigator: they don't score as high.. but their activities are also probably broader. alzheimer's assoc also does stuff like making legislation thats more alzheimer's friendly, community support, stuff like that. anyway probably both are legit, just depends how you want your money to be spent. hope this helps! if you give enough, dont forget to count it to your deduction next year :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/fr98ud/is_the_cart_fund_legit/,Is the CART fund legit?

"my grandmother was diagnosed about 2 years ago. it's hard to get any solid information from her or my grandfather - she's very solidly in denial that she even has alzheimer's (but is excited that she's a part of the biogen trial that's starting back up?), and my grandad isn't great with the medical jargon. he's her primary caretaker, as they still live on their own in fl. i'm mostly seeking advice about how to deal with confrontation with my grandmother over the phone. i try to talk to her 3-4 times a week, and usually she's good. she refuses to talk about her diagnosis with me, and tells me she's fine, it's not for me to worry about, it's just a 'mild cognitive impairment', etc. since i can usually get a separate report on how things are from my grandad, i don't press too much. but her behavior has been increasingly erratic, which brings us to the other day. i had tried to call the night before, and didn't get in touch. my grandmother called back the next day, and i didn't get a chance to pick up until the third call (at about 10:30 am). we had a decent conversation for about half an hour, and then we hung up. she called again about an hour later, then another hour later, and again almost immediately after. she also texted my email address several times. she left a voicemail each time, and none of them were urgent, just repeating the same things we'd talked about earlier. i finally answered her 7th call that evening, and i was pretty short with her, admittedly. when she asked why i sounded stressed, i explained i'd been having trouble finding groceries for the family and that's why i hadn't answered all her calls that day. i guess the way i said it triggered her, and she turned really nasty, that she wouldn't bother me anymore if she was such a burden. she later called me one final time that night, which i answered, and basically said that she wouldn't be bothering me again and have a nice life. this all hurts, and i know it's not her. she basically raised me from ages 7-13 and while she's not a perfect person (honestly, this has just exacerbated all her worst traits), i love her dearly. my concern is less the single conversation, but more how to handle this going forward, because i expect this will happen again. the last time i saw her in person, we had a huge fight where she said a lot of hurtful things, only to act like everything was fine the next day. i want to keep up the phone conversations (but not 10x a day) since my grandad says it helps keep her in a good mood, but it's getting harder to carry a conversation with her and if me sounding stressed is going to trigger a fight, i'm screwed. this turned into a vent but i appreciate any advice you folks have."," a general tip that worked in my experience is don't mention previous behavior. if she asks the same question 15 times dont point it out. don't mention that she's called you 10 times that day. they probably don't remember it and it just reminds them of their condition. also try no to correct them, it does the same thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/fksylh/how_to_handle_the_negative_interactions_from_a/,How to handle the negative interactions from a distance?

"hey guys, i’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but i am desperatei’m doing a research paper on drugs used to help reduce symptoms of alzheimer’s. i’ll be talking about donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. i have done countless hours of research but i seem to come up empty when trying to determine how these drugs actually differ from each other. i want to know the science behind these drugs and what exactly they do within your body. if anybody can helps or knows of a website that can help that would be great. any help is appreciated!"," howdy, so donepezil first.donepezil  works by halting the production of  acetylcholinesterase, which are a  component of neurotransmission, they work by breaking apart the  neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is vital for the transmission of  nerve impulses.halting  cholinesterases inhibits hydroalysis of acetylcholine causing it to  build up around  cholinergic synapses, which are synapses in the brain  that use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter and the increased amount of  acetylcholine is thought to improve mental function by a small amount.its  precise action in treatment of alzhimers is not very well understood.  but the increased amount of  acetylcholine at colinergic synapses it is  thought to compensate slightly for the loss of other cholinergic  synapses due to the degenerative nature of ad, in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, in early stages of the  disease. leading to slightly increased mental ability for a period of  time.donepezil is used in combination with another medication called memantine when prescribed for the treatment of ad.....next, galanatamine. it is an phenanthrene alkaloid.it works much in the same way as donepezil, but it **also**  binds to presynaptic nicotinic receptors and makes them more responsive  to acetylcholine.  when the presynaptic nicotinic receptors are  activated, it increases the amount of acetylcholine released.this makes galanatamine a dual-mechanism of action, in which two things are done at once.information on the method of action is also pretty limited.it is also used by the u.s army in conjunction with atropine, to combat the effects of nerve agents used in chemical warfare. it can be used in the treatment of  soman, sarin, vx, tabun and novichok. because it prevents irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition (organophosphate poisoning)&#x200b;..rivastigmine, is thought to work in the same way as donepezil. but is typically used in the treatment of mental function decline in patients with parkinsons disease.however rather than it inhibiting one or the other, it halts the production of both butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase. information is limited on the method of action for this.&#x200b;source: psyd student",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/f9w1pm/drugs_used_to_reduce_symptoms/,Drugs used to reduce symptoms

"does anyone have experience with federal long term care insurance in the us? it sounds pretty good but i don’t have a lot of experience with insurance so i really have no idea. can/will they deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions (parkinson’s, dementia)? any info you have on it or your own personal experience with it is much appreciated :)"," all i know is that it is fully underwritten, which is to say that they do ask for a health history, there is a telephone interview with an rn which includes a mini-cognitive assessment, and they do verify your health history with your primary care physician.  don’t know whether they use this info to deny, or just determine your premium. i urge everybody to consider ltc insurance. i am now caring for my second ltc-insured parent (mom died last year), and the ltc insurance is awesome. it’s the difference between staying at home with caregivers and being parked in a nursing home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nbjqq7/federal_long_term_care_insurance/,,Federal Long Term Care Insurance
"we've been living with and caring for my mother in law for three years. she's been in our care for five. we moved in when she kept falling, and could no longer remember to take her meds. she has early onset dementia, congestive heart failure, and is just a horrible person all around. but. my calling has always been caregiver, so i do what i must, and for the most part, it's not awful. i know, thanks to lurking a while, that it could be much worse. hubs's sister has seen ""grandma"" once since she's been in our care. she's impatient and despite being in town frequently, she just can't be bothered. this means no birthday cards, no christmas cards, no contact other than a monthly three minute phone call. however, on mother's day, she sent the old woman a five pound tiramisu from a swanky bakery in nj. grandma didn't even know who it was from until we saw the card. ""happy mother's day from daughter and son in law.

"hi, i've just been feeling really stressed and confused lately and i felt i needed to share with someone. i've never posted here before. i'm a 20 year old college student with a 71 year old mom who's being treated for memory loss. i don't know if i quite fit the role of caregiver yet but i'm the person my mom sees the most and the only person who really knows a decent amount about her dementia other than the doctor. my family knows vaguely, but she doesn't tell them much, and i don't want to speak out of turn to them about something so personal to her. there have been a lot of incidents building up lately that have me concerned. i come home from university to find that the dog's been limping with a harness on wrong and she hasn't noticed (there's now a bald spot), she left a pot on the stove on once and the entire kitchen was filled with smoke. another time she didn't notice the smell of gas throughout the house - she had accidentally left the gas on the stove on. she experiences a lot of the other symptoms too, and she tells me that i hate her and don't care about her and only stops saying that if i start crying. then she immediately forgets that she said it at all or why she did. i try to be there for her as much as i can, but it's hard while i'm at school, so i never know if i'm doing enough for her. we're the only ones left for each other, not including our dog; my aunt, uncle, and cousins (i was adopted so my cousins all are older and have children) live in adjacent states and we only see them sometimes. i love her so much and i cannot even imagine what she's going through, and i feel so overwhelmed and confused right now. she said last year that we might have to start looking at assisted living or retirement home options if things keep progressing like this. i have a friend who's going to think i'm a monster if we decide that's what's best, and despite what she said before, these days she tells me everything is fine, but i'm starting to really worry. i feel like i'm not smart enough or equipped to do what i'm supposed to right now. i don't even know what i should do. i love my mom so much and i want to be there for her, but i feel so lost. i also struggle with severe major depressive disorder and i feel like an awful person saying i don't know how to be enough for both of us. please send love or advice. thank you"," do you live with her? does she live alone? she might benefit by having an in-home companion while you’re not there. i would also hope her doctor would do a full work up to see if her cognitive issues are coming from a medication interaction or an infection. or even a vitamin deficiency.you’ll definitely need to involve the rest of the family, if you can. you need help. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/najx16/im_20_and_overwhelmed/,,I'm 20 and Overwhelmed
"i've taken care of my mother for 6 years. she suffers from a t.b.i. and early onset dementia symptoms. she's always been a lot. it's part of her personality. since i've started caring for her, we've grown irritable with each other. to much time together. we get short with each other and every other thing turns into a fight. i love her to death but between the arguments and my low interest social activities outside of the house, we're drifting apart. i'm looking to take some time off. maybe leave state for a few days. my biggest concern, and what really burns me out, is that i'm the only one who she talks to. over the years she's lost friends, family, and no one else in my family takes the time to listen to her. she's a lot, and doesn't have a filter, but she's human. i'm just her only outlet that she really had left. i don't even have my own outlet. it's obviously difficult to care for someone else. i just never really thought it would be so dividing. i guess i'm just sort of venting here.", traditional western medicine anti~depressants?bad advice...hes already going through he'll....that class of meds are their own to go off of......just my 2 pesos.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/n9knbu/feeling_burnt_out/,,Feeling burnt out
"i'll try to avoid putting in the same thing, how i am at my end, i can't do this anymore, the resentment has started, all of that. my dad has been told he had early-onset dementia for \~15 years now, but the symptoms didn't exactly match, so we just figured he had ""some-kind"" of dementia. after researching and finding another (again) doctor, it is believed he has ftp which is frontotemporal dementia, where the front lobe is effected first / harder rather than the sides. his actions much more greatly match that one, rather then dementia. we have been trying to get him on medicaid for a very long time now. every doctor and social worker said that we should easily qualify, based on income and all other things. finally, on our fourth medicaid attempt, we received a call and they gave us what they classified as a ""medicaid pending"" number, which i guess is supposed to prove that he will (eventually?) get it, which should allow us to find a home for him that accepts pending medicaid applications. well, i can't find any. he follows me around like a lost puppy, i can't talk freely on the phone because he is always right there. if i try to leave the room and lock a door or something, his anxiety skyrockets. i was also told that if they do take him in, they would be taking half his money, which is already either right at or right under the poverty line. i have not been able to work because he literally can't go 10 minutes on his own. despite my best efforts to make the place ""safe"", he will always find something dangerous to get into. if i take the burners off the stove, he wil put stuff in the microwave. if i unplug the toaster oven, he will flush bad things (not waste) down the toilet. he can't operate a utensil on his own, or even put his pills to his mouth. go figure, the few times he had an aid come by (i think medicare allowed 5 30minute visists, which were burned through a long time ago), he sat still and watched tv instead of constantly sitting up and down and pacing literally every dang 15 seconds. he was timely and mannered instead of constantly pulling down and up his pants. i know this isn't the case, but it almost seemed like he knew who was there and that he was purposely putting in an effort to look like his is well. the two times an uncle has come by, he sat quietly and watched tv, instead of his usual hijinks of dragging chairs around, stuffing things down his pants, and sniffling literally every 3 seconds. it's maddening, and i have come so close to just dropping him off at the big hospital in the area, but can't eat the bills (you have to pay like, 60% of the first 20 days and then 30% of the next 60 days, maybe not that exact ratio, but something like that. the money is being used to pay for utilities that have started to fall behind (but not completely sank), cats that we have had for the last 10 years, all of that stuff. a fair size amount goes to his depends, medications, and his cookies and dr. pepper that he just absolutely has to have, as he will barely eat or drink if those aren't there.  i haven't had a moment to myself, seen a friend, or done something for myself in going on...18 months now. what does everyone do? on top of all of that, i have finally got in to see a doctor for myself, and was alerted by my podiatrist that i need to come right back in because he thinks that i may have cancer on my foot and needs to biopsy and check blood for spread. i had to move two years ago because i couldn't take care of the house we had on my own, so i moved away from any friends i have, am an only child, and don't have much family. no grand parents. my uncle, his (my fathers) brother lives in florida and doesn't even call to check on him. none of the places i have found (at least, the very few i have been able to contact and actually get a hold of) either don't have memory care, don't accept medicaid, or won't due to it's pending status. all the usual stuff...my only father, but he just goes around making disaster after disaster before i can even finish cleaning the first, resentment, i might need this myself some day so do it for another while you can, all that...but, there's got to be more...right? something to help me help myself?"," i’ve had similar feelings and please know you’re not alone in feeling this way. it’s very taxing, over-demanding work with barely any gratitude shown for the persistence, patience and perseverance it takes to care for another human being. and sometimes just saying “you’re doing a hell of a good job” to yourself every morning in the mirror can give a boost of self recognition; and so deserving in that give yourself some self care and recognition in anyway you can, whenever possible. i don’t know if this will help but before i start my day, i get up a good hour before the person i’m caring for(so the day isn’t soured by what they say/do). and this hour is for me- breakfast, a shower, or just to talk to myself in the mirror about what a frickin awesome job i’m doing with this. then a good hour at the end of the night with them asleep(if that’s possible) so you can gather your thoughts or do some other necessary work. routine is a requirement. 2-is there a state program  of to pay you to-be an in home health aides/disability aide? definitely an option to consider if you’ve done it for 18 months so far. 3-if he’s following you around and wants attention(or interaction) put him to work with chores(only if you feel like doing it) or something really easy. a car ride too with music usually calms someone down, and it can be a routine activity. doesn’t have to be anywhere. just the activity of driving counts. 4-being at your wits end is not a good state of mind to stay in. i literally have to separate myself from the environment to keep myself together. support groups /community groups exist for about any sort of illness/infirmity. and if they’re good on their word they could supervise him for an hour while you get your thoughts and feelings together. or even help in other ways. it’s just a google search and the support you get can be so worth it-because- if they can be relied on it’s worth reaching out to. 5-write it down. he crapped in the living room? write it down. he drooled over the entire serving of food? write it down. writing has been a relief and a way to sort out all the micro problems i see and have to correct everyday, whether behavior/occupational/speech slp /physical therapy/etc. voice memos work too if that’s something that works for you.that’s all i have for now but i hope it helps",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/n804fc/ohio_at_the_end_of_everything_besides_life/,,"[Ohio] At the end of everything, besides life"

"my grandmother passed away this week.i helped take care of her on a daily basis for over a year, and it has been such a hard year.over the last few days i’ve had this enormous sense of relief that this chapter could finally be closed, that she would no longer be in pain and the rest of us could move on with our lives. this is what i’ve been yearning for over the last year, for her to be set free so we could be set free again. even after she passed away, and they carted her off to the white minivan for transport, i held myself together with thoughts of hope and relief given what this meant for my life. i kept myself busy, offering food and beverages to family who came out to see her body at peace.i had been feeling so much resentment towards the situation and now i could let that go.my grandpa seemed to be doing ok but i figured once the house got quiet he would probably have a hard time. well, the house being quiet affected me, too. the empty bed in the dining room, the stack of supplies we no longer need, the lack of music we no longer need to play to offer her comfort.living through the last year felt like torture and i was kicking and screaming the whole way, but i look back on it now and feel glad i could be here to care for her and to advocate for her. i was able to speak for her when she was experiencing too much pain, especially at the end.she loved us so much. her children and grandchildren were her pride and joy, we were her whole world. even though she had been suffering from dementia for at least 15 years, she would periodically ask if the kids were ok...in her mind we were still 5 years old while in reality were in our 20s and 30s.going through old pictures and videos from the past year, tears started to come. i’m devastated. i was so focused on what i could gain by closing this chapter it feels like i forgot to appreciate what i was losing. i know i did stop to appreciate what i had, but now that she’s actually gone it certainly hurts a lot.thank you to this community for all your support and for sharing your stories and experiences. this was the hardest year of my life and this sub made it better."," thank you for sharing and giving some of us insight into what lies ahead.  as hard as the day to day difficulties are in taking care of my mom, i can't imagine how it will be dealing with the loss once she's gone.  i'm sure that you were a great blessing to your grandmother this past year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/n6au1c/the_way_i_feel_at_the_end_is_unexpected/,,The way I feel at the end is unexpected
"this might be a long post, but, it’s a good place to vent. at least, that’s what i’m using this subreddit for. i’m a 25f, recently married. i’ve been with my husband for almost 9 years, but at the beginning of 2020 we moved into my maternal grandparents house to help my mom care for them... which allowed us to live together before we got married and for us to save for our own house. my grandparents (both 87), need 24/7 care. my grandmother has alzheimer’s and doesn’t know what goes on anymore. her moods are hit or miss, can be combative but also sweet, and just seems to basically be existing at this point. my grandfather is more mentally there but has a touch of dementia, and needs more help physically. his downside is that he’s the complete opposite personality as he once was; how i remember him as a kid. once was very soft spoken, considerate, and kind...but now... very sassy, grumpy, rude and bossy. makes caring for him difficult most days. as i’m sure many can relate, caregiving is hard. it’s not for sissies. many times i cry from frustration. sadness. i find it hard sometimes to keep my patience. praying for relief from my mom or sister, but finding it hard to accept help. guilt is more consuming than i wish it to be in that area. some days, i feel like a prisoner in the house. everything revolves around my grandparents. we can’t do anything as a family anymore. timing of events have to be thought out. who can watch them while i go to the store? we have a date night saturday can you come over and sit?we (my family) have cameras to keep tabs on them when we’re out in case something happens, but i find it obsessive to watch. i can’t stop. when i do have a break, it’s hard to give my mind a break as well. it’s all consuming. i don’t feel like a normal 25 year old newlywed. though, i volunteered for this “life” - to help my mom (who was pretty much burnt out) - it’s taken a lot out of me. stress is beyond what it should. my marriage/relationship sometimes suffers (but i have a very supportive husband). the guilt i feel when “passing off duties” is unmeasurable. the difficulties when caring for someone with alzheimer’s gets worse by the day. it’s all just.... a lot. i don’t know the point of this post other than just venting how i feel to complete strangers. strangers who also just happen to know what it’s like. i have a great family; support system. but does anyone else just feel immense guilt when asking for a break or time for yourself? taking care of my grandparents is rewarding but oh so hard. especially when it’s such an unappreciative role. i am yelled at, hit, argued with.... not all the time, but most. how do you keep from growing resentful? i tell myself they are not the same as i once knew. that they are probably depressed. embarrassed. but sometimes my mind forgets. my soul gets hurt. i often wonder why they are still even here on this earth... their lives are no more. it’s a sad situation. a tough situation. and i pray for strength almost everyday.", is there a way you could bring in outside help even part time so all of you could catch a break?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/n531je/first_time_poster/,,First time poster...
"hello all, something happened today that i found to be a bit weird and i'm looking for some opinions. first let me give some details. my grandma is the only close family member i have left. she is 92 and in pretty good shape (for her age). she has mild dementia, (not alz.) and needs daily help but not 0-24 supervision. i used to live at hers for a while but now i live at a rental. i call almost every day and visit her 3-4 days a week. i buy her food and stuff from the store. she has caregivers that are free for her because of a kind of support she has. mon-fri someone is here 10am-12, then then usually the lady in my story comes from 4pm-8pm and on weekends it's only the lady, like 2pm-8pm. she wears a button on her wrist that is connected to a box and on that she can could call for help any time. this level of supervision has always been enough so far luckily.let me say i don't know about the laws of caregiving for old people around the world, i'm from middle-europe and i'm not even sure how they work here. but i never fully trusted these people doing the caregiving and especially this lady seems to be egoistic and a bit shady sometimes. you know, the kind of people you talk to and seem kind but give a feeling that they aren't completely trustworthy. her bosses are in the same category. they are from a company hired by a foundation that deals with the type of support my grandma gets. they seem ok dealing with the daily works but i always had a feeling about this woman that she seemed a bit shady along with the entire company she works for... and i heard stories about caregivers trying to get what old people have... i don't know how and what, the flat is under my ownership (couldn't sell it in her life even if i wanted to, just own it) so it's her money that could people want somehow but the whole thing might just be my paranoia.... or just wanting to get her under guardianship since they have already tried this before but didn't succeed. she also made a fuss recently about not liking me getting into the arranging of grandma's medical stuff whenever i feel like it and either she deals with it 100% or gives it up and i have to deal with it 100%. i'm a bit short tempered and she got upset and we fought about this for like 2 hours (she didn't seem to understand that i didn't want to offend her and i had no intention of taking over grandma's medical stuff, just decided to call the doctor for the prescriptipons on an impulse) and after this i decided to avoid her from now on and only talk to her on the phone since i don't really like her personality.so grandma had to go to a new doctor today since her old neurologist resigned and the memory-psychiatrist she belongs to haven't seen her before due to the pandemic. but now she got both shots and the doctor refused to prescribe her meds any more without seeing her at least once. caregiver also said she should definetly go and today they went. the time wasn't good to me so i didn't go despite that i would have loved to be there in person.  i called her after and they said everything was ok, her condition is ok still, took one of her pills away and she might not need to go again in the lack of a new problem. the caregiver then told me she came earlier today and so will leave earlier too, so i decided to also visit grandma today and got on a bus. when i got here i wanted to sit on a bench and smoke a cigarette still before i came up and that's when i noticed the caregiver lady across the street a few meters from the house holding a piece of paper and talking to the phone to someone (her boss, i assume). i think she didn't notice me so i tried to hear some of what she was talking about since i was pretty sure she was holding grandma's results from today and telling her boss about it. but of course when i crossed the street a bit further up and stood in the cover of a pillar, before i could have heared anything, she started to head home (i still think she didn't see me). i didn't want to follow her so i came up and was sure her result wasn't going to be here. she took one already before and said that was so she could call them for the meds (and got the appiontment then). but now all her meds are prescribed and still she took the paper. i called her to be sure and she acted like she left it in her bag and took it by accident and will return it next day. but i'm 99% sure she was acting and took it on purpose and i'm also pretty sure that's what she was holding and talking about to someome when i saw her by accident. regardless i said ""ok, i'll read it another day then"". is this normal or am i rightfully afraid that there is something shady going on? is there anyone she's allowed to tell the results to? don't know what's their agenda could be but something about this unsettles me. maybe it's nothing but these people weren't the most trustworthy people anyways and i know there is a lots of shady stuff in the caregiver-business so i'm not sure what to think.sorry for long text and thank you for your replies!"," if you’re in the us, maybe try calling the local office for aging and disability and ask them for guidance. do you know what kind of hipaa agreement was signed for your grandma to get this care?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/n4ts6x/why_was_the_caregiver_reading_my_grandmas_results/,,Why was the caregiver reading my Grandma's results to someone on her phone?

"hi, i’m not sure where to post, really.  my (41f) grandmother is 95 and we have always been very close.  my uncle has a mother in law suite and had her move in with him about 10 years ago, which was awesome because they both had plenty of space &amp; did their own thing.  i live out of state &amp; visit 1-2x a year &amp; call weekly.  always been super independent, but after 90 she started to decline, understandably.  fast forward to march of this year and she fell a couple of times/is now bedridden with increasing dementia &amp; needs 24hr care.  her staff is amazing, and one lady encouraged me to visit sooner than later in the summer.  so i flew over that weekend and was taken aback by how she’s doing.  i asked her workers to let me help them bc i’m family and god knows my grandma has always helped people in her life.  but i can’t get the changing adult diapers, especially out of my head.  she is so tired and wants to sleep, but obviously staying clean and dry are essential when she’s forced to lie on her back 24/7.  it hurt her and she kept crying out for jesus to help her.  i was right there, and these women were all being as gentle as possible, but she’s getting spots on her bottom that are incredibly painful and she has no choice but to lay there and comply all day every day.  it hurts my soul, and i have literally been praying for her to pass so she’s not stuck in this miserable life anymore.  i was with my mom (her daughter) when she was removed from life support, and the visit is bringing some of that back.  the thing is mom was so clear that she never wanted to be unable to care for herself and once that was confirmed by doctors i had no choice but to honor her wishes.  my grandma doesn’t have that option and it kills me.  i have started calling daily, but find myself at a loss for words.  what do i say??  our old conversations fall flat.  “what are you doing/is the weather nice/what’s been going on?” .  she told me years ago that after our papaw died she made up her mind to stay around for us grandkids.  tonight i asked her how she’s feeling and she sounded dejected, half lucid.  “you know, i lay here and look at this celing and fan.”  i don’t know how to pretend like everything is ok anymore.  everybody tries to be cheerful but i want to tell her it’s ok to let go.  please let go.  sorry this is so long.  i’m just heartbroken and hate being so awkward now.  also, to you caregivers—i used to do personal care services for adults and kids with dd.  this experience was so eye opening as far as the physical and mental work you all do.  sending you all a lot of love."," >hi, i’m not sure where to post, really.  my (41f) grandmother is 95 and we have always been very close.  my uncle has a mother in law suite and had her move in with him about 10 years ago, which was awesome because they both had plenty of space & did their own thing.  i live out of state & visit 1-2x a year & call weekly.  always been super independent, but after 90 she started to decline, understandably.  fast forward to march of this year and she fell a couple of times/is now bedridden with increasing dementia & needs 24hr care.  her staff is amazing, and one lady encouraged me to visit sooner than later in the summer.&nbsp;> so i flew over that weekend and was taken aback by how she’s doing.  i asked her workers to let me help them bc i’m family and god knows my grandma has always helped people in her life.  but i can’t get the changing adult diapers, especially out of my head.  she is so tired and wants to sleep, but obviously staying clean and dry are essential when she’s forced to lie on her back 24/7.  it hurt her and she kept crying out for jesus to help her.  i was right there, and these women were all being as gentle as possible, but she’s getting spots on her bottom that are incredibly painful and she has no choice but to lay there and comply all day every day.&nbsp;> it hurts my soul, and i have literally been praying for her to pass so she’s not stuck in this miserable life anymore.  i was with my mom (her daughter) when she was removed from life support, and the visit is bringing some of that back.  the thing is mom was so clear that she never wanted to be unable to care for herself and once that was confirmed by doctors i had no choice but to honor her wishes.  my grandma doesn’t have that option and it kills me.  i have started calling daily, but find myself at a loss for words.  what do i say??

"my 80 year old father has dementia and while it's not super terrible, it's getting pretty bad. i'm having to pay all his bills for him and have him just sign the checks, and that's been okay for a while but now he's forgetting how to sign his name. i'm not on any of his accounts so it's getting a bit scary as once he slips beyond a certain point we'll both be kinda screwed. he's always been very proud and private. no one ever knew how he was doing financially as he never talked about money, not even his income. i'm the first person to ever have access to his checking account via online banking. he doesn't like people messing with his stuff. he won't pay bills online as he doesn't trust it, etc. he also doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with him. not when he forgets my name, or how to make his signature, or how to turn off the stove. not when he can't remember how to turn on the tv, or where the shampoo is in the shower, or how to put on underwear. i really need to get a poa from him before it's too late because i heard getting guardianship is a much longer/harder process. i'm just worried he'll shoot it down the second the request leaves my mouth due to his pride, independence, privacy, and denial. anyone have any success in getting a poa from a loved one in this situation? any tips for me on how to approach it with him?", i'm fortunate. my mother didn't have a problem with signing the poa and the advanced medical directive. our attorney did tell us something interesting. he said that the poa covers personal affairs but not medical affairs. he had us sign a separate advanced directive so i could be the person to make medical decisions if she could not.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mz0p9z/any_tips_on_getting_a_poa_from_a_stubborn_parent/,,Any tips on getting a POA from a stubborn parent with dementia that won't admit how bad it is?

"content warnings: death threats, verbal/physical abusei understand the concept of maintaining personal boundaries to prevent burnout and such, but i get stuck sometimes on what words to use. my current patient is physically and verbally abusive, and although i’m able to keep both of us safe (she is a fall risk patient, and not physically strong enough to do a lot of damage with her violence), and i have therapy and am strict about keeping my personal days free to recharge etc., but i have twelve hour shifts and this woman seemingly has a bottomless well of energy and it just wears on me.it’s constantly (and i mean constantly. 30 seconds of silence seems to be the max.) things like: “no coughing/sneezing/yawning!” or “stop that!!” for coughs, sneeze, yawn, stretch, etc.“don’t break any of my things!” “mind you don’t get your dirty hands on anything!” “take it easy! you’re going to break everything.” “did you steal any of my nice things?” while i’m putting away dishes, folding laundry, etc.“you poisoned me!” when i give her food or water or medicine.“you’re too fat, don’t break my furniture!” (lol)“hussy/damned fool/idiot girl/etc etc etc” (i do appreciate feeling like i’m in a noir film but still. it starts to sting a bit.)“you can’t do anything right, i have to order you around.” “you’re good for nothing.” “nobody loves you.” “nobody wants you here.” “i wish someone would kill you.” “i will burn your house down with you in it.” etc etc etc etc you get the gist.anyway. that’s the verbal stuff and my main responses are to distract, agree when possible, and be silent when those won’t work. like, seriously, how do you even respond to a disoriented dementia patient saying “i wish someone would kill you.” ???? so i say things like, “i’ll be careful, i’m just putting away laundry!” and “........you have six kids, right? that must have been quite a houseful! what was it like?” and for the physical, i mainly follow her around while she’s on a rampage to make sure she doesn’t fall while she looks for pictures to throw off the walls and such, but i do need to keep her from her husband because she will be violent towards him if they are in the same room while she’s upset, and i also feel like i ought to sometimes say something when she’s violent towards me if just for the sake of my own sanity.i say things like “i really need you to stay sitting on the couch with me right now because i’m worried you’re going to fall!” and “[name] you may not hit me/throw things at me/spit at me/etc.” but both do very little. she is on as much xanax and mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and stuff as the doctors will give her because she’s a fall risk patient and the family doesn’t want to medicate further due to what the doctor recommends or put her in a nursing home due to covid, which is understandable. i’m on the verge of quitting, honestly. i just am out of things to say that remind me (and ideally her too) that i’m a *person,* not a well trained dog, and her emotions and such do not come above mine as long as she is physically safe and has the minimum of emotional support that i can manage without burning out.i feel like i need to put affirmations up or something. idk. any suggestions???? screaming to the void here 😁 (also for the record the family is extremely supportive and pays well, and do what they can, but these situations are always difficult, of course.)"," tough situation. i’ve resorted to responding to my mom with ‘i love you, too’ when the dementia does the talking. can you find a phrase to respond? like ‘bless your heart’ or ‘always here to help you’ that may cause her to pause and reset. negative behaviors may increase with anxiety. reassure that you are there to help her. be sure your voice conveys patiencedo you have the ability to change the environment? background music might mask some unnecessary comments and could also create a positive mood. increase lighting to decrease shadows and offset gloomy daysabove all else continue to state boundaries to ensure your safety and remind yourself it’s the dementia talking",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mw8r0x/what_are_some_words_you_use_to_reinforce_personal/,,What are some words you use to reinforce personal boundaries with difficult dementia patients?

"my boyfriend and i moved in with my grandparents in january of this year because my grandma was having excruciating leg pain and needed help. well, the same week we moved in, she was admitted to the hospital and they diagnosed her with leukemia. she went to the closest treatment center for a week or so and then came back home. once she was home, it was incredibly difficult. she was still in so much pain, and now she had to go to more appointments to try and figure it out. it’s been 3 months of just trying to get through each day. her oncologists kept saying that her bone marrow results look good and that the chemo is working. she even had radiation on some lesions that were found on her leg and back, but it didn’t help the pain. well, we were able to get a break in the chemo treatments to try and fix her leg and back pain that never got better. within a week of stopping the chemo, she was so confused and hallucinating that we had to take her to the er. at first they thought it was a uti, so i was relieved and expected her to come home. but she wasn’t responding to the antibiotics, and the doctors saw spots on her in the cat scan. so now, they’ve said that the cancer has spread up and down her spine, to her liver and pancreas, even her feet and neck, and it’s untreatable. the confusion is most likely caused by the cancer spreading and her dying. she’s been in the hospital for almost a week now and has been not coherent really the whole time. we take my grandpa to visit everyday, but he just gets tired and wants to leave because she mostly sleeps. i’ve talked to him and said that she’s dying and not coming home and he kind of repeated me, but then later that day, he was asking someone when she would be home. this has all been so much harder than i anticipated. i’m just so sad that i didn’t realize she was dying and spend more time comforting her while she was still coherent. i just thought she would get better and then we could do normal things again. it’s been only three months, and i’ve gone from expecting her to die to expecting her to be okay to now trying to grasp that she really is dying. the whole three months she was really begging to go to the hospital, at least when the pain was occurring. once we got her comfortable and laying down, she would forget and be a little better but mostly just slept. i can find in my pictures and notes when it started going downhill. every time we raised concerns with her doctors, we were ignored and pushed aside. i’m so sad for her but also so relieved that she’s no longer suffering. it’s so painful, but i also know that she came home to make sure grandpa would be taken care of and i’m honored that she trusted me to do it, but i’m also terrified because he’s relied on her for years to help with everything. i have no idea how this is going to work going forward, how to best support my grandpa, or just what to do everyday now. i left this sub after i realized that she was dying, but now i remembered that i’m still caregiving for my grandpa with dementia."," sending you so much love. you are really doing a wonderful job. they would both express their gratitude to you and your boyfriend to no end, without a doubt, if they could.wishing you peace. take care of yourself as best you can xox.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mu0kxd/grandma_dying_grandpa_has_dementia/,,Grandma dying — grandpa has dementia
"*this might be a little bit of a long post, but all this has been really stressful to figure out and i'm hoping for some advice. i'm sure many people here are going through similar situations, so i appreciate the help!*i'm a 23f who was adopted by my parents when they were in their 50s. my mom just turned 73 and my dad 67. my mom's physical and mental health has slowly been declining in recent years. she hasn't left the house since 2018 and has just started using a walker. she's always been a very independent person and doesn't want any outside help (doctor, therapist, caregiver service, etc...) so my dad and i have been doing everything for her. she seems to be in some denial about her condition and keeps tell us that she's getting better. even so, her body is in a lot of pain and she frequently lashes out at us, which is especially hard since some of her pain could be eased if she'd go to a doctor. we took in my grandma with alzheimer's back when i was 16, so i definitely know the toll that care giving can take and i don't feel like i'm prepared for my parents in the slightest.a couple years ago, i promised my mom that i wouldn't move out till i got a degree and was financially stable. flash forward to the present, and i have a great full-time position in my field and am graduating with my associate's in may. i'm planning to continue with online college in july to get my bachelor's. i've been looking around for apartments to rent and was approved for a one in a great neighborhood that i can afford. the only issue is the move in date isn't till september. my friend said i could move in with her until then, but my mom wants me to stay with them for another 6 months. now i love my parents. they've been some of the most amazing people i've ever known, but my mom and i's relationship has been deteriorating fast. she deals with massive anxiety and has been getting more controlling the closer i get to moving out. some of the stuff she tells me has been really hurtful and it's getting harder for me to be around her. i know she's in a lot of pain, but i wish she wouldn't lash out so much. i feel like every time we talk it turns into an argument. even more now that she knows i'm getting ready to move out. she's been really hostile about the whole situation, says that i don't care about them, and am abandoning them. i don't intend to leave my parents to fend for themselves. i've already been making plans to still be there for them as much as i can, but my mom keeps acting like she doesn't believe me. i plan on helping them on my days off by cleaning, getting groceries, and giving my dad a break. i currently am working remotely, so i can even work from their place as needed to provide extra help. i just don't know if it's going to be enough. my dad's health isn't in the best shape either and i feel immensely guilty and selfish about the whole situation. i know when things get worse i'll eventually have to move back in, but i just want a chance to live my own life for a little bit. i really would like to move out in may, but is that selfish of me? should i stay till september?"," my mother's aunt never married, never left home, never had kids. born a virgin and died a virgin. she was a schoolteacher in an era where women worked briefly in factories before getting married. women of her class never went to college and many never finished high school. she was also pretty and friendly. she was even engaged for a number of years. why did she never marry? her mother always had a good reason why, now was nor the right time. never said, don't leave. never said, you can't marry. the time was never right.there are tons of parents like this. they never say no. they just say...not now.run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/msw8p5/wanting_to_move_out_need_advice/,,Wanting to Move Out - Need Advice

"hello everyone. thank you all for listening, being here to hear us vent and for all of the advice/comfort. i'm a very new care giver (40s m, son) and now am only about 8 months into care giving for my mom who had a stroke 2 1/2 years ago and was starting to show signs of dementia prior to said stroke.  my father was her care giver up until his passing last july.  after his death, i decided that i would quit my cozy and very good paying it job at a large law firm and move in with my mom at our family farm in rural mn.  so far things with mom have been going rather good (knock on wood), her and i have always gotten along very well and she still recognizes who i am and she is also pretty easy to care for. she can bath herself, eat, walk and carry on basic conversations on topics her brain still can remember.  she also likes the food i cook (which i never really did being single), cleaning we do and games we play.however as the months have gone on, the issues i'm having are related to our farm.  its like everything is literally falling apart each day. today it was the garage door and that issue just kind of broke me a little on the inside. their farm home is prob over 100 years old and really starting to show its age; electrical is half modern and half old/out of code wiring, concrete slabs are all cracking / breaking, sheds/barns falling apart and down, trees dying and falling.   to top it all off, they have two kitties (which are the sweetest kitties ever) and one is about 14 yrs old and requires three meds each day and a saline injection every other.i just am feeling a bit overwhelmed this week since i've been looking at everything the last few months and the amount of things that are old, broken, need fixing just keep coming and added to my list. mind you, i'm an absolute computer geek/nerd but not very well versed in maintanence or construction (i also own a condo in minneapolis and reason i own said condo is because i didn't want to have to deal w/the things i'm now having to deal with).  oh yea, i forgot that they also usually had a garden each year too and about an 2-3 acres worth of lawn to mow along with old tractors not working now and lawn mowers/weed wackers/tillers that don't start and hell i don't even know if they are diesel or gas or gas mixed w/oil let alone the starting procedures (which i can find online but..)not really looking for advice but mainly just needed to rant, get things off my chest... i seriously wish my dad would have asked or hired more people to fix these things.  he was a very independant, man of many trades and damn good at it and they did have a good savings he could have tapped into to get things fixed.  i guess i'm just a little annoyed, frustrated with dealing with it all when i know if addressed sooner than later it wouldn't be where it is now.  yes, i knew this wouldn't be easy but i didn't expect to have to deal with so many things in so many areas and get frustrated. the care giver part feels easy compared to all of the other things.today was one of my first days where i had to go out to the garage and just sit for a few mins and have a smoke. i really missed my prev life today; my modern tech filled condo that required zero work, my high paying it job that i was a rockstar at, having weekends to just sit in bed or on my couch and game.so mad props to all of you other care givers, esp those that have been doing this for years.  you are all saints, amazing people.  sorry for the long rant/vent but todays garage door problem was the straw that broke this camels back for a little bit.  i'm better now but dread what will be the next thing to break. very tempted to say fuck it and just tear down the old house and build a smaller single level 2 bedroom so i'd have one less thing to worry about.  love you all, hope your day is going better than mine and always. peace and love to the best bunch of redditors on this earth and for the work you do."," my heart goes out to you. i can definitely relate to that overwhelmed feeling, especially lately. things are quickly falling apart here too.

"so my father has parkinson’s, he was diagnosed around 13 years ago and he also now has dementia as a result of his parkinson’s. i have put my life on hold to help my mother take care of him and she has also sacrificed a lot to provide the care he needs. the last few years he has really declined and he has started to have episodes where he acts very confused, stumbles and falls, makes littles sense. i know these episodes will just get worse and longer as time goes on.the problem is, is that i am moving out at the end of the summer. i know it’s a bit selfish but i am 27 and i would like to start my own life. my mother also has to continue working full time to pay the bills. this leaves us in a predicament where there is no one to care for my father at home, except for my little brother (and it would not be fair to put this burden on him.)when my father was first diagnosed he made my mother promise that she wouldn’t put him “in a home”, but i don’t know if we’ll be able to keep that promise as much as he doesn’t want it. but even then we wouldn’t be able to afford it? what does the state do for people who have no one to care for them? just let them rot? i’m so frustrated at this point. how are people supposed to work a full time job to pay the bills and caregive full time (for free). right now it seems like we’re in a never ending hell and it’s only going to get worse as his disease progresses.what are our options? we live in utah and my father is 65. we can’t afford an in home nurse on our own.  are we just screwed? should i just resign myself to being stuck here forever?"," so sorry you're  going through this. it's  tough! yes, private  home care is expensive, even if you guys hired a live in caregiver. not to mention the stress of it all. and not that i'm aware, but there is no such thing as having a free caregiver for long hours. the most i've heard of is a couple of hours to help come in to shower the client or something of that sort, based on qualifications.  then you're on your own.  the best option, in my opinion based on what you shared, is putting him in a nursing facility or a  private homecare place. good luck to you and your mom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mkdl0e/advice_for_care_options/,,Advice for care options

"below, we’ve got a few tips on elderly care and how you can involve a beloved senior more.## 1. talk to them, even when you’re miles awayadults 60 and older in the us are more likely to live alone when compared to seniors in other countries. more elderly adults in the us are also more likely to live as a couple without children at home.it stems from the practice of leaving the home once a child reaches maturity. without anything else to focus on, seniors become lonelier. this kind of loneliness affects senior mental health.you can reduce their loneliness by visiting them and sharing your stories with them. if you can’t make a physical visit, use technology to your advantage. give them a call or a video call.a simple “how do you do” can take years off their slumped shoulders and wrinkled faces. they’ll enjoy the time you made for them, even if you talk about little things.## 2. practice elderly care by discovering new hobbies togetherdo you enjoy a certain hobby that you think an elderly person can also do? don’t stop at wondering if they can. introduce your hobby to them to see if they’ll enjoy it.one of the principles of nursing home care includes getting seniors to pursue hobbies. it opens the doors for them to socialize, make new friends, and improve their mental health. some hobbies can also improve their cardiovascular health and immunity.you can also ask if they want to pursue a passion that they couldn’t when they were younger. it’s your chance to help them explore forgotten interests. plus, it’s a great way to bond with them.## 3. exercise and stay healthy with themexercise is a key factor in maintaining good health and longevity. it can reduce your risk of developing chronic health conditions and keep you fit and healthy. you can also say the same for seniors, even if they have health conditions.among older adults, 85% have one chronic disease at least, and 60% have at least two chronic conditions. regular exercise can help them manage the symptoms of chronic disease. however, because of their age, it’s more challenging for the elderly to exercise.you can help make it easier for them by doing physical activities with them. it can be as simple as taking regular walks at the park or around a senior health care compound. even if they have mobility issues, you can find chair yoga or seated exercises for them.## 4. take a relaxing walk with themgoing to a green and quiet place with an elder family member can increase your engagement with them. it doesn’t even have to be a green place, like gardens or parks. it can be a beach, a farm side, or a national park.you can both bask in the beauty and purity of nature. reconnecting with the environment is also a great way for an elderly person to develop peace of mind. it’s good for senior mental health and yours, as well.## 5. read together to keep their brains in tiptop shapedid you know that 80% of the 5.8 million americans with alzheimer’s disease are 75 or older? like our bodies, our brains also start to give and deteriorate as we get older. you can keep an elderly friend or family member from developing dementia by reading with them.this is a good strategy in senior care, especially if you can’t exercise or go outside to take a walk. reading will improve memory, sleep, and delay cognitive decline. this is because it causes the mind to focus on something.do you want to involve socialization in book reading? organize a book club for your grandma with her friends. if your elderly dad loves reading books, have him relay its simple story to his grandkids.## 6. play games to make the most of your time with thema fun way to [care for your elderly parents]( is to play your favorite games with them. some elderly adults get quite competitive in their old age, and you can use that trait to keep them engaged. put together puzzles, play chess, answer crosswords, and more.if you like browsing the web, you may know of the gamer grandpa/grandma. you can also get your elderly family member to become one by sparking their interest in a video game. animal crossing: new horizons and the professor layton games are ideal for older adults.video games like wii sports also help improve senior health. if your elderly parents or grandparents want to try golf but can’t leave the house, get pga tour 2k21 for them. if you don’t have a console, games like wordscapes and candy crush are great mobile alternatives.## 7. give back to the community togetherdo you know of a senior who wants to do more to improve the community? is a senior in your family starting to question their existence? help them find the answer through charitable works.join local charities and organizations that have projects for older adults. elderly adults in these programs learn to create blankets, hats, or care packages. next, these crafted or assembled items will get collected and given back to the community.## give your seniors engaged and happyelderly care doesn’t have to a chore for you or the elder. use these tips to know how to keep seniors engaged and keep them active today!["," thanks for sharing! engaging seniors can be difficult but with the right steps, you can do it successfully. some of the things you can try to engage them are:  \~ spending quality time together  \~ getting to know them  \~ watch their favorite movies, shows together  \~ go out for dinner once in a while  \~ integrate their hobbies into their routine  \~ keep them virtually in touch with their family members  \~ participate in creative activities and crafts (gardening, baking, crocheting, drawing etc.)  here are some more tips to engage seniors during the holiday season.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/mf7qdp/elderly_care_101_how_to_keep_seniors_engaged/,,Elderly Care 101: How to Keep Seniors Engaged
"hi. first of all just like to say i’m so glad i found a group for care givers. okay so almost two years ago my grandmother had a stroke. after this stroke my mother took her in. so just a short back story. my grandmother has 4 kids 3 boys and 1 girl (my mother). and my grandmother has 10 grand children. my sister and i were the only grandkids raised by my grandma because my my mother was the unmarried child with almost no help when were growing up. (this information is important for later). to add 95%of the grandkids and my aunts and uncles live within less than 30 mins of my grandmother. and one of my uncles lives one street away from her as well. also none of them have young kids to take care of except two of my 10 cousins. fast forward to my mom taking my grandmother in. for an entire year my mother and i and my sister (who moved back home 10 months ago from living out of state for 15 years) and started helping my mom full time ( my sister decided not to get a job at this time since her husband can support them for now)in september of 2020 my grandmother suffered two additional strokes (so that’s 3 since sept 2019) after these last two stokes she is completely disabled where as before she was still able to walk around with minor assistance and needed minimal help with bathing , clothing etc. now she needs 99% help with everything. she can only feed herself and pick up a cup to drink. she is slowly getting dementia. at night she wakes my mother up at all hours to ask her random questions or tell her she is thirsty. which before remember i mentioned she can pick up her cup just fine. (she just like to let my mom know at 3am for some reason)as of right now my mother is the main caregiver. my sister is there from 4am to 11am and from 11am to 4pm we have a family friend who we pay.. (whereas it could be someone from our actual family; but i digress) to take care of her monday- thursday. on friday through sunday 2-3 times a month i drive down to my moms (2 hour drive there and 2 hours back) to help take care of my grandmother and give my mom some relief so she can grocery shop, get some sleep or just do any of the menial activities she wants to do for herself.my question is, are any of you experiencing that it’s just a few people wanting to pitch in to help take care of the loved one? out of all of the other 8 grandkids only 1 has come to visit her since she’s been sick this whole time. they don’t call her or even ask me about her on social media. it’s frustrating and tiresome.my sister , mother and i fear that we will be the ones to blame if she ever has to go to a nursing home because the family will resent us for it. this is the main resin why we have endured it for so long. also to add my grandmother is becoming emotionally abusive to my mom. calling her a liar and trying to make it seem like she’s not caring for her like she should. making comments like “i wouldn’t do this to you” (when my mom doesn’t coming running to her when she screams her name 20x in 2 mins for her to ask her to put her head up and down in the hospital bed)it’s really a lot and so much to explain. hope the information makes sense tldr: my mother, sister and i are solely taking care of my ill grandmother and feel stuck because other family members won’t pitch in."," sounds very similar to what happened to my grandmother. she has 13 kids (14 but one was adopted and not in much contact with the family). my mom is her oldest child and the second and third oldest children live down south (we live in nyc, so did my grandmother) while the others live upstate ny (no more than 2 hours away and they frequently come to the city to hang out and shop and such).back in '14 i believe, my grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. it was all very sudden. at first she lived alone with her boyfriend about an hour away from us. we'd visit every few weeks and my mom and i would sometimes accompany her to chemo. eventually she got too sick to live on her own so my mom took her in. at the time, my brother and i were in hs, oldest brother was working and my mom has been sick and disabled already for years. until she passed away in june '15, my mom, brothers and i were taking care of her. she spent her last 2 days in hospice. her children down south often sent money to help and would call. but the other 10 that lived a quick ride away saw her maybe twice and barely helped out at all, barely even called her. it was an extremely stressful time for us (though not one i regret, as my grandmother was one of my best friends since i was a baby). it made me feel so sad for my grandmother as well. so yeah, i get it! it's ridiculous when someone has people that could be helping but no one but a few want to pitch in! taking care of someone is a hard job and it could go smoother with just a bit of help! and then when they don't even ask about their loved one?!! it's so upsetting! ive completely cut off that family (i always tell my mom ""that's your family, not mine."") and my mom struggled with wanting to cut them all off, too. its just sad. i hope your family steps up soon!! it'll be good for those who are currently taking care of her to get small breaks and most likely good for your grandmothers mental health, seeing everyone still care for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/m541dy/big_family_lack_of_responsibility_breakdown/,,Big family + lack of responsibility = breakdown
the last 2 weeks have been very rough with my mom between her cancer progressing and the outbursts she is having with me. today she received more bad news about her cancer spreading to her hip bone area. i know she is very scared about her situation and has every right to feel that way. she is in pain and slowly losing her independence. i just can't take her mood swings and outbursts and today i reacted poorly.i called her up this evening like i do every evening and she tells me that she is not feeling well. she ate mcdonalds which did not agree with her system and pretty much sent her to the bathroom with massive cramps and such. she knows that she can't eat that stuff because it causes a lot of stomach issues for her but she did so anyway. i will spare you the icky details on that one! all i told her was to make sure she stays hydrated so she does not end up in the er again for dehydration; she was at the hospital last week for it. she started yelling at me yet again and i just could not take it and i yelled at her which is something i normally do not do but i just could not take it. i told her that i was not her punching bag and that i get she is not feeling well but that does not give her the right to treat me this way. she apologized but i felt like shit. i normally stay calm but i just lost it tonight.the last 2 weeks have been awful and i know it is going to get worse. she does not have dementia or a uti. she has been examined and is fine in that respect. she has always been this way but has gotten worse since her cancer has spread. she is becoming more volatile. yesterday i picked her up to take her to a medical appointment and while we were waiting for the elevator in her building she started banging on the elevator door because it was taking so long. i was just floored at her behavior. she has always been impatient but this was just ridiculous. it is like she is turning into a cranky child throwing tantrums. how the hell do i deal with this type of behavior? i feel so overwhelmed now., taking care of your mom makes you a good daughter. just remember that she's not yelling at you and you're not yelling at her but rather it's a frustration at her illness and the situation it has created in your lives so you may do things or say things you might not mean even if you were right to feel it.  being in pain makes otherwise rational people become irrational.  it's good that you guys can at least talk about it during calm times. perhaps you can talk to her doctors in private next time you see them to see if they have any suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/m2dx56/i_feel_like_a_bad_daughter_very_long_post/,,I feel like a bad daughter - very long post!

"hi all, was curious if anyone else had this experience. my grandmother has dementia pretty bad. she's moderately active but can't remember short term things. she's on muscle memory and is very stubborn. i bought a mobilehelp fall detection / alert button. she constantly takes the watch button off or the pendant off. she doesn't remember why she needs to keep it on and is extremely stubborn about it. i'm thinking of tying the fall pendant to her walker. i figure if she has a fall, usually the walker goes down as well and would trigger the fall alert. if not, she still has the button nearby to press (though i don't know if she'd remember to do that but better than her not having it nearby). has anybody ever had experience with this? looking for any other suggestions as well. thanks in advance for the help."," my mil did wear a help device and when she took a literal head tumble that broke her wrist, leaning over while sitting on the bed to pick something off the floor she did not use it. we figure she was afraid of getting carted off to a nursing home because she could take chances with not using her walker and doing dangerous for her stuff. it ended up costing her life as she was totally bedridden after that. home health nurses told us nothing we can do but pray with stuff like leaning over using a dust pan etc. she didn’t have a fall detection device. too bad there isn’t a discreet device they can’t detect that lets help know she fell. you can try tying it but likely it will be as good as her still pushing the button for help vs fall detection.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ll0oeu/fall_detection_pendant_tied_to_walker/,,Fall detection pendant tied to walker?

"im not sure what's the point of me writing this too. maybe just to rant or if anyone has any advice please share. i hate it. i hate that every few months there's new updates and it's always bad news.im no longer living with my parents. thankfully there's alot of social/government support for us so here's the story.my mom is 69 this year, and she has copd and high bp. she was referred to a home palliative care organization 2-3 years ago when the doctor gave a very severe/pessimistic/negative prognosis. sorry i dont know the right word  but what i know is they believed she has less than a year to live. fortunately, she'd outlived that prognosis. evidently this is a chronic condition with no chance of recovery. the only thing to do is to manage the symtoms and prevent worsening. my dad is 71 this year. generally healthy but recently there's some suspicions on dementia? my grandma had it. we have social workers/nurses visiting my home about once a month (government funded so it's free for me) and a few months ago they reported to me that they've seen my dad walking around the house naked. and nudity/loss of awareness is one of the symtoms? so far it didnt happen again so we thought maybe he just forgot there's guests over.another issue is both my parents were drug addicts when they were younger (mainly heroin and then transitioned to prescription drugs). this fact is relevant laterrecently the palliative care folks contacted me again and told me my mum's medicine had been going missing. my dad's her main caregiver and the one refilling her prescriptions. when asked he says he doesnt remember how much medicine did he buy etc and all he has is right here. they suspect that it's him who's been siphoning my mum's medication. and now i'm supposed to control my mum's medication and deliver it to her once a week. problem is i live slightly above 1 hour away. i know it's not that far but i'm just a little frustrated. like why cant they just..... not do that? i dont even know if their suspicions are correct or could it be my mom taking way more than required dosage and lying to the nurses/ she forgot.. as mentioned above both my parents had history of substance abuse and this missing medication in question is... *morphine*. something very common and at high risk for abuse. my mum does need it for her copd. it's prescribed but she's supposed to follow the instructed dosage religiously. but whether she's taking more than required for relaxation or whether my dad's siphoning for own use, i've no idea. i dont know whose words to trust because they may lie or they may genuinely forget, given their age. so the only thing i can do is to control the medicine strictly myself. but that's gonna be super tiring because now i've to visit more often than usual, and deal with their unhappiness of me trying to control them. it feels like there's so much to do and i've to do it from 1 hour awayi do have a sibling but he's rather uninvolved in their care, so it falls on me.anyone with relevant experience who would like to share?", okay.  what about a locking automatic pill dispenser.   if wouldn’t would at least slow your folks down on the dosing.   they aren’t cheap but it would save you the two hour drive.     if she wanted an as needed dose you could monitor and release it.       like a hero maybe you keep the key they get the pin.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/kzpgb8/mother_with_chronic_disease_and_parents_with/,,[deleted by user]

"i (23) have become a caregiver to my grandmother by chance after graduating college and returning home. my mother also lives here but, even with both of us acting as caregivers, it’s been difficult. we’ve been forced to stay inside together because of the pandemic and because i have not been able to find a job. my grandmother and mother do not get along well because of their personalities. they will often argue and i’ll have to come out and mediate. my grandmother does not enjoy living here and constantly says we don’t talk to her or spend time with her. she prefers living with my aunt, who is her favorite child. she says they have a beautiful family, where she feels welcome. unfortunately, my mother recently went through a divorce that has left her devastated and lonely. that doesn’t stop my grandmother from being negative and mean. she’ll say my mother’s husband (my father) left because he got tired of her. she’s had rude outbursts with me, too. once, she told me i needed to hire servants to do all my work for me when i simply asked her if the mail had passed. another time, she yelled at me for buying the wrong seasoning. she’s also said before that the only person who cares about her is my cousin. to top things off, she got covid a few weeks ago and was forced to isolate due to cdc guidelines. we did everything for her during that time to be safe, even though she complained the whole time about not being able to cook for herself. although she has gotten better, it seemed to do away with her energy. we’ve been asking for more support from everyone around us for a long time. i’ve asked my sister to pick her up once in a while and take her out. she has three kids, so i try to be understanding, but we need her help. although we do have support from my aunt, who works from home, we feel that we need even more support, or else we might lose it. my aunt takes care of my grandmother’s financial and medical needs and takes my grandmother to her house 3 days a week, where she stays from morning to evening. unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be helping any more. i’ve felt less and less rested on the days she’s gone. i find myself dreading the time when she’ll be back, which makes me feel guilty. although we’ve had many conversations about everyone adapting to each other, about having a more positive attitude, nothing has changed. if anything, it’s gotten steadily worse. on to the inciting incident:my cousin, who has been waiting to move to college, has finally moved out, leaving an empty room at my aunt’s house. we have been waiting for this to happen to ask that she live with my aunt 3 days a week and with us an equal amount of time. we had asked several times in the past what my cousin’s plan was, but we were always met with the same answer from my aunt: ‘no, he’s not moving,’ even though i had  personally asked him before and he was always resolute about moving in january. so we waited and waited, each time feeling more and more burnt out. we let them know all the issues we were having. that we needed support. a week ago, we talked about our issues as a family again. at that point, it was a cry for help. finally, we were informed by my grandmother that he moved. we were told immediately after he was dropped off. still no word from my aunt about when we could start alternating. my grandmother comes home from visiting where my cousin would live in college, and my mother and grandmother have the usual conversation where my mother tells my grandmother she’ll be happier at my aunt’s house. my mother is not very empathetic or tactful, and her way of talking about the situation always made my grandmother feel like she was being kicked out. i would always come out to mediate and explain the situation more thoroughly. that we noticed she needed a change in environment a couple days a week. that maybe the situation at our home would improve on the other days. that things had gotten worse since we were trapped inside because of the pandemic, and a change would be good for everyone. finally, i mentioned that i didn’t like how secretive everyone had been with the move. they had known about our cry for help a while back, and didn’t mention that it was possible to have her live with them part-time. they still haven’t. we had been waiting, stressed and burnt out, reaching for a lifeline. we just wanted to know that things could get better. she started to deny everything that happened with the move, saying it wasn’t true that they were being secretive, which was when i said that i would love to get more honesty and dialogues as a family. one moment, she was sitting on the couch speaking calmly, the next, she threw herself on the ground from the couch, screaming and crying. yelling that she was a burden to everyone, that no one liked her, that she did so much for us and received nothing back, that she was leaving to my aunt’s house on foot. it was absolutely terrifying. i felt worried, shocked, and hurt all at the same time. she’s had outbursts before where she leaves to her room crying, but this was the absolute worst it’s ever been. after we helped her up so she wouldn’t hurt herself after rolling around on the floor, she continued crying and yelling for another half hour, even in bed. then she got what seemed to be bad stomach pains and yelled that her head was hurting. she refused to be taken to the hospital. luckily, she started feeling better an hour after it started, speaking calmly again after we moved back to the couch. i broke down later that night in tears. i felt everything: worried, stressed, hurt, guilty. i felt that it was my fault for having that conversation with her. i knew it’d be tough, but i wanted us to communicate more honestly. this morning, i feel hurt and angry. i feel like i was manipulated. after googling for a few hours, what resonated most with the situation was an adult temper tantrum, probably due to dementia. i read that when caregivers express the need to take some time to themselves, there may be negative outbursts. i’ve read that the best course of action during an adult temper tantrum is to disengage and ignore the outburst. should we have done that? what if she got hurt from throwing herself on the floor? whatever the answer, i feel so ill-equipped to handle this. i don’t even want to look at her because i’m scared and worried but also

"first, i want to say that reading this sub, you all are rock stars for doing what you do! just creeping on here, a lot.of you are juggling so much, it is really impressive.now to my issue! i am a single (divorced) mom.of a 3 year old daughter. my grandfather lost his wife of 60+ years after being her caregiver through a long bout with alzheimers. he and my mom do not get along (my mom is great but has some mental health issues). i invited him to come live with us (we have a ranch and extra bedroom), and he has very eagerly taken me up on the offer. we have all been very excited so far.however, now that he has sold his condo and will be actually making the move, i fund myself just kind of having bouts of extreme anxiety and kind of spiraling into worst case scenario stuff. like, seeing him and helping him with my.geandma, i worry about being able to care for him if something happens. what if he falls, he is too big for.me to pick up? what if he becomes bedbound? what if he loses his.mental faculties like my grandma, or becomes verbally abusive? etc, etc.i want to point out that, as of right now, all of these fears have zero basis in reality, save for the fact that he is 87. he is mentally still extremely sharp, super active, the nicest person you could ever meet, etc, etc. he is still a good driver, volunteers at a soup kitchen, builds furniture in his spare time, and cooks a ton. and he also will be paying a little bit of rent, even though i told him that.is not at all necessary. so i'm not really going to be a caregiver for him right away, its more likely that he will be a help to me! so i kind of feel stupid even asking about these things. however, i can't help but feel worried about the future! what steps should i be taking to be ready for a time when things go downhill? he already has his legal paperwork in order, has given me.copies.of his will and also given me healthcare power of attorney. my house has a walk in shower instead of a bath, and railings all over (was purchased from an elderly couple). i do not think he (or i) will ever be able to save up for a private nursing home if it comes to that, since they can be more than 3 times my monthly salary, so i guess he would have to go on medicaid? but i hope it doesn't ever come.to that- he does not want to ""be put in a home."" are there other general things that i should be doing right now to be ready? is there something you wish you had known or done or prepared for, before becoming a caregiver?"," actually, thinking about possible future difficulties is a good thing. however, change your mode. you aren't worrying and becoming anxious, you are analyzing and planning.you mentioned that there is already some safety equipment installed in your home. falls are definitely a worry. do research on safety issues for older people. for instance, rugs are bad and increase fall risks. even plush carpet is considered a trip risk.  perhaps it's not immediately an issue, but it could become one. you are being prudent to think ahead like this.does he currently use a walker or cane? if needed, medicare will pay for necessary equipment like that if he is a fall risk. they may also cover a hospital bed that can be lowered and raised to ease getting in and out and lessen chances of falling out.you said he can still drive well. you'll want to familiarize him with the area around your home. it amazes me how much some subdivisions are so cookie-cutter that it's really easy to become lost. make sure he knows easily recognizable landmarks near your home. make sure he feels comfortable getting to the grocery store, the pharmacy, church, etc. any places he'll want to go. also, can he use a smart phone or gps? he may not have learned if he was comfortable getting around in his former town.i will say that your expenses will increase with someone else living there. you'll be making more food, probably stocking extra things like his favorite cereal in addition to your own. utilities will go up some. if you have the flexibility in your budget to cover those things, that's great. if it makes him feel better to pay you rent, take it and save it. later, you can use it to buy him something special or perhaps an emergency fund to anticipate unexpected expenses in the future.i know i've already written too much, but i have one more thing you'll want to think about - social isolation. if he doesn't have any friends/family in your area, then you will be his whole social circle. church or a senior center can give him chances to gain a circle of friends which will increase the chances of calls and visits from friends should he become homebound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ksuf75/widowed_grandfather_moving_in_with_me_manage/,,Widowed grandfather moving in with me... manage anxiety about the future
"has anyone else experienced a sharp decline in cognitive function after going through chemotherapy?   my mother has been taking her sister, who suffers from alzheimer’s, to treatments for lung cancer.  last summer was her first round of chemo and radiation, which she handled very well.  my mother and i each live just a couple of blocks away from my aunt, so the both of us and my 18 year old daughter, each take turns going to her house each day to take care of her, so that she can stay home with her pet parrot. just before christmas, the doctors diagnosed a small nodule that was likely missed in her lung, just outside the original radiation area.  so we have taken her in for a more minor chemo/radiation schedule, but after just a couple doses of chemotherapy, her mental state has severely declined.  within the last couple of weeks she can now no longer remember 5 minutes ago, and she can no longer live alone.  we now don’t know what to do, we are afraid that more chemo will only make her mental state worse,  but how can you decide to let the cancer win when we are beating it?  has anyone else gone through anything similar with family?", what do her doctors say?  do other patients who encounter this recover?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/kssv52/dementiaalzheimers_and_chemotherapy/,,Dementia/Alzheimer’s and Chemotherapy
"hello everyone, we are taking care of my father (92) at home. he suffers from chronic kidney disease and heart disease. in october 2020 he was in the hospital with acute kidney failure. due covid-19 the whole station was put on lockdown and they didn't do any physical therapy. as a result he has declinded to the point he is bedridden/ sitting on his bed. his bloodwork (especially kidney) improved greatly. since last week my dad always starts screaming/ howling whenever we want him to sit up, drink or eat. whenever we ask him whether he is in pain, he says he is not. he can't tell us why he is doing that. it's so horrible listening to that and i'm torn between pity and annoyance. today he was screaming so loud i was afraid someone was going to call the police. we don't know whats wrong with my dad. his bloodwork is ok. he is not diagnosed with dementia. he has trouble with hearing and is pretty forgetful. has anyone ever dealt with something similar? thank you."," two things that i've seen that can mimic the effects of dementia are utis and kidney shutdown. my mother-in-law appeared to have severe dementia after being given strong antibiotics for mrsa. the er staff was treating her as if she was a dementia patient. my wife had to yell at a doctor to get him to understand that her mother hadn't been like that the day before. when they checked, the antibiotics had caused her kidneys to shut down.since he's forgetful, i assume you or somebody else is managing his medications. overmedication can also look like dementia, but tends to look more like sleeping too much and not being able to focus on a task rather than screaming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/krnyiv/father_is_screaming_howling_without_cause/,,Father is screaming/ howling without cause
"i was a caregiver for my boyfriend’s dad with vascular dementia until very recently when he went into hospice in a memory care unit at a nursing home.as a last “ef you” from 2020, my mom (65f, also has fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis) fell on ice while trying to get into a truck, and fractured her hip. she’s completely immobile and finds out on monday whether she needs surgery. she’s a tough cookie but is in a ton of pain and having a difficult time accepting that she needs help (who wouldn’t, it’s such a tricky time!). i (27f) live about 20 min from my parents. my dad is taking care of her the next few days, but unfortunately struggling with money and work, so he has to go in most of next week. i’m going to move in there for a while because she needs someone there 24/7. their house has 2 floors and right now she’s confined to one room, and we’re working on making her a ramp to get in and out of that room to go to the bathroom, etc. i’m working remotely, but i do have calls that are several hours long during which i’m unable to help her. no shower on 1st floor so my bf is trying to plan out a way to rig one up in our back sunroom area. it’s helpful that we’ve spent so much time caregiving for his dad but that was different as he was not as mentally sound or aware as my mom is.do you have any tips to make a first floor more accessible for someone using a walker/wheelchair? i have a reacher and toilet seat guard on the way, and her walker is decent. i want to do everything i can to help her feel as independent as possible, bc she’s really struggling with the change.any hacks or tricks to making this easier on her (and me when i can’t be right next to her)?thanks so much, i’m very thankful for this community.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/kp383y/2nd_time_being_a_full_time_caregiver_this_time_is/,,"2nd time being a full time caregiver, this time is trickier."

"my mother is technically the primary caregiver to my dad. we get a morning personal support worker to do bathing, shaving, changing and clothing, and afternoon psw for the same (if bathing/shaving didn't happen in the am), and an overnight psw for changing and fall prevention. the psws are now all very familiar with my dad, where all the supplies are and are now on a good rhythm. i trust them all completely.i go to the house twice a day (once in the morning to help with breakfast and then again in the early evening during dementia sundowning time). my sister and i help out with groceries and do the laundry. i accompany my dad to appointments and speak to all the healthcare providers because my mother's english is not 100%.despite all this incredible help, she is still overwhelmed and exhausted. sometimes she tells me she doesn't shower for three days because she ""doesn't have time"".  she is a control freak and mico-manager to the extreme so she involves herself in the psws' work when they are fully capable of working unsupervised. my dad is doing just fine and his health is improving every day. like i said, i trust the psws completely. any tips to get her to chill the eff out and step back from the caregiving when others are providing it? it's a huge problem and i fear she will place him in a long-term care facility because she stresses herself out, not because of his actual care needs.", i think the best thing for her would be professional counseling. she sounds like she has a lot of inner turmoil that she's struggling with.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/khqcc0/primary_caregiver_is_overwhelmed_when_in_my/,,"Primary caregiver is overwhelmed when in my opinion, all is well"

"for many years, i was my mom's caregiver. she suffered from a genetic neurological condition which was degenerative, called spinocerebellar ataxia 3. you can imagine symptoms like parkinsons or lou gerigs disease (sp?) and you'd have a pretty accurate physical description. caring for her required quite a bit of physical exertion, she had no balance and could be fairly unpredictable, and could sometimes  weigh like a concrete block. i think all of her caregivers, myself included, suffered at least one sprained back or other injury. also, she was a difficult client by any measure... she had many agency caregivers over the years, a few who lasted more than a year, but most would either quit or she would fire them.in 2015, i was 25 years old. i secured a contract working on a machine learning project for apple, and when that ended, i took on some of the weekly hours caregiving for my mom, as it helped me avoid a lapse in income, and also since she was vocal about her preference for me over 'strangers' sent by the agency. another motivation was the ability to cut down on spending; i was willing to work for less than half of what the agency charged hourly. so basically, my mom needed 24/7 care. she lived with my dad, who would (kind of, minimally,) care for her at night, but during the week he went to work, so a caregiver would come for 10 hours a day, m-f, and a few hours on sat and sun. i started covering 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day, and it started as something meant to be temporary, while i secured my next job....but i got entirely sucked in, for a complex web of reasons. i felt obligated to pick up all the elements of her care that were starting to slip, so before long i was the one coordinating her doctors care, making sure she was stocked with supplies, fed, bathed, and each time something new came up, my dad would basically play chicken with me, callously brushing it off as 'not his problem' probably bc he knew that i wouldn't let it slip into the past unaddressed. boy was it a leaky ship, i felt like i was constantly trying to patch up different holes and gaps in her necessary care, and with insufficient resources. i did not have the ability for whatever reason to draw a line in the sand and establish healthy limits for myself, so i was constantly compromising my needs in order to meet hers, and at times it did feel like a 1 for 1 trade off. i couldn't stomach the idea of abandoning her with my father, who didn't even have the patience to listen to her finish a full sentence before he'd raise his voice or angrily stomp away, knowing she couldn't follow him. his behavior toward her caused her so much pain, it actually makes my stomach knot up to even remember.i digress! my point is, long story short, i never did find my next job. 5 years passed, and then in february of this year, she passed. suddenly. the way it happened was so surreal, it's still hard for me to believe... one week she was fine, then the next week she had a cold, and before another week came to pass, she became unresponsive one day... wouldn't wake up, and that night, she was gone. we didn't take her to the hospital, it wouldn't have done any good anyway, as she had a dnr prominently on file. she likely would have refused even antibiotics. she was ready to go.so i found myself unemployed, needing to find a replacement for the barely sufficient income within two weeks, before my 'severance pay' expired. oh, as well as grieve the passing of my mother, who was at that point also something like my child. i'm still grieving, tbh. it hasn't gotten any less devastating. but life must go on. quickly. so i decided to go with my most recent experience, and got a job with a home health agency. getting hired was no problem, and they've given me clients steadily, though not always a great fit.currently i have two clients, the weekend client i simply adore. and then for 3 days during the week i spend 12 hr days - from the time the client opens her eyes, to when she gets in bed and closes them - with this woman in her 80s who has dementia. i sometimes struggle not to get annoyed with her, as dementia can be very complex, it's not limited to memory loss by any means. sometimes it can really seem like it's f--king with you. sorry this post got so long, i may or may not go into some specifics in a comment, but for now i just want to get this up"," you are a wonderfully kind person. your mom raised a very compassionate child, so it is great you got to spend that time with her.with your dementia patient ask her about favorite childhood memories, play music from when she would have been in her late teens and 20s. if she is 80, that would be music from the late 50s to the early 60s. there is some great stuff in that era.there is no time limit to grieve, be gentle with yourself. develop a support group to help cope with caregiving. be kind to yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/kfermf/transitioning_from_family_caregiver_to_agency/,,Transitioning from family caregiver to agency caregiver

"i've been drafting up a really long post for about a week now, but things are getting bad, and i don't know what else to do.my family and i have been taking care of my grandma for several months now. my mom and sisters since march, when my grandad died, and i've been here since august, when my younger sisters started their school year. my grandma has been physically handicapped for 49 years, but mentally, she's typical. no dementia/alzheimer's, no learning differences, nothing. we've had her doctor screen her for just about everything. i don't know why, but she refuses to listen to me when i tell her things about safety. things like ""don't stand up in the kitchen if no one is around, because you could fall"" and ""don't throw yourself down onto the toilet while i'm pulling down your pants, i'll lower you down."" i've been telling her those specific things every day for months, but she refuses to hear me. last week, she threw herself down, and i couldn't catch her. because of where i was, she landed safely on the toilet. i however, was thrown into the bathtub. i hit my head, and really hurt my back (which i had surgery on late last year, so it still makes me nervous) and my hips. i could barely walk for the whole week, but ended up recovering thanks to my chiropractor. i think it could potentially been done on purpose, because when she slips or feels unbalanced in any way, she freaks out and screams, but she didn't scream on this occasion. she doesn't scream (or even gasp) any time she throws herself back onto the toilet. there was no apology. no ""are you ok?"" in fact, she just started talking about how she's waiting for a phone call. she didn't care that i was hurt at all until my mom had a talk with her that night, but she turned it into a ""i didn't realize i was such a bad person"" thing. idk if it was so we'd tell her what a good person she is, or if it was supposed to make us so uncomfortable that we just didn't question her.yesterday was my first day ""back to work"" (my youngest sister picked up my slack in between her online classes) and first thing in the morning, i took her to the bathroom. i got her into a standing position, and without filling me in, she decided to do something different, so she fell backwards. i was there to catch her, and she landed in her wheelchair, but the force of the fall and her body weight threw me back. i lost my footing, and nailed my ribs and left arm on the corner of the door frame. i fell to the ground and cried for a moment, while she sat there staring at me with a blank face. then i had to get up and try it again. thankfully, this time, she did the same thing we've been doing for 5 months, so it was fine. when she was ready to get up, i came back to get her, and somehow i was able to get her up with no incident. i went outside to reflect, and let my mom know what happened, and while i was out there, she decided to do dishes (which she isn't allowed to do anymore) and not tell anyone. so i was outside, and both of my sisters were in their room, doing school with their headphones on. super dangerous, and we all tell her daily to let someone know that she intends to stand up so she doesn't end up on the ground with no one around to hear her. my grandad told her that for years, and she actually fell and broke her hip once while he was at the grocery store! so yesterday, she fell. my sisters heard her fall, so they ran out and got her off the ground and back into her wheelchair. her first words were ""well she finally got her wish! i fell!"" and i'm crushed. i didn't wish she would fall, i just warned her that she could if she wasn't careful. she ended up being totally fine, which is crazy because she has broken bones falling the same distance while she was younger and healthier.i told her we should probably get her medical attention, but she flat out refused it. i was too physically hurt and emotionally drained to force her, and she convinced my parents not to take her, so she got out of seeing a doctor.  and while she feels totally fine, it turns out that i have a fractured rib, and my birth control implant in my arm broke from my fall. i am frustrated that she gets to make bad decisions, even when she knows not to, and why she shouldn't, and she gets zero consequences, but i get consequences galore from her decisions. my chiropractor says to let things go, because she's ""just a stubborn old person"" and to basically just do certain things her way, but when it comes to my safety, to enforce rules, but that's sure working out so far. there's no discussion before she hurts me, so i can't avoid it at this point. she would cut off her nose to spite her face, and at this point, she is a danger to me, and to herself. all because she doesn't want to listen to me.i am so afraid to deal with getting my arm implant removed tomorrow, but it's causing me so much pain that i can't use the arm anyway. i'm afraid that i'm gonna heal from this injury, and the next one is going to be even worse, because this injury is already worse than the last one was. i am genuinely so fearful to be in this house with her. no one else has been hurt while helping her but me. even when my mom was a kid, and my grandad was the sole caretaker, my grandma has never injured anyone else. and i feel crazy for thinking she's hurting me on purpose, but the things she says are like she blames me for everything, even though i have been telling her not to do things for her safety. i have explained it all to her, and she recalls the conversations on different occasions. i know she remembers, but for some reason, it's like she is pretending she doesn't just to.. get back at me?? for keeping her safe, and holding her accountable for things. people - both inside and outside the situation - have said she's gaslighting me (which i haven't even touched the surface of in this post) and i know that the way i'm feeling is consistent with gaslighting, but i just can't rationalize why she would be doing this to me, especially since we have the same goal: keeping her safe. it's like she just decided one day that she hated me, but we used to be really close. the things she says to me, as well as the things i hear her say about me while she's on the phone are tearing me up inside, and when i tell her that, she pretends she didn't say any of it, and that i must be imagining it, even when there are multiple witnesses. my (and my mom's) mental health is at an all time low. we are in over our heads. i feel like i'm in actual danger at this point, but there's nothing i can do. no one who could actually help would believe me, especially with the act she puts on around strangers. i'm just... so scared. i could leave, but that puts my mom in a bad situation, because then she would need to hire help to come in here in the middle of the pandemic, and anyone they'd hire would cost twice as much as me. we've talked about having her go to a home, but she's entirely against it, going as far as to tear up flyers and pamphlets, and hiding things so we don't see them. i was going to buy a house, get married, and start my family this year, but she needed help, so my fiancé and i happily (or naively) put everything on hold, and i honestly regret it. i'm creeping up on 30, and i want my life. i am so jealous that my older sister already had a house, a career, and a family, so she couldn't drop everything and come down to help the family out. i wish i would've had that excuse, but i'm so stupid that i was excited to come down and take care of grandma. if you would've pulled me aside in february, and told me how my grandma really is, i would've laughed in your face. i'm genuinely still processing it. if i never moved back home, i'd be safe and healthy, and i'd still have a good relationship with my grandma. i feel stuck. my mom feels stuck. my dad and my little sisters absolutely hate it here. we don't know what to do at this point. we don't even know what our options are. i feel like i'm gonna be taking care of her when i'm in my 50s - no kids, no dogs, no home. just here. in my own personal nightmare, until i eventually get to die, and she becomes my nephew's responsibility."," is she throwing herself onto the toilet or does she have ""uncontrolled decent""? my wife has uncontrolled decent, which basically means as

"hello! maybe someone can give me some idea about what's going on with my grandma, things are not so good in my country and it is difficult to access to specialists, like a neurologist.it happened already 3 or 4 times, the pattern goes like this: it starts with a day where she is extremely sleepy and refuses to eat or drink, just keep sleeping and even there are times she doesn't wake up when called. that day is quite scary.finally when she is awake she is having ideas of people (a witch, a gypsy, some delincuent, they...) is near and wants to harm her. this goes on for a couple more days.then she gets calmer as the days pass and start to behave better, and is calmer, eats better, recognizes me and all around better and so on. last time there was a day she were extremely thristy.and finally she starts with the apathy again, refuses to eat and gets sleepy, so after 8-9 days since the beggining  it all starts again.she is using memantine for dementia and low dose of drugs for parkinson's.help is appreciated"," i am also experiencing this, is she on home hospice? she needs to be on something for the paranoia, if she is on home hospice there are things that can be given to her by hospice, i was just informed of this by our hospice nurse. and if she isn't on hospice call her dr and tell them of the paranoia, he may be able to give her what hospice can in that scenario.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/k7rdj2/an_interesting_pattern/,,An interesting pattern
"in the summer of 2014 my mother was diagnosed with dementia. at that time she was 63 and living with my grandmother in southern california. later that year, my sister and i made the decision to bring her out to colorado to live with me, until her death in spring of 2019. i find myself today, almost 7 years since her diagnosis, at a loss, unable to grasp who she was, or what she really meant to me. i have become completely numb, totally incapable of love. not knowing how to feel things anymore. i’m never particularly happy, never particularly sad. everything is just grey. recent events in my life have finally put large cracks in the dam holding back all the emotions i have been harboring, throughout the years. knowing what i was about to face, writing this story, was always the plan. somehow i knew it’s exactly what i needed to find myself again. this is the sorry about her and what i experienced, as i start to peel back the layers, understanding them and finally taking the time feel them. to begin this story, i must capture the essence of her and the relationship we had. i was born into this world by an extraordinary woman, not only was she a god fearing moral person, she was the person that always protected me. she never deceived me. in times of confusion, she would always steer me down the right path. she was mother, she was my rock! i don’t think i can recall a time she ever yelled at me in anger. don’t get me wrong, i did get yelled at as a kid, no! david was the most common phrase in my house growing up. it was never out of anger tho, only frustration from what i had just done, or was about to do. i was a handful, always into something. turn you head for a second and i was taking something apart, climbing up on the kitchen countertop or being a ham, performing a circus act in the hallway. i was a tornado of discovery, driven by an active imagination, with enough energy to fuel a power plant. how she survived, the trials and tribulations i put her through, i will never know. all that i know is that she did it with grace. she completely knew me, inside and out and had this peaceful way to guide me. i was born with a very strong will, she must have learned early on, the only way to lead me was by example. it was always the why and never the how. what it took for her to always remain loving and clam, in the midst of the chaos, i would create is what makes her the most extraordinary person i have ever known. what it truly feels like to be loved by your mother, is the love you can see on her eyes the second you walk into the room. time completely stops and all you can feel is love she has for you. this is how my mother loved me. i will post more each week as it is written."," i love this! as someone who shares a similar story, i want to say how much your post meant. thank you for sharing and god bless💛",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/jvdf16/mending_the_broken_pieces/,,Mending the broken pieces

"hi there - this is my first time posting in a reddit ever. i'm posting because i've found myself in a proto-caregiver situation. let me explain: i'm a 25 year old unemployed teacher, having been laid off about a month ago. at the start of this pandemic, back at the end of february, i started a friendship with the elderly neighbor next door. let's call her connie. she's 75, with a moderate tremor and the beginnings of alzheimer's. i started checking in on her every week, bringing her groceries or dinner or just meeting for coffee. the last two weeks have been particularly hard for her. her tremors gotten worse, and she's very spacey, repeating questions, forgetting to pay important bills. and she's not eating or really drinking anything but coffee, which scares me even more. now connie doesn't have any family who can help - she doesn't have extended family and her daughter lives in a group home for adults with cerebral palsy. today, as i helped her decided what food she might like to have delivered through meals on wheels, she looked at me and said, 'if you weren't here, who would be helping me with this?' anyway. all of this to say, i want to help her as much as i can. i don't have family in the city i live in, and she's been in her apartment for 35 years.. i don't want her going into care. i'm all in.so, we talked about me helping her more. my plan so far (that i discussed with her) is to bring her easy breakfasts and snacks, and then help her sign up with meals on wheels. she shared her prescription list with me so i could google it and you know, start getting familiar with her medication and health. but other then that, i'm sorry of lost for how to help her incrementally get a little more well. what was your journey like? what am i not considering??? any advice or links you have would be wonderful.", you’ve got to think ahead. are you willing to be in charge of her assets? otherwise some lawyer will be. it’s much easier to get power of attorney before she gets incoherent. then it’s a bigger deal with going to court etc. you’re a very good person to take this on but there’s some impersonal things to be ready for. are you sure there are no relatives you don’t know about that might come out of the woodwork? believe me i’m not being miss opposite... just saying what you’ve got to be ready for and i think you are. i’d get power of attorney now if she agrees otherwise it may be too hard especially if alzheimer s sets in. get power of attorney before she gets any more doctor appointments.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/jpgqtr/looking_for_new_caregiver_advice/,,looking for new caregiver advice
"my dad is dying from a rare brain disease that saw him go from completely normal physically and mentally to someone very similar to an advanced stage dementia patient in a matter of months. he doesn’t have the cognitive ability to understand the illness so he does not know that he is sick or dying. it’s been awful to watch him decline so quickly. one of the earliest signs of his brain issues (that led us to pushing for tests) included his inability to use his phone properly, sending us texts and emails full of typos and other mistakes. he would also call various offices like his doctor without being clear about what he needed or why. i had to delete many of his contacts to stop him from randomly calling or texting people but there were a few embarrassing incidents nonetheless. as his confusion increased, he eventually lost interest in his phone and we quietly put it away. my brother (who took a year odd and traveled from abroad this summer to help me care for dad) now uses it since he doesn’t have a local number.for the last week or so, dad has been asking for his phone and becomes increasingly agitated when we say we don’t have it. in the past it would come up occasionally but we always managed to make him forget about it. he says he has calls to make like the electrical company, or doctors he wants to speak to, he says he is calling his boss to say he’ll be back to work in a month, etc. nothing makes sense but he is incredibly angry and sometimes tries to get up and go down the stairs. he is barely able to walk and had his first fall today because he suddenly stood up from bed in his fury and fell over when he reached down to pick up his robe. fortunately most of the impact was absorbed by his cushy recliner on his way down so he is not injured. how would you navigate this? giving him back a deactivated phone would not work since his goal is to speak to someone. we have the palliative care doctor coming by this week and i will tell her about the increased agitation (the phone is only part of this)"," if you have an old but working phone give him that and talk to the phone company to see if they can block/divert all outgoing calls to yours and brothers phones, you could also list a few contacts but all the numbers are to phones with safe people on the other end, people who will go along with whoever your dad thinks he is calling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/jn4qkf/dad_keeps_asking_for_his_phone/,,Dad keeps asking for his phone

"omg, we totally feel crushed and cornered right now... to be honest, that seems to be the normal here in the us for many folks, but i digress. we are poas for my inlaws. my fil has dementia and mil doesn't seem to be thinking clearly. fil (in his mid-80s) would not have been diagnosed if i hadn't pushed our family into investigating it a year or so ago. for a good decade, i had noticed concerning changes in his behavior. i was trying to be respectful of boundaries as a dil and wife, but it was getting a bit ridiculous. fil had been hallucinating and making really off-the-wall accusations. i think he's been hurting mil, too. i finally put my foot down past everyone's denial. then mil has health issues, and she takes care of fil while trying to downplay the physical and mental stress it has taken on her. she has had multiple surgeries and does not take the time to heal. i think she is scared of admitting this reality or there could be something else that is causing her not to think straight. she's still on the younger end of older (60s), but has really been dealing with a lot of stress as a caretaker for her husband and parents and it is clear this has taken a real toll. before fucking covid, we were taking them to look at outside help. this wasn't easy due to distance (we live a day's drive away), but we love these people and want to make sure dh and i are ready when an emergency happens (at fil's age it probably will soon). mil wasn't keen on accepting outside help and claims fil hated meeting new people...but we did not witness this in fil—he's an extrovert and actually seemed to have fun talking with folks at he daycare we visited. but luckily mil still let us drive them around to consider it all. i was hoping it'd sink in or help her start to consider letting others help herself. i know it's scary asking outsiders for help when you already have your world turned upside down and she has been dealing with her parents' death recently. then the damned pandemic happened. we had to take care of our own needs for a bit, but i am now trying to sort out with dh how to help his parents as i feel every day we wait is a day closer a big emergency will happen with them. so we are trying to do what we can virtually. we aren't 100% sure they are being safe (thank goodness they are living in a state that has stricter covid regulations). dh is on the borderline of being high risk for a covid infection. he's not a senior, but old enough an infection would possibly be hard and always had issues with respiratory infections in the past—as well as a disability. i am younger and very healthy, but we have kids so i am not inclined to take unnecessary risks right now. tried talking to mil about the idea of us finding them a hired helper to come by once a week. we just want another healthy trustworthy adult up there to help them in case an emergency happens. mil seemed to have this unrealistic plan dh would move in with them and care for them (he cannot—we both need our careers and we are parents to young kids). mil was so upset by the idea of a person coming to their home, she threatened to remove us as poas. i tried to explain to her we just wanted to insure they could stay independent and in their home, but she still saw it as a threat. wish we could have family help, but realized we will need to hire people. dh is an only child. other family members live up there (cousins), but my ils have been incredibly toxic with the rest of our family over politics.they actually can be kind people outside of that, but rush limbaugh and other angry ""talk show"" hosts play on their radio every time we have visited the past 10 years... it has really messed with the way they view the world, and fil gets very adversarial with other people to the point he'll start political ""conversations"" with strangers to the point the political bullying got him and mil may have gotten them kicked out of their favorite restaurants. but the worst part is mil—who is usually a compassionate level-headed person—joins in with fil when he does this. she could have explained to family what's been going on with fil. they totally would have helped if they knew fil was ill, but instead of downplaying his behavior mil actually joins in with him to argue, taunt, and bully people with opposing views. she seems to enjoy it. i was frequently the target of this, but then i realized what was up with fil and learned how to distract/shut him down. he can't help the way he behaves any more than a toddler. his brain isn't working right, and that is not his fault. but mil is a mystery. i don't know if her behavior is caused by intense fear, pride, cruelty, or if her own mind is going...but she and fil have driven away all their close friends and our local family members who could have helped us with their care and keeping them independent. it's up to dh and me. we know we are limited even though we are poas, but it doesn't feel right at this point to abandon them—even though they have been so toxic. we sure as hell don't want them to live with us, however.  right now, we're looking into finding outside help. we tried contacting their doctor. she is a super flake. mil already told us their doctor had been downplaying fil's weird behavior for years. when dh tried to call her, she never returned his call—but luckily ended up referring fil to a neurologist right after. we can't convince or force them to see another doctor (totally would have if i had that option). we're currently re-investigating their local dept. of aging and looking at elder care attorneys. aside from coming here to vent a little, i was wondering - are there other local resources we could be looking into? also, are there ways to research memory care facilities safely during covid (and find ones that have safe covid practices)? if any of you are still reading my tome by this point, thank you.", i did read all of your journey. caretaking is freakin stressful but trying to do it long distance has got to be worse. dss (dept. senior services) has been helpful with suggestions for outside help which we now have for 3 hours

"i have been one of the two primary caregivers from my great grandma since mid 2017. she is a dementia patient. recently she called the cops saying she’s being abused at home (she’s not) and that my grandma bit her all up her arm (also not true). before this incident she told her doctor to report my grandma (her daughter and other caregiver) for selling drugs out of her house. it’s like every few months it’s something new with her. but this time it looks like she might actually go to a home. i don’t want her to, we love being able to care for her where she gets everything she could ever want and need. she’s currently in the hospital, she was discharged the night she went in but since she didn’t want to come home with us they admitted her again while they try to find placement for her. she’s in the hospital spinning these stories like we’re horrible people and it hurts! i want to reason with her and tell her to come home but i also just want the drama to stop already, my grandma already has enough on her plate. has anyone else ever dealt with this? what do i do? when paramedics first came to the house they explained that those with dementia tend to believe made up things that never happened. i’m sorry this post is all over the place i’ve just been really stressed and emotional the past couple of days. any advice is welcome, thank you."," my grandmother had lots of problems like this and serious hallucinations toward the end of her life. i was a part time caregiver while she was living with my mother -- it got to where my grandmother was calling me at 3am saying she couldn't wake up my mom in the other room and that she needed to take her daily medicine again because it was time, and that people were getting in and out of the house spying on them. it wasn't safe for her anymore. she didn't have dementia but she had bad scarring in her lungs that prevented her from getting adequate oxygen which presents as dementia-like symptoms. her lucidity waxed and waned each day. the hardest part is when they are lucid and admit that they know they sound crazy and feel trapped. trust me, it's a hard decision, but getting her to a safe place without the guilt and shame and confusion of family around is probably the smartest decision for her safety.the professionals know that these stories aren't true. visit as often as you can and bring baskets of baked goods or other treats for the staff once a week when you visit to foster relationship with them. learn as much as you can about the day to day and you can still be a caregiver, it'll just look different. don't try to convince your ggma that what she's saying isn't true unless she is saying she is scared and unsafe, in which case, i would suggest offering soothing to her with her favorite things so she can know to trust you. unfortunately with these kinds of mind issues, they really may not understand who you are, so the best thing you can do for them is to be positive and loving. it's not easy. i'm so sorry you're going through this! have you browsed r/dementia yet? that place might also be helpful for you. sending you strength and patience for this challenging time for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/jchh1l/after_three_years_i_might_not_be_a_caregiver/,,after three years I might not be a caregiver anymore.
"my dad lived with us (my teenaged son and me) for 4 years and i was his primary caregiver with my son helping.  he progressed slowly through dementia and we also dealt with him falling and breaking his hip and then falling again and breaking his shoulder.  then last winter he had problems with not eating and drinking and his electrolytes got out of whack and he j was hospitalized twice for dangerously high sodium levels.  after the second time it was clear i could no longer care for him at home and in january he went into a care facility.  then covid happened.  i haven't been able to visit him since february when the state shut down visits.  then about 2 weeks ago 2 staff members at his facility tested positive and then in the last week a staff member and a resident tested positive.  i feel so guilty because if i'd just brought him home and sucked it up and worked harder then he would be at home with loved ones instead of strangers and he wouldn't have been exposed to the blasted virus.   i feel like a little piece of dirt on the bottom of someone's shoe.   thanks for ""listening"".", hey you.   the pandemic (and some people's willingness to spread it thoughtlessly): not your fault.  your father's normal progression into geriatry: not your fault.  if you did the best you could with the information and resources you had at the time: \*well done\*.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/jar38r/guilt_covid_related/,,Guilt - Covid related

"i've (23f)  just returned, 2 weeks ago from my studies abroad, and i'm home for good. i'm still adjusting to my home life with my parents- especially now that i've realised they've aged mentally and physically while i've been away. my parents are in their 60s. my mom is a housewife and my dad is still working. my mom used to be sharp as a tack, witty and very organised. now she is really forgetful, she's really impatient, easily frustrated and i noticed that as she forgets things, she puts blame on other people i.e my brother and dad- saying they moved her keys or took her things. when in reality nobody has done anything. and she is very stubborn, she will fight you all day if she wants.and actually, a couple years ago, she got scammed and we lost quite a lot of money. she refused to accept blame or even show remorse at the time. that's when we discovered there was something really wrong with her.  i realised its because she had been home all this time while my bro and dad were working and while i was away studying. she'd be sitting at home with just the dogs, not knowing who'd be home for dinner or when. i think there were lot of times that she'd cook and have to throw extra food away. i also think she just didn't feel close or safe enough around us to confide in us- which really hurt us the most. my brother and father's relationship with her were at a all time low after the scam. i cried myself to sleep for a week, not knowing what to do. her family also has a history of dementia, and i think that is setting in as well. (fyi i'm just an unemployed lawyer at this moment, and i don't know much about mental or physical health, but this is my best understanding of what might have happened to my mom while i was away.) so anyway, since then i put myself in my mom's corner and convinced my brother and dad to forgive her and since then we've all been trying to be more of a family. i went back to study abroad for my final 2 years of university and while we kept in contact, i heard a lot of positive things! my parents do yoga now twice a week together. my brother comes home for dinner every night. since i've been back i spend half the day with her gardening, watching tv or running errands.  so far, things are good- not great because she still tends to snap at me when i'm just trying to help. and she does seem to still blame my brother and dad for her mistakes. and whenever we ask her about simple things or try to encourage her to put more effort into things (like doing puzzles or spending more time reading instead of tv), she gets very defensive and argues with us. but other than those few moments in a day, she is much more relaxed and cheery throughout her day.as much as i love my mother, my family and how we're all in a much better place now- i can't help but feel anxious and scared that all of this is fragile. like in a few months when i start looking for a job and a place of my own, we'll go right back to square 1. can anyone give me some advice on how i can handle this emotionally, physically and mentally going forward? i'm 2 weeks in and i'm starting to lose sleep over this. i just want to do what's best for my mom/family but i know that i still have so much of my own life i need to fulfil before i can really do anything.", i know this doesn't answer your question but this is something i wish someone had told me. while your mom is still pretty lucid you need to ask her about her wishes on how she wants her treatment to go. if she stops eating does she want someone to feed her? does she want a dnr? seeing as how she's already fallen prey to a financial scam maybe its time she gets a poa as well. good luck to you and your family!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/jajxtv/advice_for_new_caregiver/,,Advice for new caregiver
"one of the most devastating parts of caring for someone with dementia is that dread day when they don’t remember who you are. we are tempted to throw in the towel and say all is lost. but there is another side to memory called unremembered memories. these memories run so deep that they are no longer remembered in the usual sense of the word, but are rather simply part of who the person is.", thanks for linking to this blog. good reading there.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/j9jedn/try_to_remember/,,Try to Remember
"i need to vent and y’all understand. we’ve had to bring my grandpa (81) to the hospital again. he’s been sun downing (parkinson’s and lbd) for 2 full days, no sleep, no stopping, and he yells constantly. he’s been home a week but it feels like 2 months. they’ve had a noise violation in their 55+ community because someone complained. it has been that hard. he’s bedbound, he can’t walk or stand, but he can scoot just enough to fall out of bed. he keeps trying to pull his catheter out which is leading to damage and other problems. he has a feeding tube. he has no bowel control and wears diapers. he hallucinates and doesn’t know where he is 75% of the time. it’s exhausting. my grandma (74) has hurt her back changing him, moving him back to bed, etc. i help when i can, and i swear i moved him back on the bed 10 times in 3 hours. sometimes he can randomly standup from the bed if he’s extremely out of it and has slept all day. he can’t stand for long or take steps. today, he hit me in the ribs (shocked me-didn’t hurt) and kicked my grandma when she was trying to adjust the pads to catch any diaper leaks. she wasn’t touching him or anything. he was mad at us for whatever he was hallucinating. it was intentional but wasn’t him if that makes sense. it’s the delusions and dementia. we know it wasn’t him because his voice changes. he can’t be reasoned with. even playing along with what we guess he is saying doesn’t work. we know he can’t help it or control it, but we don’t have the muscle or stamina to provide the 24/hr care he needs. we finally had the hard talk today where i told her if i ever have an accident where this level of care is needed, to please put me in a home and visit me. don’t try to care for me yourself. she told me the same thing. we never thought he’d go first. and we thought we had more time with him than we did. we based our expectations on the parkinson’s group they attended for years, but this disease is uniquely cruel for each individual. i asked if she thought he would want this for her, and if she would want it for him and she said no. but we got down to the fact that being a wife and mother is who she is. she has never done anything else, and having to change that is hard and it hurts. that it’s ok to ask for help. she’ll still be his wife and take care of him when she visits him. it just won’t be a 24/7 job.", thinking of you. it's tough. you two are superheroes for doing what you have done.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/j8y3yo/yall_im_relieved_but_also_heartbroken/,,Y’all I’m relieved but also heartbroken
"in august of 2019 my wife's mother was diagnosed with dementia (have since learned its early onset alzheimer's). within a month of that diagnosis she moved from missouri to georgia to live with us. we have 2 dogs and she brought another 2. as it turned out my wife also happened to be pregnant when all this happened. so now we also have a 3 month old baby too! needless to say, we have a lot going on with a new baby, 4 dogs and my mother-in-law.both my wife and i work full-time (thankfully 100% from home at the moment due to covid). because we can't watch our baby all day and also work at the same time, we decided to put her in daycare. my mother-in-law has mostly been independent and we've just had takeover and help her with things like her medication, driving/scheduling her to dr. appointments, paying bills/managing finances, etc.that was until last night. my mother-in-law fell while she was going to the bathroom and ended up fracturing her ankle. we think due partially to her dementia, she's extremely dependent on someone to take care of her now. she hasn't been able to figure out crutches and keeps forgetting and putting her weight on her broken ankle. we have also found her on the floor a few times already from not quite being able to make it back in bed.my wife and i are not sure where to go from here. she's only 57 and without the broken ankle, although close to it, i'd say she's not quite ready to go to a nursing home. with her broken ankle, however, we are not able to properly care for her, our baby, jobs and the dogs all at once.what options are available to us? would a rehab facility of some kind take her while her ankle heals? since she's been close to needing a nursing home, should we go ahead and starting looking for one for her? in-home caregiving service might work but one of the dogs is a little defensive when a stranger comes in and they also (her dogs) bark constantly if a stranger is in the house. barking normally wouldn't be a huge deal but since my wife and i work from home, and we'd like to avoid waking the baby up, it has turned out to be.thank you in advance for the advice!"," from my experience it depends on your insurance, for example with my dad whose disabled he qualifies  for 1-2 days of pt/ ot per week outside the hospital,  however if he has a seizure and has to go to the er, he then qualifies to spend a few weeks at a rehab getting 5 days a week ot/pt. depending on how long it's been since you went to the hospital for the fracture you should contact your social worker and see if you qualify for rehab. it sounds to me from your mother in laws age and injury you likely would qualify. or if you take her to the hospital after a fall that could help persuade the insurance to pay for it if shes a fall risk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/j8pgbw/options_for_a_mil_with_alzheimers_and_a_fractured/,,Options for a M-i-L with alzheimers and a fractured ankle

"there's so much wrong with this situation that it's almost impossible to know where to start. my girlfriend and i have been taking care of my grandparents for almost 8 years. it's been our primary job for the entire time. at first, it was just to be here to help my grandpa up in case he fell, which was about a once a day thing. there was no stopping him. but he passed a couple years ago and now it's just my grandmother left, who has dementia so bad her memory, it's just gone. she has a constant pain in her buttock at the moment, and my girlfriend is getting absolutely no rest because as soon as she comes back from checking on her, grandma is yelling for her at the top of her lungs. thats not the worst of it. my family has the house rigged up with video cameras,  one of which is on my grandma, which i have no problem with, because we cannot sit in there with her 24/7. however, there is a  specific section of my family that abuses these cameras in every way possible.  so with my grandmother yelling out for my girlfriend  in front of these cameras  pretty much non-stop, these ""people"" are using it to threaten the roof over our heads. every day. they know what's going on,  they just demand the impossible, knowing that they're demanding the impossible, and we can't keep up. and finally, due to the nature of my grandmother's pain, i can't do anything to help. so it's pretty much falling entirely on my girlfriend and it's not fair, but this is all we have. there is a long story that led up to this situation. that will have to be in another post. i think i'm going to end up with quite a long series of posts by the time i'm done. but i can shorten it to a couple simple words ,  and i'm just going to call them the rednecks .  the same people that are demanding the impossible of us constantly  and threatening the roof over our heads  when we can't do the impossible. they are in the middle of every problem  that we have had since we got here. personally, the only way that this could possibly end is with a major confrontation, when i call them rednecks i want you to picture every single garbage human being that you've ever seen on jerry springer, and concentrate them into a 4-person family. these people are the worst. they have control over almost every asset, which i'm sure isn't legitimate, but i can't prove it's a lie, any more than they can prove it to be true. they float, they are childish and vindictive, petty...... every time i think i have seen the lowest that they will go, they cut the floor out of the building and leave me speechless yet again. they have even gone as far as calling the police, gave them the description of my car, and my name, and told them that i was selling drugs in an attempt to get me arrested. that's not as low as they've gone, they've gone quite a bit lower, but it's the one that stands out, the rest of it is almost unbelievable. they've had five years to dig lower than that. so essentially, anything you can think of that a piece of human garbage with no morals would do in this situation, they have done. i would need someone to interview me to get the list straight. it is too long, i seriously start to get dizzy every time i even think about where to start about this .  i cannot afford a lawyer,  and i am totally unfamiliar with how adult protective services works,  but i am certain as soon as i make that call, i will be forced out of my home, and god only knows what they'll do with my grandmother.  and please,  if you're going to say ""they can't do that"",  the the law takes time to work, and these people don't. they jump on any opportunity they can find to make our lives as unpleasant as possible, so when i say that i'm worried about the roof over my head, what i mean is unless i physically stop these people, or have an armed guard at the front door, they will have the police here, backing them up, trying to force me out of my grandmothers home, well before i could get a lawyer to stop it. they've already done it once.so, safe to say, i'm trying to find an end to this situation. preferably one that doesn't leave my girlfriend and i homeless. and then i need to know what i can do to find some justice for this situation. everything that they've done in the last 8 years must have a consequence. there would be one now, if i had the time to organize one. preferably legally. anyway, my main concern is my grandmother. what's been happening to her emotionally, and financially. also, my girlfriend and i, once this is over, our future is..... i'm not going to mince words here, once this is over, we're going to be homeless. i don't know what to do, i don't know where to start, and i don't know where to find the energy to do either one. any constructive advice at all would be more appreciated than you could imagine. thank you.", if they're repeatedly doing illegal things to threaten and harm you with -

"hello everyone, i hope you are keeping safe and compassionately giving care 🧡🧡🧡.today i want to share a few strategies on how to communicate with alzheimer’s patients. i hope this will help those caring for loved ones with alzheimer’s and can’t seem to figure out how best to communicate with them.1. limit potential distractions while talking to them. it would help if you made sure that      there is nothing to distract the patient while having a conversation.  switch off the tv, radio, or any other devices, get rid of stuff that could divert their attention, or ensure the environment itself is not distracting.2. speak naturally and use non-verbal cues. do not speak to the patient like an infant with a      high pitch or by getting close to their face; it is very humiliating. if you want to get their attention, a gentle touch and calling them by their name works perfectly. non-verbal cues such as gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions are also important in connecting with the patient.3. talk one thing  at a time. it is important to discuss one topic/subject at a time to avoid      confusing the patient. while communicating, remain connected and present to ensure the patient maintains their line of thought on the subject matter.4. focus on simple conversations. learn to keep conversations short and simple by breaking      information into smaller chunks. do not repeat statements; instead, rephrase them. do not jump in when the patient struggles to find a word; they will be confused. patiently wait for them to remember the word with subtle hints here and there. repeating familiar words or names also helps build the patient’s familiarity with these words or names.5. be creative. you need to be creative in countering their resistance or frequent confusion      or reality. for instance, a retired patient can demand to leave for work because it is their duty. this could mean they are not engaged enough, and they need something to keep them busy. come up with creative activities that will keep them occupied. another example is when they decline to take a bath, you can offer them options, like an alternative time for them to  take a bath. should sound like this, *“jane, how about you take a bath at 2pm or does 3pm sound better?”*6. be patient,  compassionate, and avoid being aggressive. communicating with an  alzheimer’s patient can be very difficult, especially due to their  unpredictable emotional and mental states. be patient as you learn how  they communicate. use active listening, take everything they say into consideration, and act on their requests as long as they do not compromise  care. avoid arguing or talking back; instead, learn what triggers  emotional change and interpret their responses and attitudes to certain  situations.7. understand that  you play a crucial role as a caregiver. interacting and communicating with      an alzheimer’s patient will have some good and bad days. however, as a caregiver, you should aim at providing the best, even on the bad days. the patient relies on you for comfort, emotional, and mental support; therefore, learn to listen and communicate with them truthfully.please feel free to ask any questions or share any more strategies that have worked for you in the past.have a beautiful day, and keep loving and caring for your patients or loved ones 🧡🧡🧡", hi i need to do an interview with someone who is 55+ and their caregiver. would u mind if i interviewed you via zoom? please let me know.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/j413q6/simple_communication_strategies_for_a_patient_or/,,Simple Communication Strategies for a Patient or A Loved One with Alzheimer's.
"my grandmother (late 90’s with alzheimer’s) is showing signs of dysphasia- putting too much in her mouth, pocketing food or chewing it way to long without swallowing. she has had a few episodes where she nearly choked on food even with me closely monitoring her eating. i sweep her mouth and clap her back and she has been able to cough enough to clear it, but that’s just lucky. has anyone bought or used an anti-choking device? i’m looking at these two as an emergency option. i would try the heimlich if all else fails, but at her age and size (she’s like 4’6”) i also worry about injuries from that itself if i can even perform it correctly. [lifevac]([dechoker]("," rather than use a tool to fix choking after the fact, i would look into getting your grandmother evaluated by a speech therapist. speech therapists work closely with swallowing disorders. it may be that your grandma requires a specific food texture to avoid aspirating. thickened liquids can be beneficial to help avoid aspirating on beverages and pureed food or mechanical soft diets are also options for those with dysphagia. a speech therapist would be able to evaluate your grandmother and tell you which diet is best. altering her diet will prevent choking and make mealtimes much safer.

"hello reddit, long-time lurker, first time poster! not sure where to start, but i’ll try to keep this somewhat clear and organized. it’s going to be long though, sorry for that.the short of it: my father-in-law has dementia, my mother-in-law is getting spread very thin from caring for him by herself. i don’t know what kind of assistance we can be seeking for them to even start googling providers.we want to help, but i’m not sure where to start. mil definitely needs caregiver support in the form of a support group or therapist, but covid has made these kinds of interactions difficult to facilitate, and she is not really tech-savvy enough to manage telehealth consults. additionally, it would be difficult for her to do those because while she’s distracted is the time my fil decides he needs to tackle some complicated household chore that needs supervision, not to mention she would feel guilty about basically complaining about him within earshot.physically, my fil doesn’t require hardly any assistance. he runs errands, handles his usual household chores with relative ease, and takes care of his personal hygiene just fine. the stress for my mil comes from his behavior, which is uneven at best. obviously it’s part of the dementia package, but she’s really struggling with the loss of the man he’s been for their 50+ years of marriage while also trying to keep him from harming himself by taking on the tasks he shouldn’t be doing alone anymore. he has bouts of moodiness and extreme anxiety. he’s diabetic and under treatment, but she has to watch his meds because he doesn’t remember whether or not he’s taken them. he would easily over or under-dose without supervision. he can’t go to doctor’s appointments alone, because he either won’t follow what’s being said or remember anything that was said later. he obsesses over household tasks, but will also abandon them mid-work because he gets distracted and becomes obsessed over the distraction. he opens and closes all the doors in the house for no apparent reason, he resets the thermostat multiple times a day, as well as the fridge and freezer settings, to the frequent demise of certain groceries. he mows their lawn almost every day (two acres, flat, with a zero-turn). when mil tries to intervene or questions him even casually, he can become agitated, even mean with her. other times he’s frustrated with himself, angry at his inability to remember how to do things around the house or any time he knows he’s forgetting something, calling himself stupid or worthless.they are both very stubborn by nature. they’ve always been reluctant to ask for help in most things, and getting older certainly hasn’t dimmed that trait in the least. she occasionally confides in us about things that happen, but definitely not everything, and only when she’s reached a certain breaking point at the time. she definitely needs a safe space to unload periodically, but i don’t know how to make that happen for her. so. i guess the question is, how can i get them the help they need? where do i start? what can i do to help them while we work on finding help? thank you for any help you can offer, it’s really hard to watch them go through this."," this is a tough situation. i don't know much about resources in the area of therapy for your mil, but i do know a lot about patient advocacy, who can help support in areas like attending dr apts and taking notes. this would probably alleviate some stress from the caregiving your mil is doing. they could probably point you in the right direction for dementia-related resources locally.i know this doesn't cover the full scope of support you're searching for, but i hope it helps! happy to provide more resources in this arena if it's of interest to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/iwsnj3/how_do_i_start_finding_resources_for_my_aging/,,How do I start finding resources for my aging in-laws?
"as a caregiver some days i only speak with my grandma. and everyday she is the one i have more interactions with, by far. she having dementia and being really negative all her life that means i have to go through 5 hours minimum of complainings. (she has about 10 different tones she keeps altering everytime she feels a bit uncomfortable), demands and negativity.and that is the 50% of the battle for me. the other 30% is not sleeping for 8 hours in years. and the 20% that's left is what people probably think i do, with all the extras they will never get to know.my point is all that negativity can really mine you. today i just woke up reasonably ok, did my stretches wich i haven't done in months and i was so proud of that. then i listened to her calling me, she has a fine ear and probably heard me. so i told her i was going to take a shower. her answer was casual, common, simple and as full of negativity as it has always been: don't because you can get cold and sick. well, thank you. i myself struggle with simple things like that after years and years of give cares. and it is easy to see the reason.my solution? i am going to take that shower. shave and moist my skin. all with low music that makes me feel good. and understand i have to take care of myself and don't let myself get lost in that hell she is in. because it is clear i can't rescue her, there is no point into going into hell with her.18% of caregivers don't outlive the person they are taking care of. and even if my grandma is my only family, i am not becoming one in that statistic.after i will take care of her. and be patient while blocking all that negativity. have a nice day!"," yes, put on your own oxygen mask first.  and the only thing you can control is what’s between your ears - instead of framing it as listening to all the negativity, might be easier to look at it as sad because she never learned gratitude and/or acceptance.  motivates us to practice gratitude and acceptance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/iudvpy/block_negativity/,,Block negativity
"- i've been working w/ a client who is a vet, late 80's, multiple illnesses &amp; his wife, also in her 80's, suffers from alzheimer's and parkinson's. he calls himself a radical republican... he wants to chat about politics, religion, how much he dislikes liberals/women/millennials/black people/lgbt. i don't care for that, i'm just there to do what i need to do &amp; make sure him and his wife are good! he makes me feel so uncomfortable. he will follow me from room to room, block the entrance/exit and expects me to get real close to him to be able to pass through. if i go to the bathroom, he'll stand outside the door tapping or stomping his cane until i open the door. he looks at me in a weird way. i mean i just feel so uncomfortable. when it's time for me to leave, he'll try to keep me there as long as possible talking to me, even following me to my car.  he's follows me and talks to me so much that he neglects his poor wife. i'm afraid one day he won't let me leave. i've already let my boss know i will be quitting this client and just finish the week. but i'm still kinda scared he may try to do something to me. i just get this uneasy vibe from him. he looks harmless, but my women's intuition is telling me i am in danger if i continue to stay working with the client.my boss tried to make me feel bad like if i'm doing wrong by not putting up with the client, but her boss said this isn't the first time they've heard similar things about the client. in order to do my best i need to feel safe and comfortable. i'm not going to apologize for quitting on a client. i have to do what's best for me. dealing with this client has taken a toll on my mental health."," don’t go back. he’s threatening and he could totally hurt you (with his cane, if not another weapon!). he may be old, but he is angry as hell and amped up.of course you can’t do your best work. you already go into a closed private environment to work with people at their homes. it requires trust on both sides. i suspect that at least part of his behavior is controllable, but not by you. it’s not your job to sacrifice yourself this way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/iu3bs7/finishing_out_the_week_with_a_client/,,Finishing out the week with a client

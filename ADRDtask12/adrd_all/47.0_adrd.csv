"so. i am a post-graduate student in a university town in the uk, and in order to save money, a year ago, i moved in to lodge with a lady with dementia we'll call sylvia. she is still relatively young, under 70, but unfortunately got dealt the shit hand of developing a slowly advancing front-temporal dementia about five years ago. in exchange for cheap rent, i help her out a bit, make sure she's eating and share my cooking, keep her some company, take care of her cat, and make sure she doesn't blow up the house with the gas-cooker etc. etc. etc. she also gets carers to come in during the day when i'm usually away. the living situation isn't completely without it's stresses - but neither without it's joys, and i'm quite attached to sylvia by now.every dementia patient is different. in many ways sylvia is lucky.physically sylvia is in excellent shape and doesn't even need to take any medication. gets around the house and likes to make endless cups of coffee and eat ridiculous amounts of jam toast. she is usually always in a good mood (can get irritated tho if she feels she's being ""babied"" or ""restricted"" too much), not paranoid or scared. no clear delusions/hallucinations. has never forgotten who somebody is. surprisingly well-working memory still in some contexts, even short-term; like, she remembered what my friend who visited 6 months ago was wearing when i myself would have absolutely no chance of remembering that??? you can let her be by herself for fairly long stretches of time still without worrying she'll do something dangerous to herself or others. doesn't need help with personal hygiene or eating. really enjoys people. she still goes by herself to shop for treats in a local sainsbury's. in general, i feel like she has a pretty good quality of life, and has no major obstacles that would stop her from enjoying it to the fullest. however, she is a dementia patient, and this comes obvious pretty quickly when you talk to her. her speech is the main thing that has suffered; some days you can actually get fairly normal and lucid conversations out of her. but, lot of the time she mixes words and names, comes up with just weird warbled/blurred versions (""shitchven"" for ""kitchen""), has to pause to search for words. often it's not quite clear if she understands what you say to her, because she will reply with something completely unrelated. but, with some patience, you can still communicate with her and even have whole conversations.sylvia also does just odd, odd things; like, tries to feed her cat jam toast or cereal. would only eat endless sugary treats if somebody didn't put proper meals in front of her. puts on incredibly strange outfits; different paired shoes, two skirts over a pair of trousers. doesn't really have understanding of social cues and ""normality""; like, will get overtly excited to chat to strangers on the street. can't really comprehend any conceptions of time anymore. can't use gadgets like phone or microwave. she gets weirdly obsessed or fixated about one item for long periods of time. doesn't quite have a grasp of reality on some things; like, her son mentioned they should take a trip to france in the future, and she spent the next three months packing for france and saying she needs to go heathrow soon and just couldn't take it in that the trip wasn't actually happening anytime soon.  so, overall, when you first meet sylvia she comes across as bat-shit crazy to be honest, and you wouldn't be able to tell that she is still coping with many things independently pretty well. she loves to take walks and will go for short 15-30 min walks now that the weather is good. she's never had any trouble finding home or been confused where she is; her memory simply isn't affected like that by the disease, so far at least.  *but*. recently, we've had a lot of run-ins with the police and complaining neighbours. because, you know, she looks like a dementia patient. for example, in one week, the police brought her home twice, because she was out for a walk wearing a dressing gown (over her normal clothes - not just the dressing gown!) and people got worried and called the police. and i get it, you know? i appreciate people are worried and care for fellow citizens. if i saw someone like sylvia on the street, who spoke like sylvia does, i'd probably call the police as well to make sure she isn't a dementia patient on the run. but what i do not get is how quickly these strangers feel like they need to start lecturing me (or her sons) about dementia and telling me how she should be cared for. the second time the police got incredibly angry with me and started questioning why she doesn't have someone watching her 24/7. she wasn't harming anyone - only wearing a dressing gown on the street outside her home? the police just wouldn't accept that she is perfectly safe taking a 15 minute walk outside, and that she's never had any problem finding home. ""yes but dementia patients often forget where they are and might walk miles and miles and get lost....."" ""it's a progressing disease, you never know when she might hurt herself..."" ""she should be in a home if you can't watch her all the time...""we've also had lots of well-meaning emails from neighbours in the community, worried because sylvia is seen outside in her weird outfits. ""why is she out by herself?"". most of these people are quite happy once they hear there are people who care and are keeping and eye on sylvia. but lots of them don't. e.g. one of sylvia's ""friends"", who lives just down the street, ran into sylvia in the street for the first time in a long time. she was just shocked how sylvia isn't watched all the time. now she's launched a campaign of battering me and her sons with emails how ""worried"" she is about sylvia and how we are not taking her disease seriously, she needs more carers, she needs to be in a home. strange how all this worry and care, and deep understanding of sylvia's needs, suddenly rose up during a 15 minute run-in, as she hasn't visited sylvia even once during the whole year i've lived here...i know dementia. i specifically know sylvia's dementia in great detail. i've lived with her for a year. i deal with the painful risks vs. benefits balances of looking after a dementia patient all the time. and we've agreed that so far, we don't feel like there's any great need to worry for her safety when she goes for her short walks or grocery trips by herself. she benefits from the exercise. she benefits from the sense of some freedom and independence. the only other alternative would be to move her into a care home - which isn't necessarily the ""safer"" option. she might just get really depressed outside of her own home. the care and food in the home that she can afford might be abysmal. lots of dementia patients deteriorate very quickly when you move them out of home. i mean we *could* lock her up now because of the fear that any day could be the first day when she won't be able to find her way back home - but is that sort of 100% security really worth losing all the things that still make her life still worth living? we think about these sort of things all the time! i just feel like... underneath all this well-meaning neighbourly worry about a dementia patient, is actually just fear of getting older, and being different and unwell. people just don't *want* to see a person in a dressing gown on their street, because it makes them uncomfortable to have to see that dementia exists and what old age does to people. they want them out of their sight, out of their mind. people want to feel like *they're* the good person who *truly* care, when they step in and tell us what sylvia needs after a 15-minute conversation with her - instead of, you know, actually trying to listen to us who know her and who've spent a lot time thinking what she needs to make the illness tolerable and to advance as slowly as possible. isn't there an alternative world where we try to deal with dementia as a community? everyone tolerates and accepts that you know, sylvia sometimes wears a dressing gown outside, because she has dementia. let's be happy that the exercise helps her and the walks make her happy. maybe, instead of trying to pressure us to get her out of your sight, you could e.g. promise to keep an eye out and let us know if she's doing something truly concerning and out-of-norm (for *her*). is this a really crazy dream?***sorry, this turned out to be rather long rant, maybe just needed to vent. don't know if i'm looking for advice, or similar experiences, or what. but sometimes feels good to just rant a bit!", aw. i love sylvia. she's lucky to have you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vnpugf/ranting_about_dealing_with_worried_neighbours/,Ranting about dealing with worried neighbours
"hellofrom december 2021 my grandma start showing signs of dementia, it increased gradually as the time goes by.i noticed this when talking to her over the video call, she would repeat things like if i had dinner, drink my milk, etc...around some month ago i moved my grandma with me as my aunt doesn't want to live with her due to her condition (they also didn't consult any doctor due to money problems)anyways, mra show her brain is shrinking, doctor said we can't reverse this but can slow down the process, he diagnosed her with dementia, brain atrophy and depression.after the two days of medicines, her memory starts reappearing, although she keeps mixing old and new things (from current and 20 year ago) like she think i bought her to my house two days ago,  she is not forgetting things easily, she also become aware that she's in a new place (she doesn't like my house much lol).eventually in a day or two she remembers everything and why i moved her with me, she become angry at my uncle and aunt, also started crying when i told her that she's with me since two months not two days and told her about her medical condition.i calmed her down and after an hour or two i noticed that she's again becoming that old person when i bought her with me.and by the end of the day she again become that old person.today after one month same thing is happening again, her memory is reappearing in the same exact pattern, and i am sure by tomorrow morning she will remember everything from her past life.i don't know what to do, should i tell her about her medical conditions and why she's in my house or lie to her?she asked me today where she is in the morning, i didn't say anything but now at night think i live here because of my job and this house is given to me by the company (it was true 2 year ago where i got job in other city and the living accommodation was given by the company)one more thing to note, it only happens after the visit of a doctor (1 month ago psychiatrist and today after visiting orthopedist) so im guessing this kind of event triggers her memory?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vnojwm/my_grandma_memory_come_and_go/,My grandma memory come and go

"this list may be incomplete as i can not recall all the horrors i've witnessed from this disease but here goes.1.attempting to stop dangerous irrational behaviours like putting keys into a light socket when he had keys,eating things that are not edible,pouring gas all over his lawn mower before i took that away. many other strange behaviours.2.combative and aggression from this disease. i've been cussed at and spit on and hit in the face(he broke my glasses) multiple times and chased by my uncle with a colored pencil when he didn't know who i was he tried to stab me. 3.poop. its everywhere when i try to clean him i have to stop him from scratching his undercarriage or else he'll get poop on his hands which when he has before and he's tried to fight me with it all over his hands. i'm going to get him coveralls to stop him from digging in his diaper at night a fucking shit covered nightmare.4.stuck inside all day listening to incessant nonsensical blah blah while keeping him busy or focused on coloring or watching tv which he tries to beat up the tv so we watch kid shows all day.5.going to a store or park is difficult because he tries to steal things or talk to people he doesn't know or even go with them and driving with him to get to these places is becoming impossible. 6. relatives who admitt to not wanting to help because he's an angry incontinent gross insane old person. this one is very frustrating.7.child proofing every inch of our home and its still not enough to keep him out of trouble. there are sensors and ring noise making alarms on every door and window(i'll be hearing dingdongs in hell i'm sure). to get in the fridge or out the front/back door i've gotta carry keys for every door.i'm going to stop here cause i'm rambling at this point and just wanted to say if anyone out there has better options in life please take them. i can't because with out my demented uncle i'd be without a home and i have just enough money to my name to where when he passes away sometime soon i hope(yeah i'm awful i know) then i can take over paying rent til i find a job. my life sucks and i'm paying for it. i love my uncle he helped raise me but this devil i endure is no longer my uncle. i'm tired and dead inside but ill be ok,i'll continue on."," hugs and deepest understanding.  sounds like you were a fly on the wall in my house.  it's extremely stressful, hurtful and frightening.  now that my loved one is finally in a long term memory care facility (er doc wouldn't let him return home after a seizure and head injury at home) i've had some time to reflect on the devastating, frightening personality changes.this is not your loved one, this is the disease.  your uncle would no doubt be horrified if he had the presence of mind to observe his behavior.  his brain is an organ that is literally being attacked and destroyed by a progressive, incurable disease.  i know that this is very little comfort when you're right in the middle of living the nightmare of progressive dementia.  all i can offer is my heartfelt compassion and the reassurance that this has nothing to do with you or your uncle's true feelings about you.  my hope for you is that you and your uncle will be spared a prolonged progression.  and, as i hope for myself, that some day, memories of the man you knew, loved and respected will replace the painful memories of this severe illness.  peace and best wishes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vnmvki/the_worst_ive_dealt_with_so_far/,The worst I've dealt with so far
"my mom is 88 with who knows what kind of dementia. she’s had it for about 4or 5 years. she lives with my brother who works full time and is there at night. a year ago she was able to board a small bus service and go to the senior day center, eat lunch and socialize and the bus brought her back home. then slowly she forgot how to get back in the house and we had to stop that. she was using a cell phone correctly then, but now not possible. i had to retire from my job (rn for 38 years) and take social security because all 3 of her children work in another town and i’m the only one old enough to get ss. she is a very social person and loves to talk, so i don’t want to subject the other “normal” seniors at the day center to her dementia talk. so it’s just me and she doesn’t think i’m a relative, but i’m not stimulating enough for her. i guess she thinks i’m the maid! we found a nice memory care facility and she’s next on the list. i truly think this place would make her last years enjoyable for her, she will have a private room, they have lots of activities, field trips, and especially others like her who she can talk crazy to.i am feeling happy for her in that i think she will enjoy it there, but one of the physicians at work said to me “wouldn’t it just be easier to move her into your home?” and then i started to feel guilty…but my home doesn’t have a walk in shower and has multiple steps up and down. and mostly it doesn’t have the stimulating environment. i’m constantly telling myself that it’s to improve her quality of life before she declines even more and enjoys nothing. i know this group will understand my feelings, and thanks for sharing your stories. this shit is hard!"," as a nurse with 38 years' experience, i believe you already know the answer to this. don't let other peoples' crappy advice steer you away from what seems to be a well thought out solution, complete with regard to her ability for contentment, socialization, and safety.  it sounded to me that you were not quite ready to retire, yet. or maybe you wanted to spend this time pursuing other interests/jobs now that you are not tied to nursing. no need to feel guilty. and at the end of the day, she can just as easily fall or get injured at your house or an alf, or a nursing home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vnlp5x/my_experience/,My experience

"posted this to /caregiversupport but posting here toomy (30f) mother (69f) has alzheimer’s and has had it for several years now. we currently live with my stepdad (79m) who has always been emotionally and verbally abusive to me. they got married when i was about 11 and i’ve always just been with my mom so i never adjusted to him being in the picture. he didn’t make an effort to get to know me and as i got older our relationship just never progressed. since my moms diagnosis in 2015, i’ve stepped in to help take care of her while living with them and since pandemic working from home. long story short, the emotional and verbal abuse got physical this weekend where my stepdad grabbed me and pretended like he was going to punch me. i called the cops and had them write a report, just in case anything happens later on. the next day i found an apartment very close to their place so that i could move but still be close enough to take care of mom. i’m writing here to get tips on navigating this since i know it will be a difficult change for everyone, but i just think it’s something i must do for my own sanity. caregiving has been really tough on me as i’m the only child and our family lives in a different country. i shouldn’t feel anxious when i go home, but i do and have for a long time. i’ve tried to apply for in home care in 2017 but we were denied because of stepdads income. however my mom was 64 at the time so it was income based eligibility. not sure if now at her age would be any different. my stepdad and i tried applying for aid &amp; attendance from the va but have yet to hear back. i’m working with a social worker to figure out our options but slim pickings for our situation. mom is now in moderate to severe stages but can still do some things for herself, just needs guidance and someone there. stepdad is irresponsible with money and didn’t quite set up the rest of their lives so i’m trying to see what i can do or how to help. now, about the move, i know this will be hard on all but i’m wondering if it would be best to leave my mom in an environment she knows. whenever we’re out she’s constantly saying she wants to go home and she knows this is her home and feels safe here. my stepdad is not abusive to her as he is with me and my mom still doesn’t let anyone forcefully grab her or tell her what to do most days. i am signing a lease to a place that does have a spare bedroom. i am wondering what would be best for my mom or the best way to navigate this. maybe move out first and see how she adjusts to that? i would be coming here morning, lunch, and dinner. or just take her with us into this new place away from her husband and dog? any help, tips, suggestions welcome.thanks for reading!!"," if stepdad has retired since 2017 and now he has only social security, the income may be low enough by now. what state?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vmvpdm/moving_with_dementia/,Moving with dementia

"dear friends, my father has been displaying what we (my mom and i) suspect are early signs of dementia for the last three years or so. we have not been able to get a concrete diagnosis (part of which is because of where he lives), but i think his short-term memory losses are significant enough to  warrant this conclusion. also, this definitely runs in his family - his father and several older brother had it.he's taking medications per the advice of the local neurologist and is being cared for by my mom, but it would be really useful for me to know what else i could do to help him. i live abroad, so i think i'd really benefit from an online support group for dementia caregivers, particularly for people in the earlier stages of dementia. i feel like in this situation, i could use a lot of nitty gritty details of what to say to him, what not to say, how to set up a routine to help him from a distance, what to expect going forward, warning signs, and other such tips and tricks.can anyone suggest such a support group? i've previously posted about him once before on this sub, and got beneficial replies - so hoping for that trend to continue. other than this, if anyone thinks i can benefit from books or videos on early dementia - please feel free to suggest them as well. i've watched a few youtube lectures on the topic, but for the most part they focus on people in more advanced stages.thanks again!", ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vmc7js/support_group_for_longdistance_caregivers/,"Support group for long-distance ""caregivers"""

"***i want to open this rant by saying that i love my grandma, she is/was a fantastic beautiful loving human being before dementia, i say this now because i am fully aware that this rant will likely make me sound like a very hateful grandson.***&gt;tldr: grandmother with dementia had a psychotic episode and has to be heavily medicated to remain stable in a care facility, doesn't believe she needs medication, got a marriage proposal from a physically disabled man 25 years her junior in the same home under seemingly false pretense's and now they will both likely wind up homeless.quick recap of my families situation.my 76yr old grandmother has been living with dementia since around 2019 now, probably more like 2018 as that's when we started noting that her short term memory wasn't to good. my mom and my grandmothers younger sister spent a good year politely trying to convince her to see a doctor for her memory issues to no real avail. when she finally went, they diagnosed her with dementia, this in turn caused her to have a ***psychotic episode*** that through a series of events led to her living at home with my parents, this proved to be in no way feasible as my grandmother would regularly try to escape and often became physically violent when told she couldn't just ''leave'' on her on volition for safety reasons, on one occasion she even produced a firearm ***(we didn't know she was in possession of at the time)*** and threatened to kill my mother and herself with it, my mother was home alone when this happened and fortunately was able to talk her down and get the gun away from her. around this time my grandmother began bragging to us about how she would leave the house in the middle of the night and wander blocks away was when it became apparent that between varying work schedules and the nature of my grandmothers condition and new aggressive behavior that we were completely out of our depth in providing proper care for her.over the course of only a few weeks my parents racked up over $15,000 in hospital fee's because my grandmother insisted that she go every time she had an episode, the problem was with our broken fucking medical system in the united states, they would run a blood test on her and then come back to us and say, well she's as healthy as a horse! there's no need for her to be here and send her on her way. three times...three times this had to happen because my grandmother would go there and put on a good face and be on her best behavior for the staff and then when she came back home with us, it was like a switch flipped and she would go back to being fucking psychotic. finally on the third visit we flat out refused to take her back, basically telling the hospital that we weren't going to take her home forcing them to keep her for more than a couple of hours, finally after two days there her ''best behavior'' façade caved in and she attacked the hospital staff with kitchen utensils.long story short, my mom got a lawyer, did her research and got my grandmother into the second best care facility in our hometown under medicaid (highest rated was booked up). i'm going to shorten this next part significantly as all the nuances aren't as relevant as the big picture.but, essentially what happened was getting a lawyer, spending more money than they had and getting my grandma on medicaid and dealing with her assets (no written will) completely exhausted my mother emotionally and mentally and to a lesser extent i as well. around this time, my grandma's younger sister decided after a few months that she couldn't stand seeing her in a care facility and made an agreement with my mother that she would take her out of the facility and take her home with her two states away, but my mother made sure she understood that by doing this she was going to be taking over the power of attorney and absorbing all responsibilities involving my grandma as she (my mother) could not go through it all again. long story short, this lasted just under a year before she realized she couldn't handle it either, which prompted her to bring my grandma back home and get her into another care facility.fortunately to this day, younger sister still holds poa and continues to hold up her end of the bargain handling the legal and billing issues.however, if you've read this far, that only just brings you up to speed with our now current issue.my grandmother has talked about escaping the facility she's in since day one almost, insisting that she can live on her own in her own house, which she can't not only because she is mentally incapable but also because there was no written will, we were forced to spend her life savings by the government to renovate her house and rent it out until she passes away, my mother saves all the money she makes from the renters and only spends it on necessities for my grandmother. we cannot do anything else with the house until my grandmother passes away which could be 10 or 20 years given that she's in perfect physical condition. anyway, my grandmother has now met a man 25 years her junior in the care facility who is there not for any mental issues but because he is a real bad off diabetic who had his legs amputated and needs regular dialysis treatments. he has asked her to marry to him, she has agreed. upon learning of this my mother spoke with head of the care facility who had a meeting with this man (mike is his name) in which she explained to mike that my grandmother is suffering from dementia and her condition is only going to worsen over time.evidently mike has disregarded this information and is continuing forward with their plans. now, what i suspect but don't know for a fact has happened is that my grandmother has told mike that she is in possession of a paid off house which is no longer true, but she believes this. so mike likely sees an able bodied person who can tend to his needs has become close with her, and she see's him as her ticket out of the care facility. this is just speculation on my behalf, but i don't know what is going to happen if they check themselves out. i've recently learned that despite the fact she is diagnosed with dementia that she can actually check herself out of the facility anytime she wants though she currently does not know this. but its already been established that mike has no family and no real means to take care of himself other than a pitiful monthly social security check, he also has no house to go to.so what will likely end up happening is total homelessness as soon as they set foot outside of the care facility. my grandmother requires daily medication (which she insists she doesn't need) to keep herself reasonably level after her psychotic episode, left to her own devices she will absolutely 100% not take this medication. as i said earlier, mike requires dialyses and it completely invalid and unable to work or care for himself yet of sound mind he somehow believes this is a good idea.  what a fucking mess...i want to be angry and my grandmother, her stubbornness has fractured her relationship with my mother and most of the family, yet...i can't be, at least not fully, she is not the same person she was just 10 years ago, that person would never have let any of this happen, dementia did this to her and now this lovesick and/or opportunistic moron mike is going to ensure they both wind up living on the streets. we have essentially given up. we have tried multiple times to get the best care for her and it has blown up every time, we cannot do this anymore, my mother for sure cannot.", <<<hug>>> dementia sucks the life out more than just a brain. it messes with the minds and hearts of those who care for a loved one. find your peace knowing you

to leave something behind as a warning and advice for people in similar situations. this won’t be a text that is well written because my cognitive abilities are drastically reduced as well as my vocabulary after 3 months of rapid dementia.but i want you to try to understand my point and the urgency of my insights that may save somebodies life.i am not a doctor and i can only speak from my own experience about the severe trauma i was living with. it completely controlled my life without me even realizing it. i will share with you how i analyzed the behavior of my mental illness and how it manifested itself in my mind and body.insanity and trauma are the most cunning things in the world. it is not a joke and should never be underestimated. apart from physical disability or illness that is honest and straightforward insanity is not as clear and it operates by deceiving the mind and leading it to destruction.if you are lazy beyond the norm and refuse to work, if you refuse to educate yourself and think success is not for you, you might be traumatized. if you think you are spiritual and have spiritual ‘’symptoms’’ that are not aligned with life and living, by being constantly exhausted, depressed brain fogged, you might be experienced anything but spirituality, but a manifestation of trauma symptoms. as malicious and occult as it may sound trauma can present itself as a living entity that is sucking the life force from you, leading you ultimately to your demise. insanity as i was living with it, completely gripped the essence of my thought process and kept me in delusion for 15 years. i not only believed the thoughts i was having but was convinced beyond any doubt, with body, mind and soul that there has to be truth to them. my emotions, my intuition, even my heart was driven and aligned with the schizophrenic doctrine my mind created due to childhood trauma. as you can see unfortunately this means that when somebody is insane the whole psycho physical, mind and body can serve to deceive a person. its more than the typical hallucinations, hearing voices, and having conspiracy theories that we see in movies that make somebody insane. a person can be partly insane and be completely convinced they are normal, just following a higher path that nobody understands, just like i thought i was. if the thoughts do not support life and living normally then a person should try to question if there is truth to them. there is nothing wrong with being normal and ordinary and earning an honest living. loving life and being grateful for what it is and not searching for some fantastical worlds that don’t exist. i never realized what enlightenment is and i don’t care about it at all. all i wish for is a healthy brain but that won’t come now. i would have lived so much differently.my ideology was belief that there is no such thing as work or human will, that those things are illusions and that they are ultimately not important for realizing the truth about the world. i was aspiring to be a homeless bum, living as a fool for christ in divine truth and bliss. i believed in the force of undoing or unworking and that it is like a black whole that devours everything and extinguishes everything, and ultimately when we experience this black nothingness, we see truth. i had many instances where i did work and tried to persist in my endeavors but believing i was spiritual undervalued my efforts, and the very meaning of work and success. voices told me that work and knowledge are not important and that i was beyond them. that i don’t need it to be happy and enlightened. so, i was willingly retarding myself and regressing unconsciously while thinking this is a good thing. after dementia arouse and started desecrating my brain, this illusion collapsed and i realized that such thoughts came because of an extreme sense of worthlessness. which i was living with and considered normal. when a person is traumatized, they live with extreme and abnormal feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness, that they consider normal because they learned these things and didn’t feel anything else. a glimpse of power and true value feels almost like death to their sick sense of self. and they might even fear it because their whole identity is challenged and shaken to the core. this is why work; knowledge, creativity and education are transformative tools for somebody living with trauma. they were the only cure for me except i realized this too late. the human will and will to work, and create, and love, and enjoy the successes it brings is a divine force, not at all to be undervalued like most spiritual teachers suggest, by saying do nothing or let go of effort. when people have trauma work is the only salvation they have to live a normal life. so, if you refuse to work and think its something spiritual moving you in this direction seriously consider you might be wrong. now i will share some of my childhood story and how dementia happened. my story begins by me being born with a physical disability called artogriphosis. i had bent arms and legs which could not be stretched, kind of like a baby is positioned in the stomach curled up, that’s how i was when i got out. however devastating this situation seemed at first, there was hope, because by exercising diligently i could walk and eventually stretch my arms half way. i had all the function and potential of a normal child. the problem came while doing the very exercises because they were invasive, complicated and painful. i slept with plasters every night and all this lasted for the first 12 years of my life. my parents while doing a remarkable job of straightening my body didn’t consider that i could be emotionally damaged by the process. and thus, they convinced themselves and me that i was completely normal, which i wasn’t. those painful exercises created severe trauma that was left untreated and considered normal. in my 19 year i developed ‘’out of nowhere’’ a severe debilitating anxiety towards life and work. i had constant feelings of subconscious terror, which were relentless and constant every day all day. i tried many things to help myself and gave full attention to my psychological problem, which was paradoxically, a huge mistake. in the 15 years of living with this anxiety i learned to live with it and considered it a normal part of me. the only problem was i wasn’t productive and didn’t work and live independently. so, i read psychological books and all sorts of stuff and came across spirituality and eventually developed the doctrine i mentioned before.in my opinion symptoms of dementia can come at any age if a person lives with extreme psychological burden. it starts the cognitive decline gradually and very gently as years go by so the sufferer can forget the pain. it introduces a wide variety of symptoms that mimic so many of the ‘’spiritual symptoms’’ i read about over the years. brain fog, constant tiredness, sleepiness, a sense of peace, beingness and bliss that comes in doing nothing and sleep and rest. so all these ‘’positive’’ symptoms were actually dementia in my case, mistaken and confused for spirituality. in my opinion anything that reduces one’s abilities and qualities of life should be discarded whether it be ‘’spiritual’’ or not. the pain never ended and i was just becoming dumber and dumber and more tired, and unable to concentrate for longer periods.  in my confusion i mistook these sensations as positive and even advisable which kept me in massive delusion. even efforts to work and keep my passion alive were diminished by an unnatural exhaustion that came over me as time went by. and then i thought work truly must not exist as i am truly unable to sustain my will towards it, this otherworldly tiredness is keeping me from it. it must be a sign that the force of undoing(dementia) is the true reality. that tiredness came from dementia and it was just an illusion and breakable by sustaining the effort. it might be unlikely, but if anyone identifies with my experience, my advice is to keep going and resist the exhaustion for it is a lie trying to keep you asleep. there is nothing spiritual and worthwhile in death and dementia. life is a force to be lived, not spent asleep and tired all the time.the final straw happened 3 months ago, when i took ciprofloxacin ear drops for mild noise induced hearing loss. i overdosed by mistake using them for 14 days instead of 7 as prescribed. even though it was a relatively low dose of 2 drops each day, the final day my system collapsed. perhaps due to my already overloaded brain, and combined with this poisonous medication i finally enraged and triggered dementia. now the decline that was very slow and would have kept going on for 30 years or more, has accelerated 10000 times. i presume i have about 5 years of very unfulfilling life left. i will never experience the success i could have had. the love and joy of life i could have had. it was overshadowed by constant feelings of ungratefulness and arrogance.  believing i was beyond this world and its preciousness i was watching it go by me, waiting for my spiritual revelation which never came. i was very arrogant and ungrateful thinking that things cannot possibly be worse due to my anxiety. incredibly, things can be 10000 worse than they are. now i have dementia. the only right way forward for me was to accept the anxiety and reconcile that i have to live with it like any other handicap. and do everything in my power to work and live independently. work is the ultimate expression of value and love towards oneself which trauma cannot endure, that’s why it does everything in its power to resist it.so, this is it. i talked about my life choices and some spiritual traps that people might fall into. i feel very vulnerable writing this and even a bit stupid, wondering who on earth will want to read this depressive story, but honestly id give anything if somebody told me in the right moment how wrong i was. for years nothing could sway me from my stubborn convictions. the world is getting increasingly more insane as we can witness. spiritually can be the source of massive confusion as well, and by me interpreting it the wrong way, or actually falling for its lies i ended up like this. i wish i had never read anything about it. you might argue that its not my fault for getting these severe side effects from that drug. in a way you would be right but its the life choices and ideology that led to this. my unwillingness to educate myself and work left me underdeveloped. i didn’t know that antibiotic in topical form is still dangerous, i didn’t follow the prescription, i didn’t research the side effects properly, so all these mistakes led to this. the ideology of undoing and not knowing, that false spirituality that i had so much faith in and surrendered completely to, destroyed me in the end. it was insanity and trauma and dementia taking form of something incredibly valuable to me.farewell friends or enemies, i do hope this gives some value to anyone and people can at least learn from my mistakes. some key points:work, knowledge and creativity is more than means to an end. it can transform our life and destroy trauma and mental illness. because they represent love and support life. they are life.perfectionism and working eternally on your issues, waiting to first solve them and then return to the world, is trauma keeping you enslaved in eternal rumination which leads to nowhere. the only way is to ignore it. work, be creative, learn about history, geography, economy medicine, science... each day enrich your mind little by little. keep dementia away, keep ignorance away. massive suffering can naturally create symptoms of dementia like brain fog, forgetfulness and a false sense of peace that comes from oblivion, as well as sleepiness. don’t satisfy yourself by thinking this as a spiritual symptom. enlightenment if it exists might require force and enormous willpower contrary to much of the gurus say. not surrendering helplessly to the void and waiting for things to change. wake up by force, resist the antilife forces of the world. insanity can take form of some of our most precious values and ideas like spirituality, love, religion, trust, hope, etc. it can trick and turn them against us. sometimes you can’t trust your own mind, your emotions, your intuition, even your body that can create feelings of exhaustion. especially if it tells you to be homeless and renounce the world like it told me. its more than just a thought that keeps us in delusion.some chronic traumas only get worse over time, it won’t solve by itself no matter how long your ‘’spiritual process’’ lasts. and if you are destined to live with it, live the best and most fulfilling life you can. live now. don’t sleep and rely on dementia to take you.if you don’t work or know anything, and you depend on somebody to work and provide for you, you still won’t survive. because such a lifestyle attracts natural catastrophes and disasters in form of disease, dementia, insanity or disability. you are never safe by being stupid. it can cost you your life like it did me. love and gratitude is most important. learning from ‘’ordinary’’ people enjoying their company respecting and appreciating them. just being normal is the best thing in the world, and not being narcissistic. i unconsciously thought i was better than everyone. now i see ‘’enlightenment’’ in everyone. we are just great as we are, trying our best to go by and nothing more is ever needed. i’m sorry. you can’t imagine how sorry i am. i wasted my life for an illusion.i was insane, i was misled. may god forgive me, may you forgive me, may the world forgive me. i failed to live. i was confused and alone, marked by misfortune. if there is another life, i will never make the same mistake again. be well

"hey all,background: let (32m, exhausted) and my mom (72f, alzheimer's)has anybody felt this heavy guilt of not being able to stay positive while being a fulltime caretaker? i used to wake up around the same time as my mom, cook breakfast with her, take her ""out on the town"" lol, and whatnot. we had fun despite her initial quirks, and i was able to work from home so there was a degree of separation when needed.lately her decline has made her a bit more dismal. she won't keep the lights on in the house, she is forgetting more and more, and she is repeating things that i've specifically said not to do (tries to mow the lawn in 100º temps, doesn't drink water, etc). i was laid off so i'm stressed trying to find a job and i haven't had as much time to focus on her 24/7 and it makes me feel like a pos son because i'll check in on her throughout the day and she just seems so lonely and doesn't want to do anything (she is still capable of showering, changing herself, basic cooking, taking care of our dog, etc).anything she wants to do is directly focused on trying to take care of me but inadvertently it irritates me because she's supposed to be taking care of herself. and that makes me feel like a terrible caretaker but in order to care for her i need to be at my best, personally and financially...i feel so defeated by the whole situation. all my efforts and energy are being put into combating a disease with no light at the end of the tunnel, and it feels like i'm losing any motivation for myself. i of course ensure she is taken care of, and i hire a cna from time to time to come spend time with her and take her out and stuff but i can tell that she's still my mom and still able to be feeling my energy draining; she wants to do what she can to help me but can't. she has told me in her lucid moments that she feels like she has no purpose anymore and it breaks my heart. i just tell her that her purpose is to stay as healthy and happy as possible...which is difficult when she sees i'm in this rut after losing my job. i love my mom and want what's best for her but i'm running on fumes after any of her episodes and i need time to myself to decompress. i've taken to just checking in on her then going back to my room. i know this is mainly a vent about how my life has been impacted... i'm still empathetic and compassionate but this burn out in all aspects of my life is beginning to take a toll and the guilt of not being able to make my mom's final years as happy as possible is weighing me down. no matter what i do i can't seem to win. my plan is to accept the things i can control, find a job, and improve my attitude so that i'm not so irritable. i'll keep hiring the cna so my mom has a break in her day a couple times a week (she has begun getting more anxious when her routine is interrupted but still enjoys going to the senior center and stuff) so that i can focus on myself. if you made it to the end of this, thank you! i appreciate it and am open to any advice."," i'm the same age as you caring for my 69 year old mom. there's absolutely no way to do it on your own.do you have a durable power of attorney and an advanced directive set up? have you looked into memory care? also, not to be nosy but are you paying for things like the cna out of her money and not your own?my mom is getting to the point, and i'm getting so burned out after 2 years, that i'm starting an application for a memory care facility. i think it's important to stay focused on the fact that it's just going to keep getting worse for them and harder for you to keep them engaged and safe. you also don't know how long they'll live, especially in their early 70s. many caregivers suffer burnout and experience their own health issues from it.i was also able to work from home, but it got to the point where i needed to be a lot more ""active"" in my care to keep her engaged. i'm lucky enough that i was able to quit my job, but i don't want this to be my next decade of life, and it's ok to say that!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vlbz9b/guilt_from_feeling_burned_out_by_caretaking/,Guilt from feeling burned out by caretaking?

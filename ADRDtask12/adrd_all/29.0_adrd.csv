"both of them got alzheimer’s about the same age. my grandma died five years after a diagnosis at 58 and passed at 53. my dad is 60 and got a diagnosis. what could be my chances of getting the disease as well? is it preventable now or will i 100% get it? i already don’t drink, eat healthy, work a physical job for a retail company and take a multi vitamin/ginkgo biloba. i am 32. my dad was a heavy drinker/pot smoker, neither of which i do (he was always a happy/goofy drunk). could that have elevated his chances and caused an early onset?", depends on what mutation they carried and how it's transmitted basically.lifestyle does tend to affect it so the drugs might have hastened his onset but it's hard to say.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ct5y18/early_onset_with_both_grandma_and_dad/,Early onset with both grandma and dad

"my dad's father was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's disease. his mom is also in the early stages of dementia. my grandparents have been strangers to me my whole life. they live in florida and we live in maryland. besides a family party or two and a phone call here and there, i have barely ever seen them or talked to them. i'm 19. now that my grandparents are dangers to themselves if they continue to live on their own, my father and his sister have brought them up to md to make decisions on what needs to be done. they come over our house sometimes, but are staying at my aunt's house until my sister and i go back to university. my grandparents have been fighting any decisions my dad has made for them. my aunt just confuses them and makes things worse. she had previously said she wants no contact with them. she is only back in their lives because she wants their money. i just don't know what to do. it's hard to try to connect to someone who you are supposed to be close to, but is a stranger to you. especially someone who can't hold a conversation because their mind is leaving them. i'm trying to be as understanding as i can. i know what my grandfather is going through is much worse. but it's frustrating to fake a laugh at a joke you've heard for the 7th time in 20 minutes. i know that's sounds awful and apathetic. i'm studying psychology so i know the science of the disease, but i've never been taught how to effectively communicate with someone with it. can someone give me some guidance on how to have a conversation with my grandfather and diminish the frustrations i feel from them? please don't chastise me for how i feel. it's a very difficult and delicate situation. i just want to learn how to not feel the way that i do about it. thank you."," hi there, i’m a memory care director at an assisted living community, i spend all day every day working with, talking to, and engaging with those with alzheimer’s. it can be incredibly frustrating and confusing. i agree with a lot of the advice that was already mentioned. just some points to add. any kind of dementia robs the person of their confidence, pride, beauty, and purpose. any way we can give that back to them will help them tremendously. give them a compliment. make them right 100% of the time, even if they’re doing things “wrong.” meet them in their own reality. if they’re confused and thinks it a monday when it’s really friday, then by golly it’s a great monday today! if they’re putting their shoe on the wrong foot, instead of saying “no,” try saying “great job getting ready for the day. let me help you.” if they’re anxious or confused, try redirecting them to something you know they enjoy. i suggest talking about things your grandpa used to do, hobbies, his job, things from his past. those things are far more real than the present for him. i know you mentioned that you don’t know much about him, but maybe ask your dad about his life, or for some photos that can spark conversation. just today i asked one of my residents (who is baseline very confused about day to day goings on) about her travels around the world as a young woman with her husband, and she chatted with me for about 30 minutes about skiing in the alps. find what works for your grandpa and see if you can trigger some emotional memories from him. you won’t get it right 100% of the time. you’re going to say the wrong thing. you may upset him or make him anxious or you may get annoyed yourself. that’s ok, we’re all human. allow yourself to make mistakes and learn for the next time. every day will get easier. i can already tell you are a wonderful grandson, and your grandpa is so lucky to have you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/csmq62/my_grandfather_was_recently_diagnosed_with/,My grandfather was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's

"my grandma died a little over two weeks ago after living with alzheimer's for several years. she had a very loving and caring partner in my grandpa who was able to care for her at home the entire time (with a fair bit of assistance from my mom and her brother and his wife over the last year), for which i'm very thankful. i am very close to my grandparents and, since i moved back to my hometown three years ago, i've made the point of visiting regularly. i feel incredibly lucky that i got so much time with my grandma (my grandparents and my parents were all young marrieds/parents so my grandparents were only in their late 40s/early 50s when i was born, i'm now 34) although it was incredibly difficult to watch her deteriorate over the past several years, particularly this last year.in the past few weeks there have been many fond memories shared about my grandma and what a gifted cook, baker, knitter, accountant, etc she was. i think one of the most difficult things for me is that i'm struggling to remember what she was like before she got sick because the most recent memories i have of her is simply her deteriorating significantly. i'm not sure if that's normal? maybe it was just so awful to sit by and watch her lose so many of her memories, speech, and ability to function in many ways that it impacted me more than i realized?i also know we're a little confused because she definitely was not at end stage. we guessed she was towards the end of the middle stage but it definitely was not end stage. she was relatively healthy besides the alzheimer's and had even been to the hospital two weeks prior and been thoroughly checked out with no serious concerns (they told us she had anxiety). she could still eat and feed herself, was not incontinent, could move (until the last day) with some minimal assistance, could generally dress herself, etc. it's still something i think we're all racking our brains over and thinking over her last few days because we knew she was getting worse but definitely not ""she's near death"" worse. i guess i'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences/feelings/etc? it still feels a little surreal that she's already gone. i think we expected she had another year left at least. but i'm thankful she's not suffering from such an awful disease anymore."," this isn’t exactly related but i saw you moved to your hometown. i’m from minnesota and am thinking about moving back from california for my grandmother with alzheimer’s. she’s on her 4th year and she is just starting to get bad when it comes to repeating things.i’m on a trip back from visiting her right now and am planning to either move back, visit more often than 3-4 weeks every months, or split half and half in an rv (i stay in my family member’s houses cause they all live out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cpgktg/after_alzheimers/,After Alzheimer's

"hello lovely redditors :)a year or so ago, my grandad was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's. he attended a group in our town called memory matters in december 2018 - he went in one group where patients discussed the disease, and my mum went into a group for carers. they didn't find it any use - a lot of people were a lot further stages, so they didn't really contribute, or even discuss themselves because they didn't get a chance. at this stage, we don't know any more about his condition - only ""early onset"". we heard nothing until july this year, where he had a medical review. the doctor gave him a relatively good bill of health, bar the usual problems people who are 82 and a bit overweight are expected to have. the doctor said he was going to send messages to his doctor to arrange a meeting because my grandad has worsened. he's now repeating himself a lot, forgetting very fast and even forgetting when he takes medication. we opened the pain killers in front of him, gave them to him, and 5 minutes later he asked where the tablets were.my poor mum is struggling with this - she doesn't know what to do, who to go to or when to get involved. she tried to tell the doctor things at the review, but my grandad kept cutting in and saying he was fine - he's very proud.we're trying to get him into a sheltered flat, because we're concerned about his wellbeing. he isn't eating properly, he's fallen asleep with the oven on and fallen over a few times - we're worried it's going to get worse as the disease progresses. but our council has changed the housing register list - it's no longer done on points with bidding, properties are just given to the ""most in need"".we looked into making mum his power of attorney and went into the solicitors - but it was upwards of £500? he can't afford that... i'm kinda rambling here - i don't really know where else to ask these things or talk to about all this.i just want to know what we should do next?"," research keto diet, coconut oil, cbd and alzheimer's as a type of diabetes.those are my advices and personal experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/colbim/the_next_steps_uk/,The next steps? {UK}
"hi the first place i thought if after that drs visit was here. my grandmother is 72, today they diagnosed her with mild alzheimer’s the doctors will perform a few more test in 3 weeks. not sure what to do, i set an appointment with a nutritionist and honestly have not been able to get myself together and figure out what’s next here. i know there’s a ton of post with recommendations, im going to start reading them right now. just thought i’d get a little start with this post and come to terms. thanks guys"," this is my own personal experience dealing with my mother in law. may help, may not. maybe you are just in time to give her some good years instead of just years. requieres work, here is what i replied to some one else about cbd....if you put them (drops) under the tongue the effects are fast, but i'm looking for steady effects so i just put them on her tea or on her water.summary of her state by beginning of may: she was on mirtazapine, rivastigmine, lisinopril, sinvastatin and something for the stomach due to pills he was taking. she was always foggy, lost, would either sleep most of the day and then drives us crazy at nights wandering, going into my room at night a few times. would call my kids nice girl, young man.on top of that she has a wire on a knee cap that broke and needs removal (it  kind of sticks and bothers her a lot), which limits how far or fast we can move around, plus some shoulder discomfort. physically she is frail at 72. she smoked for 40 or 50 years, ate bad, drank like a litter of coca cola until 3 months ago (that thing is ban from my house) and no exercise. she would get into the car very sluggish and with directions. she was in a sorry state.first month i did change her diet a lot, is not a keto diet, but close, is more like a mediterranean diet (we are latins with spanish and italian roots so you get the idea). since i was kind of desperate i tried the cbd.first 36 hours after starting the drops she was calmer, more focus and you should see her getting in and out of the car, no complains about knee, pretty fast. cbd has anti inflammatory effects which is one of the problems with alzheimer's and any joint pain.at present she is sitting in a couch in front of me making some small talk about our dog, my kids (which now she refers to them by name). she is no longer on any medicine i mean none, blood pressure a couple of hours ago was 101/57, she still sits down and stares in the distance like my 90 year old grandmother does, so i take it as it is. she only wakes at nights to go to the bathroom which she can find by herself, she puts her pijamas now. no more wondering, she can use a fork and knife, can watch the news and ask questions. we go on small errands that don't require to much walking or a supermarket which cater to the elderly and has wheelchairs.i have found that the real combo is cbd plus coconut oil (we have her up to 10 table spoons a day). coconut oil is what keeps the brain from just being in the off switch, cbd is for all the other problems.but for sure , no more 4 am telling me someone is going to kill my wife, she ask to use netflix (not by name), but ask for the show, at least is dr martin and sherlock holmes (like for the 10 time, the one with cumberbatch) so i don't care, keeps her entertain. music all day and the nana gives her company during the day.she is 110 pounds and about 5' 4"" so her total daily dosage is about 32 mgs in a  1 ml of hemp oil, i have the brand name if you want i get it at amazon. it doesn't say it has cbd, but i'm sure it has, no other way for it to do the things its doing, (had another brand once that had like 20% cbd and 2 thc and the effects are the same).i can swear the combination of both of them work. just now got one of those old song that is in top gun, she remember the movie and the actor tom something , i said yes tom cruise.any questions let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/codbnk/my_grandmother_recently_got_diagnosed_with_mild/,My grandmother recently got diagnosed with mild Alzheimers what’s next?

"i have no idea what this could be. my dad is only 57. i'm 34, my brother is 26. my dad pushed for us to move back home until we did, and then he recently had a major heart valve surgery, and then was acting so weird, that i'm worried about leaving him. i've been noticing frequent memory lapses and repeating himself for about a year, to the point where sometimes he retells a story multiple times in a day, leave the doors unlocked, garage open, trunk open. minor personality changes like he used to be very particular about things being orderly and now he just throws things wherever, but i figured he was getting lazy as he aged. nothing where i could say, yes, for sure something's wrong. today, he woke my brother and me up with a tangential group text about how we think we know everything and we're disrespectful and prevent him from ever being happy.. ???he's spent the day acting really alarmingly, saying really hard to understand, out of character, and cruel things. for example: he was telling my brother that my brother didn't know him, so my brother said that he would like to, and my dad replied that it's impossible because we're all ghosts.he was acting aggressively religious suddenly (he doesn't even go to church) and got mad that he doesn't think my brother's career goal, programming, is god's purpose for him, that my brother is an abomination and he wants him to change his last name, that i really ""surprised him today"" in a disappointed tone (i literally did not participate in the conversation other than trying to ask if he was ok. i shut down from the stress and eventually left.)when i got back, my dad leaned out of his bedroom window and yelled down to me that my brother was crazy and had trapped him in the room and for me to run and get out of there because my brother was dangerous. he was yelling into the neighborhood at like 2am... we have very close, old, and familiar neighbors. i have never seen him act this way. he kept repeating facts about the past, like my brother's birth size and weight, started crying about loving our mom (they've been divorced for at least 15 years and he's been remarried twice since), accused me and my brother of trying to have him taken away, went off on a long tangent about dementia really just being someone getting trapped between parallel dimensions..... etc. he's been acting aggressive and i'm afraid to push at all, but i'm so confused and concerned. he absolutely refused to see a doctor, said that it would be a good thing if it was alzheimer's because it would only hurt us and not him, cried over being ""fucked up in the head"" and agreed something was wrong, but then immediately flipped and accused my brother of trying to manipulate him...my mom is entirely on my dad's side and has said he's acting fine he's just mad and to not call the cops and just wait for him to cool down, but she has a bad history of mental health issues, drug abuse, and general poor decision making skills. does any of this sound like anything to anyone? :("," wow- no, none of this is normal. your dad needs help and medical intervention asap. if i were you i would form a united front with my brother and attempt to intervene despite your mother's protests. the second your dad acts out in this bizarre way and/or makes threats call 911 and report a medical emergency that may need police involvement. when they arrive they will clearly see your dad needs an emergency psych eval and they will take him to the hospital. once he is evaluated then you and your brother can start thinking about the next steps. your mother is obviously in some kind of denial. maybe it's fear, or something else. but a person with mental health and drug abuse issues is in no position to be making decisions regarding your dad's bizarre behavior. seriously-- call 911, get him to a hospital for a psych evaluation.i'm sorry you are dealing with this, i know how scary it is, but you are not alone. many of us are dealing with parents with dementia, and there are resources. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cl1z5g/scary_day_not_sure_whats_going_on/,Scary day.. not sure what's going on
"i've talked about my grandmother (72) in this sub before, and you all have been very helpful and nice. thank you.but this week has been bad, to say the least. she's been threatening to kill my grandfather, to the point where he has his bedroom door barricaded at nights. twice, she's taken off with the car to go see her sister because my grandfather upset her. her doctor agreed to call aps so we could start the process of getting her into a care facility.i don't know what the outcome of the aps visit was yesterday, but i know today took a turn for the worse. my grandfather drove into town for groceries, and when he came back, my grandma was burning her things and threatening to burn their house down. the cops and my mom were called, and my grandma agreed to go with my mom to the hospital for a mental evaluation.she had no idea how she got there or why she was there. she didn't even remember the incident that led up to her leaving with my mom.no one knows much about what's going to happen or where she's going to go. there's going to be an investigation into what led up to the fire, but i don't know if that's through the police or aps. the hospital is going to transfer her to an institution in the next few days, but considering there isn't one locally, we don't know where she's going to go.i don't know what i'm looking for here. to rant? worry? ask for advice?"," wow, that’s a lot. you all must be exhausted. well, the good news here is that your grandfather is safe, so i imagine he is secretly relieved (or maybe openly relieved).  it’s also good news that your grandmother is somewhere that they can evaluate her and put her on some new medication to calm her butt down a bit :). as to where they will send her, i am guessing here, but i imagine it will be the closest hospital with a psych floor or a psych hospital. that’s only because they have the kind of doctor that prescribes medications for the brain, no matter what the cause.  it is usually at least a week stay, maybe longer. that’s because they want to make sure the medicine they put her on is the right one and is ok for her to take. if not, they start over, which means she has to stay a little longer.  now, for the next part. has your family talked about taking your grandmother to a memory care facility or a nursing home? is so, this is the time to do that. she is already out of the house, so she’s halfway there. they can transfer her there, instead of releasing her to come home.  i’m sure there will be meetings with the hospital folks about plans for the future. listen to what they suggest and go from there. but tell them if you don’t want her to come home, and stick to it. they will then have to find a bed for her in a facility. i hope you all try to take good care of yourselves where you can. stay strong and you’ll get through this. hugs!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ckxdst/grandmother_had_a_bad_week_thats_led_up_to_her/,Grandmother had a bad week that's led up to her being institutionalized

"just got a text ten minutes ago that dad ""had a really bad episode"" yesterday. mom planned a three-week trip for them (one week in one city, and two weeks in another), and dad said he felt like he wasn't ""in the loop"" with the planning. (i told her before they bought their tickets that i didn't think a three-week trip was a good idea. he will be around his grandchildren full-time for two of those weeks, and they're as young as six.) mom said he started beating his forehead with both hands, then ran to the kitchen and started opening drawers to look for a knife to hurt himself. she stood in front of the knife drawer. she said she figured by the time she called 911 and they arrived, the episode would be over, and that he wouldn't even remember it happened. so, they did not call for/get help.she is continuing to leave him at home alone for hours at a time pretty much every day. i texted back immediately to ask if he was still home alone sometimes, and now she won't respond. what on earth do i do about this? i know you shouldn't tell the non-dementia spouse what to do (or that they're doing anything wrong), but what if my dad does hurt himself when she's away? he does not know how to use the phone really anymore, and even when she leaves him a note to say where she is, he can't remember where the note is. she is not leaving to do anything like go to the doctor; she's going to game clubs, book club, golf, out to eat, etc. my siblings and i are trying to convince her that he needs to go to a day group if she needs time alone to do things, or that someone needs to come into the house to watch him. she doesn't want to drive him and spend the $60 for him to do that (they have the money).what do i do? i am picturing my dad dead in the kitchen or lost in his car the next state over, because she is stubbornly refusing to treat this situation with the gravity required. i know it's hard for her, but if something happens to him, because of her negligence, i don't think i could ever forgive her."," my siblings and i live far from our parents, so we’re trying to manage from afar. mom played golf yesterday (i’m sure that was a four hour thing.) and when i called last night, dad was home alone again, and he wasn’t sure where she was. right now, she’s kind of not speaking to me, because she knows i’m upset that she’s not taking care of him like she should. she has told my brother that, essentially, she is doing all she can right now, and she can’t do more. and that if my dad was gone, that would be okay with her.i have a call in to a man i spoke to earlier this year. he helps line up day care/respite, and can evaluate where dad is in the process. we’re going to try to intervene, because she’s not prepared for any eventuality. she’s not looked at homes, doesn’t know about services available. they contacted the va, but she hasn’t followed up. she’s very selfish, likes to be the one who’s taken care of, and is upset dad can’t clean/do dishes like he used to (even though he is still trying to do a lot of the housework.) it’s very frustrating. hopefully, she’ll be willing to meet with this man from the help agency. she’d know him if she went to the alzheimer’s spouse support group in her retirement community, but she doesn’t want to go, because it’s “too sad, and she doesn’t want to hear about what diapers to buy.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cko1m1/help_dad_was_looking_for_knives_to_hurt_himself/,"Help: Dad was looking for knives to hurt himself yesterday, but mom doesn't want advice"

"for the past few years, my family has been struggling quite a lot with my grandmother, who has alzheimer's. among all of the problems we have had to go through, there is just one for which i can't see the solution. whenever my grandmother goes outside, especially in the spring and summer months, she walks around the neighbourhood. this would be totally okay, if not for the fact that she would also pick the flowers out of our neighbours' yards. the worst part of it is the fact that the neighbours have come to us, telling us about the meaning that went into the flowers that she consistently picks and ruins. the flowers that she picks are being grown for a specific person who isn't doing well health-wise. not only that, but she also picks flowers that they're currently growing for a competition, and it just so happens that these flowers are quite hard to grow. so clearly, i understand that they have the right to be angry and frustrated with my family. however, i found myself in an ethical dilemma: where on one hand, someone's meaningful flowers are being taken, but on the other hand, the other choice is confining her inside, effectively putting her under house arrest.she is in the moderate stages of alzheimer's right now, still generally able-bodied, so she refuses to go to a nursing home, where she can be taken care of. whichever way i seem to look, there's no solution and it's putting an immense amount of stress on myself and my family. could anybody help offer a solution?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cj3mtq/help_looking_for_advice_dealing_with_grandmother/,Help!

"i’m currently living with my parents to help out my mom who’s helping my dad who was diagnosed early this year. so far, he usually remembers me but not many others. yesterday i had a kitchen accident and burned something, the house was a little smoky but everything was okay. my dad came in, asked who i was, i told him my name and he remembered i was his child and he hits me with “you know, you’re really good at ruining everything”. i know he doesn’t mean it, it’s not him. we were in a stressful moment and it just slipped out. i just don’t know how to deal with this hurt. i can’t blame him, but what he said really messed me up. my dad before this would’ve said, it’s okay life happens, kid! and we would’ve laughed about it. i guess i’m just missing him and who he was before."," this is always very hard to deal with. my grandmother has been diagnosed for a few years and started showing signs a few years before that. her short term memory has been long gone for quite some time now, but now her long term memory is starting to go as well. she’s constantly very confused and very scared. she’s lived in illinois my entire life (30 years) plus a number of years before i was born, but she was originally from tennessee. her husband died from a heart attack when i was 5, and one of her sons passed about 5 years ago (it was after that when we started to notice significant cognitive decline).until the past few months, it has been the worst at night time, and was usually just repetitive questions. such as “did you eat dinner” or simple things like that over and over. her hygiene was poor, definitely couldn’t drive a vehicle, had no sense of time or what month it is, but overall it was manageable and she was still fairly happy. but lately she’s gone downhill very very quickly. now she’s constantly wondering where she’s at, why all of her deceased siblings haven’t been around to talk to her. she’s been very combative and has said some horrible things to all of us. she thinks she’s in tennessee but doesn’t recognize it and that agitates her a lot. she’s very talkative and it’s pretty much the same sentences 24/7 now. “this isn’t my old home house” “who’s house is this” “why doesn’t bertha lee come to see me anymore, she’s mad at me isn’t she”just 2 days ago she confused one of my uncles for her husband and threatened to “wipe the smile off that whore’s face” referring to his significant other that was sitting by him. she then left the house and started to walk, mom and i ran to grab the van and managed to get her back to the house but she wouldn’t leave the front yard to go inside. we ended up having to call the cops because it was 90 degrees and humid as fuck (illinois sucks) and were worried about her getting overheated. they ended up talking her into getting into the vehicle with a family friend and she drove her to the doctor’s.even though she’s got 5 living children left, my mother has taken the brunt of the responsibility. my family lives across the street from her, so mom has been staying with her after work and through the night. my other aunt comes and sits with her for a few hours while mom is at work, and that’s been about all the help my mom has gotten. i’ve seen mom age about as much in the past few years as most presidents do during their 8 year term. she hasn’t slept in the same bed as my dad for who the fuck knows how long, it’s been over a year, maybe 2. one piece of advice i’ve got for you, is to at least hire a professional that knows how to treat and help alzheimer’s patients to help take the stress off of everyone trying to do it on their own. it’s very physically and mentally taxing and mom and i both struggle with a lot of anxiety and depression from dealing with this for so long. i know this is all a jumbled mess, i have a hard time talking about this, let alone forming a coherent thought. it’s a fucking miserable disease and i’m so sorry you and your family are also having to deal with it. if you ever need to talk, feel free to shoot me a message, i know i wouldn’t mind having an ear to vent to from time to time myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cffvqt/dad_with_alzheimers_told_me_i_ruin_everything/,Dad with Alzheimer‘s told me I ruin everything.

"i just stumbled upon this subreddit and i hope this is a place where i can get some advice. so to cut it short, my father in law has dementia and is some days more easily agitated than others. one thing he tends to do when he gets fed up enough is he will leave the house without telling us and we usually only realize he’s gone once he’s made a good amount of distance from the house. this ends in us sending out a small search party until we find him and have to convince him to come back home with us. so we’ve got together with other family members and are looking into a form of locating device that we could put on him or he could carry that we could use in these kinds of emergencies. has anyone here had similar issues with alzheimer’s patients?and of course the **big** question, does anyone know of any devices we could use to help us know where he is if he wanders off?"," yes!!! my great nana gets fed up and often “escapes” since we took her car keys away. she’s speedy when she wants to be...we’ve given her a flip phone with a bunch of important speed dial numbers on a piece of paper taped to the back of it. i put the loudest ringer on the highest volume on it, and because she craves talking to other people, she jumps to answer it when she recognizes that it’s ringing. she’s gone on walks without telling us a few times now, but we’ve always been able to find her if two of us each take a direction, and one of us waiting on the porch. sometimes she can describe where she is (gas station, dollar store, intersection where the streets begin with x and y...)we almost wanted to put something on her, but she often takes things off and misplaces them/hides them (vicks, socks, her watch...)anyways i hope this helps! i’m glad that you’ve always been able to find him, and hope that you find something that works for you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cd9kaf/father_in_law_wanders_off_a_lot/,Father in Law wanders off a lot

"my grandmother was diagnosed with lewy body alzheimers  in the past year or so, and honestly i don't know much about it, save for how i see her behave and from reading through posts on this subreddit. my parents sent me and my sibling here for a couple weeks to see them and help out with their daily activities, but i can't deny that it's  much more stressful than i expected.the main thing she does is  constantly clean the ""dust"" that only she can see, going as far as opening all the windows and doors and spending all day in her room with a rag. she will come to us and point at the walls to get us to see it, then scornfully dismiss us as ""one of them"" when we tell her it's not there. in addition, she hoards. my grandfather has taken us to the thrift store at her demand and she fills the cart with junk like plastic flowers and one time, this gigantic stool. when we tell her we can't bring them home she digs her feet in and refuses to listen or let them go. one time she threatened to leave our belongings at our uncle's home if we took her stool away.my grandfather is a giant pushover and hates confrontation, so he always gives in. i know it's unimaginable stress on him, on my mom, on my family, but it's so frustrating when she's so stubborn. i guess my questions are something like this: how can i get her to do other activities if cleaning is all she wants? what kinds of activities would be good distractions or things i could do with her?  what can i do when she tries to bring junk home, as i don't have the authority of an adult? are there any websites with relevant information on these behavior changes due to lewy bodies?", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ccsnsk/how_can_i_as_a_teenager_help_my_grandmothers/,How can I as a teenager help my grandmother's increasingly erratic and contrarian tendencies?
"i wrote a few weeks back after visiting my folks who live several states away. dad is probably now in stage two of alzheimer's/dementia and has worsened quickly this year (it seems.) he is kind, generous, so helpful (he got a goose egg on his forehead on the fourth running to try to help someone in a wheelchair -- my dad fell.) he is getting clingier (to my mom), wants to be home with her all of the time, and is prone to outbursts when he is confused scared.after they retired ten years ago, they moved to a retirement community where they have been in a lot of clubs and groups. (cards/games, golf, exercise, book club, and social gatherings...lots). i call home every couple of days and usually find mom not at home. dad answers and seems happy to hear from me. mom said this week she has been out, and comes back, and he will be running out of the house frantically looking for her; then he explodes (including swearing) when she gets home, talking about how she needs to be home, he is going to drive somewhere, her friends are b\*\*ches, etc. mom texts us kids and asks us to call to ""talk him down."" sometimes she will leave while we have him on the phone. yesterday she called from her friend's car -- her friend had a weight watcher's meeting, and mom just went to go (i am sure she is frustrated at home, and just wants to get away.)i believe this is a terrible cycle of her going to too many social events (sometimes multiple ones a day, often several hours each), he gets confused and scared, because he can't remember where she is, doesn't remember where her note is telling him where she is, can't remember how to call her, and he stews for the entire time she's gone. she gets home, he yells, she just wants to leave again.yesterday we all got a text that the last three days have been particularly bad. he has an appointment with his (new) neurologist in ten days. his anti-depressants were raised several weeks ago. i told mom she should consider this a semi-emergency, call the doctor's office and explain the situation and ask about any kind of medication that would help take the edge off for the next week and a half, until they can see the neurologist.she did not call the doctor's office, and when i asked her (by text) why?, she didn't text back and now won't enter the phone.what do we kids do to help? we are trying to be supportive of both of them by staying in contact several times a week each. i was just there to visit for five days in june. dad has always been the caretaker. he needs to be taken care of. i understand mom is probably reacting to his need for care in a fairly usual way, but how do i get them help? (she does not want to spend the $60 a day to send him to a day center, even once a week - they have the money to do it - and she has always been reluctant to treat mental illness/issues with either counseling or medication.) i feel like this is the perfect storm, and something bad is going to happen (dad could just get in the car and drive for five or six hours. he can't work his cell phone, and he gets lost just leaving the neighborhood.)tl/dr: dad with dementia is getting worse/angry/clingy; mom won't take advice, do research, or ask doctors for help.thanks guys -- this is new territory for us, as it always is, i'm sure."," sadly, your mom at first is denying the existence of mental issues. now she is tired and just don't want to be around. being there.meds will just dumb him down so your mom and you can go on with your life. is the sad truth. your alternative is to be very disciplined and research about alternative diets, ketosis, coconut oil and cbd oil. is easier to give people pills, but there is no good end result. do some reading there are lots of materials out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ccpk5q/please_help_dad_is_getting_worse_mom_wants_advice/,"Please help: dad is getting worse, mom wants advice she is not taking and wants to maintain her active lifestyle"

when she was diagnosed it was a huge shock because there wasn’t any generation that was diagnosed with alzheimer’s. i’m struggling to deal with everything and find my self breaking down a lot because of it. i see her everyday as to i’m 19 and i still live at home. lately i’ve noticed she’s just progressing even worse and it’s really getting to me and i’m not sure what to do. she is starting to wander outside when no one is watching and i’m worried she’s gonna walk away and not know how to get back. i’m having her get a medical id badge for just that reason but i don’t know what else to do. i catch her pointing at things all the time that aren’t there. every time she goes back to the doctor it’s always “her test score is much lower than what it should be at.” and hearing that just gets to me even more. i just don’t know how to cope with the stress of it all and really i’m just asking for advice and what you did if you felt overwhelmed by emotion. thanks to all," i'm sorry you are going through this.1. you need to change locks.2. read about dietary changes (keto diets)3. eliminate sugar and caffeine (point above)4. coconut oil (point #2 again)5. if cbd oil is legal there, get some.6. most meds are more to calm her down and give you some breathing space than anything else. they don't help or slow down the progression. 7. find a support group for you and get free time or you will stress out in so time.i mountain bike to manage my stress, talk to others and write here. my wife tries to go to the gym and talks to me. that's how we are managing it. plus we do have someone during nhe week to tend to my mother in law.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cbl161/mother_diagnosed_at_54_now_59_struggling_to_cope/,Mother Diagnosed at 54 now 59. struggling to cope with her condition

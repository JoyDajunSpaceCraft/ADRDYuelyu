"hey guys,i'm trying to get a good picture of what's happening with my dad. he's been to a local (country) doctor and they say he has passed some cognitive tests and failed others.i just wanted to see if this seems like dementia to you guys. he often forgets what he's talking about, he's gone from being an excellent driver to being so bad no one will drive in a car with him, he barely exercises and has lost 1/3 of his body weight after a divorce (used to be quite physical), he has major hearing loss and is probably going deaf, he sometimes gets stuck in loops where he'll lose something and search for it, forget what he was searching for, then get stuck in that same loop again, and he can barely look after himself, mostly due to years of mum doing everything for him.he's always been a bit angry and quick to put people down. not violent but he has been threatening in that way at times. he also has drunk 4 standard drinks a night for the past 30-40 years, so cognitively that at least explains some of it. he's going to have to move out alone into his own place soon and has no/few friends and i'm concerned this will cause a further mental decline. oh, and a doctor has put him on antidepressants. any insight on his condition would be great, thank you."," hard to tell if it’s dementia or long standing alcoholism. i have a family member who’s only in his 60’s but is exactly that way. he had to rent a room in a halfway house/group home, where he gets a bed in a shared bedroom and they provide 2 meals a day. his ex wife manages his monthly social security payment and pays for the group home and takes him to the doctor whenever necessary. this is in the us, not sure where you are and what’s available there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vvjbxv/73_year_old_can_barely_drive/,"73 Year Old, Can Barely Drive"
"hi. i'm very much new to reddit, so please excuse me for not being used to the format or if i am doing something that's not too compliant to it or to this very subreddit's rules. i just need help, a few words of advice, maybe... something that'll help me go through with this with a tad more ease. also, apologies for any mistakes or misspellings, i am not a native english speaker.  my mother, who is now 87, was diagnosed with dementia a year back, most likely a late diagnosis. nonetheless, her symptoms showed very late, which caught me by surprise and completely unprepared for this. ever since her diagnosis, she's been having these episodes of never ending random hallucinations that start at night time and go on for days, during which she does not sleep for days, loudly talking to people that are no longer alive without stop-, confusing me with my dear late father, or worse... i do nothing but show patience and love, i will never stop doing so. though i feel like i'm now coming very close to my limit.  up until a few months back, it only occured ever so rarely, perhaps once a month, or twice at best. lately it's once every few days. i can no longer sleep, i can barely work, and i am mentally devastated. i love her very much. i am her only caregiver, i promised my father that i would look after her till the bitter end. i recently had to send my son to stay at his mother's place so that this couldn't affect him as well. she is my burden alone. all i ask is... how can i cope with this? what can i do to make it so that i can get over this with my sanity and my heart in one piece? thank you very much for any responses or comments that you might have. peace."," your mom’s days long psychotic episodes sound intense. at the very least, you should be able to get anti-psychotic meds for her. i know someone who was diagnosed as psychotic and he rages like this if he’s off his meds.she is lucky to have a son like you, whether you care for her in your home or not.for your mental health, you should find a friend, local volunteers, or paid caregiver of some sort to stay with her a few hours a week to give you a break, maybe go out to dinner with your son or just go exercise. i would highly recommend therapy, this is a very stressful time in your life. you need support for what you’re going thru.finally, when i’m at my most distressed, my mil who cared for her mom, tells me to remember that this too shall pass. it will come to an end soon, it won’t be forever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vvh3kn/please_be_so_kind_as_to_spend_a_few_moments_of/,"Please, be so kind as to spend a few moments of your time to help me out about how to cope with my mother's violently progressing dementia."

"hello, i’m new here. my dad was recently diagnosed with dementia and i’m having a hard time trying to figure out what to do. his wife (my mom) passed away in 2016 and i’m an only child so i’m the only one he has. he’s not logical and is getting very hard to manage. he gets fixated on financial stuff, even when he receives ads in the mail, he thinks it’s somehow connected to his real accounts and that people are trying to “send him money”. he is in a good spot financially (thank goodness) but i’m having an insanely hard time trying to reason with him. he also lives by himself and has let the house completely go. it’s a pigsty. he hoards stuff and it’s becoming unlivable. the plan was for me and my family to move into his house and he move into the house next door because his house is very big for him and we would be close to him. i’ve brought it up a few times and he won’t acknowledge it or answer my question. i need to be closer to him to help keep an eye on things. i try to have patience with him and the situation but some days i feel like i’m going to break down. it doesn’t help that i have a toddler to care for and i’m having baby number two in two days. just feel like i’m in over my head. anyone have tips or have a similar situation?"," absolutely agree with the idea of moving in “so he can help you with the babies” just in order to get him to accept it. also that you need to get dpoa, and make a clean new email address to send all his online banking, hospital portals, ssa information to… also set up usps informed delivery.every time a scammer/fishy charity or business sends mail, if there is a postage-paid envelope inside, send it back with his address sticker (probably have loads from charities) saying “please remove me from your list”see here:  and here: ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vv5biv/father_diagnosed_with_dementia/,Father diagnosed with Dementia
"this is a throwaway account, as i don’t want info traced back to my family. i’m kind of in the midst of a big hole with this and am desperate to reach out to others who might understand what i’m going through. i’m in therapy, but a constant emotional wreck. as the title says, my (m37) father (66) was recently diagnosed with dementia, what we believe is ftd. his mother had it and his older brother has the same condition, just a few more years advanced. what is hard at the moment is that both my parents are suffering and i don’t know if my mother has the ability to care for my dad - even now in the early stages. essentially, i was shuttered away from both my parents for close to 2 years, due to border closures throughout the pandemic. i still live 700km from them. when i finally got back home, i knew something was wrong straight away. my parents used to be such house proud people, but the house was filthy, like a hoarders home. my dad had emotionally shut down, didn’t talk as much and my mum was trying to dig bugs out from under her skin that weren’t there. i’d zoomed them weekly throughout the pandemic, but they’d only shown me what they wanted me to see. when i first saw them i had no idea what was going on. they’d lost contact with friends, family etc. they’d become shut-ins living this paranoid, delusional life, where in their heads i’d done crazy things to them, like hack their phone from afar to delete photos, or hidden details of non-existent life events from them. turns out my mum was overdosing on antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds, causing her to go into serotonin shock, have hallucinations and not reach rem sleep. it took months to get her in somewhere, but she’s now detoxed and a lot more level, but i still don’t trust her capacity. my mum has never been the most stable person, with some severe trauma in her past- in fact dad used to care for her i many ways. last night she admitted to me she had seen dads behavioural changes come on over the last three years and she had self medicated herself into the state i found her in. she’d been doctor shopping and trying to find a way to escape it all. last night she made panicked messages to my brother and i, threatened to leave my dad, as his behavioural changes made it too much to bear. i ended up on the phone to get to calm her down from a state of hysteria and beg her to get some support herself. she’s only been out of hospital a week and already i’ve had to mediate fights over dad not driving the car on my breaks at work and then this panicked call last night. i haven’t seen it personally, but apparently dads behaviour has changed in private to her and he can get quite aggressive and angry - something he would never have done in the past. i don’t think my dad ever raised his voice before- not even when i was a shitty teenager acting out. i’m just in this constant state of overwhelming grief. grief for dad, grief for my family and grief for my mums pain. it also comes with this intense worry that she is unable to care for him or help him through this. she already almost killed herself once (serotonin shock is eventually fatal if left untreated)- the future terrifies me. it’s at the point i feel like my life is being put on hold whilst i sit paralysed with worry. i had amazing job opportunities overseas i was actively pursuing- but i’ve kind of dropped the ball on everything now. it didn’t even occur to me that i potentially could suffer the same fate as my dad and uncle, but after reading more about ftd, it’s just added to my anxiety about the future. i’m not sure why i’m writing this- i guess i just wanted to share what i’m experiencing with people who might understand. i tell friends and colleagues, but there is a big disconnect around the constant grief i feel. it’s like a feeling of constant loss and i feel angry the pandemic cheated of the last few normal interactions i could’ve had with them both.", ftd = frontotemporal dementia,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vv3xas/father_with_ftd_not_sure_mother_capable_of_care/,"Father with FTD, not sure mother capable of care"
"hello there, i'm looking for help because im desperate.my grandma is 75 years old, and has been acting kinda not herself most of the time since february. she has been taking rivotril (clonazepam, type of benzo) for about 20 years now, and i'm afraid what to expect. i'm going to share a brief timeline of what was happening in the past few months, and i hope some of you can share some insight.around 2020/early 2021 i took her to a doctor because she was acting like a zombie during the day.she was on 6mg of rivotril, 2mg in the morning, 4mg at night before sleep, doctor said skip the morning 2mg morning one (which i just learned is a pretty steep taper) but it actually helped.at the end of 2021 she had more and more headaches, also talked to the doctor if we could taper more, and yes, now instead of 4mg, only 3mg at night. around this time she got her blood tested, everything was fine, except a bit higher cholesterol, so she got prescribed a medication called ""rosuvastatin sandoz"".2022 around february after tapering to 2mg at night, her headaches were more frequent, and her short term memory got worse, so she was taking quite alot of painkillers for it, because of this i took her to the doctor again because i didn't want her stomach to suffer consequences. thats how we got to a neurologist, did a brain mri, which came back with brain atrophy, but the neurologist said its okay. she said nothing regarding what to do with her sudden headaches though.but by this time i've noticed that she's often confused, asks the same stuff alot sometimes, has spontaneous bad mood, crying thinking of something bad.2022 around may we've got to her psychiatrist and told her what i've noticed about grandma.the psychiatrist prescribed her yarocen(mirtazapine) an antidepressant, to take it after eating dinner, it didn't really help her in the first few weeks, maybe she could sleep better. the psychiatrist also told me to taper her down to 1.5mg of rivotril at night, and after 2 weeks taper it to 1mg.2 weeks later. let's start with the good news, she didn't have these heavy migraine headaches for the past few weeks. she would limp less, sometimes its almost even gone. here short term memory improved a little. but now she had the urge for hours to go to the toilet everyday, even if nothing came out, took her to the doctor to check for uti, negative, doctor said it must be something psychological. she also got more confused, and her cognitive skills were pretty bad, but strangely enough after dinner taking her medicine(yarocen), it got better, sometimes by a landslide, but this would always 'reset' when she woke up in the morning.after a month of tormenting toilet visits and stomach cramps, we've put her back on 1.5mg rivotril instead of the 1mg. her cognitive skills maybe improved just a little, and her toilet frenzy is almost gone. could it be that the taper was too fast? what can be done? we're visiting her psychiatrist at the end of the month again for control.i've read alot regarding what this could be, but i feel lost. somewhere around 2022 february her cognitive skills declined by a bunch compared to what it was. she didn't have a stroke, didn't have a surgery, no major events that could be linked to it, no uti. only thing i can think of is tapering her meds too fast? i wonder if there is light at the end of the tunnel...."," if the mri showed actual ""brain atrophy""  it's only going to get worse. father in law was a neurologist for 40+ years, showed signs and lost speech, and became compulsive about cutting things up, and rearranging things. he is now just shy of catatonic and barely mobile.all you will be able to do is monitor the symptoms and adjust. some of what you are saying very well may be medication related but it sounds like the natural progression of the atrophy.depression and headaches are part of the degenerative nature of what i have seen with brain atrophy. i had a brain injury 40 years ago and have been doing my own research and reading for myself all the time since. now i have a father in law who is full on dealing with wholes in his brain and a mother in law who is starting to show similar symptoms. the medication for the dementia caused a lot of bathroom problems. i can't recall the name of the product atm, and it's late so don't want to disturb them. if i remember, and or there are no issues  i will check it in the am and try to respond to this for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vv2tjs/could_it_be_pseudodementia_or_withdrawal/,Could it be Pseudodementia or Withdrawal?

my dads behaviour has changed dramatically. he went from being a devoted loving husband and father for the last fifty years to talking to a friend from highschool online and falling in love. he’s always someone who researches everything and is very practical and black white. he’s always said to every action there is a reaction. now this week alone he has said he’s leaving my mom for “j” to saying he would never leave and that he loves my mom back to he’s leaving every few hours! he even has forgotten that he’s leaving my mom and then remembered randomly 5 hours later. it’s even more bizarre that when he told me he was surprised i was upset. he can’t understand what all the fuss is about. i had an appt yesterday and he asked me four times in the span of an hour what time my appointment was at. i’m honestly so scared that he doesn’t have a grip on reality that he might just go for a walk and never come back. has anyone had an experience like this? i’m supposed to see his dr on tuesday," my husband and i live next door to my widowed 80 year old mil. in the last year, she has begun having significant short term memory issues and dramatic personality changes. to say she is staunchly independent is an understatement! she continues to drive. she will leave her house to go to store to purchase specific items. hours later, she returns with completely different items purchased and doesn’t recall what she was going to store for. we purchased her a cell phone about 3 years ago. she’s on our cell plan. often, she leaves her home without the phone. when home, she forgets to charge phone. she easily loses things in her home, i.e. tv remote, ceiling fan remote, her glasses. these are all huge red flags to my husband & i. we have purchased an airtag and placed in my mil’s car to track her travel and find her if she gets lost. my husband & i both track her on our iphones. you might consider putting an airtag in your dad’s vehicle or purchasing him an airtag keychain to track him. i know some people are also putting airtags in their parents wallets in addition to their cars and on keychains, since they do easily misplace items. my husband & i would like to have my mil evaluated for dementia & alzheimer’s, as there is family history of this, but my mil refuses and her other adult children are in denial and think she is fine even though she constantly repeats herself and asks the same question 5 times in a 30 minute period of time.i’m truly sorry you are experiencing this op with your dad. i hope you get some answers or insight from his doctor.i did learn with my 78 year old dad over past 3 years, excessive brain & spinal cord fluid mimics dementia, alzheimer’s & parkinson’s disease symptoms. a brain injury or bacterial infection causes the body to begin making excessive fluid. my dad was hospitalized for 12 days with bacterial infection and dehydration a few years ago. my dad’s symptoms became so bad they ordered mri. he had to have the excessive fluid drained twice in surgery. following each surgery for period of time, his dementia & parkinson’s symptoms would go away. his hands would no longer shake. he could get up & down and not shuffle his feet when walking but then the symptoms would quickly return to our dismay and heartache. 6 months ago, he had to have a brain shunt put in to control the flow of the brain & spinal cord fluid. it’s a trial and error process for the doctor to know what the exact or best setting should be for my dad’s fluids. dad has headaches and vertigo when setting too low and continued dementia & parkinson’s symptoms when too high. it’s been really hard on my dad’s mental health. we try to keep him as comfortable as possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vuv6hz/how_hard_was_it_to_get_a_diagnosis_and_what_were/,How hard was it to get a diagnosis and what were the initial signs?

"for now, i have two ladies who split the week staying with my dad who has dementia in his home. he is still able to do a lot for himself (he’s continent, he can shower himself but won’t without prompting/reminders, etc.,) but primarily needs someone to keep him safe and make sure he’s in a routine. it’s going well for the most part (this has been the arrangement for 9 months now) but he still wants me (his daughter) there daily. and i do usually take him to my house for dinner and to spend time with us in the evenings, which allows his aides time to rest, run errands, shower, etc. (they do sleep, eat, wash when he’s there too - but we all know it’s sometimes nice to do things in the peace and quiet.) anyway, it’s going well, but no matter how many times i try to set boundaries and occasionally take time away from him to spend with my husband and kids (short overnight trips) - if i miss more than one night of seeing him, it results in excessive agitation, confusion, etc. he gets angry and upset with me and his aides. he wants to kick his aides out so they won’t deter him from getting to me. yes, i know routine is important to dementia patients and i know this is all part of the dementia. my questions are: if you used live in caregivers, did your lo ever get used to them to the point that they weren’t quite as attached to you? how long were you able to keep them home with a caregiver before needing to put them into memory care?end of day, i’m struggling with the lack of freedom caring for my dad brings with it. i want to be fair to him and keep him in his home as long as possible, but i also can’t be permanently tethered to him with two young kids and my husband at home. my in laws are planning a big 50th anniversary trip and i’m not sure how i can go if my absence will cause my dad to get into a tailspin, kicking his aides out, angry with me, etc. i don’t want to put him into care too soon, but i have to have some ability to prioritize other people and things in my life sometimes. can you share your experiences?"," if you're sure it will be a big problem, you might want to call your local memory care units and see about getting respite care for him when you're gone. or like others have said, start spreading your visits out, explain to him that you're unable to be there, maybe even leave him a note explaining why. if he has trouble reading, do it on poster board. it helped a lot with my mom when we had to put her in a nursing home because she broke her hip and wrist. we printed a big note to put on the wall by her bed with answers to all of her typical questions/concerns. all three of her children and my husband signed the note so she knew it was from us.""name a,b, or c will be by to visit you sometime each day.you broke your wrist and hip, stay in bed until someone comes to get you up.your insurance is covering everything, don't worry about it.there's candy in your drawer.if you need something, push the button for the nurse.""if she started getting agitated, the staff pointed the note out to her. it either answered her concern or just the activity of reading through the note distracted her and calmed her down.maybe that would work for you too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vunove/anyone_else_use_livein_caregivers_for_their_loved/,Anyone else use live-in caregivers for their loved one with dementia?

angry? paranoid? narcissistic? that she won't let any of her kids move in with her to help and won't move willingly?she's 89 and has always been a nasty abusive angry person. she apparently never wanted to have children but, as part of a religion where that wasn't an option as a woman, she had 5. my mom and aunt admit that she clearly is not able to take care of herself but they both say ""she doesn't want to move!"" when i point out that she needs a nursing home. she lives in a house that, with this market, is worth close to half a million dollars as is, and could pay for her care for years. my aunt would have to make an appointment with my grandmother's doctor and see him when she wasn't present because every time she's tried to talk to the doctor about the issues when my grandmother is present she just starts screaming that she's a liar and storms out. the doctor has noticed the decline and most recently suggested a transition to a nursing home, which my grandmother dismissed, so i think that might be a good route. my aunt says it's too stressful (she had a heart attack about 10 months ago, which she contributed to being the primary caretaker for her mother).my mother has said recently that she wishes her mother would give covid and die as that would be easier than trying to get/make her to go to a nursing home. my sister and i were quite shocked at this statement. i genuinely don't understand how my mom and aunt still see their mother as some kind of vengeful god who they can't contradict or go against lest they face *the consequences*. they've also voiced fears that the nursing home staff would ""find out what mom is really like"" and that she might hit the staff or refuse to take visitors and then the staff would have to deal with her all on their own. i can only assume this comes from a lifetime of feeling like they had to hide my grandmother's behavior, but it's now a harm to them *and* her. my biggest concern, i guess, is that my grandmother will end up taking measures to end her own life the way her ex-husband, my grandfather did. that seems like such a terrible miserable way to go, even for a terrible miserable person. and, i think my uncle is going to swoop in and try to claim ownership of the house, or claim that he deserves most of the profit from selling it, if it's not used for my grandmother, and he's so aggressive that my mom and aunt might just let him do it so as to ""not make things worse."""," is grandma on medication? seroquel can really make a difference to make her a little more mellow or at least less belligerent. and less midnight calls. aunt needs to talk to the doctor on the phone privately about a prescription before the actual appointment. my 90 year old grandma was incredibly cantankerous with her daughter and me, but actually really took kindly to in-home help once they were there. she was so sweet and polite to them, and really funny too. drama-free. 40% of alzheimer's family caregivers die before the patient due to stress related diseases. since your aunt has already survived one heart attack, her health could really, seriously be in danger. a lot of patients end up going to a nursing home directly from an er visit/hospitalization, first it's rehab until they get better, then it ends up being indefinite (but still telling the patient, ""until you get better"")there is a book called the 36 hour day. get a copy, get your mom and aunt copies, flip through it and keep it on hand. does someone have poa?

"we, the team at visionsasyst want to create an artificial intelligence that can help guide people with dementia through their worst stages. the artificial intelligence will be based on a similar technology as gpt-3 and will use natural language to remind the dementia patients of things, philosophize with them, do thought training and most importantly, record their mood and detect seizures or relapses of severe dementia at an early stage. in the background, this artificial intelligence is supposed to record the most important things said by the person with dementia in written form, and thus adapt to the conversation with the person. caregivers or relatives of the person with dementia should then be able to access the summaries in order to always stay up-to-date and informed. this would help to understand the person better and would make it easier for the caregivers and relatives to deal with the person. in summary, it should become a kind of digital companion through dementia. the most important thing, however, should be the adaptability and tolerance towards the sick. there should be a voice-controlled version and a chat-controlled version in the app, between which one can choose and switch. in addition, the ai should calculate a value by which it recognizes the strength of the dementia in the long term and can send the caregivers early enough warnings before the situation worsens. does this sound interesting to you? then donate now, or join our team and help us realize the plan.

"my grandpa (87 years old) lives in ohio with my dad (57m) and i (24m), who take care of him. he is in the early stages of dementia. he is still able to talk and hold a conversation, remembers a lot of things from years ago, remembers most people and faces, but has major issues with short term memory and repeats things a lot within conversations. he has been exhibiting the memory problems for about 18 months now, and officially got a diagnoses of dementia 9 months ago. after the diagnoses, my dad got power of attorney (including medical) for my grandpa. within the last 1-2 months, there has been a noticeable decline in his health. he stopped being able to cook for himself, and gradually started eating less when we would give him things to eat. it’s now gotten to the point where he has probably only eaten a maximum of 300 calories a day for the last 2-3 weeks and has been losing a ton of his weight. most days he eats absolutely nothing at all. he hardly drinks anything either. he can’t walk anymore without major assistance, and hardly can walk at all even to the bathroom even with our help. this all happened very fast, as he was walking and eating completely fine 2 months ago, so it kind of surprised us and led us to think that there may be another medical issue going on. clearly, this is a very serious situation and we know that my grandpa won’t live much longer if we don’t get him medical care. however, he completely refuses all medical care that we try to offer to him and says he doesn’t want to go to the hospital. 2 weeks ago, when he stopped eating, we called 911 and had paramedics come to the house to try to convince him to go to the hospital. he just lied to them, told them he was eating and walking fine, and that he was just tired and didn’t want to get up at the moment. the paramedics agreed that he should go to the hospital, but said that even though my dad has medical power of attorney, it’s still a gray area and they can’t really take a patient against their will who is able to hold a conversation and seems coherent enough to them. my grandpa lately has started mentioning his death coming soon, and basically says he feels that it’s his time to go. this is not necessarily out of character for him, because all of my life, him and my dad have been very religious. it’s been common for me to hear something like “when god says it’s your time then it’s your time, there’s nothing you can do about that.” they both do believe in doctors and medicine, but in the end, even though i disagree, they put their faith in god higher and take a defeatist attitude when it comes to medicine. even though my dad is like this too, he still wants my grandpa to go to the hospital in this situation and keeps asking him to just let him take him. but again, my grandpa absolutely refuses. i’ve been talking to my girlfriend about these issues, and she believes that there has to be something more that i should be able to do in this situation. i do tend to agree, but i’m not sure what. it’s very hard to just sit around and watch my grandpa near death like this knowing that he was completely fine just 2 months ago, his dementia still being mild, and knowing that we can likely make him feel a lot better if he goes to the hospital and gets some liquids in him. on the other hand, i just don’t see how we can do anything when my grandpa is an adult who is refusing to have medical care and even the paramedics said they can’t transport him against his will. what is the most ethical thing to do in this situation? do i give my grandpa more agency to make his own decisions, or should i start pressing harder to get him to the hospital and for my dad to use his medical power of attorney even though grandpa doesn’t want to?", he needs more calories. immediately. he’s weak because he’s starving to death and is dehydrated. similar thing happened to my aunt when she was living alone. she began bleeding internally and needed 2 transfusions and several procedures. ignore what he says and get him the medical help he needs and deserves. it is not okay to let people starve to death. . — check the laws in your state to see if this falls under elder abuse.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vse88q/how_much_agency_do_you_give_someone_with_mild/,How much agency do you give someone with mild dementia over their medical care?

"late last year, my family made the decision that my grandma would move in with me, my mom and my dad. when my grandpa died, my mom made a promise to him that my grandma would never end up in an assisted living facility. in some way, i don't blame my grandpa; they don't have a sparkling reputation, especially in my area, but i acknowledge the benefit of having a schedule, and for the most part, caretakers that have to pass some sort of background check and competency check to care for the patients. our biggest concern, as a family, was my grandma's safety. she is still pretty feisty at 82, quick on her feet, and she's the type of patient that would very easily slip through the doors because she's so mobile. but, as this subreddit suggests, her cognitive abilities are not where they need to be in order to live independently. there is some resentment from that. my grandma lived on her own for 20 years before ever having to have someone help care for her. the foods she likes are bad for her. i try to practice moderation with her, and she mostly responds to it well, but we have our moments of disagreement. she isn't able to spend money as freely as she used to because her poa (her son) has enforced spending limits on her account. we have to reason with her if we're out shopping because of her hoarding tendencies. my aunt took her out last week and she bought four comforters. my aunt did not stop my grandma for some reason -- i was able to take them back to the store without my grandma even noticing (*thankfully*). perhaps the most troubling thing is my grandma's growing verbal abuse. it's been directed at me a handful of times. i have worked with the elderly before and know that it's an unfortunate side effect of the disease, and it's mostly born out of fear and anxiety. my mom is a sweet woman who, in all honesty, is not prepared for the scale of things to come. my grandma will openly berate her and talk down to her. i have had to step in and remind my grandma the things she saying are hurtful; i'm often met with a blank stare. the subject quickly changes, and it's forgotten about by her. earlier tonight, my grandma told my uncle she would ""knock \[his\] teeth down his throat"" because she didn't like him swearing. he is an easygoing guy and didn't take her threat seriously, but knowing the loss of inhibition that comes along with the disease, i have to wonder if these threats will materialize sooner rather than later. i am sacrificing a lot to help my parents - my mom especially - to navigate through my grandma's diagnosis. i have sat down with her and tried to explain to her what the next few years will entail, and my mom doesn't seem to understand. i might as well be talking to a brick wall. she is taking things personally and internalizing it all. i'm worried for both my grandma and my mom, and i'm concerned my mom's mental health will suffer greatly as a result. at the same time, my mom would never have a peaceful night's sleep knowing my grandma was in an assisted living facility. i have a background in healthcare and i'm in pursuit of a nursing degree, but any helpful advice, especially anything i can share with my mom, is welcome."," it may also be time for medications or a change in medication. my grandma got belligerent towards me. would push me, try to kick me, threaten to throw me out, etc. she screamed how she just wanted to die and wanted us to kill her. she would sit and cry. we got her on a low dose of citalopram. it made a world of difference. she still can have the occasional outburst, but it is nowhere as bad as it was. caregiving is not for the faint of heart. some people hold guilt over placing their loved one in a home. it may be beneficial to see if there is a local support group for caregivers. she can hear from others. having everyone safe and healthy and able to enjoy visits is a much better outcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vrpl1d/my_grandma_has_gotten_progressively_worse_over/,My grandma has gotten progressively worse over the last year

"cn: description of violent acts.i will try to keep this short: my grandma's dementia got rapidly worse since march when she moved in with my parents. she has a cat, that i dearly love, and has developed a fixation with it during the last months, which takes a toll on the cats health due to increased stress as my grandma is carrying it around, holding it for hours and locking it up in her room. intervention has proven difficult at times, but i am not okay with letting pets suffer and i am planning to rehome the cat to my place. i have been taking care of my grandma for the first time for the last three days since my parents went on vacation and so far everything was mostly okay, but although i really love my grandma, i feel some resentment growing. today she was carrying the (growling) cat in her room in the evening and reacted aggressively when i asked her (nicely!) to leave it to its cat activities. i took it out of the room again, which was not good of me and did only escalate the situation. she got angry and upset that i ""threw her cat on the street"" and i tried to reason with her, which was also not helpful because of course she can't understand reason in her state. usually i can distract her from a subject that makes her upset, but she was very persistent and went outside in the yard multiple times looking for the cat, telling me to go find the cat, cursing me and, as i refused to ""give her the cat"", threatening to kill me in my sleep and punching me. she did unfortunately find the cat somewhere outside and carried it inside again. the cat growled while she coddled it. i tried again to reason with her, saying the cat is growling because it doesn't want to be held, which my grandma blamed me for. a particular desperate growl made me lose my temper and i grabbed her wrists to ease the clench on the animal. my grandma bit me in response. i shoved her away in a reflex (we were at her bed, so she fell on the bed) and went outside the room, she followed me while throwing death threats at me. it was honestly very scary and overwhelming, i've never seen her so violent. so i closed the door behind me as i walked out and held it while she punched and kicked the door and screamed at me not to go to sleep tonight because i might not wake up.eventually she said she needs to go to the toilet, so i let go of the door (she took a laxative), but she just went upstairs to look for the cat, accusing me of hiding/giving away the cat etc. this whole thing went on for hours, i even got so desperate that i screamed at her. eventually she got less aggressive, but cried and held her head as in pain. she didn't react to any attempts of reassurance in a positive way, only said that she doesn't need anything from me, if she said anything. i understand that through my not dementia-appropriate behavior i caused her a lot of stress and contributed to the situation escalating. i feel very guilty for screaming at her and not being able to meet her on her level. i would really appreciate opinions of more experienced caregivers on how to deal with this particular situation. i know for some it might be stupid that i this happen because of a cat, why didn't i just let her have the cat, but i can't stay calm when an animal gets hurt in front of my eyes, well meaning or not. i will most probably take this cat home with me, but my parents themselves actually have three other cats and i'm afraid this situation might repeat itself."," omg, paragraph is your friend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vrkkfk/grandma_gets_physically_violent_and_i_dont_know/,Grandma gets physically violent and I don't know what to do

so after 1.5 years my moms nursing home doctor has a new diagnoses. she was told she had parkinson’s dementia and on that medication and now as of last week new doctor said she doesn’t have parkinson’s but rather lewy body dementia . what’s the difference including key medication difference ? she definitely hallucinates . note - my dad is her power of attorney and care giver not me so i have no contact with doctors," no offense but a nursing home doctor is the last doctor i would trust with a new diagnosis.parkinson's dementia occurs later on in parkinson's disease.  if your mother has a pd diagnosis then she likely has pd dementia.  dlb is a frequently misdiagnosed condition that is actually pretty rare. hallucinations are not a good tool to diagnose a specific dementia because all dementias come with hallucinations.  also, parkinson's disease frequently has hallucinations as well.  if your mother was in a nursing home for 1.5 years before this new diagnosis then dlb is unlikely as well.only a movement disorder specialist should be trusted with a dlb diagnosis.  the reality is the dlb diagnosis is probably wrong but its not very different from pd dementia.  the main difference is pd dementia occurs after years of pd and mimics alzheimers disease in progression length and decline rate.  it's also possible your mother has alzheimers disease that presents with hallucinations.  both of these are extremely more common than true dlb. true dlb is an aggressive disease and few live beyond 3-4 years after diagnosis.  but like i said, most dlb diagnoses are probably wrong.if your mother only had hallucinations this could be from any dementia or just an infection.  i recommend a second opinion from a movement disorder specialist because the rate of misdiagnosis from nursing home physicians is high.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vqpq7t/misdiagnosis/,Misdiagnosis

"i've (33f) been on a wild ride with my dad (76 yo). he's been baker acted, sent to the er weekly, kicked out of his alf, did a stint at the geriatric psych hospital, discharged to a new alf, got covid and pneumonia at alf #2 his second week there, spent 1 week in the hospital on oxygen, discharged back to alf #2, needed 24/7 care in addition to paying full price for alf #2, had a seizure, had a fall, and ended up back in the hospital. today, they told me that my dad has a pancreatic mass... and i'm so dead inside and tired that i have no feelings. i haven't told anyone in the family yet,  because it's not like they will magically offer more help than just prayers and generic ""when xyz event is over i'll come visit"". the hospital suggests an mri, but daddy can't stay still (suspected lewy body dementia). it would require him to be sedated, which is dangerous for him. and treating the mass if it is cancer is also pointless. he has no quality of life left. he's constantly confused, can't understand words, can't understand prompts, hallucinating, aggressive, overly proud, and overly picky. to complete my day, alf #2 has officially released us, so now i need to find a new place for him and get hospice set up. i'm tired. i don't know when this ride will end, but at least i know it will be relatively soon. which makes me feel hella guilty. i'm going to need so much therapy once he passes. therapy now just consists of me paying someone $100 to cry for the whole hour. does anyone have any advice to help him stay pain-free and comfortable? i know hospice will offer some advice, but i like crowdsourcing."," how about “comfort care only”. give him pain meds and no more tests. i am sorry this is happening. lbd is the worst - any exit is a blessing, and this tumor can be his way out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vntakb/the_hospital_found_a_mass/,The hospital found a mass

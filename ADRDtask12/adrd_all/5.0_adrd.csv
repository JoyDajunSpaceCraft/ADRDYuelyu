"do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? that’s what i’m struggling with. my family and i can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad i worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. we’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. i am pushing to get it done but the more adamant i am about it, the more i wonder if it’s even the right choice. i have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly i don’t know what to think anymore. thanks in advance for any advice."," with my one data point, i say no. i have tried changing things up numerous ways to try to manage and try to stay ahead of my wife’s decline. her decline has been a constant steady progression. it seems like every week i noticed a subtle little thing she can’t now do. but her decline will seem more remarkable at times because it’s tied to milestones. when she can’t feed herself or use the restroom properly it seems significant, but i see the constant steady decline.staying on a constant schedule of sleep and meds seems to make for much better next days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/tezqvo/could_getting_a_diagnosis_make_my_parent_worse/,Could getting a diagnosis make my parent worse?

[removed]," you're correct....there are no adequate words to describe how much this disease sucks. my grandma is the most amazing person i know. she helped anyone and everyone she could w/o judgement...her father was an emotionally absent, controlling narcissistic ass hole. my grandpa, though great and caring in many ways, experienced a lot of trauma as a child, and became an alcoholic. was definitely not an easy man to be married to.  he unexpectedly passed away at 67 years old. not too long after, my grandma was dx with alzheimer's.  she finally was at a point she could do what she wanted, travel where she wanted, live her life w/o having to answer to anyone..... alzheimer's took it all away.  (& covid fast tracked it) now my mom is stressed with having to handle all of her medical & financial needs/decisions, while her last remaining sibling is zero help, complains about not being in charge of $$, is selfish, and second guesses every decision while giving zero constructive help, and undermines her whenever possible.  this disease destroys so much more than the person that has it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/tecwap/useless_birthday_celebrations/,Useless birthday celebrations

[removed]," from what i understand a doc has to be the one to sign off on her being eligible for hospice care. they do it based on a reasonable expectation that the person has 6 months or less to live. my dad ended being on it for many years. that said, people were telling me he had less than a year, every year, for well over a decade. when he got hospice care it was very helpful. he got a medical bed to help him sit up, wheelchair and other medical equip to help keep him clean. also nice to have access to home nursing. just because mom is eligible doesn't mean you have to use hospice. you can also pull her out at any time, and to put her back on it, the doc just has to approve, which im told is easy to get. i would 100% look into this. leave it up to doc to decide, and tell them everything. if she's not eligible then thats that. ask about signs to look for when she will be. if she is eligible, id definitely look into all the options for starting up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/tdfby0/hospice_when_not_seemingly_close_to_death/,Hospice When Not Seemingly Close to Death?
[removed]," one thing i have come to learn over the years is you cannot make someone not do something even when it’s very clear to others that they shouldn’t be doing it.i would also be careful with assuming it is alzheimer’s, because some forms of cancer can manifest with alzheimer’s-like symptoms, and there are even more diseases that do too.the best advice i can give you is to advise your dad that he’s going to be a shit caregiver if he doesn’t keep on top of his health. it’s absolutely vital that he keep on top of his health, which is done best by letting an expert do assessments.i’d also suggest persuading him to allow you to install cameras in the house that you can view remotely, so can keep an eye on your mother and the house when your dad is out, and so you can help get help to him if anything happens with your mother, like her getting violent with him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/tdazf2/i_finally_came_to_the_realization_that_my_dad_has/,[deleted by user]

[removed]," yes, and unfortunately it may last much longer than 2 days....try 2 years unless of course the nursing home is planning on ""helping along the transition process."" my mom is 87 and has had dementia since at least early 2006 and is now at stage 7 for over 5 years. she lost the ability to walk and stand about 16 months ago, and has been bedridden ever since. she started to develop bedsores last summer until we got a hospital bed, and the in home care nurse helped treat and heal her wounds. her arms and legs have also become immobile since that time and she was wasn't expected to make it to 2022 per her own doctor.if you would have seen her at any point in the last 6 months you would have been convinced she had only a couple weeks left to live. she can barely even move her head now and only mumbles about a dozen nonsensical words throughout the day. alzheimer's is a cruel disease and the only blessing may be that the patient has no idea what's going on anymore and doesn't remember anything from more than 2 minutes in the past. we know she is very close to the end of her life, but we have literally been saying that since the end of 2020.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/td0nrb/black_and_blue_legs/,Black and Blue Legs

"first i wanted to say this subreddit has been very supportive getting to hear everyone's stories/tips. i know many caregivers or loved ones can feel alone in the experience but this place helps. my wife and i are finally moving forward this year to move my mother in law into a facility. wife was adopted and hence why we are both pretty young (31) caretakers. mil is turning 80 this saturday and was diagnosed about 6 years ago. we have been the primary caretakers of her and have stayed with her this whole time. there have been so many ups and downs, but to see this amazing strong woman slowly degrade has been heartbreaking. she was a professional violinist who played for the chicago symphony/chicago lyric opera. she is remarkably physically healthy for an 80 year. we have mentioned the change to her about moving to a assisted living place/memory care before. we described it as a place where she can make friends and do fun activities. she was always hostile towards the idea however and was adamant she would rather go live with family in europe than go. there is no family in europe that can take care of her but its one of those ideas that stuck with her. we are really all she has left. we have had visiting angels come and stay with her for a few hours during the day when me and my wife are working. that situation worked fine but was always temporary solution. we feel guilty moving forward with this decision but my wife and i would like to start a family of our own. being a caretaker and raising a child would be immensely stressful. we have toured a great new place about 8 mins from us which has multiple levels of memory care offered. we have also have gotten an elder care attorney to try and maximize her money for her care. she has been in the middle stages for the last few years and is still able to do a lot of things on her own as long as long as its confined to her normal daily routine. we are not sure when this year it will happen but wanted to see how peoples experience it was moving your loved ones into a place. any tips to make it easier or to prepare? i know it will be one of the hardest things we do."," hey op! first off you are doing amazing! be proud of yourself to recognize that you and your wife want to live your lives. that’s not an easy decision to make.my grandma moved into assisted living about a month or 2 ago. she is in late stage 2, early 3 where she requires a lot of assistance but doesn’t understand how much assistance she requires. (ie she can’t cook, needs constant reminders for hygiene health, only answers phone calls and can no longer dial anyone back, doesn’t understand remote control even when there’s a simple remote/instructions we created with pictures). due to family dynamics, she was placed on assisted living (long story short, some family members believe she’s just old even though we have had years of proof and doctor’s telling us she has alzheimer’s) and is paying more daily since she requires the care of a memory care unit.my recommendation is to hear what the facility recommends on where to place her. my mom and aunt are her primary caretakers but on paper my aunt is the one who makes the final call. she ignored the facilities recommendation and it’s backfiring immensely. my grandma refers to the memory care floor as death floor now since the people up there are very sickly and not as active. is that all true idk since i’ve never been there.my other recommendation is once the move is ready to happen, avoid having her around that process and make it as easy as you can for yourselves. hire movers, have similar items in the unit that she’s accustomed to. ie if there’s a radio she can use, bring the exactly same model to her living facility. sorry for the lengthily post but i’m happy to go into anymore details from my experience so feel free to dm.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/t9r3fk/transitioning_into_memory_care/,Transitioning into Memory Care

[removed]," my mom, when she was still at home, did this often. i found that distracting her with something different (offering to play cards or go for a walk) worked for a while. finally i just said ""well, let's look for it"" an ask her very specific questions about whatever was missing. what color is it? where did you see it last? did you possibly take it with you anywhere? often just feeling like she was being heard was enough. sometimes we'd actually hunt through the house for it.  she'd invariably find the thing in some odd place where she put it. of course she'd insist that she hadn't put it there and ""someone else must have done it"". i'd just say ""wow - that's something but i'm so glad we found it!"" and move on. another idea would be to offer to take her to get a new magazine that she can pick out (when you have time). this can be really frustrating because often there is no resolution to accusations like this. the best thing you can do is stay calm, realize that she has no idea how she's acting, and be as patient as possible. a few times we've had to just say ""mom, i'm sorry i can't help you with this but i'm not going to talk about it anymore, and if you insist on bringing it up i'm going to go home."" you can stop responding to the emails that are on this topic, too. i'm so sorry you're dealing with this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/sw1fkt/my_mom_thinks_i_stole_something_from_herany/,My Mom thinks I stole something from her—any thoughts on how to approach moving past it?

[removed], our family carries the psen1 mutation. my mother and brother were both diagnosed at 44. i am 46 & haven’t been tested - i won hundred percent thought that i would until it happened to me - it’s a death sentence. the only way i would’ve gotten tested is if i was going to have a child (luckily i have a stepson instead). if you test positive with one of these mutations- it is a 100% guarantee that you will have it. hopefully…. after reading your post you said that your dad had early onset- which isn’t efad. early onset is rare - efad is happens to so few people- i will probably never meet another carrier in my lifetime. and they usually won’t test you unless you have a family member that comes out positive for one of the three genes. if that is the case private message me and i can also get you into a facebook group/ it’s amazing for so many years i felt alone & and then i found people that actually knew what i was going through.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/sutxw4/experience_with_early_onset_testing/,Experience with Early Onset Testing

"hello everyone, i don't really have any valuable information to share right now. i just want to get this out. it has been very stressful in the last couple of weeks. my mom has been complaining about feeling a decline in cognitive activity and poor memory for some time now, but she went for an evaluation a few days ago, and the results are, she has reduced cognitive ability in the area of concentration and short term memory. i don't think anyone will give her an alzheimer's diagnosis at this point, but on both sides of her family they have a history. she has an appointment with a neurologist next week.i have never seen the last stages, so i thought it was just, short term memory and general forgetfulness, getting disoriented, wandering, needing more care... but, i'm reading about the final stages now, and it's very distressing. my mom was a linguistics professor, she just retired. it's very sad to think that she could loose her language abilities, or just thinking of what it might look like... i'm also scared of how i'd handle it, and how i'll focus on other tasks. i have a very demanding profession, and so little time... my mom was a very hardworking woman, and even seeing her like this now, stopping mid-sentence or forgetting what she was about to do is distressing. and she won't get a chance to enjoy her retirement, she spent her life working... i'm also scared that i'll have it too, and i'm thinking that i'll need to have enough money saved up before retiring to pay for care.i don't know how people go through this, and how they handle the stress... what are some strategies?", at this stage it is just mild cognitive impairment. it may or may not progress much further.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vg57jf/i_just_want_to_share_this/,I just want to share this
"hey everyone,long story short, my girlfriends elderly father has been diagnosed this year with advanced dementia. he's currently in the anger stage, and given that her mom (his wife) is a nurse, he tends to get angry and says ""she's a nurse, she should be doing a better job."" he's currently broken a rib and is angry over the care that he's receiving from his wife. my girl is having a difficult time coping since she's an only child and we live roughly an hour away. she goes up when she can to assist her mom and to just give her mother a break since she also works full time (no longer in hospital rn). i will accompany her when i can be available since i work a 3x3 rotation. is there any advice anyone can provide for us... we're doing our best but, i'm at the stage where i feel like my assistance and lack of being able to assist is taking a toll on my gf. i wish i could help more but i'm not very educated on the topic and am also trying to work overtime to make it so she can take more time off to help her mom and we don't go under financially.if there's any resources or assistance programs for family members of dementia pt's in canada that you know of. we appreciate any and all insight. take care, and hope everyone's spirits are up."," is dad already on medication? seroquel/quetiapine or lorazepam can be life changing in smoothing out the anger and mood swingsget the book the 36 hour day, get one for mom too, flip through it as needed for advice what behavior to expect and how to handle it. much of the advice is counterintuitive",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vg54lu/anger_stage_assistance/,Anger Stage Assistance
"hi all, my grandfather did another dip decline, and he's having trouble walking, even with a walker. i had to take him to the hospital twice in 10 days for falls----the second one much more minor, but he jammed his toe pretty badly. he's more disoriented lately, more anxious at times, and also quieter, which is outside the scope of his base personality. he is beginning to have chain reactions from dehydration, and had some problems giving buspar a try for anxiety. last week (and last night but to a much lesser extent) his dehydration from being a brat about drinking water caused a change reaction; namely, rising creatinine levels in his kidneys, and then a subsequent rise in his troponin levels, an enzyme in his heart. i notice that his legs blew up last night, swelling with fluid puffing his calves, ankles and feet up. i know that can be a sign that heart failure is on the way----its not surprising but this is a fast decline and i'm just getting nervous. i have several appointments over the next month (cardiologist, neurologist, primary care doctor, np home visit) so i will know what's going on with some medical confirmations if he is approaching heart failure (he is already in stage 2 kidney failure). i'm obviously sad because he went off a new cliff and i know it will only progress probably faster and faster. his decline has been extremely fast----he could still drive last june, and have conversations that were still sensical. vascular dementia is rough, but maybe less cruel. we are keeping him home still (we're blue collar irish catholics, please, no comments about placement at the moment). we have an arsenal of home health care and likely the option for home hospice as soon as the need arises. does anyone have any experience with vascular dementia and potential heart failure brewing? i just have such a bad feeling about this dip, like we're going to be approaching the end by the end of the year. :("," i am sorry you are going throught this.  my mom has dementia currently.  my dad died of heart failure in 2019.  with your grandfather's bad kidneys, it will be hard to get the fluid off with diuretics since those are awful for the kidneys.  my dad was getting really bad (mentally he was still pretty good) when a ""sudden heart incident"" happened and he peacefully died.  since i have experience with both dementia in one parent and heart failure in the other, i will say that dealing with dementia is much worse for the patient and the family...  and my mom, who is aware she has bad memory loss which will probably get very much worse, has stated that if she develops some sort of other serious disease, we are to just keep her as comfortable as possible.  keeping someone alive through heroic and intrusive medical care when they have dementia is not the kindest route for the patient, something to think about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vg30uv/dementia_and_early_heart_failure_dehydration/,"Dementia and Early Heart Failure, Dehydration"

"thank you to everyone on this subreddit for their helpful advice and kind words.   all of you are dealing with a difficult and cruel disease.my 85 year old mother was experiencing severe pain at the beginning of the month.   her dementia was pretty advanced and i had noticed even more of a decline in the last six weeks- more weight loss, more confusion, less interest in the few things she still enjoyed.   but one day we found her standing in her bathroom, in terrible pain.  a staffer and i were helping her on the toilet and she began to scream like a woman in labor.  long, sustained screams of agony.   thank god for hospice.  she had a standing order for as-needed morphine and it was agreed, she needed it.   we wondered if she had gotten up in the middle of the night, fell, hurt herself but was able to get back into bed and woke up wondering where she was and why she was in searing pain.   after that, with the loving care of memory care and hospice, we made the decision to keep her on round the clock morphine and lorazepam.  no pain, no anxiety.  we did not want to awaken her enough to eat or drink because the pain was unrelenting and the screaming began anew.i hate that dementia robbed her of so much in her life, removed the joys of traveling, recalling trips via her photographs, made beloved outings to thrift stores into scary and bewildering experiences.  she was keen on movies and movie stars but that interest faded when she could no longer follow the plots of films.  we found ways to bring joy along each step of her decline.   when she could no longer do counted cross stitch, she loved painting wooden bird houses.   when she couldn't shop, i would bring her clothing catalogues.   i played her favorite music on my phone and showed her lots of pictures of a great grandchild.if i have any advice for those here it is this1.  take care of yourself.  stress can cause enormous damage to your health.  self care is not to be found in a half gallon of your favorite ice cream.  walk and exercise when you can.  eat healthy foods.  look for stress reducing activities in your life.  ask others for help if you can.2.  utilize hospice early.  my mother entered hospice about 9 months ago as she was steadily losing weight.  the extra attention with the 1-2 visits a week really made her days better.3.  keep seeking out medications that help.  it's not just for challenging or unsafe behaviors, but to make the person with dementia have happier days. in the last months, days without lorazepam were like scenes from the exorcist.   days with the medication were filled with sunshine and my mother contentedly counted her blessings and raved about all the loving care she was getting.  4.  the end of life can be unpredictable and it can be strange.  the last food and drink my mother had was a bit of her favorite candy on the 7th but she was in no pain or discomfort because of the medications given.  i thought without fluid, she would pass peacefully a few days later.  it was 11 days.  it felt surreal, but hospice says it can happen.  we made sure any unfinished business was taken care of- we had a priest  in to give her last rites, family came into town, we assured her everyone was well.  i even joked that maybe, she had an unfulfilled hit list of mortal enemies and that i would promise to track down and seek revenge on everyone who failed to write her a thank you or return a pyrex dish.be kind to yourselves.  it's hard to make the right decisions at difficult times- when to place a loved one in memory care or forcing a parent or spouse into the car for a neurology visit or forcing yourself to lie to them out of kindness to spare them pain.much love to you all.  i'm thankful the end was peaceful- no more confusion, indignities of diapers, no more pain."," sending you love, peace, and healing from a fellow traveller on this wretched road.  i hope the offramp takes you somewhere beautiful. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vfxr7n/her_journey_is_over/,Her journey is over

"a little backstory. my mother-in-law is almost 86 years old, she has a long history of mental health illness. she was technically diagnosed with bipolar some 40 years ago, however, i'm not sure that was totally accurate (hers was more of a psychosis episodes). unfortatnely she lives in rural kansas and good psychiatrists (or any for that much) are hard to come by. she was committed several times due to her psychosis. since i've known her for a little over 20 years, she has more or less managed with the help of her husband and maybe some anti-anxiety medication (though none of us are certain she took those), but she has always had a lot of anxiety. she can't even watch a basic tv show without getting anxious. now fast forward to a couple years ago, her memory getting worse and she was diagnosed with dementia (again, this is western kansas, so not a firm diagnosis). my husband's parents hide a lot of details from us, so there could be a more specific diagnosis, but we're not aware of that. my father-in-law has now picked up all household chores, but that has become too much for him, and he has been hospitalized numerous times in the past couple years since he had covid (and she can barely cope when he is hospitalized). also, i should mentioned, there is no family that lives in their town and the closest sibling is three hours away. needless to say, it is time for them to move to an assistant living place. we have found a great one and it is in the same city as my husband's sister! however, my mother-in-law is very anxious about this move and her drinking has become increasingly excessive (she's always been a skotch drinker though). a couple weeks ago i counted her drinking six skotch on the rocks in one evening. she gets so drunk she pisses herself on occasion and has been vomiting as well. and, then when she's drinking, she becomes overly emotional and even more irrational...and then her memory even worse. i'm pretty sure she is drinking nightly and this is her way of coping and self-medicating. it doesn't help that her husband indulges in his bourbon with her every night as well; it's like they have a cocktail party for themselves every night.  of course, we're well past the point of putting her into rehab, but it's more the emotional toll it takes on her when she does drink. my question is: has any caregiver experience this with their dementia parent? how did you manage it?hopefully once we move them, we can get a psychiatrist for her that can help. she's in a very bad mental space right now...and i don't see her coming out of it anytime soon."," mom has dementia and after an idiot kept bring her wine every time he visited.

"since her diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment last year, her short term memory was slowly declining.  she never would say she had dementia; rather, 'some problems remembering' and i avoided the 'd' word, even though two sisters died from it and one is in memory care.   now, her memory is declining rapidly and, while i can, i discuss it, clearly, not sugar coating it nor pretending it's not as bad as it seems.  it's uncomfortable telling her that she's getting worse because it's acknowledging that she's looking at what might be the cause of her demise, if it isn't something else.  she told me she's fine with another neuro evaluation but even i have trepidation with what the doctor might tell us.  i was with my father when he was told he had three months to live.  we heard from my mother's surgeon when he told us her cancer had spread and was terminal.  there aren't any 'good' serious diseases.", look into the bredesen protocol it could help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vbl756/i_talk_straight_with_my_wife/,I talk straight with my wife

"my aunt is currently in a nursing home, where she went for rehab after suffering a stroke in september. at the time she was discharged to the nh from the hospital, no diagnosis of dementia appeared on her record. it was aphasia and cognitive deficits caused by stroke (along with diabetes). she seemed to bounce back fairly well from the stroke (she has anomic aphasia which means not word salad, but she substitutes wrong words which sometimes sound like or have a shared meaning with the word she wants). if you don’t know she has aphasia, she does sound whacked out, like she’s playing mad libs. trouble is, the nh environment is chaotic and that makes her aphasia even worse. somehow, everyone there assumes she has dementia. i even saw it on her nh records and have no idea how she got “diagnosed” with it. she had a low bims score, but that wasn’t surprising after the stroke. i had her speech therapist do cognitive exams appropriate to an aphasic patient and she scored somewhat better, but i do believe the stroke caused some mild cognitive deficit.that said, i don’t know if she isn’t in the beginning stages of dementia or how it is even diagnosed. she hasn’t had a personality change. she seems oriented. we have meaningful conversations once the aphasia is allowed for. i can’t figure out why this on her nursing home record.what i do see in her is a slow continuation of tendencies she has for years before her stroke - she is happy to get important items and gifts she has requested - but her interest in them fades in 1-2 weeks and they sit unused after that.  she doesnt forget about the items so much as she loses interest and is very passive. today i discovered that the water jug i gave her for her bedside, which was happy to get 6 weeks ago, had never been touched and had mold in it. it was in plain sight the whole time. the music player she was thrilled to get and learned to use - she never touches it now. this happens over and over. is this dementia or ""just"" cognitive decline? like i said, she's ignored her belongings for years and before her stroke had some hoarding issues.she is 77 with diabetes.", different types of dementia are diagnosed in different ways.you might check the links on this page for diagnosis issues >> ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vb0qep/how_is_dementia_officially_diagnosed/,How is dementia officially diagnosed?

"my bf's mother has been having symptoms of dementia now for going on almost 3 years, she is 68 years old. about a year and a half ago her youngest daughter told me that she had overheard her tell a friend over the phone that she had been driving home from work one evening and ended up forgetting where she lived and so she drove around for hours which while it is obviously a symptom of something going on, is also significant because her place of work is only a 1 minute drive from her home, or 4 mins walking distance. we should have taken her keys then, because about 4 months later she ended up crashing her vehicle. when asked what happened she told us 3 different versions of what happened, none of which matched the accident report, which was determined her to be at fault and led to her having to pay for the damages to the other vehicle out of pocket (she was uninsured at the time of the accident) . now, i included the backstory so that you can get an idea of the progress of her dementia thus far. presently she cannot remember dates, recent events , and she constantly loses items such as keys, phone, purse, wallet, bank cards. now what does any of the above have to do with pets? well she currently has 3 dogs, and 5 cats, all of which are indoor pets, none of which are housetrained, even the cats ...they frequently go inside of plastic containers full of clothes or in the bathtub . me and my bf ( her son ) buy all of her food, with the exception of debby cakes which is the only thing she ever buys for herself to eat, she spends the rest of her grocery money on pet food, and treats.if it isn't already starting to become obvious, she really loves and cares about her animals, but particularly her cats, which she constantly worries to death over if they are not all within viewing range 24/7, which is not how most cats roll. a little more info on her cats: out of the 5 of them, there are 3 adults and 2 kittens (which are a week and a half old)  their mother died just 1 day ago from infection. she was suffering at his mother's home for around 3 days due to his mother not taking her to the vet, now she no longer has a running vehicle, but frequently recieves rides from friends and family members to where ever she needs to go, but she wouldn't ask them to take her to the local vet, despite breaking down several times to me and her son about how much she loved her and prayed to god nothing happened to her. she was obviously extremely stressed out about this situation. she had talked to several friends on the phone telling them about her cat.. with each friend being given a unique retelling of what was going on,  but when one offered to take her to the vet she declined, exclaiming that she didn't have the money or way to get there ...even though they offered her a ride there. i ended up losing my patience because i saw just how much this cat was suffering and who know how long it would continue to suffer for, and because we live in a rural community, the local vet is not open on saturday's, i ended up finding her a ride to the nearest emergency vet ( 2hrs away) myself , hoping to god the cat would survive only to learn that it did not make it, and that now there would be the added stress of two newborn kittens put into her to take care of. just taking care of them while she was gone to the vet was extremely stressful to me, let alone to someone who's memory is fading.now when she returned home that night i tried to ask her what had happened, but she obviously couldn't remember , and began to just tell me different stories of what had occurred, i still haven't gotten ahold of the woman i got to take her there. but back to the main point of this post which is could all of these pets of hers actually be causing her condition to worsen faster? i know that pets can be of great help to those with dementia but because she has so many i believe that in her case it may just be doing the opposite...am i wrong for feeling this way? i care about her and just want to know what i should do to help. today she has been especially aggressive towards everyone today due to the stress of caring for the kittens and not wanting to accept help when given .", this website is helpful in showing you the options for medicaid waivers etc for low income disabled seniors who need home care etc  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/vaweum/are_her_pets_speeding_up_her_brains_deterioration/,Are her pets speeding up her brains deterioration?
my mom has always been kind of quirky and maybe a little spacey. but as she’s gotten older i have found it hard for her to remember short term things.for an example. i was coming home to visit her and she would ask me what days i was coming. we talk everyday so i would have remind her what days. she could remember that i was coming though we went bridal shopping and when i got she asked where did my fiancé put my dress. and then 5 mins later ask again where did my fiancé put my dress.other than that. she’s pretty sharp. if there was something that happened at work. she’ll be like “oh yeah i need to tell you this story”. or if i ask her to recall something she can do so with ease.i guess i’m worried because my grandmother her mom has dementia. i’ve brought up my worries and she gets aggravated because she doesn’t think she has anything wrong. she thinks she’s distracted which is valid. my brother is going out the country which she’s worried about. i’m trying to have kids at 34 and she’s worried if i can have kids. she’s a worrier always thinking about something so i don’t know.she’s agreed to go see a doctor this week to see. but want to see if the above are signs or do more need to be showing.," glad to hear she has agreed to see doctor.  possibly nothing, but ...

"tldr: *how do you grieve and remember someone you've loved for decades... when you dont have a memory?*ive been caretaker for my grandparents for several years now. we lost my grandpa a few months ago, and my grandma's dementia has been a slow burn for many years. losing her partner of nearly 70 years was traumatic though, and has exacerbated her memory care needs. we are both struggling with grief- they are like actual parents to me moreso than grandparentsm. all the ""experts"" say the best way to keep a loved one alive is to remember them often, tell stories, etc. and that it takes an unknown amount of time to heal from grief. it's been about 6 months and i still feel raw from it, i can't imagine how hard this is for her. (i really really can't, any insights are welcome).time fluctuates for her. sometimes it's as if the funeral just happened, sometimes it feels like months or years ago. she has no memory of the funeral or if she went, or if she was there when he died (she was for both). she's had 2-3 sudden extreme unexplained dizzy spells, but i suspect she forgot where she was or that he was gone, and then ""awoke"" to this reality and was overwhelmed and panicked. (staff in her a.l. memory unit took all vitals, we've been to the dr and ran every test we could think of to rule out stroke seizure heart problems etc..). she appears to be in perfect health.  how can i help her grieve in a healthy way when she has no consistent predictable memory? i try to bring up happy stories when her mood is up and shes already thinking of him, but the dementia is causing grief bombs that are so hard on her it just breaks my heart.  does anyone have any experience or advice?"," i knew a woman with a similar issue. she would forget her mother died, then remember, then say that she didn't go to the funeral, they must have been hiding it from her, etc.her family said she did go to the funeral. so i would tell her yes, you were at the funeral and you helped plan it. but it was such a painful time for you that maybe your brain is trying to help you by blocking it out because it hurt so badly to lose her. you loved her so much, she was a wonderful woman, wasn't she? she grew up in wherever, right? everyone loved her cooking. and at that point the woman would be calm enough to go into reminisces of her mother. she was still very sad, but she accepted the idea that she blocked it out because she loved her so much (rather than she forgot because it didn't matter).sometimes we'd spend ten minutes on that one concept. your brain is trying to protect you out of love because you cared for her so much. all those words, love, protect, care, matter, meaningful, over and over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v7wm2o/grieving_death_while_living_with_dementia/,Grieving Death While Living with Dementia

"last year i noticed some things with my mother that was off with her.  by october, there was a list of things that wasn't quite right. eg:- she ignored a request from her lawyer- there was some social anxiety about a family funeral- she lost her balance at the funeral and fell over- there were episodes of intense anger over very little since 2020- there was some silence from her like a mutism.  no conversation at times- easily bored- she left her bank card behind in the shop. i thought nothing of these stand alone incidents until one day it clicked with me and i began to wonder if she's losing her mind and if she's going senile and perhaps a dementia setting in.then there were other things like invading other family members privacy with eavesdropping and snooping. there was a lack of comprehension on public health matters and at home she would cough and sneeze without covering and containing potential germs.  i remember last summer we were having a meal out after the funeral and she needed to cough.. she turned her head inwards to where i was sitting and coughed into my direction over me and my meal.  then in april of this year, i found some of my underwear amongst her laundry. she never washes my clothes so it looked like she took my underwear as hers. there was an episode from her where it demonstrates poor planning and organising.  we have amily abroad who wanted to come home on holidays and the panic she showed was intense to the degree there was self combustion in anger and rage.  there was definitely some sort of a showtime with her too because she can hide that anger and rage when it suits her and only has it for me, her daughter. i noticed over the past number of weeks that she has been neglecting her health. she has a sore back and sometimes she has some headaches.  she won't go to the doctor about this. she's been eligible for a booster for a number of weeks and she has neglected this too. at this stage i am genuinely concerned about her especially now because she is neglecting her health.  she's not open for me into talking with her. it will lead to an explosion of anger and rage from her and accusations that i am trying to boss her around and i am not trying to boss her around.  when she gets angry she's nasty.  if she was to go to the doctor, she won't be listing these behaviours out to her gp because she's probably unaware of them. chatting with her is out of the question. i am a member of the same practice she goes to.   i am thinking about writing a letter and making an appointment for myself (i have some things to do at the gp myself) and discussing this in person with a doctor and giving them a letter. i am hoping they will invite her in for a baseline of work.", i like your idea of writing a letter to the doctor. i’d ask the doctor to invite her in for an exam because she hit some benchmark age and they went rindo preventative checkups,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v7ribq/how_do_you_get_an_aging_parent_to_the_doctorgp/,How do you get an aging parent to the doctor/GP

"hello, so i’ve lived with my mother in law for around a year now, we are very close. when i moved in her father was showing early signs of dementia, but over the year has quickly declined to needing a care home now which he is moving into next week. i use to be a dementia care worker so i know the ins and outs well. she just seems very unable to process her father’s dementia which i understand can be hard, but she is often set on ‘when he gets better’ ‘when he improves’ and well i know almost for sure that sadly he won’t be getting any better. the issue is i can see it affecting his care in the future, she is reluctantly putting him in the care home due to his at home carers saying it is now a necessity (he is getting up in the early hours wandering the streets, leaving the oven on etc). she is claiming he will be back home soon, and is only currently planning to pay for a short stay at the care home. i feel as if i’m intruding when i try and speak to her about him, but for his sake she really needs to change her mindset on the situation and i’m not too sure how i can help her come to terms, any ideas?"," have you suggested that she subscribe to this reddit thread?  reading everyone else's situations could help her process what she's experiencing, whether she wants to believe it or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v7prnk/how_do_i_help_my_mother_in_law_come_to_terms_with/,How do I help my mother in law come to terms with her father’s dementia?
"i am dealing with a very difficult situation. my grandfather hasn’t received a diagnosis because he is being exploited by someone outside the family. i am no longer allowed in his house because i’ve been accused of trying to hurt him after i began to raise the alarm to his doctor, the bank and aps.some days it’s been borderline, he will say things that are inappropriate about other people. he uses the word letter instead of email…but yesterday it was full blown dementia. he couldn’t use the keyboard anymore. even with full on instruction, he wasn’t able to log-in to pay his bills. it took him 2 hours to do something that should have taken 5-10 minutes max online.and yet his doctor still hasn’t ordered any brain imaging! she even heard him on the phone yesterday. meanwhile, this “friend” keeps telling people it’s his hearing, his glasses, sleep, medication…but i know she’s just trying to keep taking advantage of him for as long as possible.until this past month my husband thought i was making things up/exaggerating…my sister still dismisses things that i bring up.it has been terribly painful. i’ve been accused of poisoning my grandfather, trying to steal his money, of being on drugs….all by people trying to take advantage of this situation.i know not everyone who is in denial is trying to take advantage of him but what blows my mind is that his doctor still hasn’t ordered any cognitive assessments!!!"," first, sorry that you're dealing with this.second, i'm going to differ a little by suggesting you not go in guns blazing with righteous fury, calling adult protective services or whatever.  (although maybe it's too late for this.)your goal is to get them to take your grandfather to his primary care physician for a standard test of his mental faculties -- e.g. repeat three words (e.g. apple, pen, cat) after five minutes of discussion, drawing a clock with hands on it for a certain time, etc.third... i'm going to answer the question you asked in your title, even though i think you've already made up your mind.why does dementia denial exist?* sometimes it really is only because a caretaker is exploiting them.  yes, this happens, and it's awful.* sometimes people just can't face that their loved one/friend is deteriorating, both because they are ""in denial"" about losing the person and, maybe, because it reminds them of their own mortality and the fact that most of us will suffer from dementia if we live that long.* sometimes people don't like facing hard truths, the same way people people wait too long to see the doctor for a treatable illness or deny that a family member has fallen off the wagon.* sometimes people are too close to the situation.  what's the saying, you can boil a frog alive by just turning up the heat a little bit and a little bit and the frog doesn't notice till it's too late.  someone living with dementia might just be telling themselves that the person is slowing down, and adjust to them without really realizing it.* sometimes, conversely, people are too far away.  people with dementia can sometimes fake clarity for a little while in a situation that they're comfortable with, fooling people who don't see them every day.and outsiders (doctors, police etc) are in a difficult position when someone who is not the caretaker says the person is being taken advantage of, if it's not obvious, flagrant abuse.so... this is a long way of answering your question... you can go in guns blazing, or you can try to get them to take him to his doctor for a real assessment and maybe get some medication that can help slow down his deterioration.  good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v7oc94/why_does_dementia_denial_exist/,Why does dementia denial exist?
"dad (95) and mom (90) will be married 70 years this october.  mom was diagnosed with dementia about 5 years ago.  dad has always been almost slavishly devoted to her, and mom has always been more aloof but we don't doubt they love each other.  my sister and her husband moved into my parent's home about 4 years ago to keep an eye on them.dad's health took a turn for the worse last month.  he spent about 2 weeks in the hospital. we started to doubt he would make it but thankfully he did.  the problem is mom convinced herself that dad was not around because he was cheating on her with 2 other women.  she was angry and wanted to talk to a lawyer to begin the divorce.  we took her to the hospital to visit and she calmed down, but was angry at us for not telling her he was in the hospital.  no one had hidden this from her, but she didn't remember anyone telling her about it.  meanwhile, dad kept repeating that he just wanted to go home and be with his wife.we hired a woman to take them out twice a week and also to take them to any doctor's appointments that a family member can't get them to.  dad had a follow up visit yesterday, so the woman took my parents.  mom again started up with her insistence that dad is having an affair but now it's with 3 women,  she was very angry and shoved him at the hospital.  my sister has said mom has gotten more abusive but this is the first time she was physical with my dad.my sisters want to put my mom in a home.  i'm the only person against this idea.  they did not do well when they were apart for 2 weeks, and i'm convinced we'll lose both of them.  my sisters counter that dad can visit her often, but i'm insistent that it's not our decision to make.  dad needs to be the one to agree with it or we can't do it.  my sisters think i'm being unreasonable.  they say we have to decide for them. mom is mentally impaired,  this is a fact.  no one ever tested dad's mental wellbeing, and as long as he's not legally impaired then i feel we have to be respectful of his wishes.  i think he's going to resent us if we split them up.this whole situation sucks."," i agree the situation sucks, but most states if the person was abusive would okay them for memory care through their system. (sorry i can’t remember the name for medicare like insurance, but for people without funds.)  that may not be your case, funds wise, but it will give you an indication of when it’s appropriate to make the move for your mom. it might ease your mom’s mental state not to be constantly reminded of her “cheating husband.”  also, he is at risk for injury and possible serious injury if he were to fall due to a push by your mom, not to mention the mental/physiological toll it takes on your dad. i’d suggest being open minded about it, and look at your true reasons for your response. not the facts so much as your inner deep feelings about it. this is not easy for us to see this happen to our parent(s). also, find out who has the legal authority.  your folks trusted that person to make the right decision for them. good luck to you and your family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/v78eu7/talk_about_separating_our_parents_im_the_lone/,Talk about separating our parents.

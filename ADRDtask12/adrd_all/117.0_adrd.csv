"he's been having delusions ever since he had stroke last year. the one i've heard about include him not letting the dentist work on his teeth because he thinks the dentists hand were covered in semen, believing my sister was out to get him, believing mom is trying to control him by taking away his drivers license (the government did when he was diagnosed with alzhiemers.) tonight he put the dog in his room and told me he thinks i'm biting her genitals. i screamed at him that it was the craziest thing i've ever heard and called him a sick fuck. i know i didn't do the right thing but i don't know what to do. i can't stand the thought that he thinks of me like that. he told me he saw me do it. i just don't know what to do.", i’m so sorry. just know that people like me have also gone through this. i went through this with my grandma. know that you’re in my prayers. you are a good person for being there for your father.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ctt5xo/my_dad_has_paranoid_delusions_he_had_one_about_me/,My Dad has paranoid delusions.

"hello,essentially, my grandmother, who i have cared for recently got hospitalized a second time for pulling a knife on me on sunday night. i did not want to call the police, but i felt the need to, due to the condition et al. i went back to work today, and found out after i got off an hour ago that she got ""discharged into police custody"" and the county attorney wants to pursue charges, so that he gains jurisdiction over her, which would make her a ward of the state, so they can find placement for her in a facility.. however, why am i feeling extremely guilty? why do i feel like i abandoned her? even if i cannot take care of her physically anymore, why do i feel like shit about it? deep down, i know it was the right thing to do, and she needs placement to be safe, but at the same time, i'm feeling really horrible about this. i know she misses the dogs and being home... she's been such a big part of my life (she took care of me since birth) that now i feel like i've just up and dumped her in a strange place.. i honestly know i shouldn't want this, but i want her back home.. how do i cope?"," i know you feel bad for calling the police, but you did the right thing. she could have taken it even further. an elderly lady i know stabbed her husband 8 times with a steak knife because she didn’t like something he said. luckily, the knife wasn’t very sharp and he was able to break a window to get away from her and get out of the house. he was told to commit her or the state would.  now, you will be safe, and so will she. as her disease progresses, she will forget about the attack, then about her house, etc.  also, they will find the right medication to make her safer to be around.  can you imagine how she must feel when she is in that state? so she will probably feel better too.  she’ll be in a better place for everyone.   hugs to both of you, from me in florida.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ctpard/why_do_i_feel_extremely_guilty_all_of_a_sudden/,Why do I feel extremely guilty all of a sudden?

"hello everyone, i recently found out an old friend of mine was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia a couple years ago. i also was informed that he is now unable to speak so i have no way of communicating with him directly.he is currently under the care of his parents as well as caregivers and lives separately from his wife and children. apparently his memory is still intact and is able to walk.as my information is limited on his condition, i'm wondering what his life is likely like now and how much longer he has to live? i was also informed that i could only see him for a quick visit which makes it clear he's not in a good state.i'm just having a hard time wrapping my head around this as i keep recalling the days where we were hanging out and just doing what young kids do like play games, trade cards, etc. i'm also hesitant to try to pry for too much information from his family members as i'm sure they already have a lot to deal with.from the literature i've read as well as documentaries and other videos online, it is a terrible disease that eats away at your personality and ability to behave and think properly. it would be really appreciated to get some first hand information from someone who has cared for another person with this disease. thanks in advance."," hi, i’ve only ever cared for someone with dementia in hospitals i’ve worked at, never a family member or friend. i have studied dementia through university so may be able to give some insight into what’s going on for your friend.our cognition is divided up into several domains including memory, executive functioning, and language, and these generally correspond with actual physical areas in the brain. with ftd the frontal (behaviour, planning, emotion, social appropriateness) and temporal (language, speech, communication) lobes are primarily affected. two people with ftd may present in entirely different ways. someone may be able to produce speech but what they say makes no sense. someone may be able to understand you but not speak. someone may have personality changes and act aggressively - it depends on what parts of their brain has been affected and the severity of it. generally in the earlier stages of ftd memory isn’t affected as this is a different part of the brain, but as all dementias are progressive in nature it will likely get affected eventually.it can be very difficult for family and friends to cope with these changes, especially since ftd is more common in younger people compared to other dementias.i think a lot of families affected by dementia feel isolated as friends and relatives don’t know how to act or what to say or what to do. i’m not sure if your exact relationship with this person and their family but i wonder if reaching out and seeing him could be helpful for them all so they aren’t so alone. it might be confronting seeing your friend act differently to how you remember though. there are lots of great resources online (dementia.org.au if you are in australia is a great website) for info and tips",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ctd2gv/life_expectancy_for_someone_with_ftd_and_what/,Life expectancy for someone with FTD and what they're likely going through?

"hello again, kind r/dementia peeps. here's a bit of backstory. well, a lot of backstory. i'm lost and don't know what to do. my father has problems: untreated ptsd from vietnam, some other sort of untreated mental illness (he has a colorful, rich history of verbal/emotional abuse, lying, and manipulation), and has recently been showing signs of dementia. he refuses to see a counselor, so untreated it shall remain. he and my mother divorced some months ago and he decided to move clear across the country, away from my sister and myself, despite my protests. i got power of attorney as i was worried about his obviously declining mental state.now he's delusional and lashing out at my mother, sister, and me. my maternal grandmother recently died and, upon finding out, my father began a campaign of phone harassment against my mother, calling her dozens of times with seemingly normal requests for things he abandoned at their old home. she has told him to stop and he just keeps calling. she has recently filed a protection order to (hopefully) make him stop.he has been telling people that my sister has been encouraging him to kill himself (my sister can be an asshole but would never do that) and has been attempting to contact her friends and husband's family. when he successfully contacts someone, he starts out claiming he just wants to tell ""his side of the story"" , then goes on telling them stories of how she's ""a whore and is abandoning her children"", and about the bad decisions she made as a teenager. over twenty years ago.during my last phone conversation with him, i explicitly stated that i don't want to talk about whatever is going on between him, my mother, and my sister. in response, immediately after those words left my mouth, he started going on with this ""your sister told me to kill myself"" fantasy. when i politely but firmly told him i just stated i didn't want to talk about that, he simply says ""i'll never bother you again"" and hangs up. now i am receiving slews of emails, text messages, and facebook messages where he berates me from ""dropping him like a piece of shit during his time of need"" and that it's bullshit that i'm remaining neutral. he's now demanding i revoke the power of attorney (not happening and he doesn't know he can do it himself). he was never mentally stable enough to talk things out before so it's not like i can discuss this with him, so i just ignore him and block these messaging and email accounts. he then makes a new account and starts doing the same.needless to say, my father is unhinged. i don't know what to do. while i have poa, it isn't effective until he's incapacitated in some way, physically or mentally, and all of the resources i've contacted state that there's not much i can do until it gets bad enough where he's evaluated.does anyone have any suggestions on what to do in the meantime? i want to look out for him and to be there for when i can actually help him, but i'm not down for simply enduring a slew of abuse.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ct915d/father_being_abusive_not_sure_how_to_handle_it/,"Father being abusive, not sure how to handle it"
"hi, i had an incident happen with a close family member and now i'm being told that person may have the early symptoms of dementia. if anyone can offer some insight on this it's much appreciated. the simple version of events is as follows: my uncle and i had been pretty close for about a decade. we liked the same music and home decor, we'd attend concerts and go shopping together frequently. i helped him with his computer and other ""young people"" things. he lived about 40 mins from me.i'm the only niece of his, he has no children. he's about 70 now. i was to be the executor of his estate and he had planned to leave me his home, although i'd never asked for or expected it. he retired about 2 years ago. he was in a high stress job in the medical field. when he retired he up and moved to a town where he only knew one person and was about 6 hours or so from any other family including me and my husband. he sold his home and bought another with the equity; when he purchased the new home he was very into getting a will made and a trust set up. seemed out of the blue but i figured because of the house he wanted to be feeling secure. he's had some serious health issues that he'd not told anyone about. he mentioned it on the phone just before the incident happened, maybe two weeks prior. we were literally emailing once to twice a week, sometimes a phone call. the last conversation had been about my new job and that he'd tried a new recipe that i should check out. really run of the mill kind of stuff... over the months prior i had noticed he would bring up people in conversation that he had been fairly close to for 15, 20, even 30 or 40 years and totally just go to town on why they're no longer a quality person. this was very out of character and i'd mentioned that but he was aggressive so it got dropped... basically this happened 3 or 4 times with random people he'd once been considered family with. it was over petty petty things. very strange. a month or so went by and i'd gotten no responses from him. i figured he was busy or maybe just wasn't in the mood to talk. it wasn't like him but i didn't want to be a pest. we had the earthquakes out near him so i asked my aunt (his sister) if maybe she'd spoken with him since just to know he was alright. she said he was just fine and that she'd seen him a few weeks earlier on their roadtrip to visit another relative. anyway, i finally emailed my uncle 2 or 3 weeks after just letting him know i have no idea why he hadn't responded and that i love him and hope he is ok. he emailed the next day and wrote about 5 paragraphs as to why i was no longer a quality person. made me cry it was so harsh. not necessarily accurate, but very harsh. it was hard to hear from someone i'd been so tight with. my mom (his sister with whom he hasn't spoken to in 20 years) says this could be early symptoms of dementia.... i'm just looking for some insight. thoughts? much much appreciated, thanks"," i have a good friend that went through a very similar situation with his mother after she was diagnosed with dementia. hard to advise, really. i would reach out to other family or other contacts who might be in touch with your uncle. possibly schedule a trip to visit with him along with your aunt?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ct5txo/looking_for_insight_please_assist/,"Looking for insight, please assist."
"my grandpa was diagnosed with dementia about 2 years ago. he lived in florida and we brought him where we live so my dad could be closer and keep a better watch on him. my grandpa left my dad and his brothers life when my dad was 8 years old. after he left, he lost contact with his sons. rightfully so, my dad suffers some resentment towards his father. now that my grandpa has dementia, my dad feels morally obligated to take care of his dad even though he didn't to his son when he was young. however, my uncle doesn't feel that he owes his dad anything. my dad has a very stressful job that causes him to travel often and is currently putting me through college. his brother has no kids, a very stable job, and is an hour flight away. i have reached out to him and just said, ""hey i know how you feel about your dad. but if you don't help because of how you feel about him, at least do it for my dad"". of course, he said he would help but actions always speak louder than words.i am wondering what my role is to my dad? how can i best support him? i am in college an hour away from home and have my own commitments. i try not to add any stress to my dad's life and always let him know that i am doing okay so he doesn't have to worry."," family dynamics like you described are complicated and there is no right or easy  answer.  dementia related diseases really test a families capacity for unity or discord. i think part of it comes down to financial capacity to help and  support your grandfather, if your family can pool money together and get a caregiver or a care facility that might be the easiest solution. as far as obligation and who should do what, it's virtually impossible to make people who have little desire or interest to help out, asking them to contribute financially is likely the easiest course.  good luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ct5jhx/grandchild_of_someone_with_dementia/,Grandchild of someone with dementia

"my grandmother has vascular dementia.  her memory is still good. she mainly struggles with cognition and confusion and executive functions.  she lives far away from me.  my mother and i have tried for decades... literally decades to get her to move to be closer to us.  she'll agree and then pull the plug at the last minute every time.  we've spent so much money on this:  my mom bought an apartment for her but when my gm saw the apartment, she didn't like the finishes so she refused to move, i bought a house with a basement walkout apartment for her but she didn't like that the living area was separate from the rest of the house so she refused to move, i tried to get her to come back to a place of her choosing but she didn't want to fly - she wanted me to drive out and pick her up and drive her back 6,000 miles of driving!! - and when i said no, she refused to come back. these are just some of the examples, it's been so numerous over the years.she's living in an assisted living now and there's one aide she doesn't like.  the aide is gruff but she does her job.  she's just not coddling - she's a very to the point, blunt person. last night, at around 10pm my time, while i was out grocery shopping (super long day it was the only time i could get around to shopping) she called me multiple times frantic - screaming and crying into the phone yelling, ""i'm going to kill myself!! i can't take this any more!! she always does this to me, i'm sick of it!!"" i rush through the rest of the shopping, (forgot a bunch of things in my rush, left my coupon book in the shopping cart by accident and now that's gone) and call her back.  i ask her what happened and she says, ""she doesn't take care of me, she takes care of everyone else but me."" i asked for specifics of what happened, she said that the aide fed the other people first and didn't serve her what she liked to eat.  then, when she drank her whole glass of water, the aide didn't tell her she did a good job drinking her whole glass of water.  this aide isn't the type to do that sort of thing - she won't get special attention or be congratulated by this aide - but when i told my gm that, she insisted that she's not being taken care of there. she then started screaming that she wanted to move back to where i am.  i literally just went through this 7 months ago where she agreed to 100% move to me. i made her promise that she would actually come this time.  she assured me she would.  i spent thousands of dollars on an attorney and a deposit and plane tickets and in the last week, she refused to go.  i will not do that any more.  that was the last straw for me.  i have spent too much money on her whims.  it's not fair to my family to use our limited resources like that.then she went on a tirade about how all her companions have left her (i hired companions to take her out and be my eyes/ears out there and they quit frequently because she's mean to them) and how another resident hit her 3 times (he didn't hit her, he told her to leave him alone and when she wouldn't, he walked past her and his shoulder hit hers because she wouldn't move), and how another resident screams all night long (one resident screamed one night because she fell and the emts were trying to get her out to the ambulance) , etc.  she tells others these lies too and then they call me up, asking me why i haven't move her to me or why i leave her in such a deplorable home.  i don't have unlimited funds/resources/time to devote to her care. i have a young family, i watch/care for my other grandmother with advanced alzheimer's one day a week, and i have a full time job too. i don't understand why people just believe her!  i am at her beck and call.  i fly out to her multiple times a year.  next month will be my 5th trip out to her this year.  i ordered new furniture for her to be delivered while i'm out there, and she told me to return it all, she doesn't want it and don't bother coming out.  never mind all the time and money i spent on arranging all this because eff me and my life.  i can't go through the whole moving thing again.  what do i do?  how do i handle this? thank you for reading and for giving me space to vent."," i'm going to say the shitty things that need to be said. your grandmother as you knew her is gone.  the person she is now is angry, bitter, lashes out, enjoys making other people dance to her tune.  this will not change... it will get worse.  she is now someone who will take, and take, and take, and take as much of you as she can.  she wants other people to fill the void within her because she, herself, is going away. that's incredibly sad, but it's not going to change.  no matter how much of yourself, your money, your time, your family you pour into her. get a new, cheap flip-phone.  contact the assisted living home and give them your new phone number, only in case of emergencies.  do this for the rest of your contacts, too, such as partner's work, schools, etc.  now carry both phones... but turn off the phone gm calls at night.  and when you're on vacation.  and when you need a break.  just turn it off.  if it's an emergency, they'll ring the other phone.  if she needs to make someone crazy, she can talk to the professionals who are paid to do that, not harass you because she needs to feel powerful. you cannot continue giving pieces of yourself away, you will be empty and broken.  if your very best friend/sister/twin knew you completely, when would she have you turn off that phone?

"hello! i am a 19 year old male. my grandmother has been in her late-stages of dementia (vascular) for the last 2-3 years and has been living with me and my mother for the last 8 years since her diagnosis. i admire my mother so much for taking full-time care of my grandmother for this long but it has been way too much lately. :-( my mom has always been so focused on taking care of my grandmother that she never really took much care of her children. i know its an awful disease and i can't imagine being in my moms position but she is so very attached to my grandmother. i don't know how to tell her enough is enough. i am so depressed and it pains me to see her cry and have such a hard time with my grandma. my mother told me that she wanted to end her own life because it's too much for her. it makes me mad because nobody in our family wants to take care of my grandmother so my mother feels guilty not to take her in. my mom doesn't have a life outside of taking care of my grandma and she's told me that multiple times. all i want for her to have is a life again because who knows how long this will last. :( maybe 1 year? 3 years? could be 5 years who knows!&amp;#x200b;i feel so alone not being able to relate to anyone about this. it's a huge part of my life and i've been having trouble coping with it. me and my mother are constantly abused by my grandmother. she is not the same person i knew before. she screams and yells all the time and has outrages every minute or so. we are woken up every morning by her screaming. she is very aggressive and slaps, punches and pushes everybody including one instance with my baby cousin when my grandmother attempted to strangle the baby. she has been kicked out of every home in our city because of her aggression. she cannot put together sentences or understand things so she is always very confused and angry. it is all very upsetting for everybody in our family. my grandfather is over everyday which is great but he doesn't leave us alone because he is guilty for making my mom take care of his wife. he is horribly depressed too and cries almost every time he visits. on top of it all we are always walking on egg shells because she has seizures/strokes every couple of months and it is very scary.&amp;#x200b;i just want help or some sort of advice for the situation i'm in because it's hard watching everybody being so depressed and upset all the time. i just got a job and plan to move out soon but i still have no idea how to cope in the meantime. :(&amp;#x200b;thanks.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cs4bn4/need_help_coping_with_grandmother_who_has/,Need help coping with grandmother who has late-stage Vascular Dementia :(

"hi,i'd like to ask for advice in the following situation, what do you think is the best course of action?my grandmother (89) is suffering from dementia which is getting even worse since may. in the beginning she just didn't remember small things or couldn't learn anything new, but in may she suddenly changed. she used to live abroad for 40 years but moved back to my home country to be closer to her children, grandchildren. because she didn't have experience how things work now she willingly left her finances, insurance, pension, housing stuff to her children to deal with. she even signed documents to authorise access for them for all of the above.all was good until recently when she suddenly developed paranoia and started to blame my mother stealing her money. then came that somebody (she doesn't say it, but hints her children/my mum) is spying on her computer and her phone.the problem lies she doesn't understand how modern things work and now everything she doesn't recognize means it's against her. she doesn't listen to reasoning, she says all the time she is not stupid, etc. so no matter what anybody says she ignores it and becomes hysterical from time to time about small things.i used to help her with the computer and the phone but now she gets scared of every pop-up and questions the computer asks. when i try to help her, explain what it is, why it happened, she doesn't even listen and just repeats herself about being spied and how my mum is stealing her money.the situation got so bad the family started to ignore her calls, cause it lead nowhere and she always got hysterical in the phone (or even in person) about the same things crying and feeling betrayed. it drained everybody mentally to listen daily this. our thought was if we don't give her chance to speak about these things, she won't anger herself. later she stopped calling most of us. however my mum still visits her every couple off days to do the groceries, have a lunch together but if my grandma starts her blame-game she leaves immediately, won't argue. according to my mum, she is normal a week than next week is crazy again. grandma calls me sometime but i let it go to voicemail, because i know she doesn't have any serious problem on her computer and i just don't wan't listen to her complains for hours.but i know (and grandma mentioned it unintentionally), she feels very-very lonely now everybody tries to minimise the contact with her. she always loved her whole family with her full heart and still does (despite what she thinks we might do) but now she is confused and feels lost why everybody is acting as they do. she won't admit she has a mental problem, doesn't wan't to see a doctor, so we can't do anything about it. but it's painful for her (and for us as well) for her last years to feel like that.i had the idea to call her on weekends so she doesn't feel disconnected (from me, at least). but now she is angry at us that she just says all is good in an offended voice and hangs up.we accepted her condition and we know it only gets worse. we know she's never going to be that person she was like even a year ago. it just hurts everyone to turn our back to protect ourselves (and herself) from those breakouts.i turn to you to for advice. how can i (my family) mitigate her pains but somehow avoid her meltdowns? we don't want our grandma/mother to feel lonely in her remaining years (which can be still quite a few as she doesn't have any other physical problems).thanks for reading my lengthy problem."," does she live in a senior home facility?  if not, i think you should move her there.  there will be other people there which is good from her safety in case some health scare happens there will be someone there.  as well as she will have additional companionship and friends besides yourselves.  get guardianship and i think you can move her there even if she doesn't want to move.i was told if you can't convince them the first time, it's impossible to convince them later and even if you did, they'll forget and be unconvinced again.think that seems true.  distraction seems to work the best instead of arguing with them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/co1jr3/grandmother_with_dementia_and_paranoia_estranges/,Grandmother with dementia and paranoia estranges her family and feels lonely as a result.

"for no reason at all. my grandmother has had dementia for several years now but we’ve been lucky for the most part. it’s been shitty of course but in comparison to other accounts i have read or heard, i know it could be so much worse. in the last few weeks my grandmother has been telling my mom she’s depressed and sad. we’ve always had our off days or couple of days here and there. but in the last week, everything sets her off and makes her angry.  any simple thing you say to her will be responded to as though you have been whining about it incessantly and pestering her to the point of bursting. i have always been the one that said getting upset doesn’t help anything and to just try and be patient. silly little fool i was, that was before she was being downright mean and it’s like a switch has flipped. mom and i attended a caregiver support group yesterday because of how much this switch flip has gotten to us. there i learned that dementia can change on a dime. so this might just be the way it is now. i suppose i’ll get the hang of dealing with that, but god fucking damn it i’ve just been so hurt and angry at how she has been that i was the one to lash out just now and get her upset when it might have been fine otherwise. i’m so fucking angry at myself. i’m ashamed of the way i’m short tempered and miserable at home and then i go to work and chit chat and be charming with customers both nice and difficult, and i can’t maintain the same facade at home. my grandmother used to be my best friend. i constantly tell myself it’s a monster controlling her brain like some sci-fi movie. all medical science and logic and common sense obviously tells you it isn’t her acting that way and saying these things, and it isn’t what she wants but she can’t help it. but my monster visualization has not stopped me from letting my feelings get hurt and fighting back, which as we all know, there’s no point. it gets to all of us in the house so much. it would be in everybody in this household’s best interest if i could just be patient and be the one to brush everything off and be positive, even in the face of the most difficult challenges dementia may present us with. i could be the one to pull us all up by our bootstraps and diffuse things. people say that’s not realistic to be always patient and positive but to those people i want to say “you don’t know, it has to be done”. but i haven’t done it, and i’m feeling pretty selfish.  so now i’m just sitting here wallowing in self loathing, and all i could think of was to just write it out to whoever is listening here. just needing to vent. trolls, please leave me alone."," oh, my goodness.  please don't beat yourself up.  there isn't a human on earth that has dealt with this disease that hasn't lost it at one point.  dementia patients often seem to remember just enough to know what your sensitive spots are and tend to go for jugular.  (at least that's how my father was at one point.)the good news is that while my father was a complete nightmare  (to the point where i removed myself from the situation for a month), with medication and a bit of time, he settled down and is now a pretty happy guy for the most part.  it's an ever evolving disease, so when you hit a rough patch, just remember it's probably pretty temporary.  if she isn't on anti-anxiety or depression meds yet (or even if she is), i would certainly contact her physician and explain what's happening.  there may be something they can do to alleviate the outbursts and make her feel more at ease and thus less irritated.even though you know they are not of sound mind, the words and actions still hurt and accumulate over time.  at some point that pressure gauge is going to blow and it's okay to take some time and get away from it all if you are able to.  no guilt and no remorse.  the good news is, she probably doesn't remember any of it anyway!hang in there.  this is a pretty darned supportive site so come here and vent!  hugs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cna4e1/i_just_lashed_out/,I just lashed out.

"hello, i'm currently 32 years of age. military veteran of nine years. i had no idea 50 days ago, that my life would take this turn for the better and it is such a glorious friendship and yet tragic relationship in a few ways. i have no children and divorced in 2016. i am one semester away from finishing up at university, and currently 50 days totally sober. i once thought that was impossible. i grew up under a narcissistic alcoholic father, codependent mother, abusive older sister, and have 2 forms of ptsd at present that i deal with by staying sober now. before i came to aa i was utterly lost, and spiralling out of control. i cut total contact with my n father a year ago, and my healing has begun. it's well underway. i met nancy at aa. she came from a very troubled background, and yet, has been sober 38 years no slips, raised a great son, and has a phd in adult education. and a great cat named itchy. he loves me. she was extremely lonely, and had other unmet needs that early dementia brings along. she offered me to reside with her in the spare bedroom and i accepted. we attend daily aa meetings 7x a week. and i have since being sober discovered i am actually a great cook! she was eating peanuts and hot dogs before i came along nearly every day. i've literally cooked 8 different meal varients for her: pot roast w veggies n potato, linguini alfredo with blackened chicken, pot roast with rice over green curry sauce, blackened chicken alfredo, baked lasagna...etc. i also would have been totally homeless without her help. i've got multiple grants, scholarships, va pension, and the gi bill coming in soon to help us out, and to repair the damage i did while drinking. i drive lyft 4x a week and wont have to soon as i plan on getting a career after graduation. i also got her cat on a diet and he has slimmed up bc he's being fed 2x a day with 3 kinds of food, instead of 6 or 9 meals a day that she was doing before bc she forgot how many times he had been fed during the day! lol omg this cat was bursting when i first arrived!!! fat boy! she has helped me work through to step 4 so far, i'm just happy to be needed, and she is thrilled to have me here! she loves my war stories and tales from my 9 years overseas, and we have a nightly ""movie time."" so far we have watched all of band of brothers, the pacific, and enemy at the gates, restrepo, 24 hours the benghazi movie, and generation kill lol. i tell her all the bullshit fake hollywood parts, and we also watched lone survivor. i also got her going to the gym with me at planet fitness 3x a week roughly. and i've put my bowflex weights on the porch that her and i use regularly. i also got her drinking a lot less coffee, and much more water.  less sugary drinks too, more high protein and we often go out for poke toki or healthy full breakfasts at new beginnings. i have never had a friend ever or relative that i connected with more than nancy. we are kindred souls. anything else i could be doing here? i also write sticky notes for her regularly. thanks for reading.", amazing and beautiful. how did you come into each other’s lives?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/clh2pd/she_saved_my_life_i_protect_hers/,She saved my life.

"thanks in advance to anyone who will listen. i'm sorry this is kinda long.first off, our family suffered a decade ago when my dad died due to parkinsons, which my mom was an absolute soldier through. for reference, i live in canada and went down two summers in a row to help with dad, because he was such a great father and i really wanted to help mom. i don't mean to shuff off my dad; if anyone has questions about that time, i would be glad to answer. suffice to say we all still miss him greatly.now, mom has been diagnosed with dementia. this is not a surprise to us kids (4 of us).  we've had some vacations with her to california, appalachia and the south (where she was born/raised), and ireland (where my husband and i accompanied her) to relive our ancestry. she has loved these places but at the same time has both remembered them and forgotten them. like, when i talk with her now, she will greatly remember some of our ireland trip but back then could not find her way down a street or from a restroom/bar table to the bathroom and back--this is going back 3+ years. i talked with her this evening, and she could not remember her parents' death dates or circumstances. she does not remember my own dad's death's date. it's so weird talking with her because she remembers so many details about her past, but her short-term memory is shot. each time i talk with her i know i am in for repeated stories. i also know it is my responsibility to listen patiently to the same stories she has told me for months/years. yet, she always surprises me with these old stories--some we have a shared memory of, which i can collaborate. some of which are new to me, that make sense.my brother is living with her now and acting as power of attorney/medical.now, she has been diagnosed, which we knew would happen. i guess i'm just looking for some feedback from people who have similar experiences. i just love her so much and count every time i call and she knows i'm her daughter. what can i expect going forward? i think i know, but just want some feedback."," you can expect that short-term memories will fail first, followed by progressive past memories. my mom, widow with vascular dementia, forgot the name of our father, and, when i took her to see her sister, who also suffers from a different form of dementia, i told her to tell her sister that our cousin jim was in town to see my aunt, and she tried to tell her sister that her *husband*, jim (our father, her husband, was named fred), was in town to see her. it's tragic and heartbreaking, but such are the ravages of dementia. you are going to want to scream, but, instead, take it as something that you cannot prevent. at my mom's stage, i can still print out explanations (verbal communication hasn't been so successful since me having undergone oral surgery because of cancer), which does work in terms of making her understanding in that moment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/clezae/i_need_help_dealing_with_my_mom/,I need help dealing with my mom

(my mom forgot me at school and daycare more than a few times, and my grandma locked me in a hot car on accident when i was a baby and had to call 911 to get me out). i've also had 2 episodes of aphasia around age 28 and 30 (it could have been because of a history of migraines, or maybe it was a mini-stroke - my grandma had those as well). i didn't get it checked out, i was still in a bad marriage and overrun by toddlers and not doing self-care.  **and now i have this issue: i was married for 8yrs. we have 3 children. \*i\* divorced him. i no longer wanted to be with him. i have no romantic feelings at all for him. i don't miss him but we do co-parent well. plus, we are both remarried. i've been remarried for 2 years. yet i \*still\* accidentally call my new husband by my ex-husband's name. i have caught myself so many times doing this. he seems understanding and doesn't mind. but i feel extremely embarrassed and it also makes me think of my mom and grandma.**i know it could just be like how people call their kids by the wrong name (i do that too). but i can't help but picture myself in the memory care section of the nursing home, asking for my husband (or a photo of him if he's dead lol) and expecting to see my ex, having no idea who my actual husband is. **like it's ingrained in my brain's long-term memory that my ex is my husband.** i make jokes about it to my husband, but it actually kind of bothers me!! lol i say it's just my dementia coming out to play a little early. my grandma always owned her dementia and when she had trouble with word recall or forming a sentence, she always laughed it off and said, ""oh it's just my dementia"" with a big grin. &lt;3 **tl;dr anyone in here see it happen where grandma asks for an ex-husband because she doesn't remember her actual husband? lol**",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/clam87/im_afraid_ill_forget_my_actual_husband_and_expect/,I'm afraid I'll forget my actual husband and expect to see my ex-husband when I'm elderly - anyone see it happen?
"hello reddit,i'm back again. over the past few months, i have experienced a lot of new ups and downs related to my understanding of dementia et al. for backstory, i am 25, my grandmother is 65. she has undergone neuropsych testing to determine what is wrong, and we finally have the results. according to the doctors from the results/report and their observations, she has a ""cognitive disorder which is consistent with ftd (fronto-temporal dementia)"". the doctor then told us both that ""she is no longer capable of making her own decisions, living independently, or working ever again"". as you can all guess, she does not believe this to be the case. after this, the doctor got in touch with a social worker at the hospital to assist me with her case, but they haven't been much help.according to the case worker, i need poa or guardianship, so that i can then apply for medicaid and ssdi on her behalf. however, since she cannot make her own decisions, i have to go the attorney route to get said poa over her. additionally, i have noticed (as have other relatives) that the diagnosis seems to have made her a lot more agitated and her behavior is getting more erratic. furthermore, she is hallucinating more often, and her paranoia is at an all-time high. she is going to be getting enrolled in a ""chronic care management program"", but that appointment is still weeks away. she does not believe she needs placement, but i, and the nurses believe it is the best course of action. she has told me that ""she's not going to go to a home"", even though she fails to realize she has no choice. this brings me to my question: how do i deal with the behavior shifts, paranoia, agitation et al, while still trying to manage and take care of everything else? (i feel like i have no support system, since the social worker seems to just be giving me steps to take rather than help me like the doctor said they would). in essence, i feel like i'm fucking drowning, and i don't have a life vest on. i just want out, i want this all over with.. help?"," this sounds exactly like my situation a few years ago with my grandfather. he was early 70s when his ftd started to set in and within a few years, he had lost his mind completely. -- i know it is hard, but relocation to a home is neccessary. at some point the behavior will become so erratic and the daily demands of caring for an individual with ftd (bathing, feeding, everything) become far to great for any one person to handle. i certainly know that feeling of drowning that comes with this long and painful process, but in retrospect, i wish i would have been quicker to reach out to professionals faster (like assisted living/memory care institutions, more doctors, more support groups, etc). i went into dealing with a family member with ftd without knowing what my resources were, and i still feel unclear at times. i feel i am still learning how to deal with this situation as well, my only advice here is reach out to relatives (this is where i found my greatest support). it was so overwhelminh at the beggining - trying to process all of the paperwork and also emotional work got the best of me.i wish i had more tangible advice to provide. but, if you ever need to rant or talk a situation over, please dm or anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cl4k1j/ftd_and_potential_pitfalls/,FTD and potential pitfalls

"didn't really know where else to go so i thought i would try here. my grandparents both have different types of dementia: my grandad has alzheimer's, and my granny's is undiagnosed but affects cognition, behaviour, and processing. we've known about grandad for a good while, an in a way he's not difficult to deal with as what's wrong is fairly straightforward (no short-term memory) and he's still his affable friendly self, if often confused and more quiet. my granny however, has shown a big change in personality that i'm really struggling with. she has become really neglectful in looking after herself, my grandad (who obviously needs so much more now), and her environment, behaves inappropriately in various situations (laughs at unfunny things, acts very emotional at simple actions like buying her shopping, sometimes says rude things out loud to/about people that she never would have done) and has visible trouble using the right language. she was always such a smart, together, sensible and organised lady that seeing this is just so difficult for me, i honestly don't like it. my mum moved them down to a flat near us as they used to live far away, and that continues to be stressful, specifically for her, as the challenge is greater than we anticipated and they probably can't really live independently. i'm worried about my mum, but also feeling a lot of guilt as she's noticed my behaviour around them too. i feel awful, but my face has betrayed my, in mum's words 'disgust' at how my granny is now, and i haven't really spent any time with them in the few months since they've moved down as i just don't know what i'd do and i know it would be a difficult experience. i've told my mum that i'm sorry but i find it hard, and she quite rightly says that we all do. she (and the rest of my immediate family) do all come from caring professions though, which i don't. i want to be more involved and do more, but every time i'm faced with seeing them (especially my granny) i just kind of shut down, and wait for it to be over. i'm one of those people who finds it very hard to conceal emotions or act in a way that's not how i'm feeling, but i'm desperate for the tools on how to do this as i know it's hurting my family. if anyone has any experience or advice on how i can do this, i would really appreciate it. please be kind. thank you.", .,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ckgc6r/grandparents_with_dementiaadvice_please/,Grandparents with dementia-advice please

"my dad is 70 and has been retired since 2015.  we live in different states over 1000 miles away.  around the time of his retirement, my mom noticed him having some mild memory problems but she didn't seem to be alarmed by it.  after retiring, my dad's memory began declining very rapidly.  in the beginning of their retirement, i remember calling my dad a few times and him commenting about how he suddenly realized how little he could remember about the past and what he did during his decades long career as an engineer.  i also didn't think too much at that point and just thought it was a slow but inevitable decline in mental capability that every old person suffers from.i remember visiting him in late 2017 and he was having trouble driving at night when picking me up from the airport and i had to step up and drive the car back home.  he kept insisting that there's nothing wrong with him although he did admit at the time that he could not remember any of the skills or knowledge that he needed when he was still working a couple of years ago (he's an automotive engineer with a phd.)  i also didn't feel too alarmed at this point although in retrospect, i probably should have.a few months later, after a few visits with relatives and old friends, they told us that he desperately needs to seek professional help.  and so he did.  and thanks to the ridiculously long wait times in seeing a doctor here in the us, he was finally able to see his family doctor earlier this year and a neurologist in april.i wasn't with him when he saw the neurologist but i was only informed of how it went through my mother who speaks and understands english very poorly.  but she told me that the doctors felt his condition wasn't very good.  for example, one of the tests that the doc had done was having him name as many types of animals as he could.  he sat there for a minute and could only name like two (like cats and cows and nothing else.)  they also had recited him a short shopping list (milk, eggs, butter, flour, etc.) with like 5-6 items and he could only recite back like 2 of them correctly.**at that time, the doctor recommended that my dad go in for a mri to see what's wrong with his brain, but my dad insists that he wait until october 15 because that's when he gets medicare part d and will get the mri virtually free.**  i suggested to him that maybe he needs to go in some time earlier since his dementia has gotten a lot worse but he insists on waiting until october 15.  and my mom just meekly obliges with it without question.i just came back from visiting them for a week and i'm really outraged at this situation.  while my dad's current dementia is a lot worse than what i had expected considering he was alright just a few years ago, he's still got just enough mental function to refuse to seek any treatment until october.  he's not choosing to refuse treatment because he thinks he's fine but he wants to save a few thousand dollars..  all while his condition is rapidly deteriorating while we speak.i'm also very concerned right now about their living conditions since my mom is recovering from cancer and she has to take care of all of his daily needs.  my mom also doesn't speak that much english and can't drive and here's the kicker: she still has to rely on him for driving.i really want to step in and help them but for some reason, no matter what i tell them, they don't want to listen.  i guess it's more of a cultural thing since they're immigrants from china and it's ingrained in our culture that the children should always listen to the parents and not the other way around.what's the best way to get the help that my dad really needs right now?  i suppose adult protective services is an option but i don't know how to frame it correctly to them without painting my mom as an abuser."," you need to get there somehow and make sure their legal paperwork is in order as far as power of attorney and so on, especially given that your mother isn't able to handle their affairs. a responsible adult may have to step in and apply for guardianship. we had to do this with my mother who resisted getting help until it was too late and she was no longer competent to sign a poa, so we had to go to court to take over her affairs.your dad can't be driving any more. he's a danger to himself and others. can they start taking uber?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/chi4xk/my_dad_has_dementia_and_is_refusing_to_seek_help/,My dad has dementia and is refusing to seek help because he says it's too expensive.

"my mom is 71.  we have noticed memory issues now for just over a year.  confusion and difficulty finding her way around as well.  we delicately brought our concerns to her on multiple occasions but she has not agreed to an assessment and has also not acknowledged the lapses.  in the last 6 months she has been hospitalized twice for low sodium and had two seizures as a result.  her memory worsened greatly in the weeks following the seizures but then returned to her current baseline (more or less).  her doctors believe she is drinking too much water and not eating enough food (which has been remedied for the most part).the hospital visits and follow up appts with her doctor allowed us to speak to her primary care doc about our concerns regarding her memory.  at the last appointment one month ago, her doctor told her in no uncertain terms that he is concerned about her cognition and that she absolutely must get a neuropsych assessment.  my brother was with her, taking notes.  he emailed the notes to her afterward.  she was game to do it, and was all set to make the appointment with the care coordinator who was to call her and schedule it in the coming days.  unfortunately, my mom never followed through and now believes that it is unnecessary.  she doesn't recall the conversation with her doctor and has convinced herself that she is moving beyond her seizures and that her health is completely fine. last week i contacted the doctor's office to explain what happened and asked if her doc could send my mom a letter outlining how important this assessment is.  i do not know if she received it.  i am not exactly able to address the memory concerns with my mom.  i've broached the subject about 5 times with her and each time she becomes very upset and tells me to stay out of her personal business.  my mom and dad have owned a business together for 35 years, and i work there.  i will take over the business when they retire. i do all the work outside of the home, but she handles all the accounting from her home office, as she has for 35 years.  i am deeply concerned about this.  she and my dad also watch my 3 year old son when i am working out of my home 2 days a week.  she is still able to watch my son alone, though i do prefer when my dad is there as well.  she does still drive with my son in the car to pick him up/drop him off on those days.  my dad knows of my concerns.i have never successfully broached any of these concerns with my mom.  she has told me she has no reason to live outside of the business.  my son is her only grandchild and she treasures her time with him.  taking away her babysitting time would break her.  she is wonderful with my son.  i don't want to take that away at all, though i do have anxiety about when her condition worsens, and how to identify when it is no longer safe.  when i say ""we"", it's my two siblings and my dad. we all agree that we are likely dealing with dementia.i feel stuck.  my life is so intertwined with my mom's...work, childcare, and family.  she is my boss and my babysitter.  i respect her and admire her.  she is living her life off of post it notes and getting by, but for how long.  i don't know where to turn next on this journey."," not to sound harsh - but why are you putting her needs over your sons?  she doesn't / shouldn't be in sole care of him at any time.  and it is crazy you let him drive with her.  if you are upset enough to write this - then it is just plain crazy that you leave a helpless child in her care.  you need to have a sit down, hard conversation with dad.  you don't wait until she harms herself or others - especially driving and getting lost - then confusion sets in and poor decisions are made... while driving.&#x200b;side note - if she is drinking too much - you might want to encourage her to eat more potassium.  it was a problem for my dad when he was drinking a lot of water and flushing it all out.  eggs and bananas became a morning ritual.  plus other changes, but those were quick and easy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/chdjap/early_stages_no_diagnosis_need_help_navigating/,Early stages.

"title says it all. my (19f) 60 years old mother, suffering from early dementia just peed in the living room.i cannot take this anymore. it’s getting to hard.how tf do you guys handle such things"," thank you for reaching out. i’m glad it helped in some way. i’m also glad you can make jokes about it, even though i know it doesn’t make you feel any less choked up.regarding the disease “stealing” the person. at least in my experience, my dad was very different sick, but still absolutely himself. she’s in there, she’s just so confused. she doesn’t know where she is most of the time or even totally who she’s dealing with. whatever you say, saying it with a negative mood with communicate a hostile environment. and i was trash at this, when he was really having a day, creating the warm, safe atmosphere was very hard for me. people have probably told you to “redirect” or lie to reassure because the paranoia is so bad with this disease making the person feel safe is way more important than trying to adjust their reality. it will feel weird to be loving. my dad wasn’t a particularly affectionate man healthy, we did have a strong bond and seen a bit closer than maybe you and your mom are, but “i love you” was not usually exchanged. we didn’t hold hands when i was a kid. by the time he was in hospice, i would have him lean in to me and i’d pet his head. it will feel weird, but you have to try giving love. there will be days this quells the paranoia for a bit. there will be days she’s tired or ate something weird and it doesn’t work. some days you’ll start with good intentions and totally fuck up, but that happens. she’s not stolen though, she’s just lost.did my dad know how to work the remote? no. did his vision get so shot he’d bump into glass doors? sure. did he spill an entire plate of food on him in public from time to time? absolutely. but i had to start laughing with him. it’s okay, this stuff happens. everyone sucks when this is happening because the disease doesn’t abide by social rules. it’s socially isolating so if you have to be in this with her, be in it with her, make light of it for her, too. when it comes down to it, most of the infuriating stuff that happens can be fixed by some all purpose cleaner and a broom.for your health, beyond talking to someone, i recommend letting out your feelings physically. the stress is super physical. i exercised a lot, i listened to loud music and sang along, i would find a solitary spot to literally thrash around in a fit of energy. let it out with yourself. you can’t blame anyone, but that rage still needs to be expelled. and feel around your friends. will your friend who lost her parent at 14 know this feeling? no. but she’s way more comfortable with talking about loss and death and grief than other people your age. so know you can’t really compare, but you can find the same feelings in different parts of your experience.does you mom like music? i found that buffered things a bit with my dad. anyway, you are strong and you have shouldered so much. i’m with you and i’m proud of you for getting through this so far.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ch6jun/my_mother_just_peed_in_the_living_room/,My mother just peed in the living room
my mother who is 60 years old is having memory loss and cognitive decline for the past 3 years. we’ve all been blind to it and it took us this long to get her to seek professional help. i feel like complete shit for waiting this long. my father took her to see a neurologist and he did an mri and came back clear no issues. she had low vitamin d and a low thyroid problem. she takes medication for this everyday and as of her last blood test everything is leveled out. the doctor prescribed her zoloft since she was having anxiety attacks and felt depressed. my mom is home throughout the day alone in a small apartment while my father works. it’s been like this the past 3 years. she never got her license and always depended on my father. now she’s forgetful and can’t do things she used to be able to do. today we went to a neuropsychiatrist and he did a 2 hour exam on her. at the end he told me he would call me back after he analyzes the test. what can i expect of this? what questions should i ask when he calls me with the results?," gerontologist here. don’t just take the words from one doctor. consult multiple. also, don’t just take the diagnosis of “dementia”. dementia is a umbrella of multiple diseases and each have their own path, medications and best practices. probe as much as you need to in order to get the right diagnosis so she isn’t given the wrong treatment. check her water intake as well. a lot of symptoms can be attributed to a uti or lack of hydration. good luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/cgxzfy/waiting_on_a_call_with_the_diagnosis/,Waiting on a call with the diagnosis

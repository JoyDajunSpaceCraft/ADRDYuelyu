so we are roughly half way through our fith year with my dads dementia. two weeks ago he had kidney failure and now has a catheter. hospice has been initiated. it’s been a really rough ride. it’s bizarre knowing tis light be the last year  the worst part is i’m not sure mom and i will be able to stay in our house because dad and i are coborrowes. i’ve gone from taking this disease day by day to hour by hour. hang in there guys. dementia really is a marathon and not a sprint in some cases. but you are stronger than you think.," my deepest condolences. my grandmother's disease ran a few months short of 4 years. 4 frustrating, sad, funny, weird years. i love her to bits and i miss her everyday. when she was put into hospice, it was so...weird because in the back of my mind, i knew what that meant and it felt like she took a downturn quickly but she had avoided so many of the end stage symptoms until literally the end (i.e. being unable to swallow, being completely bed bound). hang in there op. be by your dad's side and be there for your mom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gw5m8r/five_years/,Five years

"hi folks,i'm writing this on behalf of our family friends, whose father is suffering from dementia. our friends are at their wit's end , need a solution and would appreciate any suggestions that you might have.in the past two years they have done everything humanly possible to care for him. this includes multiple mental hospitals, memory care stays, home-nursing, and even bringing him back home after negligence where he was staying. the truth is that it's gotten much worse. the patient, a father in his mid 60s, has become suicidal, violent, and impossible to live with. he was never any of these things prior to the illness.his history of suicide attempts makes it difficult for admission into most memory care places. are psych wards still around? does a hospice make sense? are there any international options?&amp;#x200b;thank you."," you could have them check out a local geriatric psych unit, i’m based in new hampshire and there’s one at my local hospital, my dad was there for 2-3 weeks while they helped regulate his meds, some patients are there permanently, it just depends on whether or not their insurance approves the need to be there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gvx4er/longterm_options_for_father_with_dementia/,Long-Term Options for Father with Dementia?

"wasn't sure how to title this. basically, my (27f) mom (73f) was diagnosed with ftd a year ago and lately has been progressing quite quickly. we suspect she has had it for many years, we just didn't know what it was. we speak english in our household, but korean is her native language and she lived in korea for the first half of her life. when she was healthy, she spoke english fluently but still had a slight accent and struggled with a few words. now however, she struggles with english immensely, and is far from fluent. i know some korean, so we've been getting by, but a lot of the time she speaks only in korean and none of us know what she is saying. we can sometimes pick out some words or use a dictionary but that doesn't always help, especially if the word she is using in korean isn't actually what she means to refer to. now to the actual problem. of course this is sad and frustrating for all of us. however, i've been doing my best to calmly tell her i don't understand if i really can't figure out what she is trying to say. sometimes if i ask her what she means in english, she'll be able to say one or two words in english but not always. my dad on the other hand is really not handling this well. i understand it's difficult for him to come to terms with what is happening to her, but he has always been a difficult person who gets frustrated and shows it with his words in a way that is hurtful to others even if he doesn't mean it. this morning, i heard from the other room that he was yelling at her: ""speak english!!!"" obviously she can't just do that. with other things he has said to her, it seems like either he is in denial or he thinks she has more control than she has. it doesn't seem to me that these are things he is accidentally just saying, but i could be wrong. other things he often says include : ""i just told you that!""""we've been over this a million times!!""""stop asking so many questions!""""why did you stop doing this everyday?""""you just did that this morning, you don't remember?""i think this is so awful and i don't know how to talk to him about it because every time i've brought it up, he just deflects blame onto me and gaslights me. has anyone else dealt with this in their family? i don't know what to do but it hurts me so much to hear him speak this way to her when it's not her fault!! he's acting like she's an annoyance."," first of all, i'm sorry that you are going through this.i (m61) can relate to your father. my wife (f65) has ftd and i get really frustrated at times dealing with her. my wife is very stubborn and continually does things that i specifically tell her not to do. she lies to me (i think intentionally, at times), but i also know that many of her behaviors are things she can't help.trust me on this: it can be difficult to be with someone for 40 years and treat them as an intellectual equal, and then find yourself having to deal with that person behaving as someone acting more like a 6 year old child. it's not easy to transition your thinking and reactions (even when you know why she's behaving the way she is). add to that the frustration of having to deal with that all the time and knowing how it will end. knowing that your mate that you've loved for years is now nearly gone and you'll never have that relationship back.try to be understanding of your father.now, one of the best ways to help your father is to try to allow him some time to himself. if he's like me, he needs a break from your mother to allow himself time to not be the caregiver. also, try to talk to him and understand how he feels. ask him what he's going through. ask him what kinds of things you can do to help him in the situation. tell him that your mother will never be able to understand things the way she used to. he knows that, but he needs to hear it. tell him that some of those things he says are hurtful. he needs to hear it from an objective observer.be kind when you talk to him. let him know that you understand his frustration. if you can't be there every day, call him every few days and talk to him. be supportive in whatever way you can.again, i'm sorry you're dealing with this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gu04k3/how_to_tell_someone_what_they_are_saying_is/,How to tell someone what they are saying is harmful to someone with dementia?

my 81 year old mom spent 83 days in hospice. her specific diagnosis was parkinson’s plus syndrome where the plus part is dementia. the hospice folks told us that dementia is basically the brain slowly dying piece by piece. mom had basically forgotten how to toilet herself and was having many near miss falls. within a few weeks of hospice her walking went completely and a hospital bed was ordered. we retained all of her meds except the memory meds for the first few weeks. she really wasn’t taking much medication.  she became very agitated and different meds were tried til we settled in ativan. her kidneys began to shut down and we were told that can be painful so pain meds began. she also started choking on even tiny amounts of apple sauce so food was discontinued. she had only a brief few moments of consciousness for last few weeks. she seemed to pass peacefully in the night and did not suffer. i was by her side. some things i want to share are most dementia end stage sites say dementia itself doesn’t cause death but rather choking or aspiration pneumonia or a fall or an infection is the ultimate cause of death. for my mom though it seems her brain failed her almost all at once- well over the course of about 90 days. i know dementia patients can last quite awhile in hospice. i’m grateful my mom did not seem to be in pain. i hope this helps other folks suffering from end stages. i would say my mom was in the end stages for about 45 to 60 days before hospice so all total about five months of incontinence and severe confusion. i lived my mom soo much!, my condolences.   my dad is 82 and was diagnosed last summer with  early onset dementia. we are at the point where he has to move in with our family or go to assisted living. i can see how this disease is slowly taking its toll on him.  best wishes for you!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gt6q3m/mom_is_resting_in_piece/,Mom is resting in piece

"well to start, i’m 33 years old which i’m sure makes this post sound ridiculous and patronizing, but please hear me out. my memory has been significantly impaired for the past two years and seems to be declining as fine goes on. i do suffer from depression and anxiety and i’ve been diagnosed since 2014 and have been taking medication. my short term memory is shot. sometimes, i can’t remember recent events and even conversations, and i’ll repeat something i’ve already said many times. i’m having severe speech problems and an especially difficult time remembering and articulating familiar words. i find myself combining words unintentionally and making up words that don’t exist. most days, i’m afraid to have a conversation because i fear that i won’t  remember basic words or names of things and that. my wife thinks that i am too young and that perhaps going on a keto diet might help, but i feel in my gut that it’s more than that. today, i was trying to articulate something to my wife in the store and i thought i had done a good job, and she said “that makes no sense” - which is something that’s happened more frequently in the past 2 years and hadn’t happened before. there are times when i walk into a room and forget why i’m there. i just started crying in the middle of the grocery store because i couldn’t “find” the words in my brain. i have a lot of brain fog and it feels like my mind is constantly racing to find words. i mentioned it to my psychiatrist and they dismissed it as being a symptom of depression, but i’ve been medicated the entire time and it hasn’t improved, it’s gotten worse. my hair has also started falling out in clumps every time i comb it. i’m genuinely concerned about this and am not sure what steps to take. i have a 13 year old daughter who is still very young and it’s impacting her."," this could be a host of things that you should seek professional guidance for. i would strongly advise speaking to your doctor to see if this perhaps related to your medications which often, this can be the case for psychotropic medications (if you’re on any) which can often impact cognitive functions. otherwise they can refer you for further assessment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gq0o1m/i_think_im_showing_early_signs_of_dementia_and_im/,I think I’m showing early signs of dementia and I’m scared....

"the neurologist won’t call it dementia. she scores a 22 of 30, knows how to turn it on for the doctors, so they say she has mci (has infarcts on her brain) and severe anxiety. her anxiety is so insanely bad that she’s in a permanent state of panic. when she takes meds to help with that, her mci gets much more severe. we’ve tried zyprexa (bad side effects and she wasn’t hallucinating so bad choice), zoloft, busiprone, lorazapam, and something else i’m forgetting. the lorazapam with busiprone worked to help a tiny bit but no longer works. clozepam and maybe cymbalta have been suggested as a next attempt. anyone any experience with this?  she literally is scared and thinks she can’t breathe all of the time .  she only will take my sister’s help and refuses to move (my sister does have poa) . we have a helper 20hours a week and her boyfriend weekends but she still calls my sister 40 times a day even if they are there. it’s insane.", i would try to get a referral to a geriatric psychiatrist if that’s available to you. they are specialized in identifying cognitive factors vs psychiatric concerns and may be very helpful in this case. it sounds like your mom is going through a really hard time! sorry you’re going through this. you and your sister seem like gems.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gpn66q/dementia_or_anxiety/,Dementia or Anxiety

"this something anyone else experienced?  my grandmother is still in an early stage.  she can still still hold a conversation, knows what's going on, etc.  she's basically just at a point where she forgets small details, repeats stories, things like that nature.  sometimes you tell her something once and she remembers, other times you have to tell her three or four days in a row before she remembers.  what she started about a month ago though, and now does rather consistently, is interpreting people mid sentence and talking over them.  the thing is, she *knows* that person was talking, she isn't unaware of it, but she gets mad an acts as if they *interrupted her*.  now, if she does it to me, i just stop talking and let her talk.  my grandfather is hard of hearing though.  so a lot of times he doesn't even realize she's interrupted him and will keep talking, then she'll turn to him and snap, ""are you going to let me finish talking?"" as if he was the one talking over her.  she's not blurting out randomness either, it usually is something that actually is relevant.  sometimes relevant to the current conversation, or something that would make sense to say to the person she's speaking with before they leave.  anyone else have a family member who did this?  i'm starting to wonder if maybe she knows she has to either think hard, or practice in her head what she wants to say, and knows she needs to get it out right away.  instead of wanting to admit that, she just gets angry/frustrated and tries to flip that script and pretend she was the one being interrupted."," my father started interrupting conversations before he was diagnosed with lewy body dementia. in retrospect, that should have been one of a couple of clues he was getting sick. prior, my father had always been quiet, very concerned with manners, and not hurting other’s feelings.one thing i learned in a support group for alzheimer’s and dementia was not to argue with the person experiencing the decline that accompanies dementia. i would let my father interrupt and finish, and then try to gently steer the conversation back to what everybody was discussing. sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t.what you are going through is very difficult. alz.org has some good resources to help caregivers, family, and friends. something that helped was when someone told me i had to start living in his reality and not expect him to live in mine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gpfjg1/constantly_interrupting_conversationsspeaking/,Constantly Interrupting Conversations/Speaking Over People?

shot to keep this ball rolling to get a diagnosis and get some help. what do i tell the doctor? what will be super important for him to know? what will be kind of helpful? what's not helpful at all?dad can come off as a normal, sweet but quirky old guy. but there's a lot going on at home.i'm trying my hardest to keep him independent and healthy but i've got to get at least a home healthy aid in there to keep him on track. now the long partabout 16 years ago, i noticed the first change in my father. he started telling folks he was raised in a rural town on the outskirts of our metro area where his grandparents lived. he was actually raised in the worst neighborhood in the inner-city area of our metro. he started speaking with a southern drawl for a while. he would pronounce dinosaur as di-nuh-sour and try to teach that to my toddler son. from that point until now i've noticed a marked decline in language skills. he forgets nouns and objects are described by their function.about ten years ago, when my mom/his wife was sick she had a commode at the house. he referred to it as her ""potty chair"". several of us attempted to correct him by over-pronouncing commode to him hoping he'd get the hint. she passed after being ill for four months. during the funeral planning, he told the funeral directory he wanted a second autopsy done because my mom was in perfect health when she went into the hospital and he didn't agree with the first autopsy's findings. in the next few minutes, the funeral home is calling medical examiners from across the state. he's puzzled. i asked everyone to step out for a few moments. he doesn't realize that his words indicated he believed by mother was killed by the hospital and he's threatening legal action. for the record, my mother was obese, probably morbidly; had what she thought was the flu for nearly a week and hadn't drunk any fluids for 3 days. at that point she was transported to the er, her heart beat irregular, dehydrated and found to have a bowel obstruction and required emergency surgery. she's lucky she made it to the er let alone survive the surgery.the hoarding started shortly after mom passed away. three bedroom house with narrow walk ways cutting through all the stuff. it was about this time the humming started. he would hum while watching tv, sitting at the dinner table, wherever. he once hummed very loudly at my daughter's dance recital. i told him to stop and he denied he was doing it. people three, four, five rows ahead of us were turning around and glaring at him.he fell in with a window washer who is a sovereign citizen. this character is a part of the republic for the united states. the believe the current us government is a corporation and they are the true and faithful government. for several years, dad would have a tuesday night conference call with all the other self-appointed representatives and senators and discuss how they would take control of the federal government's assets once society collapsed. this window washer acted as an agent to purchase us$300 worth of iraqi dinar. this dinar would be worth us$300 million when the dinar were turned in during a special redemption time frame. of course, the dinar were turned in but no us currency was returned.one fall i mentioned i had prepped my portable kerosene heater for winter in the event of a power outage. during a call a few days later, he mentioned he brought his heater inside to prepare it for winter. he started it in the family room and had flames shooting up to the ceiling. at that point, i realized i had to watch everything i said and start thinking ahead of him.five or six years ago, he started dealing with incontinence. he fashioned cloth diapers for himself using material my mom used in crafts and sewing projects. he'd fold these in 42 layers of cloth. he was very proud of this number for some reason. it looked like a football stuffed in the front of his pants. it took me three years to get him to switch to depends. then he switched to cloth baby diapers when he found those in the back of a closet at home. he used those until a year ago when his personal physician came to his apartment and forced him to toss those out. he'd been drying them in the bathroom without washing them. the smell was overwhelming and management at his retirement center approached me. he started using depends again and drying out partially used depends on the bathroom floor. the overwhelming smell was back immediately and again generated a phone call from management.three years ago, he placed a corn bag in the microwave to warm it. they are common in my area and are used to warm a bed during cold winter nights or as a heating pad for pain relief. one night he got it hot enough to start a fire. he burnt a hole through the fleece sweater he was wearing and a hole through the blanket he'd covered himself with. he suffered a second degree burn on his left pectoral region.about two years ago, he suffered a tia in the early morning hours. my younger brother who lived with him at the time found dad's glasses in a dinner plate sized spot of blood on the floor, found my dad bleeding from his lip, tried to had dad his glasses 3 times, set them on the bathroom counter and left to get breakfast. at 2pm that day my family and i arrived to find him with dried blood on his face and took him to the er because his behavior was very odd. mri and other tests performed. doctors said he'd had a tia. because he wasn't safe at home anymore i put my foot down and moved him to the town i now live in.since arriving here, he's started hoarding clothes from the senior center clothing giveaway. he started collecting stuffed animals there as well and giving them to his special friend june. june's family requested this end because they were concerned about mites, lice and other bugs on the donations. management at his retirement center asked me to speak with him. he stopped giving her stuffed animals and instead gave her dresses and sweaters. june's family collected two 30 gallon garbage bags full of sweaters and dresses and gave them to management. this time the manager and i sat down with dad and he agreed to stop. immediately following that meeting he told me, ""now i'm not saying you and your wife have to do this but the clothing giveaway has a lot of bras and panties and mens' underwear you could get for free."" i cannot think of anything more repulsive than wearing someone else's used underwear.he frequently asks me what i know about a letter he received in the mail. i ask what the letter was about, who it was from, etc. i get unspecific details such as from that one place or that group or i think it was those people i talked to the other day. when he receives an explanation of benefits from the insurance company, he'll ask why he's getting a bill. when i explain it's not a bill, he argues with me.if you've read this far, thank you. thank you..."," too lazy to read it all, but it will come out in the testing. he will be assessed by a separate neuropsychologist, then you’ll go back to the neurologist. at least that’s what happened with my mom. i worried they wouldn’t see

"due to the pandemic i (24f) became unemployed and my dad asked if i would be willing to move into a new house with my grandma to look after her. i agreed because i had no legitimate reason not to, even though i am not close to her, and thought that i was a patient and caring enough person to deal with it for a while before we can find a care home (after they are not covid wastelands). it’s so far been manageable with the main problems being her moving things to random places, trying to wander, and being stubborn if i have any level of disagreement (could even be about the weather outside - she will say it’s a bad day, i’ll say i think it’s pretty sunny and might get better). she has a slight attitude problem too switching from being bitchy to being upset and expresses how she should just kill herself.anyway the latest incident was that i found the bathroom sink blocked with shit. she goes to the bathroom by herself and there hasn’t been any noticeable issues until now. my guess is that possibly she had an accident in her underwear and then washed it in the sink? otherwise i don’t want to comprehend what else could have happened. does anyone have any advice for this? would it be ethical/ worth trying to hide a camera in there to see what her morning routine is (as she claims she showers but i’m not convinced as the shower floor usually isn’t wet, but then when i run a bath and say ‘oh would you like a bath it’s already run’ she will refuse saying she already had one that morning). my dad is wary of putting her into a home (which i think she definitely needs and i am not capable to handle this if it gets worse), because he is worried about the societal blame he might get as a backlash, specifically from his sister and step siblings as obviously coronavirus is prevalent in care homes."," i don't have advice, just sympathy. my mil hasn't put shit in the sink...yet, but when she opens the bathroom door and sees the sink, she's like ""you want me to go way up there??"" and i'm like ""no... here is the toilet."" and i open the door further to reveal the toilet. we had to take the garbage basket out of the bathroom because she was putting her used toilet paper in there instead of flushing it. i've seen poop smears on the floor, too. but her abilities are different day to day. she hates showering and can't do it alone. huge attitude every time. very common, i guess. my partner has to help her, and i think it's a combination of fear of the shower because she doesn't know what to do, and loss of dignity that make her opposed to them. long story short, she has to have 24 hour care, and societal shame or not, if your grandma needs to go to a facility, then that is just the reality. though, it may be hard to get into one right now. can the other family members help watch her to give you relief?i think i know how you feel because you said you aren't particularly close to her. i'm not close to the person i have to care for, and if i'm being honest, i have to completely subvert myself to get along with her. she just brags constantly and talks about herself.  i'm doing it because i love my partner. i just vow right now, that if this ever happens to me, send me to a home. i would hate to burden my loved ones, especially when there isn't anything that can be done to improve the disease. you are young... look into long term care insurance now. thanks for listening to my rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gnydoe/grandma_put_literal_shit_down_the_sink/,Grandma put literal shit down the sink

"tomorrow is the year anniversary of my grandmother's passing. she passed 10:25am at home with all of us there. it was peaceful. she hadn't been in any pain. she had family that visited in the preceding days, some of whom hadn't been to our state in years. but death is so..traumatic in some ways and just weird. i don't think i've even processed it even a year later. my grandmother had vascular dementia likely triggered by a stroke. her official diagnosis was unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance. we didn't even know she had had a stroke until we ended up in the er during a syncope episode and that's when it all came together at her next doctor's visit. i read posts here from time to time and our journey wasn't half as bad as some. she was relatively easy to please. she loved her candy (though we had to limit it because of her diabetes), loved to just watch tv but most of all loved being around family. even when she couldn't follow the conversation, she loved us all just sitting around and talking. we'd give her a snack and she'd eat and interject a random word or two that sometimes made sense, sometimes wouldn't but we got used to that. her diagnosis brought so much anger in me. it wasn't fair. my grandmother was pretty healthy aside this disease and it's terminal (for now). i watched her become a grandmother i didn't know. we became her protectors and caregivers. she still had some of her old traits (such as that motherly sense in some ways), but she wasn't the same. the only upside was that she was docile and while stubborn, not so much to a point where it was impossible to care for her. i'm grateful she passed slowly and not suddenly. at least it wasn't as traumatic. but all the readings in the world don't really prepare you for this journey. my grandmother lived a long life...she passed at 84 but it still felt short. i still feel like a kid and i never thought i'd be walking this earth without her. rest in peace to a phenomenal woman."," i'm sorry for your loss. there's never enough time, no matter how much you have. it's so hard to let go of a loved one, and i'm realizing that it's the kind of thing you never really get over, but that's okay. i kind of feel like our sorrow honors them; it shows how deeply they were loved. i'm glad your shared journey wasn't as bad as others because this disease is so terrible. it takes and takes until nothing is left, so even those who don't have it as bad suffer more than most. be at peace. <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gmwk5d/tw_death_its_been_a_year/,[TW: Death] It's been a year....

"hello all, i joined the sub a few weeks ago after my mil with ftd moved in with us. i figured it would be good to have a support network as we adjust to this new way of life. it's tough to say how far along her condition is because she was diagnosed before i met her. i'm continually stumped when trying to describe what she can and can't do at this point, and it switches day to day. sometimes she can dress herself, sometimes she can put on a seatbelt, sometimes she can find the bathroom. her vision is screwy... it's hard to describe, but her depth perception and peripheral vision seems to be out of whack. but she always knows where the ice cream is. a couple years ago, she went through a phase of being nasty, accusatory and paranoid. she would insist that nothing is wrong with her, that she is just depressed. she has definitely softened over the last year in particular. she knows she has limited abilities and asks frequently if she is ""retarded"" (sorry about the use of that word, i'm just using her authentic words to describe the situation). but, she still would never admit something is wrong, even though she acknowledges her short comings.i can handle repetition, but what makes the situation particularly difficult is the way her narcissism has distilled down into raging egotism. she is over compensating for her decline and has to try to impress you constantly. constantly. anything you talk about, she interrupts and turns it into a story about herself. this is an annoying personality trait to have, then add the repetition to it and you just want to scream. i have no idea how long she will live here. since the pandemic hit, i have basically become 24/7 care giver since i work from home everyday. my partner handles the personal/private tasks like showering, and is really good about preserving her mom's dignity in that way. but, she gets to go into work 2 days a week at least as an escape. we are working on a system that allows us to get alone time, and together time, but until things settle down, i don't know when we will be able to get anyone else in the house to help watch her. her son (my partner's brother) and her siblings (my partner's aunt/uncle) have been by when the weather is nice. i just hope that she is will to go back to the day center when the stay-at-home order is lifted, otherwise, i don't know what we are going to do. we can't afford to have someone sit with her all day while we are at work. wish me luck!and i hope you are all staying safe, healthy and hanging in there.", so sorry to hear about your mil. your spouse and mil are fortunate to have you help in caring for her.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gmaan8/just_saying_hello/,Just saying Hello

"not sure if this belongs here. maybe i'm looking for some support. maybe i'm hoping someone will have an idea to help me along. i have suspected for at least ten years my father's dealing with a form of dementia. if it's not dementia, then i'd have to say he's a narcissist. he was raised in a single parent home by his mother. when he's relayed stories of his childhood and interactions with his mother's family, it's clear there was a lot of dysfunction. my mother, his wife, passed ten years ago. i recall visiting my parents' home and my father displaying an odd behavior. later that afternoon i asked my mother if he'd had a stroke or if something had happened. she didn't answer but turned around and went back to her task on the kitchen counter.when she feel ill, my father was more concerned about the different syrup flavorings for coffee offered in the visitor area at the care facility my mother was in than he was about the care she was receiving from the doctors. at one point, he had a shelf in their fridge dedicated to all the cups of coffee he'd brought home with various combinations of creamers and syrups.while mom was sick and at home she had a commode. he referred to this as a ""potty chair"". although myself and others would emphasize ""commode"" in our next sentence to drop the hint he was using the wrong word, he just never put it together.one fall after she passed, i mentioned to him i'd spent some time outside prepping my kerosene heater for the winter ahead. i wanted it ready in case the house lost power for a prolonged period. during my next phone call home a few days later, my father mentioned he, too, had prepared his kerosene heater for winter by bringing it inside the house and starting it. he said he had flames shooting up to the ceiling and had my little brother not been there, the house might have caught fire.there have been several instances where he's been unable to foresee the very likely outcomes of his actions. i liken this to when my own children were toddlers and we'd have to keep on eye on them at all times for their safety.several years ago, he began to deal with incontinence. his approach was to fashion diapers out of cloth he'd had around the house. he was quite proud to tell me there were 42 layers of cloth stuffed in the front of his pants. he looked as if he'd stuffed a football in his pants. as these were soiled, he'd drop them wet into a laundry basket in his bedroom. after a number of them had accumulated, he would take the load to the laundry in the basement and wash all of them. the house reeked in the worst possible way of urine. after a year or so, i was able to convince him to try depend undergarments.two years ago, he suffered a tia and smashed his face into a door frame in the kitchen. i found him over seven hours later laying on his bed, incoherent. i dialed 911. the er ruled out uti, stroke, all the ""big nasties"" and told us to keep an eye on him over the weekend. while trying to dress to go home, he couldn't find the left half of his belt. it was in the loops and dangling right in front of him. the doctor returned and preformed some vision testing. he had no vision in his left eye from mid point to the outside. at that point, the doctor admitted him to the hospital and he went for an mri. a stroke was ruled out and the incident declared a tia.at this point, i met with his lawyer who brokered a deal. dad was to move to an independent living facility closer to me. i was prepared to obtain guardianship and force the issue. there are several other issues at play that i'd rather not publish on the internet. i will say that all these combined put my father at risk for physical harm or criminal charges if he fell into the hands of an uncaring da. when i spoke with dad's lawyer about my intentions and observations, the lawyer said he had no doubt i'd be granted guardianship based on what i was relaying. two points - first, i was holding back a few other larger points that i would share with my lawyer if indeed this would go to court. i've been around enough to know you don't lay all your cards on the table at the beginning. second, for some of my larger points, i had texts, screenshots and photos.dad moved closer to me and began use of the cloth diapers once more. he argumentatively refused to stop using them. he generated a smell complaint from the senior center. he and i met with his doctor and i explained my father's living conditions. his doctor left the office and visited my father's apartment during his lunch hour. he went toe to toe with my father and told him the diapers had to go. the doctor's assistant and i were able to round up all the diapers and toss them out.sadly, just before the pandemic started, he started drying out partially damp depends for re-use and generated another smell complaint. i'm not sure if that's a continuing practice as visitors are not allowed in during the pandemic.whenever i ask him about showering, he tells me it's been a while but that he does sponge baths.the last time i was able to enter his apartment before the pandemic, he had a pair of used shoes on the kitchen counter. these were from the senior center. the rubber heels had started to disintegrate. he'd wrapped the soles in scotch tape and was filling the voids with elmer's white glue. he refused to allow me to throw them out.he claims he's completely competent to manager his own affairs. mom did all the finances while she was alive. when he lived at home, he lost $300 to a iraqi dinar scam, $700 to a bum who promised to do tree trimming and another $400 to an online vitamin offer.during the pandemic, i've been making a point to call him daily. three times in one week he told me about different ""free"" offers where he'd only have to pay shipping and handling. the final one was a book about hitler's scientists discovering a cure for cancer. it, too, is free but he'd have to pay shipping and handling and subscribe to a newsletter. he ended that portion of the phone call by saying you never know if these things are a scam or not unless you try.that comment scared the life out of me. i've started working in the background using my financial poa to limit his access to his funds. he and i will have to work much more closely on his spending habits from now on. he tells me he doesn't have money for depend yet makes $120 a month in donations to causes he supports. when i read back the acronyms from payee line of the cancelled check, he cannot tell me which group that is or what cause it is for.i don't know if this is dementia or not. he's refuses to seek testing. he says there's nothing wrong with him and that's just how he is.thanks for reading this far. maybe if you have some communication strategy suggestions, i'd appreciate those.", the alzheimer's asscn. is super helpful.  when i was at my wits end and called asking for resources they recommended the book the 36 hr day- it has helpful strategies for communication.  hang in there.  i'm dealing with some similar behaviors and know how draining and time-intensive it can be.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gm779g/dementia_narcissism_idk/,"Dementia, Narcissism, IDK..."
"my husband is nearing retirement age, so younger than the average person with a diagnosis of dementia. i have some experience in this area, which is why i'm concerned.first signs were years ago, related to a statin. cognitive decline was very rapid. he stopped taking it, but never fully regained function. fast forward several years to a heart attack. now on a very aggressive cholesterol lowering medicine. i cannot tie his current status specifically to that. at this point, it's a long and fairly slow decline. recently i ran across a photo from about 20 years ago and emotionally was slammed with the realization that the guy in it bears no resemblance to who he is now. i guess the daily slog sort of masked the magnitude.he has difficulty word-finding. he will stand in another room and yell ""what is this?"" and if i don't know (because i'm off in another room) he'll get furious and demand to know why i don't come look. or he'll say, ""you know, when you're that person who is doing that thing, but like, famous"" and if i can't mind-read, he'll slam his fists and accuse me of ""gaslighting"" because ""obviously"" i know. in particular, he seems to be losing nouns. he is also falling victim to inertia - has trouble initiating activity. for example, he'll say that he ""always"" does the dishes. he's at home during the quarantine, and occasionally does them, but the spatial understanding of the device seems lost to him. i'll find dishes &amp; glasses shoved together so tightly that it's a miracle nothing shattered. or, he'll empty it half way, then start adding dirty dishes in with clean. or run it half full. i never know what i'll find.also, and this one really troubles me, he ""remembers"" things that i did, but thinks he did them. it's making me constantly check &amp; question myself. or he'll meld different memories as if they were simultaneous, even though the actual events were years apart. he has some paranoia. any conversation i have with our adult children, he assumes we are talking about him in a gossipy way. if there's any word play (puns, references to memes, movie quotes) he thinks they are directed at him. he gets mad and accusatory - so that is the end of any fun conversation. he has had a medical doctor witness a major episode - one so wild we took him to the er. he's had so many scans &amp; exams &amp; blood tests. and everything comes back ""normal"" so i'm at a loss. like, basically i have to just watch &amp; cope because nobody is taking it seriously. where can i turn for recognition &amp; intervention?

"i hate this disease so much. my dad is leaving me and this argumentative, ill informed, shell of a man is left to tell me he doesn’t need his meds, that he can take care of himself, and he doesn’t need me. i’m selling our house and moving for work and this old shell of a man who i’ve given my young adulthood to has decided he doesn’t need my help anymore financially or otherwise. i don’t even feel guilty anymore when he goes for a bike ride without his helmet. maybe it’ll end faster and he won’t get any worse than it is now. because worse is going to be awful and it’s going to bankrupt me. i’m not even burnt out...i’ve been burnt out before. i’m just super over it."," i can relate. my grandpa has dementia and he can get crazy scary when you try to argue with him. after he suffered a few falls over the years, resulting in cracked ribs and broken hips, we wanted him to move to an assisted living. he would agree with it at first, but then grandma would say no and then he would say no. they are not sociable in general and they said something that they don't want to give up their privacy or independence. we were looking at alternatives like having a nurse come in and help around, but again, they didn't want a total stranger coming in. there are times that my dad would get very frustrated with his father, my grandpa when he is lucid or does not make it easy on my dad when he is helping with finances. i often wish that death would come quick for both my grandparents as not only is it frustrating to please them, but their mental states are slipping even further, making it hard for us to protect them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gl8t25/i_hate_this_disease/,I hate this disease

"hi all. my mom, 73, was diagnosed last year with early onset dementia. she probably could have been diagnosed at least 3 years before that. my dad, also 73, is her primary caregiver. i live about 45 min from them with my own family.ok, so here's where i'm looking for advice. in my opinion my mom shouldn't be left alone and needs to have the house child proofed. if she has a headache, she finds and takes whatever medicine she sees first. she will turn on the oven, presumably to cook, and then forget it. my dad is a night owl and later sleeper meaning there are a few hours in the morning when my mom is awake, doing god knows what, and he is sleeping. mom is also hiding her medicine; she missed 4 night time doses last week alone. this puts my dad in the position to have to be more like a jailer, but he is not comfortable with that. he doesn't make her take her meds in front of him. he will still leave her home alone to go to the store and things like that. and, i think, she is starting to become violent with him. this is my main worry.i cannot force my dad to do anything and i know that. i have tried to help, offered to come over or for mom to come to my house while dad does stuff. i've offered to go to doctor appointments. i've been turned down consistently. at what point, though, do i need to step in to ensure my father's safety and sanity? i've been avoiding telling my dad what he must do, things which seem so obvious to me, because i am not her primary caregiver. i am becoming increasingly concerned for my dad's well being, though. any advice on how to make sure both of my parents are getting the care they need?"," wow... i have a whole lot of empathy for you and your family. i suspect that you are 100% right about what your mom needs. you're right that you can't force anything, and until your mom is in urgent danger (depending on where you are in the world) there aren't a whole lot of programs you can call into action. if i can indulge in kind of trying to imagine your dad's state of mind... there are three things that i experienced while caring for my own mum which might be clouding your dad's judgement. they certainly clouded mine. i bring them up because you might recognize your dad in them and having a better sense of his headspace might make you better able to approach him.first is grief. it's hard to accept that your life's partner is slowly losing themselves, and straight up denial is not an unusual coping mechanism. if this is the case, do be gentle with him. calling him out on his denial might only put him on the defensive. be sad with him. acknowledge and validate those feelings. in my case, i couldn't recognize how messed up i was feeling until a therapist started naming my feelings for me. (sounds dumb in retrospect, but that's what it was.) when i understood what i was feeling, the enormity of it all kind of hit me and i was better able to ask for help.second would be a kind of unintentional blindness to her progression. in a perverse and kind of tragic sense, it's the same as when you see a child who you haven't been around for a while. you immediately spot their growth, both physical and emotional. the child's parents, however, might not see the changes as starkly because they, well, they don't experience the stark contrast. even though i knew she was sick, there were days with my mum that felt normal. and when there weren't days, there were moments. i held on to the normal... if this is the case for your dad, a reasoned approach with evidence will help. plan out your case like a lawyer. ""she did x on day y, and a on day b."" you can also bring him research about what the next months might look like for her to help him put a plan in place.finally, there's a kind of dumb pride. he's managed just fine for his whole life, and it can feel demoralizing or even humiliating to ask for or even accept help. if you think your dad's pride is on the line, he might more readily accept your help if you frame your offers as being about him. my husband got me to accept help this way... he'd point out how exhausted i was in a non judgmental way, and then offer to administer her medicine, or make supper, or whatever. for your dad, ""i know you've got mom cared for so well that i'm not really worried about her. but if you've got her back, let me get yours. i've noticed x, y, and z in you, and mom's condition is not short term. let's put some plans in place so that i can support you as you support mom, even if you don't need me now... you might sooner or later and i want to be here for you."" even if he refuses help, i'd generally suggest putting your attention on him. get him through this. and... that's what i've got. hope it helps. warm e-hugs to you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gkbsmq/looking_for_advice_please/,Looking for Advice please

"i am a bit under shock still to be honest. just need to get this off my chest, i wish there was some advice you could give me, but since i'm just a neighbor there isn't all that much i can do, i guess. tldr below.i (f,23) have known her for about two years but since last summer i noticed she wasn't doing so well. she comes to us for help more and more since our apartment door is literally right next to hers. often she complains about people just leaving her in this strange flat all by herself without any explanation. sometimes she doesn't recognize me. she's in her 80s, has lived here for a long time (her now deceased husband basically built the apartments we live in). she really needs help... she sadly is too far gone to keep living on her own of course but besides daycare on weekends her absolutely exhausted son is unable to get a spot in hospice care or something similar.usually my boyfriend handles these situations when he's home but he's currently gone for the week because of work. i'm so thankful for that since i struggle with my own mental health and am coming out of depression. this makes the last 12 hours especially hard.i was already completely exhausted from a long day of online college courses when she rang the bell. i just got done eating dinner a second ago and hurried to the door. she gave me her phone, telling me to please pick up... well, it was the police. she had called them since she was convinced for a moment that someone is playing tricks on her. everything seemed to be off. the notebook a neighbor and friend of mine had gifted her (to write down good memories) had started the confusion according to her. they decided to send two cops. we waited, i tried to get her to tell me about her selfmade ceramics. a while after the cops arrived an she suddenly told me about her ceramics. they called the son in and were very kind. more waiting. with some of the comfort memory-topics i tried to strike up it felt like it made it worse since she couldn't remember or isn't able to do it anymore. the poor guy doesn't know what to do anymore - between his family, visiting her almost every day, getting constant calls and trying to get her placed... it's heartbreaking to see, especially since she's aware that something is wrong with her. she used to be sharp and a passionate teacher.after that encounter i started with ecosia but quickly discovered this subreddit. i've already learned a lot. like the ""yes, and..."" rule. thank you for that.so this morning was supposed to be a fresh start. but after a while i heard her screaming fo help through the thin walls around 6:30 am. there is a security key hidden so i got in as quickly as i could. she had fallen during the night, couldn't get up since and was miserable. i tried to help her up, but since she seemed to be in a lot of pain and asked me to get a stronger man. probably for the best. i tried to call my neighbor, no luck. going around ringing his and another family i was super relieved that one of the care workers was coming up the stairs. so with her and my friend coming out of his flat we went back upstairs. (3rd floor, stairs only, poor old lady.) they helped her onto the bed. then we finally could leave. my friend and i were both pretty shaken. especially since the elderly neighbor speaks of being so sad, lonely especially, that she doesn't want to live anymore... we already try to help out best we can.with some warm tea and my blanket and this off my chest i feel a bit better for now.tldr: the old lady with dementia in the apartment next to me lives alone. her son is completely overwhelmed and unable to get her care beyond day care monday through friday. we neighbors are trying our best but are illequipped to handle the situation. i'm struggling with mental health myself and feel helpless.thanks for all the tips i've found in this subreddit so far. in case someone here is from germany and knows anything about a law or way to get instant full time care... let me know. thanks."," i don’t know about germany but in my experience in america, a fall is sometimes the quickest way someone can end up in a long term care facility. my mom was caretaking for her aunt. she was instructed to never try to lift her if she fell because if something is broken, especially the neck or head, you shouldn’t move the person. also, it could injure the person trying to lift, and the person lifting could drop the person again etc. she was instructed to call for medical assistance with any fall. eventually, a fall led to permanent placement in a long term care facility through rehab, completely unrelated to her dementia. there is nothing fun for easy about the situation. i hope your neighbor is able to get the care she needs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gjgrrd/my_neighbor_has_dementia/,My neighbor has dementia...
"aromatic compounds such as those found in essential oils (via aromatherapy), ginseng, and marijuana have been studied in the treatment of alzheimer's disease.  these compounds because they are excellent hydrogen donor partially reverse oxidative and nitrostative damage done to critical receptors, transport systems, and enzymes needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, stable mood, sleep, social recognition, and alertness.  the following article explains the interplay between oxidative stress, amyloid beta proteins, and metal binding (especially copper and zinc) in alzheimer's disease.  a few points to add to the article: without oxidative stress there is no amyloid, amyloid by attracting metals such as copper and zinc can contribute to this stress but is not needed for this stress, and once copper and zinc are entombed in amyloid plaques they no longer do any damage.  anti-amyloid drugs that target plaques have made no difference in the disease and anti-amyloid drugs that target amyloid oligomers only make a difference in those with the apoe4 gene(s) who have higher levels of amyloid oligomers than those without the gene or genes.  so without further explanation here are some key findings of the research: # designing alzheimer's therapies at the molecular level*overview of a rational strategy for designing compact aromatic molecules with multiple reactivities against pathological factors found in the alzheimer's disease-affected brain and the chemical series studied in this work.*  *sometimes the most complex problems actually have very simple solutions. a group of south korean researchers reported an efficient and effective redox-based strategy for incorporating multiple functions into simple molecular reagents against neurodegenerative disorders. the team developed redox-active aromatic molecular reagents with a simple structural composition that can simultaneously target and modulate various pathogenic factors in complex neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer’s disease.*  *a number of pathogenic elements such as reactive oxygen species, amyloid-beta, and metal ions have been suggested as potential causes of alzheimer’s disease. each element itself can lead to alzheimer’s disease, but interactions between them may also aggravate the patient’s condition or interfere with the appropriate clinical care.**for example, when interacting with amyloid-beta, metal ions foster the aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides that can induce oxidative stress and toxicity in the brain and lead to neurodegeneration.* *because these pathogenic factors of alzheimer’s disease are intertwined, developing therapeutic agents that are capable of simultaneously regulating metal ion dyshomeostasis, amyloid-beta agglutination, and oxidative stress responses remains a key to halting the progression of the disease.**professor lim said, “this strategy is straightforward, time-saving, and cost-effective, and its effect is significant. we are excited to help enable the advancement of new therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders, which can improve the lives of so many patients.”*[***", go away.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gj3xl1/aromatic_compounds_in_the_treatment_of_alzheimers/,Aromatic Compounds in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease
"it was not talked about, i never saw the program or ticket, but i knew. i could remember.when i was little my parents took me to see a local theatre production of rogers and hammerstein’s, cinderella. i was too little to remember anything that happened, from where we sat in the theatre, to which theatre we were in, to what dress i wore, yet i remember. these memories are not from seeing the program, or photographs from the day, or having conversations about it with my parents. there was something special about that experience that tapped into my emotional memory, pulling me in and allowing me to become apart of its narrative, or for it to become apart of mine. the power of storytelling, sound, sight, smell, touch, and creativity all were engaged during that experience, that has allowed me, almost 30 years later to remember this live theatre experience. i think it is why, when asked about my “start” in theatre, in aging, in therapeutics, i respond with this answer, speaking to that time when my parents took me to see something that tapped into my emotional memory, my creativity, my imagination. this experience pulled out of me an emotional reaction, giving something that should have been forgotten, life. what is it about some elements of our life that we remember so vividly, so purely, so warmly without the aid of family stories, photographs, or other prompts that enriches our lives? whis is it that allows each one of us to have expereinces where are emotions run with such strength that it can almost out pace dementia? this is sort of a messy question, but truly, do we understand the full power of emotional memory? do we know how we can use emotional memory to help someone living with dementia, live fully alive?early on in my work with dementia, i recognized the power emotional memory could hold, long before i knew anything about its research and support, the instinct and the results i saw were more than enough. as i worked to become relational with others in a way that would not require them to remember my name, title, the reason for being with them, i found ways to help them tap into that part of there lives, and frequently we found a common connection, a place of beauty, a place of warmth. the emotional memory, and engaging the senses, are, for me, the two pillars of successfully working with those living with dementia. filled out with creativity, imagination, and seeing the person for all they have and can continue to be and become, these two pillars are powerful! i saw how when we created something new, together, even if it was a reflection on something we both loved, a bond was formed and even on the bad days when one would not remember me, i would bring up our shared connection and suddenly i was no longer someone to fear, to fight with, to be alarmed by, but someone to smile with, to hold hands with, to spend a moment with as we move to the next part of the day. in a small way, i was recreating that theatre experience for us, by creating something that didn’t require logical or linear thinking. i normally fight for logical and critcial thinking, but this is an area where the emotions are the shining star. there is a great emphasis on improv and dementia right now. programs are popping up all over the country and beyond. it is used both as a teaching tool for care partners, but also as programming in memory cafés, life enrichment calendars, and in partnership with community organizations. last summer i wrote about these programs and my opinion about them remains strong. as we look for tools to help us understand emotional memory on a very simple level, engaging in improv workshops for those living with dementia shows us what each person can do, can remember, and can engage with and in. it always amazes me how someone can transition from not remembering much about their life, to telling me the full story of their college career, their parents, their 40th wedding anniversary, simply and clearly, by allowing the creativity and movement of play bring out stories that cause you to forget about dementia. these stories are not always joyful however, the stories of war vets often come out and haunt you as you move through the workshop and head home. it shows us where we are lacking in care for those living with dementia who are also veterans.early on in my work with dementia, i recognized the power emotional memory could hold, long before i knew anything about its research and support, the instinct and the results i saw were more than enough. as i worked to become relational with others in a way that would not require them to remember my name, title, the reason for being with them, i found ways to help them tap into that part of there lives, and frequently we found a common connection, a place of beauty, a place of warmth. the emotional memory, and engaging the senses, are, for me, the two pillars of successfully working with those living with dementia. filled out with creativity, imagination, and seeing the person for all they have and can continue to be and become, these two pillars are powerful! i saw how when we created something new, together, even if it was a reflection on something we both loved, a bond was formed and even on the bad days when one would not remember me, i would bring up our shared connection and suddenly i was no longer someone to fear, to fight with, to be alarmed by, but someone to smile with, to hold hands with, to spend a moment with as we move to the next part of the day. in a small way, i was recreating that theatre experience for us, by creating something that didn’t require logical or linear thinking. i normally fight for logical and critical thinking, but this is an area where the emotions are the shining star. &amp;#x200b;originally posted at dementialettersproject.com"," hi kate! love cathy braxton.. great to see you here. remember to always ""yes, and...""",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/gizcjy/emotional_memory_and_dementia/,Emotional Memory and Dementia

"hello everyone.it all started when i came to visit my mother and step-father abroad this year. my mother was always on the strange end, and she also has adhd so she was never quite “normal”. but during my visit (ongoing, it has been 6 months together now) i noticed that something was off. something that adhd doesn’t quite cover. after observing her a little more my gut told me there was a cognitive issue going on, and i started researching that which pointed to dementia, and the signs fit like a glove.. first of all, her driving got way worse but she blamed it on having to drive a bigger car. it got better after switching cars but she still sometimes freaks out and requires directions from her husband.. which didn’t happen ever when i was young. secondly, she never spoke good english but she used to teach english. now she requires audio lessons almost every day to keep her skills intact, which seem to deteriorate anyway. she can barely form meaningful english sentences, and she has difficulty finding the right words in native and pauses or goes uhmmm or just says “the thing” a lot.. today, she forgot what niagara falls was called and said namibia falls. the other day during a conversation about making a cake, she said “we have pineapple in the fridge” and i replied “oh cool, we can use strawberry, banana and pineapple” which made her look dead confused and utter almost like a reflex, “which one was pineapple?” as if she had totally forgot the fruit.. when confronted she said she thought i meant the opiod called pineapple (?????) so she got confused... while discussing making a cake... the other day she used 5 different plates for a batch of dough because she couldnt work out which one it could fit in. when confronted, she said she has bad sight (she has 2 different pair of glasses yet fails with things like this or frequently purchases wrong items at the supermarket. she also refuses to wear glasses most of the time..) she forgot the safe keys on the kitchen table. and most weirdly, she used to very rarely drink and frown upon it but she seems to do it a couple times a week now. she used to cringe at the sight of sweets but asks me to bake something daily. she even ate chips, which she used to call “disgusting factory-made poison” when i ate it. her impulsivity also got overall worse. there are more examples but these are the prominent. the issue is; my mother is also very abusive and narcissistic, and when i voiced my concern about this she verbally attacked me and her husband pretended to listen for 2 seconds and said i’m just exaggerating. my mother is now actively trying harder to hide the symptoms and manipulate my father against me, and my father seems dangerously oblivious. i don’t have a strong enough bond with my mother to care but nonetheless my gut is telling me she needs help asap and i cannot shake off this concern. what should i do? the only advice i have gotten so far has been that i cannot help a person unless they accept it. but standing aside doing nothing just doesn’t feel right... what if i’m right? what then?...."," so sorry. i know being faced with something like this isn’t easy. i would read up on ftd, frontotemperal dementia, if i were you. symptoms sounds like they could fit. whatever it may be, it’s good to have an official diagnosis if for nothing else but social security, medicare or disability reasons.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/giqbrj/i_suspect_that_my_mother_has_dementia_but/,"I suspect that my mother has dementia, but.."

"my grandpa was diagnosed with dementia some odd years ago and his mental state often leaves him lucid and confused on any given day. just last year, my family was in the midst of deciding in either sending him and grandma to an assisted living or hire some nurses to check in on him. well, grandpa is a stubborn old man who refuses to leave his home or welcome any strangers. things then went bad to worse as the covid-19 pandemic took us by surprise. a lot of elderly people had succumb to the virus, although i'm not sure of the exact number. however, many places where the elderly live have been hit hard by the virus, which made us reconsider in sending my grandparents to a facility. it has been hard to keep not just grandpa safe, but also my grandmother. they don't seem to understand the pandemic very well as they often go to the store to shop, but we keep telling them that we will deliver their groceries or have one of us do a grocery delivery service for them. another thing they don't understand is the reason why barber shops or hair salons are closed. many places where people like to hang out, like restaurants, libraries, etc. are closed and we are waiting for our state of maryland to reopen those places, but it's likely that strict policies of crowds or large number of people will be enforced. they still don't seem to understand that, which concerns us. the one thing we are hoping for is that neither one gets the virus. we don't want them to suffer an agonizing death as the symptoms include a high fever that will last for days and shortness of breath. we just keep hoping that we wake up and think this was all a bad dream."," do your grandparents just forget you are having their groceries delivered or do they stubbornly refuse to not shop on their own.  if it’s the latter, i can’t see what you can do about it (i assume you ed already tried to convince them otherwise).  if it’s cause the forget, you could set up something that will notify you every time they leave the house.  you could call them when you get the notification and remind them at that time not to go to the grocery store or into any crowded place in general.  you can even set up an automatic notification on their phone to tell them just that right when the alert system knows they’ve left the house.the alert system could be set up with either something like wyze where a door sensor would let you know they’ve opened their front door.  you could put life 360 on their phone and it will beep you when they leave a certain radius around the home and you can call the person who isn’t typically the driver and reach them before they hit their destination (phone trackers sometimes aren’t sensitive enough to alert you before they are already driving though it does seem to tell me right when my dad is still in the driveway and not started his car yet).another thing is to help them develop hobbies that they would do at home.  this is to divert them from whatever activity they would do in busy places.overall, if they do get sick, just remember it isn’t your fault.  they really are making their own life choices.  my dad is s stubborn mule same as your grandpa so i sympathize.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ghxwqw/with_nursing_homes_being_struck_by_coronavirus/,"With nursing homes being struck by coronavirus, we're stuck in trying to keep grandparents safe"
"if you’ve read my previous post, you know my grandma has severe dementia and we put her in a nursing home last friday. my cousin called her hospice nurse and this is what he said: she cannot suck through a straw, she cannot chew food. he said she cries out like she's in a lot of pain from everywhere. her bottom is red and he's taking meds to treat that. but she didn't tolerate being touched anywhere. he gave her some ativan to see if it was more anxiety than pain and it helped temporarily but shortly after that she needed morphine again. they haven't had tramadol in stock so he's taking that to them also. he honestly doesn't think it'll help. her breathing and blood pressure is good, her pupils are sluggish. he thinks we have a couple of weeks but it's an educated guess at this point. she has not had a bowel movement since being there. and we got conflicting reports about her eating. he's going to ask to see the chart when he goes back.my grandma is in so much pain and i hope she passes quickly, and sooner rather than later. yesterday we were able to video chat with her because of mother’s day and it was also her birthday and she looked awful. she said “please let me go.”", it’s so frustrating when care takers say everyone is different. my mom is on day 79 of hospice for dementia but seriously doesn’t have more than a week left. she entered hospice when she was still comparatively high functioning. i was surprised they took her.  we called hospice for an evaluation expecting them to say call us back in a month. at her evaluation in february she was still walking around the house by herself but slipping down occasionally with catching herself on a stool or cabinet so not technically a fall. she started having trouble getting to bathroom before releasing. and once she needed to change pull ups she was not able to. she was unable to bathe herself or dress herself. she could only eat foods that had been pre cut into small pieces and put in front of her. she needed almost constant watching. she was sleeping 13 to 14 hours per day.  once she entered hospice she maintained at that stage for about 3 weeks until she started wandering more at night.  we were all asleep when i heard her in the kitchen around 1 am eating cake. she fell to the floor but landed on her bottom. i was luckily able to pick her up and put her back in bed.  a hospital bed was ordered to help keep her from night wandering.  at about the same time she started urinating in her pull-up about 10 times per day. the constant diaper changes were wearing everyone out. because she could not follow commands to sit down or lift a foot it took two people and almost 20 minutes per change. we were spending about 4 hours per day in the bathroom just so she could urinate.  getting her on and off the toilet was a near fall every time too. a catheter was ordered.  unfortunately that didn’t work at all and we were back to diapers but much easier to change in a hospital bed than from the floor of the restroom.  she also progressed to not being able to eat a soft sandwich so we switched to baby food and yogurt. our hospice nurse told us that this was a normal progression for dementia because the brain is dying a slow death. the brain is having trouble telling the legs to walk and the hands to dress and the teeth to bite down etc.  after a few more weeks mom forgot how to swallow even apple sauce and would hold it in her cheek. she could still swallow little sips of water delivered by syringe but as of today she has even “forgotten” how to do that. so without even water now for the last few days it won’t be much longer. i hope that helps. feel free to dm me if you want to chat. best to you. peace for her is just around the corner.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ghx9gi/anyone_elses_relatives_experience_this_right/,Anyone else’s relatives experience this right before they died?

"my grandfather (80) has some sort of dimensia for sure.my family likes to think he's been cognitively declining since his 40s. that was when he started taking antidepressants and sleeping pills i think, not to mention other pills for high blood pressure and maybe something else. his routine became set in stone and he never wanted to try anything knew. any time he'd try to watch anything on tv he would get completely bored and fall asleep within 20 minutes no matter the time of day.in his late 60s, he just couldn't recall pretty much any modern trends, media, news stories, except for politics, and even that's debatable. that's when he also started to have great difficulty finding the right words and getting to the point. he also started to forget the names of friends of friends and friends' family, and if they had a brother or sister. at first we chalked it up to regular old people stuff, but his memory only became worse.it's not as if he's lazy. yeah he could do more but he always made an effort to keep his mind active. he does some accounting for people even though he's long retired, and does crosswords every day.2 years ago he forgot a film that he watched a few days ago. a few months after that, we were on vacation and made the mistake of placing some important tickets with him. he searched for them thrice and didn't find them. we were going to get stranded in a foreign country if my grandmother didn't decide to search his bag and find them. everyone was pissed at him after that.  last christmas he entirely forgot a very heated argument that was between me and my grandmother. i haven't seen them since then because we don't get along.i visited yesterday and he just seemed even worse. this time he forgot what his wife was cooking when she was cooking in front of him the whole time.my grandfather tries to cover up his memory problems as best he can. but they're the type who deal with a problem by not acknowledging it and will only act once a lot of damage has been done. i can see that my grandma is struggling to cope, because i can see she barely restrains her anger around her husband's forgetfulness.i hope their son is responsible enough to intervene if things become worse."," it sounds like it may just be cognitive decline.  my dad was like that.  years later, he was diagnosed with alzheimer’s though, so this may be the years that come before that.  i’m not a doctor though, so it’s probably best if he can be seen by a doctor.  there may be other issues causing the forgetfulness, if so they maybe treatable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ghrm5q/how_long_will_this_take_to_get_worse_and_how_does/,How long will this take to get worse and how does one cope?

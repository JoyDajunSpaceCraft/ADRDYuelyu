"in short, my grampa has been having some memory issues for a while (around 6 or so months) but i just genuinely don't know if it's to do with him bumping his head, which happens semi occasionally, or perhaps dementia. i love this man with my very soul and it would break me so much to have him actually have the symptoms. i feel i could manage somewhat if i did lose him, i've been thinking about it all day and i'm more upset and hurt for my nan who is practically his soul mate.i'm genuinely confused and i wish i had a definitive answer with what is wrong with him.", naturally my mind being the crazy thing that it is looks towards the future and what might happen and it gets the tears going. i'll always try and keep my mind in the present because imagining the future isn't exactly a good thing all the time.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jz870w/i_dont_know_how_to_feel/,I dont know how to feel

"tldr: the problems that my grandmother exhibits with us like peeing on everything and getting up in the middle of the night she doesn't do with my uncle and i'm kind of annoyed.now for the long version. about four years ago, my mother (45f) who i (19f) live with, took in my grandmother (62f) who was diagnosed with dementia in 2010. she was okay to live on her own for the first couple of years and we took her in once we realized it wasn't safe for her to live alone anymore. since then she's pretty steadily gone downhill. she now talks constantly, takes and hides anything of value that we leave out, is generally mean to everyone (especially mom) and has to be supervised constantly because she no longer has the wherewithal to decide when she needs to go to the bathroom and will pee wherever she's sitting. my mother is her primary caregiver because my uncle (46m) absolutely will not help unless he has no other choice. we've practically begged him to at least take her once a month to give us a little break because we can't even have a legitimate conversation with her around.a few months ago, my uncle was finally forced to agree to take her for two months. my mom and i were flying to london to get me settled in university and she was staying there for the first couple of months.there was trouble with the loan so ultimately i had to withdraw from university and come back, but grandma has been with my uncle since october 3rd.now that we're back, we're getting everything situated for grandma again and getting updates from my uncle and his girlfriend.well luckily for him, it seems she hasn't been having any of the problems with him that she does with us! no constant talking, no taking anything, no getting up in the middle of the night, no peeing everywhere.even before this, i often had my suspicions that in spite of her diminished mental capacity, she was kind of doing this on purpose as a sort of prolonged temper tantrum against mom. she would take things sure, but it seemed like she knew the difference between things that were hers and things that weren't. because if she took something that was ours, she wouldn't just leave it out in the open in her room like usual, she would squirrel it away in the back of a drawer somewhere. sure she would be mean to the dogs, but she would stop the minute mom walked in like she knew she wasn't supposed to do it. and now with my uncle of course she has no problems at all.has anyone else had a similar experience with a complete 180 in personality and issues? i've heard stories of dementia patients being all sunshine and roses for their family and then being completely awful for healthcare workers. could this be something similar? to be honest i'm kind of mad. as awful as it sounds, i was looking forward to my uncle's complaints of all the crap he's refused to help us with until now"," before my dad was diagnosed i used to say i had 2 dads. dad and gene. i love my dad, but gene is difficult.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jylwhd/is_she_trying_to_make_things_harder/,Is she TRYING to make things harder?

"mending the broken pieces in the summer of 2014 my mother was diagnosed with dementia. at that time she was 63 and living with my grandmother in southern california. later that year, my sister and i made the decision to bring her out to colorado to live with me, until her death in spring of 2019. i find myself today, almost 7 years since her diagnosis, at a loss, unable to grasp who she was, or what she really meant to me. i have become completely numb, totally incapable of love. not knowing how to feel things anymore. i’m never particularly happy, never particularly sad. everything is just grey. recent events in my life have finally put large cracks in the dam holding back all the emotions i have been harboring, throughout the years. knowing what i was about to face, writing this story, was always the plan. somehow i knew it’s exactly what i needed to find myself again. this is the sorry about her and what i experienced, as i start to peel back the layers, understanding them and finally taking the time feel them. to begin this story, i must capture the essence of her and the relationship we had. i was born into this world by an extraordinary woman, not only was she a god fearing moral person, she was the person that always protected me. she never deceived me. in times of confusion, she would always steer me down the right path. she was mother, she was my rock! i don’t think i can recall a time she ever yelled at me in anger. don’t get me wrong, i did get yelled at as a kid, no! david was the most common phrase in my house growing up. it was never out of anger tho, only frustration from what i had just done, or was about to do. i was a handful, always into something. turn you head for a second and i was taking something apart, climbing up on the kitchen countertop or being a ham, performing a circus act in the hallway. i was a tornado of discovery, driven by an active imagination, with enough energy to fuel a power plant. how she survived, the trials and tribulations i put her through, i will never know. all that i know is that she did it with grace. she completely knew me, inside and out and had this peaceful way to guide me. i was born with a very strong will, she must have learned early on, the only way to lead me was by example. it was always the why and never the how. what it took for her to always remain loving and clam, in the midst of the chaos, i would create. this is what makes her the most extraordinary person i have ever known. what it truly feels like to be loved by your mother, is the love you can see on her eyes the second you walk into the room. time completely stops and all you can feel is love she has for you. this is how my mother loved me. the first year i’ll never forget the moment i decided she was coming to live with me. we were on a family vacation in hawaii and i stopped by her room to check on her. she was washing her contact lenses in the the sink. she already had one in her eye while washing the other vigorously under the running water. looking at me with a puffy red, squinted eye she said, “honey, this really burns”. she was washing the contact lens in the tap water of the sink. she must have been in there for a half hour, repeating the same process. moving her away from the sink, i grabbed a hand towel and ran it under some warm water. calmly placing it over her eyes, i reassured her everything was going to be ok. we then headed to the eye doc for a last minute eye exam. we got her pair of glasses, some pain relief eye drops and were on our way. seeing my mother in panic of pain and her not knowing how to stop it, was the moment reality set in. it was very similar to the “loosing cabin pressure” sene in fight club. that moment i knew it was my job to take over. a week later, she came out to colorado. oh man did my mom love elvis, our vacation in hawaii was epic. we saw a elvis impersonator and she thought he was the real deal. it was like a time warp back to the 60’s for her. singing and dancing the whole time, she couldn’t sit still. after the show she got to meet him, we took some pictures for her and he gave her his scarf. just before we left he gave her a kiss on the cheek. she was completely glowing the rest of the trip. the scarf he gave her was wrapped around her neck or on her wrist the rest of the year. i must have washed that thing a thousand times. i tried to make everything about elvis when we got home. picked up a giant diner statue at a swap meet and tons of vinyl records. elvis was playing regularly around the house this year. there’s a 50’s diner close to my house, where we would have breakfast a couple times a week. she always had the same thing, strawberry french toast with scrambled eggs and a strawberry milkshake. i remember being very ambitious that year, i was on a mission to find a solution that will slow the progression of her disease. we went to doctor after doctor trying to get a solid plan of attack. her insurance was still a california hmo plan the and was nothing but thorn in my side. every doctor had a different opinion and they all seemed scared of their own shadows. they were all unwilling to try alternative medications or treatments i found in europe. after countless visits in multiple practices we found a young doctor willing to try something new. he had a let’s give it a try and see attitude. this was a breath of fresh air and i started to get my hopes up again. two weeks later he left the practice and we couldn’t see him anymore. we had to start all over again, that was a very depressing moment, i started smoking again that day. i was on a job site talking about my mom with a client and she turned me on to a article about peter falk. apparently peter developed early onset dementia after a dental visit and died soon after. knowing my mom suffered from periodontal disease her whole life, i scheduled a dental check up for her the next day. the appointment a the dental office went very well. the staff was amazing, i was able to stay by her side the entire time keeping her calm and making her laugh as a means of being distraction. after a panoramic x-ray, the doctor had a ton of questions. i remember the doctor thinking she had been in a horrific car accident or something. the x-rays looked like a scene from a science fiction horror movie, screws and wires everywhere. my mom had a cosmetic surgery to correct a overbite just a year before. i didn’t know how extensive it really was until that day. they also had her on a daily dose of benadryl for almost a year. with the connections to benadryl and dementia, i found during a previous hunt. i convinced myself, that’s exactly what’s to blame. i told myself this countless times and started to become angry. chain smoking a pack of cigarettes later, i realized i had created a false hope. when that hope was crushed, i just started to blame. after some deep soul searching, i remembered what i was taught growing up. my mother taught me, nothing is to be gained from anger but a battle fueled by rage. the only thing you can hope to accomplish with that mindset is, annihilation. battles are won though compassion and understanding. she would have told me, “life’s a crap shoot, there are no guarantees for anyone, just make the best with what you have and move forward.”she had another had saying, “when the going gets tough, the tough get going.” that i never really grasped it until that moment. my outlook on the situation completely changed and it only became about making the best of it. nobody is to blame, it just is. if she’s happy and safe, that’s all that matters.getting back to this mindset is exactly what i needed to be reminded of today. sometimes life beats me down and i loose site of who i am. mom and i were starting to get a routine going then. it took a couple weeks to figure it out. 7am is breakfast. she likes to have a cheese omelet with a slice of toast most days. i can usually sneak in a protein shake, if she’s hungry enough to eat the whole omelet. the nanny comes at 8:30 to give her a bath and hang out for a couple hours. that usually lasts until 10. i’d head out to work until 1 and usually come back to mom in her room changing clothes. she’ll put on everything in her closet clean or dirty. it’s very hard to keep track of the clean clothes vs the dirty ones. it’s ok for now i’ll just do laundry every day, she has fun playing dress up, i thought to myself. we usually head out to lunch around 2. there’s a local bar/restaurant that know us well. we always sit in the same spot and she always gets the same food grilled cheese and a heineken. we hang out for about 45min while i control the music form an app in my phone. she had no idea i’m doing this and gets surprised every time elvis comes on. we make it back to the house, walk around the half block to see the horses, she calls them the big dogs and finish the day with friends on tv until she’s ready for bed. it’s one of her favorites and will keep her calm if she has a beer in her hand. this routine stays relatively consistent the whole year. i start to notice little bits of her cognitive function disappearing, she looses about 10 words each week. this is pretty hard to watch unfold. conversations started with complete sentences and her, mostly aware of her surroundings. now she just has a few little phrases to describe everything and no idea where she is. i first started to pay close attention to the decline when we were brushing our teeth in the main bathroom together. i handed her a toothbrush with some paste on it. i always make a quick joke. this time it was, now this isn’t for your nose. that one always made her laugh. this time she didn’t, she instead smeared the paste all over her face. looking at her completely confused, it felt like my heart hit the floor. it took everting i had to keep it together. i called her a silly goose and said, that’s not supposed to go there, as i washed her face with a towel. i was completely overwhelmed by sadness. i smoked a couple cigarettes in the garage and continued on with the day. that was the first year. i’ll post more in the comments as i write about it."," thank you for sharing your story!  although my mother passed from a malignant brain tumor in march of this year, i can definitely relate.  when you say, "" *i find

"not necessarily a guilt thing, but something i feel is worth being discussed:my grandmother has dementia, she was diagnosed early this year (3/2020) after a series of episodes where she would scream in the day and at night because she believed she was being possessed by demons. we took her to the doctors and they did confirm it was dementia. since the diagnosis, it's gone downhill from there. she has rapidly become incontinent, walking and talking are becoming harder for her, and her only words she seems to say any more are ""mama!"" or some combination of expletives. she is no longer the matriarch of my family like she was when i was younger and i understand that. but since covid has kept me from going to my mom's home in sc where they live to visit, i have felt like every time i visit, it has just gotten harder and harder to see her in this state. i think the moment when i knew i just wanted her to die was when she screamed at me and my mom ""kill me please mama!"" i had to leave the room to keep from breaking down in front of her and my mom. knowing that a family member is depressed to the point of literally begging for death is one thing, but to add on dementia to that, adds so much more stress because idk if she is saying that because that's what she wants, or if that's the dementia talking. i want her to not be in pain, i want my mom to not be in pain either because of what she has to do to take care of her. and there have been many a time i've wished my grandmother would just drop dead, because it would mean she'd finally no longer feel pain. i wrestle with those thoughts regularly because a part of me thinks i'm a horrible grandson for thinking that, but another part wants to justify it because then no one would be hurting anymore...i just need someone to talk to about these feelings because explaining this to my mom would not be the best option. she takes care of my grandma by herself (her siblings live in hi and can't travel due to funds/covid) and i'm the only family close enough to be supportive. telling her how i feel about this would not only insult her as a parent, but would break her heart because she's tried so hard to care for my grandma, in spite of all this. my wife has told me that i may need to speak to a therapist about this too, but i haven't brought myself to go do therapy because i've believed that while these emotions hurt right now, they are temporary. i know my grandma will likely die soon, but the clear and present stress that is exerted on my mom to care for her, while simultaneously stressing me because i want to help but can't, feels like an endless bog of depression. and i just want it to stop.i love my grandma very much, she quilted my first baby blanket, a blanket for my wife when we got married, made the best food, and cared for all of us. i just want her to rest in her old age and pass peacefully, surrounded by all the family who love her, not in some hospice care place screaming in her bed that she's likely soiled and a nurse who's only there to swap out a bedpan or change her sheets. but since no one can be there for her besides my mom, my wife and i, we just have to make due. i apologize if any readers think this wasn't really all that important or just simply twisted. i just had a lot i needed to say and i thought posting would make me feel better..."," you’re not alone, i’ve done a lot of thinking about euthanasia rights. we really need to get that sorted in the us. it’s genetic, i’m caring for the man who told me about his of mother he cared for while she died of dementia. i’m not interested personally in suffering like this, and i know he wouldn’t be either. i’m holding out for more research and maybe cures but also we need to have access to rights that can end this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jxhx31/i_want_my_grandma_with_demntia_to_die/,I want my Grandma with demntia to die...
"hey guys. i tried searching for a previous post but i didn’t find the responses super helpful as they would be for someone further along than my mother. the doctors believe she is in the “pre” stages of dementia, which is frustrating in itself not having a certain diagnosis. she’s still very aware of what’s going on but she has a lot of problems with her speech and making decisions. even sometimes just how to unpack the takeout is a little too much. it’s like her compute time, for lack of a better work, is delayed. so this delay in being able to make a decision is leading to some close calls while driving. i tried to talk to her tonight but she’s not hearing what i’m saying. she says she is a slower driver than me and always has been but the issue is she’s almost unable to merge. my dad said she almost drove them into oncoming traffic last week looking over her shoulder and i’ve had her drive us to lunch the last few weeks so i could see how she was doing and i just don’t think she can react fast enough to drive safely. a lot of people had said they pretend the car is broken or hide the keys but she would absolutely know what we’re doing. has anyone been able to get through to someone to make them understand that they aren’t safe when they don’t see anything wrong with how they’re driving? i wouldn’t be able to live with myself if we continued to let her drive (she’s never alone) and something happened."," it might be underhanded but we went to my mother in laws doctor. where i live a person over 80 has to get a dr approval to renew their license i think every year or two years.my wife and i spoke to her doctor and brought up our concerns (she was having issues seeing the traffic lights, she wouldn't look behind her when reversing and so on). dr put her through an extensive physical and mental testing and that is how we found that her macular degeneration had progressed to her being legally blind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jxgdbm/delayed_responses_leading_to_unsafe_driving/,Delayed responses leading to unsafe driving
"for a science competition (scifest ireland), my friends and i created a smart glasses system called ""specs"" for people with dementia, alzheimer's, face blindness and other cognitive disorders that cause patients difficulty with recognizing the faces of their friends and family.it detects faces in front of the patient and recognizes them using opencv computer vision and machine learning software running on a raspberry pi zero. this face's corresponding information (i.e. joe, your son) is then displayed on an oled display and then projected onto a display piece in front of the patient's eye. the system is personalized for each patient depending on their needs and we are currently adding in new features. we hope that this will reduce anxiety fear and paranoia in patients and relax them in situations where they think there may be an intruder or threat or simply are to embarrassed to ask who the person they should know what their name is. our system also has an app to manage the system that we created. we really hope this will help a lot of people in the future. for the scifest competition there is a voting element for a smaller award (the scifest stem outreach award) we would appreciate any votes we could get. i know reddit and the fine members of this sub won't disappoint.thanks so much, we'd love to hear feedback and if possible for you guys to be able to cast your vote for us.the specs team.[video description of specs system]([voting link](",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jxcvd8/smart_glasses_for_people_with_dementia/,Smart Glasses for People With Dementia

"my father is in his late 70s and has been abusive towards us (me, mom, brother) our entire lives. post retirement, he contracted a staph infection in both legs and refused treatment for several months until we had to call an ambulance and have him forced into the hospital. he had it treated in the hospital and rehab facility for a month and was released earlier this year. he was tested for dementia but they said he doesn't have it. however, his behavior is bizarre and indicative of someone who is losing his mental capacity. the infection has returned to both of his legs, and he is flat out refusing to be taken to the hospital because he's concerned he will get covid. if any of us ask him about his legs or if we calmly state he needs to see a physician, he shouts at (literally) the top of his lungs for several minutes (he has a loud booming voice and yells for us to ""fuck off, get out of here, i can't afford it, i'm not going to any hospital, you're picking on me, shut up""). this is alarming and makes it 100% impossible to communicate with him. the last time we called an ambulance, it took them an hour to convince him to be taken to the hospital, but now he flat out will 100% refuse with absolutely no chance whatsoever that he will willingly go. when he was in the hospital earlier in the year, he would consistently shout at us when we would go to visit him (even though they put him on a sedative/ anti anxiety medication), so with his fear over the current covid situation things are even worse (i can't imagine him willingly in the hospital again for a month). what options are there in this case? it seems he has low grade dementia but can perform well if he's questioned by an authoritative figure. it's 6am and he is literally yelling to himself saying ""why is he saying that to me, leave me alone man, ahhhh"" because i calmly told him half an hour ago that he needs to see a physician for his infected legs. how can we force him to go to the hospital if it's likely that he will flat out refuse?"," mine is this way about the fungal infection under her breasts which became a raw, oozing open wound. fever followed. she wanted no part of having either treated or cleaned and the severity increased rapidly. she’s 90 and extremely frail so a jaunt to the hospital wasn’t an option yet. i’m an rn and she’s never had an issue with my treating her in any area of her body, in fact she would often call me specifically to help her with wound issues, but with the dementia progressing she would try to physically fight me over it. she’d call me names, swear at me, try to hit me and throw anything in her reach. this behavior is not in her nature however. her doctor put her on a higher dose of ativan (.5mg am and 1mg pm, to reduce her combativeness). within a couple days she was willing to let me do wound care. we’ve been doing twice daily washes and treatment for 3 weeks now and it’s almost completely healed. have you talked to the doc about possibly introducing a low dose of something to help with his combative behavior? i am not advocating the use of lorazepam or any other drug. i just wanted to share what helped us get over combative health care refusal. it isn’t something to take lightly, of course, putting dementia patients on certain drugs that affect the brain, but it might be worth discussing with his gp.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jx0tx7/abusive_parent_with_possible_dementia_refusing/,Abusive parent with possible dementia refusing medical treatment for foot infection

(i’m wondering if they’re actually tias but the scans we have don’t show any in particular.) anyway, that’s what i’m asking you lovely people about. these funny turns - the only way he can really explain them is that his “eyes go big”, or he feels like he’s in a virtual reality or 3d movie. everything looks really weird, he doesn’t know where he is etc. it really worries him and makes him feel scared and unsettled. they normally happen when he’s just woken up from a nap or a deeper sleep. he also has what i think are hallucinations about being put outside/in a shed?? he is convinced one of the overnight carers keeps putting him outside in the weather. (they aren’t doing that.) i had to sort of say to him, that they aren’t and that he’s safe but his brain is playing tricks on him, i believe he’s having hallucinations etc etc which at first he didn’t believe me and was offended, but now i think he realises that his brain is tricking him. my question is - is this all normal for vascular dementia? has one of your loved ones experienced this? and is there anything (drug/medication) that can help? we are in process to have a geriatrician review but i thought it would be a good idea to do some research first.", my grandmother has vascular dementia and in the early stages she would also have hallucinations. shes always hated rodents and every small flicker of light or movement of a curtain in a breeze would set her off and she thought the house was infested with rats and mice. not much you can do except reassure and distract them,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jwzzih/vascular_dementia_hallucinations/,Vascular Dementia - hallucinations???

"hi allmy mom was placed in a brand new memory care facility that opened in june. she was their first patient. there were lots of promises about programming, care, etc. recently they have requested that she be removed for a month so that they can put basic programming in place. they've stated they don't have skilled dementia practitioners onsight to handle her or the other new patients and need to staff up. they say once a month has past and they can get this all in place, she can return.   i am now looking for a new place for her. i'm certainly not going to return her to a place that has turned out to have such significant issues. however i did a lot of due diligence on the first place and it seemed great. now i'm second guessing myself as i evaluate a new placement.   what are the key questions you've asked as you've tried to select the right memory care placement for your loved one?", visit *all* of them.  look for engaged and well-cared for residents.  choose a place where you can easily visit.  check reviews online and use services like medicare's [care compare]( to check ratings.  i'm sure other countries have similar services.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jwh1op/how_do_you_select_the_right_memory_care_facility/,How do you select the right memory care facility?
"as stated in the title, my mom was diagnosed formally last week. for many months she’s been off, wandering off to go home in the middle of the night, crying that her family (dead parents) left her, not recognizing my aunt as her sister, etc. she’s in total denial when she’s lucid and refusing help. she’s always been difficult and prone to violent outbursts, so it makes possibly caring for her even more difficult. additionally, she lives below the poverty line, has no real assets or savings and lives far from me (she’s in ny and i’m in tx).  i want to help her, but can’t afford much. what can i do? for now, my aunt wants to move her into her home and hire a hha, but the reality is we need to plan for long term care as she gets worse. does anyone know of facilities in nyc? how do i contact medicaid for assistance? what do i have to expect as my mother progresses in her illness? i’m very anxious, upset and above all else, tired. i haven’t slept well in months from her constant phone calls and wanderings at night. if it weren’t for covid, i’d be up there to care for her, but i have my family and children here. i feel like i can’t do anything for her...", [  here's a good place to start. they can help you understand what resources are available to you locally.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jwbd71/73yr_old_mom_recently_diagnosed_with_vascular/,"73yr old mom recently diagnosed with vascular dementia, need help and advice"

"please. please. i think i have dementia. i'm really young, 16 years old. i know it's unheard of for a person at such a young age to get dementia, but hear me out. what if i break the world record? what if i end up being the record breaker for who got dementia the youngest? that sounds incredinly arrogant, but i'm not. i do not want dementia. i do not... please. please. please.when i was young, i would constantly fall and hit my head. now, you may ask, how is that relevant? because i read that there's this thing called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. it's something people who've suffered head injuries get, and it leads to early dementia.and before you say, so what? that doesn't mean anything. fuck fuck fuck fuck i'm scared. please, help. so i've been unable to concentrate since last year. okay, not unable, but it's hard. and it's hard to think coherently. like one time i could be thinking about something, and the next my mind is blank. or maybe i'm asking myself what the hell i was thinming again. like sometimes, my train of thought goes too deep, and when i go back to the premise my mind's blank. and this is just an example, and i'm scared. my mind is blank most of the time. i have to literally force myself to think. it's hard to hold conversations too, but that might be because of anxiety... anyway. i miss the old days where thoughts came naturally. came fluidly. not artificially. not repeated thoughts in place of fruitful conclusions or inferences or links to other topics. i miss those days. now i struggle. it's an internal fucking battle. it's like trying to break through a wall in my head. you know the feeling? oh, and my memory, as in not thought memory if you know what i'm saying but my memory as in what it's generally regarded as. i can't remember shit. when i for example want to fill my water bottle. i would wash it, put it by the sink, and leave, with my water bottle still by the sink— and unfilled. or whenever i'm asked to remember what a person told me and i struggle to remember it. or when i talk to others and i forgot our subject. ok, as i said, that might just be anxiety, but it just screams something deeper. or when. look i can't even remember. what the fuck?????oh and here's a little something. last year, my absolute dumb fuck of a self thought it a good idea to hit myself in the head multiple times because i had the idea that if i did that, maybe i'd be able to be normal again. yeah, that didn't help. it probably even made my condition worse.don't let my wall of text deceive you. the amout of time i took to create this took at least 30 minutes, or even longer. please tell me what is wrong. please say i am wrong. please. i'm too young. i want to have a life. i want a job. i want meaning. i don't want to be a husk, and i don't mean this to offend anyone. please. i'd rather die than be incapacitated. an invalid. please please help. please. i can't express my desperation clearly and urgently enough through text. i hope you don't think i'm trolling. fuck. please don't. please."," idk if this helps at all but generally “early dementia” is more like >40 years old or so. even if hitting your head did damage, it is unlikely that it would present as dementia at 16 years old. it is unlikely you did real damage from the head injuries if you didn’t experience any subsequent dizziness or vertigo. it sounds like you have an anxiety disorder and like you would benefit from therapy. i was diagnosed at 10 or 11 because of hypochondriacal thoughts like the ones you express here. i still have the disorder but i can usually use logic to find my way through the panic (i’m 30). it’ll be okay",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jvtmii/i_need_help/,I need help
" hello everyone!looking for some directly related opinion for something. the company i work for is pitching an app idea to help people that are suffering from alzheimer's. we are pitching a memorization app - an app that can help people remember who they are by using their device’s data - photos, memories, messages or even music - either the family provides the music that the patient used to enjoy or maybe just the music that was very popular doing some important phases of his life. just remind the person to take a short quiz, ask them basic stuff and correlate the data to watch for any progress, notify them from time to time to go through some of the quizes. we were thinking about splitting it into three phases - if the patient is at an earlier phase he gets notified to do them at himself, after the results are not as good, he can do it together with the family or nurse and in the end only someone else can do it for him.we are still at the phase of evaluating the idea but we would love to hear any feedback - would it be useful, would it feel too intrusive, is there something out there already that serves the same purpose, even furhter reading might be more than useful. thank you and take care!"," i would consider not making it like a quiz, but simply an easy to use app for someone with dementia to experience memorable photos, videos, messages, and music. family members and approved friends can add to the data. notifications of new memories and specified times to open the app could be used. my nonprofit currently has users load photos with descriptions onto our web apps. we then create memory books or cards and send to their loved one with dementia free of charge. your idea is  certainly an excellent expansion of that idea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jvtm19/evluate_idea/,Evluate idea
"my stepfather is clearly suffering from severe cognitive impairment.  it started over 10 years ago but it's only become worse and worse.  maybe it's the morphine horse pills he takes for degenerative osteoarthritis combined with the scotch and weed that he knows he's not supposed to combine with it. but he cannot retain information for more than a couple of minutes. he repeats himself endlessly and asks the same questions over and over again. his problem solving abilities are gone. for example, the backyard pool sprung a leak. he planned to refill it with the hose, and then have the lining repaired. he was absolutely confounded by my explanation that he had it backwards: the tear in the lining needed to be repaired before he put more water in, otherwise the water would just leak out again. *everyone* around him notices how bad it's become and comments on it. everyone except the physician's assistant he sees for five minutes at a time, that is. the pa - we'll call him ernest - dismissed my concerns to him out of hand: ""he seems fine to me."" the stepfather is a narcissistic rageaholic, so the chances of him voluntarily going to a neurologist to get screened are nil. we've asked and tried to make an appointment for him. he refuses.  my brother and i are at our wit's end. our mother is really in a bad way right now, and his refusal to take steps to get a handle on his own health is making an already bad situation untenable.any suggestions when the patient is a grade-a a-hole, and his primary care provider isn't much better?"," assuming you're in the us, if it's a pa, he's working under a dr. make an appointment with the dr. or ask for a referral to a different provider.  we had to call ahead and specifically request an exam for dementia (and ask that the pt not be told it was requested, they told her it was  a routine test) just fair warning, even if he gets the diagnosis, that doesn't mean they'll treat him/ he'll accept treatment. you may need to consider what steps you can take without a diagnosis/treatment to make things more manageable for your mom-- assistance at home, caregiver, housekeeper, food prep, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jvtg4p/getting_an_evaluation_when_the_patient_refuses/,Getting an evaluation when the patient refuses and his primary care PA is an idiot?

"in the summer of 2014 my mother was diagnosed with dementia. at that time she was 63 and living with my grandmother in southern california. later that year, my sister and i made the decision to bring her out to colorado to live with me, until her death in spring of 2019. i find myself today, almost 7 years since her diagnosis, at a loss, unable to grasp who she was, or what she really meant to me. i have become completely numb, totally incapable of love. not knowing how to feel things anymore. i’m never particularly happy, never particularly sad. everything is just grey. recent events in my life have finally put large cracks in the dam holding back all the emotions i have been harboring, throughout the years. knowing what i was about to face, writing this story, was always the plan. somehow i knew it’s exactly what i needed to find myself again. this is the sorry about her and what i experienced, as i start to peel back the layers, understanding them and finally taking the time feel them. to begin this story, i must capture the essence of her and the relationship we had. i was born into this world by an extraordinary woman, not only was she a god fearing moral person, she was the person that always protected me. she never deceived me. in times of confusion, she would always steer me down the right path. she was mother, she was my rock! i don’t think i can recall a time she ever yelled at me in anger. don’t get me wrong, i did get yelled at as a kid, no! david was the most common phrase in my house growing up. it was never out of anger tho, only frustration from what i had just done, or was about to do. i was a handful, always into something. turn you head for a second and i was taking something apart, climbing up on the kitchen countertop or being a ham, performing a circus act in the hallway. i was a tornado of discovery, driven by an active imagination, with enough energy to fuel a power plant. how she survived, the trials and tribulations i put her through, i will never know. all that i know is that she did it with grace. she completely knew me, inside and out and had this peaceful way to guide me. i was born with a very strong will, she must have learned early on, the only way to lead me was by example. it was always the why and never the how. what it took for her to always remain loving and clam, in the midst of the chaos, i would create is what makes her the most extraordinary person i have ever known. what it truly feels like to be loved by your mother, is the love you can see on her eyes the second you walk into the room. time completely stops and all you can feel is love she has for you. this is how my mother loved me.i will share more each week as it is written."," the first year. i’ll never forget the moment i decided she was coming to live with me. we were on a family vacation in hawaii and i stopped by her room to check on her. she was washing her contact lenses in the the sink. she already had one in her eye while washing the other vigorously under the running water. looking at me with a puffy red, squinted eye she said, “honey, this really burns”. she was washing the contact lens in the tap water of the sink. she must have been in there for a half hour, repeating the same process. moving her away from the sink, i grabbed a hand towel and ran it under some warm water. calmly placing it over her eyes, i reassured her everything was going to be ok. we then headed to the eye doc for a last minute eye exam. we got her pair of glasses, some pain relief eye drops and were on our way. seeing my mother in panic of pain and her not knowing how to stop it, was the moment reality set in. it was very similar to the “loosing cabin pressure” sene in fight club. that moment i knew it was my job to take over. a week later, she came out to colorado. oh man did my mom love elvis, our vacation in hawaii was epic. we saw a elvis impersonator and she thought he was the real deal. it was like a time warp back to the 60’s for her. singing and dancing the whole time, she couldn’t sit still. after the show she got to meet him, we took some pictures for her and he gave her his scarf. just before we left he gave her a kiss on the cheek. she was completely glowing the rest of the trip. the scarf he gave her was wrapped around her neck or on her wrist the rest of the year. i must have washed that thing a thousand times. i tried to make everything about elvis when we got home. picked up a giant diner statue at a swap meet and tons of vinyl records. elvis was playing regularly around the house this year. there’s a 50’s diner close to my house, where we would have breakfast a couple times a week. she always had the same thing, strawberry french toast with scrambled eggs and a strawberry milkshake. i remember being very ambitious that year, i was on a mission to find a solution that will slow the progression of her disease. we went to doctor after doctor trying to get a solid plan of attack. her insurance was still a california hmo plan the and was nothing but thorn in my side. every doctor had a different opinion and they all seemed scared of their own shadows. they were all unwilling to try alternative medications or treatments i found in europe. after countless visits in multiple practices we found a young doctor willing to try something new. he had a let’s give it a try and see attitude. this was a breath of fresh air and i started to get my hopes up again. two weeks later he left the practice and we couldn’t see him anymore. we had to start all over again, that was a very depressing moment, i started smoking again that day. i was on a job site talking about my mom with a client and she turned me on to a article about peter falk. apparently peter developed early onset dementia after a dental visit and died soon after. knowing my mom suffered from periodontal disease her whole life, i scheduled a dental check up for her the next day. the appointment a the dental office went very well. the staff was amazing, i was able to stay by her side the entire time keeping her calm and making her laugh as a means of being distraction. after a panoramic x-ray, the doctor had a ton of questions. i remember the doctor thinking she had been in a horrific car accident or something. the x-rays looked like a scene from a science fiction horror movie, screws and wires everywhere. my mom had a cosmetic surgery to correct a overbite just a year before. i didn’t know how extensive it really was until that day. they also had her on a daily dose of benadryl for almost a year. with the connections to benadryl and dementia, i found during a previous hunt. i convinced myself, that’s exactly what’s to blame. i told myself this countless times and started to become angry. chain smoking a pack of cigarettes later, i realized i had created a false hope. when that hope was crushed, i just started to blame. after some deep soul searching, i remembered what i was taught growing up. my mother taught me, nothing is to be gained from anger but a battle fueled by rage. the only thing you can hope to accomplish with that mindset is, annihilation. battles are won though compassion and understanding. she would have told me, “life’s a crap shoot, there are no guarantees for anyone, just make the best with what you have and move forward.”she had another had saying, “when the going gets tough, the tough get going.” that i never really grasped it until that moment. my outlook on the situation completely changed and it only became about making the best of it. nobody is to blame, it just is. if she’s happy and safe, that’s all that matters.getting back to this mindset is exactly what i needed to be reminded of today. sometimes life beats me down and i loose site of who i am. mom and i are starting to get a routine going now. it took a couple weeks to figure it out. 7am is breakfast. she likes to have a cheese omelet with a slice of toast most days. i can usually sneak in a protein shake, if she’s hungry enough to eat the whole omelet. the nanny comes at 8:30 to give her a bath and hang out for a couple hours. that usually lasts until 10. i head out to work until 1 and usually come back to mom in her room changing clothes. she’ll put on everything in her closet clean or dirty. it’s very hard to keep track of the clean clothes vs the dirty ones. it’s ok for now i’ll just do laundry every day. she has fun playing dress up. we usually head out to lunch around 2. there’s a local bar/restaurant that know us well. we always sit in the same spot and she always gets the same food grilled cheese and a heineken. we hang out for about 45min while i control the music form an app in my phone. she has no idea i’m doing this and gets surprised every time elvis comes on. we make it back to the house, walk around the half block to see the horses, she calls them the big dogs and finish the day with friends on tv until she’s ready for bed. it’s one of her favorites and will keep her calm if she has a beer in her hand. this routine stays relatively consistent the whole year. i start to notice little bits of her cognitive function disappearing, she looses about 10 words each week. this is pretty hard to watch unfold. conversations started with complete sentences and her, mostly aware of her surroundings. now she just has a few little phrases to describe everything and no idea where she is. i first started to pay close attention to the decline when we were brushing our teeth in the main bathroom together. i handed her a toothbrush with some paste on it. i always make a quick joke. this time it was, now this isn’t for your nose. that one always made her laugh. this time she didn’t, she smeared the paste all over her face. looking at her completely confused, it felt like my heart hit the floor. it took everything i had to keep it together. i called her a silly goose and said, that’s not supposed to go there, as i washed her face with a towel. i was completely overwhelmed by sadness. i smoked a couple cigarettes in the garage and continued on with the day. that was the first year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jvd2mk/mending_the_broken_pieces/,Mending the broken pieces

"hi, i'm new to this group. my grandma was diagnosed with vascular dementia about 5 years ago, but in the last 2 years it has really progressed dramatically. in addition, she broke her left hip 1 year ago, had surgery and made a nearly full recovery in terms of walking and mobility, but this past september broke her right hip after another fall. her recovery from this surgery has made everything significantly worse. she is mostly incontinent now. she used to just have accidents like wetting her depends over night, however she consistently has accidents day and night now. bowel incontinence as well. which inevitably leads to frequent uti's, and when she has a uti she almost always ends up having a few tia episodes. her walking is incredibly shakey, even with a walker, and there are days where she can barely take a few steps. she lives with my mom and i, and we're just getting exhausted. it's so draining, emotionally, physically, and mentally. every morning its a hassle to get her out of bed, changed, cleaned before we go to work. pre-covid, she used to attend an adult day center however obviously they have been closed since march with no signs of reopening soon. so we are going through the nj personal preference program to have a caregiver get paid through her insurance program however they only approved about 30 hours a week for her. weekends are really hard on my mom and i. it's taking a massive toll on my mom and she is 61. i worry about her a lot because of thsi. shes not of the greatest health either, having gotten a terrible 2 month bout of pancreatitis last year, and a repeat attack this past october which lead to her diagnosis being chronic. the worst part is, sometimes, i wish my grandma would just be able to pass away peacefully. she's had such a beautiful life surrounded with so much love, happiness, accomplishments, and amazing memories. she's like a shell of herself now. and i know its making my mom resent her at times. i don't know what i'm looking for in writing this, i guess it's had to vent this out to friends when they don't really understand. and i don't know if it is really feasible for us to put her in a facility. in mexican culture, it's like unheard of, to just drop a loved one off somewhere to live out their days. i also would never want her to feel neglected or abandoned, or not be cared for well. but i also don't know that what we are currently doing now is sustainable or healthy for anyone. our shower is upstairs and its getting harder and harder to get her up the stairs, and it's stressful being responsible for her when she's such a fall risk all the time. anyways. any advice or input is appreciated from people experiencing similar situations. thanks :("," this is a safe place to vent. coming from a similar cultural upbringing, i get that reluctance to put family in a care home but that's what we had to do. my stepdad burnt him self out taking care of my mom and suffered for it. she needed 24/7 monitoring and could not pass the tests for self sufficient care. i encourage you to make sure you have a plan to transition your grandma because if you lose your mom you're gonna need professional 24/7 care for your grandma at some point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/junu9w/86_year_old_grandma_with_vascular_dementia_my_mom/,"86 year old grandma with vascular dementia, my mom and I are reaching our wits end. :("

"i've posted recently but i need someplace to vent about this week.  my sister is our mothers primary care giver. she needed to fly out to seattle and help her boyfriend load up a uhaul with their stuff and he is moving in with her and mom. i live a state away and have been working from home so it made sense for me to bring my home office to moms and stay the week while my sister was gone.  it has been so fucking stressful. first, we thought mom had a stroke (we being me and my sisters best friend who used to work taking care of ill inmates at a prison) so we called 911. half her face was slack when she got up from her nap and she wouldn't raise her right arm. thankfully it wasn't a stroke and she seemed fine by the time the ambulance arrived.  then i noticed mom had a very large wound in her elbow. the next day i could see into her arm! the hole was all the way in and i could see under her skin and see her elbow bone! we called 911 again. they came and got her and the er just sent her back home with the same f'n bandage we sent her with and an antibiotic she has to take every 12 hours and has to sit up for 30 minutes after taking it and drink lots of water. i struggle to get water into this woman and she sleeps so much!  my sisters friend isn't able to help me as much as she did the first few days. i am not used to seeing mom this far gone because i only come up once a month and she is worse each time i come. i feel alone and overwhelmed. i haven't showered this week at all, forget to eat and my legs hurt from all the running back and forth in the house. and all this while trying to work a full time job from 8-5 mon-fri that is high demand and i have 9 hour long conference calls that i am hosting and the primary speaker on.  i'm struggling so hard. i really hope i can get a shower tonight. i did make myself eat something today at least.  my sister was supposed to be home today but because of poor planning on her part, she didn't even leave washington until today and has a 30+ hour drive to oklahoma. i've already requested monday off work so i can recharge from this experience.  i don't expect anything from this post. i really just needed to vent about the situation. i've cried more this week than i have in years. i have mad respect for you all who care for your loved ones full time and for my sister who is always here with mom.  it hurts to see my mom this far gone. :("," i hope things are better today and that you are able to make the best of your recharge day.  it sounds like you did a fine job for your mom given an impossible situation!  luckily this is a short term arrangement. the suggestions from other people here seem helpful  for the rest of your time in this role. your post makes me feel a bit better about my own impossible sitn of my father having to go into a home (as pushed by doctors) where more than just one person can help him - esp as he is combative (hits), is confused, falls, doesn't want to eat, shower and has serious health issues etc. with a full-time job and me being on my own i think it wouldn't be feasible more more than a day or two.  i am still struggling with that decision a lot but seeing how bad it can be for a person to handle it on their own... :(in any case- just sending a hug your way and i'm really glad that your sister and you have come up with the arrangement you described so your mom can be in her home longer etc. be well!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jt0egi/this_week_has_been_awful/,This week has been awful

"i'm sort of just looking for a place to vent. it's been a few years since my father was originally diagnosed with dementia. originally they diagnosed him with depression, as that can have memory effects and he definitely was depressed. he's 65 and was in the navy in the mid 1970s, working in the engine room of an aircraft carrier. then went on to be a mechanic for automobiles. we think some of this exposure to chemicals/fumes, as well as head injuries is possibly part of what could have caused the dementia to come on so strongly at such a young age. (his father did have dementia, so it possibly is genetic; we could not afford the testing to find out if it is, so we don't really know.)the reason my mother (his caregiver) made the decision to bring him somewhere he could get professional care is she has to work (obviously) and they live out in a very rural area on a mountain in the forest. it isn't necessarily safe for him to be alone in that environment. near the end she would find him just standing outside in the backyard staring at seemingly nothing. he's moved in now to a home specializing in dementia at an advanced stage, and is apparently settling in pretty well. unfortunately, because of covid, we have been unable to see him since my mother first dropped him off at the va hospital. my mother and eldest sister are having a short window visit with him on friday, and i'm hoping to be able to video chat in and at least talk to him. the last time i got to see him was in july. my sister had a small wedding ceremony with just family. (all outside, masks worn, about 20people max). i want to be able to see him in person, but i'm afraid of crying in front of him. i don't want him to feel bad, or get upset. but also, i can't help but feel that it's so unfair. i'm only 24, and my father of 65 is in a home for dementia. it's not fair for him. it's not fair for my mother. my sisters. my nieces and nephews. and i'm more upset at the fact that the united states likes to show face that they love and care about veterans, but when it really comes down to it, they still get the shit end. even with va benefits this home is a little over $100 a day. his social security check covers it thankfully, but only leaves a small amount left over. hes getting excellent care there which is what we want, but it's so expensive. and now my mom is having a hard time with insurance and all that stuff, because he technically still ""lives"" with her, so they ""make too much"" for certain benefits. i'm angry, and bitter, but mostly i just miss my dad."," i'm so sorry you're family is going through this. i don't have anything else to share, but to agree that our veterans and their families are not given the support they need and deserve. i am 32 years old and my brother is 27. my dad just turned 69.  we were just told today that my dad has dementia (still early stages though), and my mom is considering retiring early to care for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jsk5op/my_father_65_was_recently_placed_in_a_home_for/,"My father, 65, was recently placed in a home for advanced dementia."

"my dad has early onset dementia, he’s 65 and has had it for probably about 8 years and i would say he’s been in various treatment and diagnosis of sorts for about 5 years but only got a dementia “diagnosis” two years ago (it was like pulling teeth to get it from the doctor, he didn’t want to make anything official for some reason? but we needed it for disability plus to get his license taken away). we initially thought it was alcohol induced dementia but now we don’t because he hasn’t had alcohol in about two years and no improvement. the doctor still has never given a diagnosis, like alzheimer’s or anything. now he says my dad is past the point where he can get a four  hour test to actually determine what he might have. he says it doesn’t matter because the treatment will be the same. is this normal? i do want to know partially for treatment reasons but also partially because selfishly i want to know if it might be a type my brother and i are more likely to get. my grandfather also had early onset dementia and we think they said it was alzheimer’s but  everyone in my family who was involved with that has passed away."," this is normal. many types of dementia present with very similar symptoms and without spending a lot of time and doing a lot of background history regarding progression and specific behaviors, neurologists have a difficult time nailing down specific types of dementia. with my wife, i gave our neurologist as much detail as possible regarding progression and specific behaviors. i did my own research and concluded that my wife probably has frontal/temporal dementia. her neurologist agreed that it was probably likely, but there wasn't a test that could actually confirm it.  her brain scans were inconclusive as to the type of dementia. dementia is a very broad, catch-all term that generally describes any type of degenerative cognitive function that isn't a result of some type of traumatic injury or other disease process. alzheimer's is a broad term, as well and according to our neurologist, frontal temporal dementia (ftd) fits into the broader category of alzheimer's, which fits into the broader category of dementia.the best thing i can suggest is to research yourself and see if you can see if it fits into any of the sub-types of dementia then ask your doctor if it seems likely that's what you are dealing with. then see if you can get a diagnosis for the purposes of disability. even if he will give you a broad diagnosis, as long as it will work for disability, that may be all you need.

"are you the family caregiver of a loved one with dementia? the university of pennsylvania is leading a free, virtual research study that may help you cope with the difficulties of caregiving.the study features an intervention called pisces that helps caregivers solve problems. the goal of the study is to understand if the pisces intervention decreases anxiety and improves quality of life among family caregivers of patients with serious illness. no in-person meetings are required.who are we recruiting? family caregivers of patients with dementia who are 18 years of age or older (e.g., family or partner caregiver).what is involved in participating? the intervention involves three online/phone sessions. each session lasts 30-40 minutes and is scheduled around participant availability. a member of the study team will discuss principles of problem-solving therapy and practical ways to improve coping skills based on each participant’s needs. where do sessions occur? the three sessions are conducted online (videoconferencing). there are no in-person meetings.to learn more or to sign up for the free intervention:email: [pisces@nursing.upenn.edu](mailto:pisces@nursing.upenn.edu)"," a caregiver’s job can be rewarding, but it can also be overwhelming at times. caring for someone with alzheimer’s or dementia needs time and constant effort.     while caregivers provide the best care to their elderly, they often undergo a series of emotions. they may feel frustrated, angry, or lonely, which is a sign of over-burden. thus, caregivers should care for themselves as they care for their beloved elderly.     if you as a caregiver are experiencing a toll on your physical and mental health, here are some tips to get you started:    1. cope with communication changes by being patient and aware of your body language. make sure to maintain respect and speak slowly & clearly. avoid questions that challenge short-term memory as these can humiliate the patient.   2. make sure you take time for self-reflection by keeping a daily journal, counting your blessings, and valuing the possible.  3. always ask for help when you need it. you can reach out to friends, family members, or social support services for additional care needs.   4. make sure to consume nutritious food to stay healthy, active, and live longer.   5. join an online or in-person caregiver support group. meeting other caregivers may give you a chance to share stories and ideas, which may keep you from experiencing isolation.   6. take breaks each day and try to relax by making tea or talking to a friend.   7. spend ample time with friends and family and try to keep up with your hobbies.   8. make time for regular exercise as often as you can. you may also indulge in yoga or a short walk.     it is pretty easy to fall into the trap of neglecting your welfare while focusing diligently on your loved one’s needs throughout the progression of their dementia. if you aren’t getting the physical or emotional support you require, know that you won’t be able to provide the elderly with the best level of care.     after all, chances are excellent for you to be overwhelmed on your own and suffer burnout.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jrwsh2/coping_intervention_for_family_caregivers_of/,Coping intervention for family caregivers of patients with dementia

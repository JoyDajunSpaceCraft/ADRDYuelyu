"i'm 26 yo and my mom is 56 with ftd/alzheimer's. ever since she's been diagnosed last november, i've been frozen in action. i'm just now starting to take care of her finances and i feel like a total failure. i'm allowing accounts to go into a negative balance because i can't bring myself to switch her autopay. i can't talk to her on the phone (but i can text) because i've been working through some sexual and emotional abuse she did. i recently got medication for adhd, and that's helping a little, but i feel that i can't juggle her affairs, my processing of my childhood/mental health, and my own fumbling life. she only has myself and my brother, but i also can't really get my brother to help. am i just an inflexible, bitter person who can't move forward? i don't think it's wallowing when i want to move on and just can't figure out how. thank you for reading, i'm having a particularly down day (which i'm sure is coloring this post) and it helps to reach out."," hi, i actually have some exposure to the ftd group,  find a support group. feel free to pm me. you are doing the best you can. you're not a failure.

"we've ran out of ideas how to keep him out of trouble. he's constantly fiddling with things and making messes. there's just so many problems even though we're watching him 24/7 in shifts he's still somehow causing more headaches for us when we turn around for one second. two things that we really need help with right now:we need a way to keep him upstairs/'in his area' at night. he doesn't sleep, only takes a few shorts naps during the day but we need sleep so we need to make sure he can't do anything to harm himself. the current set-up is baby gate at the top of the stairs and a second gate we made out of ropes to keep him in his room and bathroom area. he's figured out the ropes twice and it's only a matter of time until he figures out the baby gate.the second and more important problem is that he doesn't want to go to the bathroom. he doesn't leak, which would be way easier to deal with, but sometimes he refuses to pee/poop. he goes to the bathroom and goes through the motions but nothing actually comes out. he gets really aggressive when this happens. he's already been admitted to the hospital for not knowing how to go to the bathroom but they discharged him to an inadequate care home forcing us to take him home with us.thank you to anyone who has any advice and then writing this was very cathartic."," does your grandpa wear underpants or does he wear incontinence pants? we found putting my grandpa in 'adult nappies' or 'adult diapers' was the easiest way to combat this. that way he could go to the toilet as he pleased, when he pleased without any 'issues'. by removing the 'having to take him to the bathroom and help him go to the toilet' side of things it made the whole process a lot less stressful but everybody is different. aside from that, we took him to the doctor who gave him medication to help his bowels move along to 'make' him go to the toilet. again, this worked alongside swapping his underpants for incontinence pants and just letting him 'go' when and where he felt like it. we also got a[ commode]( so he could sit on it, and watch tv in his room whilst going to the toilet for as long as he wants on his own and shout us when he is done/us check in on him when we think he's done. the commode was probably our saviour as it really de-stressed him and he 'forgot' he was going to the toilet so was less tense and just went. hope this might help. we found the best way to get my grandpa to 'stay' in his room at night so people can sleep when he isn't was to work out what it is he is trying to 'find' and to try and 'fill' that need for him. i'll put some examples/things that worked with my grandpa below, they may or may not be of use to you. so if he is lonely then maybe getting a[ radio]( and having it playing may help him feel less lonely. you can get [easy one button old style play radios]( that are still [digital]( so work in this day but look more like they relate to him. you can load up a usb with his favourite sort of music or radio shows, or even recordings of you guys talking for him to sit and listen to? did your grandpa ever have any animals? you can buy [companion animals ]( are just soft lap toys that look like a dog or cat (you can even get the breed specific ones). if it's that he needs his hands occupying, he can sit and listen to his radio or watch his tv whilst stroking his animal. this worked wonders with my grandpa. if it's that he is trying to work his tv but struggles and so wanders off and gets bored you can re-programme his remote controls to a simpler, easier remotes. this was happening to us. my grandad would happily watch tv but couldn't use the two tv remotes anymore, i finally found a[ simple remote control]( that would let me programme into the other two. it now means he can work the tv himself, so he sits and flicks through all the channels and stuff easily. depending on what his interests are, you can maybe try looking at the [easy wordsearch type ]( stuff they have on these sorts of websites or the [simple jigsaws]( and [board games]( yes, he won't actually be playing them, doing them or completing them and you'll be spending your morning picking up pieces off the floor but anything to try and keep him occupied is worth a shot. they've got [big cards]( if he played cards. he could just sit and shuffle them if he likes to keep his hands occupied. they also have some [old print newspapers ]( my grandad loves, even though he can't read anymore. he will sit and 'read' the paper at night, which will keep him occupied. if it turns out that the main reason he goes wandering is because he thinks he's on his own and is lost/unsure of who is in the house we brought a baby monitor [(similar to this one)]( so, the camera is in his room and then the monitor is in my room. if i hear him wandering, or he calls out for me, it wakes me up, as it comes through the monitor, i click on the 'microphone' on the monitor and say 'yes, grandpa?' and see what he wants. if it's just to check he's not alone i can usually quickly reassure him from my bedroom and quickly go back to sleep, however if he needs assistance i can get up. it also means i can check on him, if i wake up in the night too. i also got an alarm mat (i can't find the specific one i got but [here is a similar one]( which sets off an alarm anytime he steps onto it. this would wake me up anytime he stepped foot onto the mat. so depending on if he was in bed, i'd put the mat at the foot of his bed, or if he was staying awake for the night i'd put it at the foot of his doorway so that if he did try to leave the alarm box would sound (placed next to my head in my bedroom) and wake me up. i appreciate all of these solutions involve having money, which isn't helpful depending on your situation but as i'm from the uk we did get some funding help from the government. i hope the links are slightly helpful, i think the 'unforgettable' website we used is a uk website but hopefully the products on there are available worldwide if you google them or you can find similar if you think any of them will be useful.  but i would definitely suggest trying to work out the why behind is wandering, is it because of boredom, is it because he's lost, is it because he's lonely or is it because of fear, then try and tackle that :) keep me updated and let me know how you get on. i'll happily answer any questions too, we're all in this together.

"i love my grandma so much, i spent my childhood with her. she is like my hero.  she got on her knees in front of my mom and begged her to stop hitting me. i have vivid memories of her crying every single time i had to go home from our visits. ever since she was forced to live in a seniors home 6 years ago, her case of dementia has gotten worse, she's been constantly  sad and would not recognize aanyone. out of everyone in the family, she would remember me. only me. i took a lot of pride in this as i would visit her everyday in the summer. and now because of work, i've been visiting her once a week. today i came and asked her if she remembered me and she couldn't recall my name. it really fucking hurts. i know i shouldn't be taking this personally but i just miss her. so much. dementia has taken her personality away and she doesn't speak much as all now. please cherish your time with your elder loved ones. i feel guilty every time i tell her i'm leaving. even if she didn't remmeber my name, her love of still there. i hate leaving her behind at the seniors home. i want her back home :-( i want her back :-(((("," bless your heart, sweetie....as a grandmother myself, i wish i could give you a big hug. i know you are so sad. it's good to keep on sharing with people how you feel and what this is like for you. also, seek out a caregiver support group or dementia support group and go. it really will help.

"i am the sole caretaker for my father who is 88. he was hospitalized on sunday after a fall. he was transferred from the hospital to skilled rehab on tuesday night. his mental condition has gone downhill ever since monday and i’m beyond overwhelmed and looking for advice!he has been showing early signs of dementia for the past few months. on a monday night at the hospital, he got very confused, began pulling all of his wires off and got mean/violent. he had to be sedated, and didn’t remember 90% of what happened by tuesday morning. he was transferred to rehab late that night.when i arrived at the rehab facility this morning, he was very confused and angry, but after about an hour we convinced him it wasn’t a nursing home, it was temporary, and he agreed to stay. i do have poa so he was staying regardless, but it always makes me feel better to have him on board. i left for about two hours to pick up his clothes, books, and snacks from home. when i returned, he was a totally different person. he had no idea what planet he was on, he thought he was in hell, the nurses were witches, and when i took their side he declared they had gotten to me and i was now a demon. mind you my dad has never been religious in any way. he got agitated even more at this point, got out of his room, tried to pull the fire alarm, and tried to make an escape. it took four nurses, myself, and the best nurse practitioner i’ve ever met to get him calm, seated, and sedated. the doctor said it could take up to a week for him to be fully “with it” as dementia and going from home to hospital to rehab don’t play well together. i’m debating whether i should continue to stay with him for the majority of the day or keep my distance for a day or two. when i’m not there, he asks for me constantly. when i’m there, he seems to think i’m going to take him home and so every time he sees me, it begins another episode of freaking out. they weren’t able to do any therapy yesterday due to his emotional state. am i doing him more harm by being there?? any advice would be helpful! i would do anything for him; he’s given me everything my whole life, sacrificed his retirement to raise me (adopted me when he was 60) and he deserves the best treatment in the world; i just don’t know how to give that to him and don’t want to fail him."," cna with lots of memory care/dementia experience here. ask his nurses/cnas. probably cnas because they spend more time with him as of now. “what do you notice about my dad’s behavior when i’m here vs when i leave?” there are times when having someone who is familiar is extremely important for the patient and it helps keep them grounded a bit and gives them motivation to get better, even though it can be hard on the family member. then there are other times when that family member is the one causing the issues or at least is making them worse. there are many factors to consider like his personality, yours, how progressed the dementia is and like you were told, moving back and forth/unfamiliar environments/medical issues like falls... etc. you said when you come he thinks you’re going to take him home and he freaks out. is freaking out actually freaking out or him just becoming upset? is he able to be distracted? with dementia agitation/anxiety, one of the best ways to calm it is redirection. i’d go ahead and validate is concerns, keep explaining to him that he’s only there until he is better. then quickly change the subject to something that interests him, or even make up a big lie. say something like “did you hear about such and such happening?” or bring in a family photo album and insist he looks at it with you. say there’s an important picture you wanted to ask him about. anything you know might get him to forget about what he’s worrying about. try to stay away from complex things though. just ask around within his caretakers and see what they say. i’d talk to more than one person if possible. cnas and nurses and doctors are not always on the same page with behaviors. in my experience though, unless the family member is saying a bunch of complex stuff to the patient and making them more confused, getting noticeably frustrated with the patient, or there wasn’t a good relationship to begin with, that patient will generally do better with all the love and support they can get. we have to go into their worlds now, as they cannot come back to ours. i wish you both the very best 💜",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/902rlc/am_i_helping_or_hurting/,Am I helping or hurting?
"hey everyone, my father has dementia and is a wanderer; he hates being cooped up at home and my mother (who is his primary caretaker) used to try and stop him, but has since realized that he is much happier and calmer if she lets him leave and return whenever he likes. of course, we know that this can't go on forever as the disease progresses but we want him to have his freedom while he is still able to remember his way home.they live in a colder climate area, though - so wintertime is an issue and we're worried that he might get stranded somewhere or for the inevitable event that he forgets his way home. so, i've been looking at some gps watches for him to wear so that we can check in on him. we think this is a good fit for him since he loves watches (sometimes he wears 3 at a time!) and they aren't as bulky or ugly as some of the other tracking devices. plus, there are some that you can ""lock"" so that they are not removable.i'm looking for any advice or suggestions as we decide on a hardware and service. i'm eyeing two brands right now and i'm hoping that some people on this sub might have some first hand experience with either one.theoraconnect - they are taking preorders on this now, but maybe someone has beta tested this and has some thoughts on how well it works?

"hi. this is a difficult post (but i assume someone out there can relate).i can't really remember when it started because i was studying in a different place, 4 hours away from my town. i just know that, one day, when i came to spend the weekend, my grandpa kept asking who i was. my mom told me he was starting to do this with my older brother as well (he also lives in a different place). then, it was my younger sister, who still lives at home. then my dad, his son in law. now, it's starting to be my mom, his only daughter.my parents try their best to take care of him. my mom helps him with everything he needs and she accepted his state before anyone - she was the one to take the car away from my grandpa despite his protests, for example. and now that his problems are worse - he forgets his pills, he tries to leave the house and gets lost, incontinence, and others - she is tired. and i feel like i can't help.i'm on vacation now and i stay home a lot of the time. i check up on him once in a while and help him with things he needs. i remind him to take his pills. i answer all of his questions. i check to see if he hasn't left the property (just a few weeks ago he started walking randomly around town and fell down. it's a small place so people helped him and got him to my parents, but it was still scary). i also help with my little sister and our small family business. i'm trying to get my masters next year and also a job so that i can support them in another way.but it doesn't feel like it's enough. we're all tired. but i wish i could do more. it feels like he's so down, at his end, but the end never comes. and i'm just stuck with feeling useless.my grandpa is gone (it's a hard way to put it but that's how it feels) and my family is struggling. and it's not his fault. but it gets difficult and i don't know how to make it better.thank you so much for reading. you're all wonderful and very strong.", the best thing you can do to help your grandpa is to help your mom.  since she seems to be the main one caring for his needs - do what you can to remove stress from her.  take her to a movie or send her meal kits - anything that removes burden from her or makes her feel appreciated.  the best thing for your grandpa is to have a happy person looking after him and trying to understand his needs.  your mom's role is pretty much thankless and comes from her heart.  look after her.  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8ztz9q/i_wish_i_could_help_more/,I wish I could help more
"mom has dementia at age 72, which seems really early for our family history -- everybody else was very lucid until they died and lived into their 90s, but we don't know the genetic or health history of her biological father -- so i'm a bit concerned.i'm tempted to do something like 23 and me for both her and myself -- mainly because it is the one i've heard the most about.is there another i should consider in terms of breadth of information or how transparent everything is? if i use them, am i locked into their service if i want more detail on something?"," 23 and me will tell you about the apoe genes you might have. this effects your chances of getting alzheimer's in your later years. it is important to note that even people who get apoe4/apoe4 (the worst combo) do not 100% develop alzheimer's. it looks like that for alzheimer's that develops in later years, there are many genes that effect the condition.also note: 23 and me does not test your whole genome. that means that the genes that might effect if you get alz or not might not even be tested. we flat out do not know all the genes that effect the outcome. in fact, damage to the brain due to the disease is not 100% correlated with symptoms. the religious order study of dementia patients shows that there were people with significant damage to the brain that were functioning normally, or close to normally at their death, and the disease was discovered afterwards. 23 and me is not a diagnosis website, so anything you find there would have to be followed up with your doctor and professional testing at a facility that was rated for this sort of thing. 23 and me seems to be the best if you are interested in health, but the genetic testing companies all test slightly different sites. if you have an interest in a distinct area, you should shop around ahead of time.you can take the test and then look up genes that are an interest to you individually on 23 or me, or you can crowdsource some of the knowledge and take the info from 23 and me and put it into promethease. both the 23 and me and promethease subs have more info on this. i'll be honest, this is what i did. it had no answers for me, as we have no idea what genes to even look for.i did this when the disease first appeared in a first degree family member at age 48. it then seemed to start popping up all over, but maybe that was just because we have a large family tree. the doctor told us that young onset is more likely to be strongly genetic (and even then it can be dominant autosomal or sporadic inheritance). the doctor flat out told us genetic testing for the young and healthy was not recommended, and that testing would only be recommended if there was a clear pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance. and even then, strongly discouraged.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8zo0rc/mom_has_dementia_drs_arent_sure_if_it_is/,"Mom has dementia, DRs aren't sure if it is Alzheimers, but I'm considering doing a test like 23 and me for both her and myself to get more genetic info on us both.

"so, the question is “how to go about getting a person into assisted living who absolutely does not want to go there?”short backstory is my sister, 84, has been diagnosed with fronto temporal dementia. she can still cover her adl needs but not any executive planning or thinking. she has given me fpoa and mpoa to my other sister. she currently lives alone in a condo. while i will prolong her independence while i can, it seems like in 6 to 18 months, my sister will need more than the once or twice weekly visit from the professional caregivers which is currently in place. she doesn’t want any “help” as she can do things by herself. not true, but i have learned arguing, reasoning and explaining are generally a waste of effort, particularly on this subject. any thoughts??", could you try “we can do this in a planned manner now and you will have control over where you go. or you can wait until there is a crisis and the hospital discharges you into the first available spot no matter how you feel about it”,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8zehf6/resistant_to_change/,Resistant to change
"there are funny moments with the disease.my family member with dementia was attempting to make dinner (heavily supervised), and then decided that the floor was too dirty as he had gotten some balsamic vinegar on the floor. we offered him some lysol wipes to clean it up as he had been marinating some meat. no, no, no, that would never do! could this wait until after dinner was done? no! all of the floors in the house will be dirty by then!so, the whole process had to stop as he had to find a mop and a bucket. when he was informed there was no bucket, he was baffled. we told him to use the sink instead. he proceeds to search for a bucket in the backyard. finding none, he reluctantly uses the sink. he gets the mop wet once, and then mops the whole floor with it. we coached him on rinsing the mop. he redoes the kitchen, but now the floor is soaked. time to dry the floor. he pulls up a chair to watch the floor dry. we tell him he could grab a towel and dry the floor. not good enough, this requires fans. he walks past two fans in an adjacent room to collect a fan from upstairs. he collects a couple of extension cords from the garage and turns on all of the fans. two of the fans are 15 feet from the kitchen floor. he sits back and watches the floor dry. then he starts complaining that he always has to clean (this is probably the 2nd time in 20 years he has mopped something) and that if he has just been allowed to mop up the spill with wipes, this whole process would have been so much simpler. but we had yelled at him and told him no. floor is dry, now it is time to sweep it. we need to sweep it, put the dirt into the kitchen trashcan, and take the whole trashcan, not just the bag, out to the trash. we have some difficulties emptying the trashcan and taking it back. this is another sign of my irresponsibility. the trash can is smelly, clearly, i am emptying trash directly into the trashcan and not using a bag. i have no respect.now i am being scolded that my pet raccoon has been shredding the hammock's pillow, and i have made a mess of the whole backyard. just look at it, there is stuffing all over the place. and i am encouraging the raccoon because somehow i find the situation funny. when will i start taking responsibility for wildlife?!?!?! i show no respect, no respect at all.somehow, i get the feeling that dinner is going to take a while."," i hear petsmart has a deal on beginner obedience training, maybe you should take your pet raccoon there. after you have a glass wine, that dinner sounds exhausting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8z6ubo/funny_and_frustrating_moment/,Funny and Frustrating Moment
"reddit's always been a great place for me to lurk and find reassurance so when i saw this place, i'm hoping i can find an answer, or at least some reassurance on what to do.my mom is in her late 60s and a few years ago started to show a significant change in memory function. she was having issues with short term stuff. she is and always was extremely independent and blunt (undiagnosed, and yes i understand i am not a psychologist, so take it with a grain of salt please borderline personality disorder)she was fired from her job, went on unemployment, then disability and finally retirement. memory wise she just seemed to decline.currently she constantly talks about old stories from when she was working or growing up. i'm not trying to exxagerate but if she's watching tv or seems something when i'm driving she's got some story about how x happened to a coworker or y happened to her sister.she has practically no short term memory and constantly asks the same question over and over.  for example if she doesn't see my younger brother she asks if he's at work (he has two jobs) and then later on she'll ask again.  the last doctor appointment she went to, my father was supposed to go in the room with her.  the nurse said oh we're just taking vitals.  mom didn't know what to do and came out with no idea of what they did. dad ended up checking the paperwork and finding out she was given 2 vaccines and told to get lab work done.in nov 2017 i got a referall to a neurologist for mom. he told her to keep taking aricept (minimum dose) but didn't give me a diagnosis or any suggestions.they have since switched back to kaiser and i was able to have her refered back to neuro. the visit did not go well and is why i'm lost.doc was extremely blunt, asked me what i ""thought"" the issue was with her. wouldn't let me speak with him without mom present (that was extremely nice, trying to explain how her mind has deteriorated over the last couple years while she's sitting there listening and starting to cry)he did a few tests, and that standard mini mental test where she had a breakdown and started to cry because of how his was pressuring her. if he had let me speak to him he would have been able to understand she has an undiagnosed learning disability (bad childhood abuse and neglect) and she does have some underlying angry and emotional issues.his diagnosis is that we're completely wrong, she doesn't have dementia or anything but depression and anxiety  and needs intensive counseling. i and my dad are baffled. we live and love her. we know this isn't forgetfulness and resentment because we don't let her drive.  he told us to feel free to stop the aricept and that her pcp will give a referral to pysch. right now my plan is to stop the aricept as told and try the therapy with her. but does this make sense? should i try to get a second opinion?is all this just because dad and i started trying to pick up the pieces after she lost her job?  dad does all the cooking and i do all the driving. i love my mom so much. the changes i've seen are killing me. she used to be the closest thing to a best friend i had. i don't have much of a support system outside of dad, so any advice or suggestions on resources would be helpful. for location reference i am in southern california,  specifically la county. if this kind of topic isn't allowed i do apologize, just kind of in a daze right now.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8z2vh8/not_dementia_afterall/,Not Dementia Afterall?

"so some back story. my stepdad is 82 and may have lymphoma. he and my mom are in the middle of figuring that out with the doctors. he's been steadily losing weight and energy for a few months now. my mom called me on monday morning in tears saying she was at her wits end trying to support him alone at home. they live a 45 minute drive out of the city and neither my wife or i drive. after she called i left work and arranged a ride out asap. that night we brought him to the hospital to see if they could get some fluids into him as he was pretty dehydrated.he has been having what my mom and i call ""foggy spots"" for about two months. on tuesday at home he didn't recognize me for a few minutes. it's heart breaking the first time it happens as i'm sure you all know.yesterday they had an appointment with a specialist to set up a biopsy. while there the doctor asked my mom how she was doing. after some tears and more discussion it was decided by everyone that the best course of action was to get my stepdad into the hospital for a few days to get some nutrients and fluids into him to help him get his strength up. it was also a good opportunity for my mom to recharge and set up some home support so she can be a little less stressed when i can't be around.everything was looking like it was going well. i came home this afternoon. i got a call from my mom around 7 letting me know that my stepdad was extremely agitated and didn't know where he was. he was telling at nurses and they moved him to a private room and gave him something to help him sleep.i'm honestly not sure ewhat i'm asking here. i'm just venting and trying to get everything out and this seemed like a place to start. this is all frightening. it feels like even if he survives the suspected lymphoma i've already lost the man who has been my father and raised me for over half my life.that's all i have. i'm sorry if i've broken any rules for the sub. also, this was typed on my. phone so please excuse any grammatical errors or random comas."," give the alzheimer's association a call. 800-272-3900. 24/7. there have been some people who have gotten some good advice about resources from them.also your county's senior services department. of course, their usefulness or even existence can vary widely. we're lucky where we are.

"my dad’s got vascular dementia. we think it was building up for a while but we never noticed, we put the problems he was having down to “normal” aging. he had a massive stroke in march and that accelerated his symptoms. we had to move him into assisted living to make sure he gets the round the clock care he needs now. the staff there are amazing, so dedicated and caring. my dad really liked them and couldn’t stop complimenting them. however, he has recently taken a drastic turn for the worst, and on to another stage of dementia. (his nurse says he’s in stage 5) this new stage has brought with it bouts of violence and racism against this wonderful staff. it is so upsetting because not only does no one deserve to be treated like that but it is also so polar to my dad’s core beliefs. he would never hit a woman, he was much more likely to beat up the man who did. he has also never been racist. to the contrary, he worked tirelessly to provide vaccinations for african children living in the slums. he even visited the slums to interact with the children being vaccinated and with the medical team dispensing the vaccinations. on top of that my husband is african american so of course, our children are mixed race. it’s so heartbreaking to see my dad become something that is so far from who he really is. i’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this with their loved ones adopting terrible beliefs and violence. this is not my dad. i hate what this horrible illness is doing to him. i’m sorry this is a bit long, i’m very upset."," my father went through the same thing. in life he was jovial and friendly, one might even describe him as a “flirt” towards almost any woman and always the life of the party. he grew up in tough neighborhoods and was always very accepting of people’s differences, but as the illness took hold he began to physically and verbally lash out at the nurses and care givers. just keep in mind “it’s the disease” not your loved one. the staff at his nursing home constantly reminded me of this as i apologized profusely for the tirade of obscenities that would spew forth. i’m typing this as i sit next to his hospice bed. he’s now unable to speak, walk, eat, or perform any basic function of a healthy individual. he opened his eyes today and looked right at me. although he didn’t say a word or give any indication he knew me or his surroundings it’s somehow comforting to have him look in my eyes. my point is merely this. the moments you may have left will be fewer and further between, and the people caring for our loved ones understand the realities of this terrible disease as they see it every day. try not to get hung up on the deviation from our implied social normalcy, and take solace in the brief moments of recognition that will happen between you. they are fleeting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8y5ixx/radical_change_in_beliefs/,Radical change in beliefs

"my dad has had good bouts and bad bouts for several years-  its gotten so bad that he was put in a psych ward a few years ago after swinging on a nurse.  he has walked naked down an independent living hallhere's my issue.  he deny's all of it and blames my mom who has passed on a large conspiracy that i am carrying on.  he has always been a ""big shot"" and quite frankly with out getting into to much detail a liar at a lot of parts of his life.  when he is ""good"" he will constantly make up stories and inflate occurrence's- he refuses to admit he has any issues and wants to live on his own and drive.  he absolutely cannot and has been told by 3 doctors.i recently moved him to sc from illinois where he lived his whole life- hes in a very nice assisted living unit here.  he hates it and presses a lot of guilt on me that he is lonely and not how he wants to live his life.   i admit i have some underlying issues from the past when he lies and blames everyone else for his problems.  things like the nurses are making him stand on a circle in his room at six am (hes in a wheelchair) and they either wont shower him or will have six people throw him in the shower.  is this common behavior?i try not to have this roll over- but it seems like every time i see him its all negative, i leave feeling like i took his life from him.  i have a business and a wife and 2 little kids.  has anyone else dealt with a personality like this- i'm only a few months into this and the only child.  family aside from me is basically passed or to far removed to be interested in helping.thank you in advance for any help or places i could look to."," it's not uncommon. i have 2 sisters, and i'm in the middle. i've always been closer to my mom than my sisters, and for lack of a better term, was always her favorite. so, imagine my shock when, a few weeks ago, she told me ""well, i used to have 3 daughters, but now i only have 2."" i had been called to her nursing home because she was in an aggressive psychotic state, apparently brought on by the nurse wanting to check her blood sugar (she's been diabetic for years, this is not some new procedure they were forcing on her).  what brought on this sad sentiment was me telling her that she needed to let them take a drop of blood so they knew how much insulin she needed. i've been ""un-daughtered"" 6 times since then, for various offenses.my point is, your dad is not going to come to grips with his situation. he doesn't understand what having dementia means, and if you waste your breath explaining it to him, he'll just deny it, or become legitimately very depressed . your dad is manipulating you, and guilt is his chosen vehicle. believe me, the staff at his facility are not letting him sit alone in his room, stewing in his boredom. most places have an activities director, and it is their job to have activities for the residents and to ensure that no one is left out. talk to the staff. visit frequently. develop a relationship with them.  i've discovered that patients with frequent visitors usually receive a lot of attention.most of all, set boundaries with him. tell him that you will visit frequently,  but that you will not allow him to be mad at you for not giving him what he wants. that you are doing what is best for him, whether he realizes it or not, and that if he wants to treat you badly, you will leave. *and then do it.* follow through is important  you'll have to have this conversation often, so get used to it.  some of your visits will only be 5 minutes, but some will be as long as either of you is awake.once you get accustomed to the fact that you now have a 3-year-old in an adult man's body, it gets easier to figure what works and what doesn't. editing to add, find an alzheimer's support group. your local hospital should be able to direct you. and stay active in groups like this sub, even if you just lurk. feel free to vent or ask questions, and don't forget to share the positive or funny things that happen. we're always here, always open. ❤",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8xvcwe/how_do_i_handle_dad_who_wont_come_to_grasp_with/,How do i handle dad who wont come to grasp with his situation

"hello,i'm not sure where exactly to begin so i suppose i can start from the very beginning and slap a tldr at the end.**history:**my father in law was living with us about 7 years ago. he had just come out of a verbally abusive marriage and was taking it hard. he lived with us roughly two years. in that time we racked up credit card debt supporting him and his other children (who would eat about a weeks worth of food in a weekend). we had to kick him out as we needed the bedroom for our newborn and he was content with his side of the arrangement. we assisted him moving to an apartment and had him over weekly.after a while (honestly i am horrible with timeframes) he lost his job and was evicted from his apartment. he moved in with us for a month to be able to get his feet under himself and get a new job. he did not seek a job in that time and was blatantly trying to catch a free ride. all this was around the time my wife lost her job and we were fighting to keep our own house and keep our kids fed. he moved into a veteran homeless facility and was getting va benefits. we made sure he knew he could always do laundry and grab a meal in an effort to insure he could look his best for interviews.a year or so later and he moves from family member to family member, borrowing money and then cutting them off. all of his family besides us are pretty much washing their hands of him. we never loan him money and keep him at arms reach in an effort to keep a relationship with him. contact is pretty spaced out, once a month to wash clothes.**current events:**last week we were contacted via family that he was in the hospital. he had called his cousin and the cousin contacted us. we checked on him and nothing physical was wrong with him, he was on a psych hold for confusion and wandering. because my wife was next of kin (within the city) she signed medicaid paperwork to get him signed up to cover this latest hospital visit. that document was denied because she isn't his guardian, she is only next of kin within the city (clarifying that because he has an older child that lives out of state). he was on a psych hold for 3-4 days while they searched for a facility to diagnose him. they, cmh (community of mental health), shipped him to a facility in another city to get evaluated.this is where our frustration is and we would like advice. the facility never called to confirm that the patient arrived. we called them and then they wouldn't give us any information until the patient signed an information disclosure statement. the patient signs it and we (read: my wife) can now talk about medication and diagnosis. this doesn't make sense to me, if he isn't in his right mind then how can he sign a document?the facility states over the phone that they don't diagnose the patient, only treat him. this was the opposite of what the hospital case worker stated, they stated they could only do a brief evaluation but not a full diagnosis. to get a full diagnosis they needed to ship him to the facility. the facility started throwing around dementia as his diagnosis from the hospital. we visited the hospital multiple times and dementia was never stated as a reason for his psych hold.the facility is asking questions we don't have answers to and getting agitated that we can't answer the questions because he distanced himself from us. on top of the general sense of no one knowing what to do with the patient, we have reason to believe they are giving him the wrong drugs. drugs specifically labeled as used for schizophrenia and bipolar not dementia. everyone we have talked to about this seems to brush it off. we are hoping to talk with a new case worker/social worker today (i don't know the difference yet).**tldr:**father in law has had an on/off relationship with us over the years. we know very little about his personal life. he has burnt most of his family and no one wants to take on this responsibility. he was sent to the hospital and put on a psych hold for wandering off. he was shipped to a facility in another city to diagnose his mental state. we were told by the facility that they do not diagnose, they only treat. the move was facilitated by cmh and we had no say in where he was shipped. case workers have given more questions than answers and we don't know what we should be doing.i really wish there was a basic check sheet of what to do in this situation. i may try and formulate one (once our own issues resolve) for others in this situation. we feel like we are drowning and doing everything wrong. basically who should we contact if case workers are being difficult? is there a hierarchy that we can reference? what can we be proactive about? if you have gone through this, what was your experience? i would like to see if my experience if going off course or not. i really appreciate you reading this, i apologize if i am in the wrong sub. if i am, please direct me to where i should post."," first of all i'm sorry you are going through this. i had to deal with my mother's frontotemporal dementia or ftd for about 9 years before she passed almost 2 years ago and all forms of the disease are terrible. i'm in canada so it likely works differently here and any advice i can give will be limited to my experience. if you haven't already someone in the family will need to get power of attorney (there are two, one for finance, and one for personal care) as you live the closest it likely would make sense that it is you, for personal care at least. this will allow you to make decisions on his behalf and allow you more control. you should also start looking into care homes for him unless you or someone in your family are willing to take care of him yourself (i wouldn't recommend it) - care homes in my area, the good ones at least, sometimes have really long waiting lists, like years long. you may have to put him somewhere else in the interim. when my mom was originally diagnosed and given six weeks to live (she lived for many more years after that) we had to take what was available, which was halfway across the city in a not so great neighbourhood and was horribly maintained. the closer to your place you can find, the easier it is to visit and you likely will have to often to sign papers, doctors meetings and updates, etc.  as for the medications you said he was taking not being for dementia, this was the case with my mother as well. i'm going to assume you are talking about seroquel, although it could be something else. this is a drug they give to reduce anxiety, restlessness, and generally sedate them. i always thought that this one in particular was simply to make the nurses/attendants job easier, but there some benefits for the patient as well, such as a reduced risk of falls and the like. they tend to experiment for a while with the drug cocktail and each is unique to the patient and their needs. get him signed up for every government assistance program you can - there are some i didn't find out about until a couple years into it so make sure to do lots of research and speak to someone knowledgable about this that is willing to help. i found out about one from my accountant while doing her taxes, for example. you will need all of his background info and you will likely be asked about it a lot, such as ssn, birth date/certificate, previous health issues, allergies, family medical history, the list goes on and on.anyway, best of luck in dealing with this and if there is anything else i can help with feel free to reach out.

"long complex story that i can share if the details are needed, but to cut to the short of it, i'm planning to move to thailand, and i've been planning this for a couple of years. it is the retirement i've been working towards, and i feel very active and happy there, much more so than in the us. unfortunately, my single mom now has dementia, which started to manifest itself about 3 years ago. my younger sister was arranging her life (they were very close) and placed her in a pretty nice assisted living facility in seattle near her house, but then, tragically, my sister passed away (not related to brain issues).there is really no other family in seattle (just some very distant cousins), so if i move to thailand, mom won't be getting many family visits, which i don't think would be ideal for her. but, i really don't want to stay in seattle, i've been planning my escape from this city for 10 years, and just finally decided to do thailand after traveling there a lot over the last 5 years (prior to that i was thinking san diego). then i learned that there are some assisted living facilities in thailand that cater to westerners, and it is even possible to hire a live in aid there (which isn't expensive) if i preferred to just rent a large house and have my mom live with me in the house.i talked this idea with a nurse friend of mine who thought the idea wasn't bad (better than leaving her alone here), but thought a person with dementia might struggle in a place where english isn't the primary language used.have others done anything like this?"," depending on where you move, thailand has excellent healthcare and it is common for people to have daily or live-in help. i would recommend you find a location and have everything in place before the move. getting to thailand will be a very long trip. you might want to break up the trip into segments if you think that might help your mother.

"my grandma was diagnosed with dementia only a couple of months ago, although we are suspecting she has probably had it for upwards of five years. within the past few weeks, her symptoms have really dramatically worsened to the point where she is straight up hallucinating things that aren’t there as well as experiencing worsening cognitive decline.common delusions/hallucinations and other manifestations of her symptoms include:- having conversations with herself- having conversations with people who aren’t there- misidentification of objects (imagining that my handbag was my dog and saying that his leg was broken)- thinking that it is night when it is day- constantly thinking that we are getting evicted from our house (even though we own it) and trying to pack her belongings- trying to give our dog away by calling up family members and asking if they will take him- saying that i have abused our dog and broken his leg and that we need to take him to the vet (my dog is happy and healthy and he jumps and runs and is very active)- worrying because my grandpa or mum is dying in some way and the police and ambulance need to be called- saying that indian men are outside trying to break into our house to steal our cupboards (the specificity and absurdity of this one absolutely kills me)- getting changed into her sunday’s best at 2am and putting on her makeup saying we need to be somewhere- saying that someone is cutting a tree down outside- threatening to kill herself and saying that suicide is the only option anymore (she has been saying this for about fifteen years though, none of our family members or psychologists who have seen her think she is very serious about this)we have been struggling substantially over the past few weeks. i live with my grandparents (including my grandma who has dementia and my ninety year old deaf grandpa) and my mum (who has schizophrenia). we have not been getting any sleep over the past few weeks and it has been significantly impacting all of our health.her symptoms usually aren’t too obvious during the day and she is usually quite easily to manage, but it seems that she begins to completely lose her grip on reality when night falls. several times throughout the night, she will wake up, turn all of the lights on, talk very loudly to herself and shake the rest of us awake. every time this happens, i have to coax her back to bed, put her back to sleep and tuck her in. it just keeps repeating over and over again.we have an appointment with her gp on monday, but we are all suffering from lack of sleep and i’m desperately hoping that there is some way that we would be able to get her to settle at night in the meantime.does anyone have any recommendations for what we can do before we see her doctor? (we have talked to him on the phone and she has suggested sleeping tablets or sedatives for her to take at night.) are there any possible treatment methods that any of you guys have had success with that you would recommend discussing with the doctor?thanks so much! any suggestions would be very welcome.", check out the dementia australia organisation. heaps of resources and help sheets. there's one for 'sundowning' as well.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8wrs55/advice_for_dealing_with_symptoms_that_get/,Advice for dealing with symptoms that get particularly worse at night

"very new to the dementia world but learning fast. i just think i need some perspective from those of you who've been here awhile.my mom hasn't yet had a diagnosis, but is declining so rapidly that it doesn't seem likely that she doesn't. she recently got a diagnosis of parkinson's and has all the symptoms of the associated form of dementia - lewy body dementia. her doctor is working to confirm this.in the meantime, i am trying so hard not to rush her along due to my own needs. i don't know if that makes sense, but what i mean is, i want her to keep her independence as long as possible while still making sure her needs are met in a way that i can easily manage. i am her sole caregiver at the moment as my siblings all live very far away, but do have excellent support from my partner and my employer. the thing is i feel like sometimes i have to lie to her and that is so hard for me to do. she is smart and capable but was a nurse so when we talk about dementia, it is very distressing for her. then she forgets the conversation until it comes up again and i have to break both our hearts all over. she also get obsessive thoughts. like i asked her a month ago if she still had a valid passport. i asked only out of interest because my partner and i are planning a trip and we were talking about it. after that she kept trying to give me her passport. i refused and did not take it. now she can't remember where she put it and is convinced i took it. she won't accept that i didn't take it. now she wants to go through a box of things she gave me to make sure it isn't in there. i am terrified that if i give her the box before i can go through it this weekend, that she will lose or misplace the papers that are in there too. i've asked my partner to hide the box until after the weekend and feign that he doesn't know where it is so that i can go through it before she does.i feel awful about this. i feel like most days she is fine to have access to her papers, but right now she is not and so i fear her losing more. i feel like the worst person in the world to lie to her and to keep her things from her at this stage. i did tell her that i wanted her to wait until after i went through the box, and she has asked me to be in charge of these items, but i worry that she will forget she agreed to this and will ask my partner for the box. god this feels wrong and manipulative.any advice, gentle reprimand or commiseration would be appreciated.

"my mom has early onset alz.  i moved her into a memory care unit in april and the transition hasn't been awesome.  she is pretty far advanced that she can't care for her self and needs constant supervision because she's not safe on her own.  but she is still with it enough to know she doesn't want to be where she is, but wants to be home.  i used to get her every other day and take her to my house to walk her dog (which i took over care for when she had to move from her home) and eat dinner.  i've since become pregnant and am sick most of the time, so the visits have been scaled back to about once or twice a week.  the visits at my house aren't great.  she says she enjoys them, but literally the entire time she beds and pleads with me to take her to her house (which even if she was safe on her own is physically impossible bc the house has been foreclosed on) or to drop her off at her old neighbor's house so she can stay with them.  the visits are emotionally draining, but i was still trying to make her happy. the last few times i've taken her out, she's started refusing to go back to memory care and getting her back there is an emotional and physical struggle.  the last few times, i've just visited her in the memory care unit.  the whole time i'm there she fixates on me taking her out of there so she can go to my house and then walk to her house from mine.  she swears it's not a long walk, just across the street, when in reality, it's over an hour long drive.  i don't even try to reason or argue with her because i know it's pointless, but when i tell her no i can't take her out of there anymore, she whines that i'm horrible and being mean to her.  after about an hour into each visit, she's just been getting up, grabbing her purse (and suitcase she has packed bc she swears she's going home or moving into my home) and stands by the elevator, waiting for me to get it open so we can leave.  she gets so riled up about it, that i've had to leave without saying good bye and sneak out using the stairs to leave. i feel so bad sneaking out but i don't know how else to leave.  i don't know how else to handle the visits now either.  i think it is traumatic for her me visiting and not taking her to her home like she begs me to, but i also can't handle physically forcing her back to memory care anymore because that's not an easier on her than me just sneaking out and refusing to take her.any insight on how to handle it, i'm at a loss."," also trying really hard to figure out how to not have aunty focus on going home whenever she sees us.  we want to come away from visits with her feeling positive somehow.  current ploy is ""yeah i know, we're waiting for a needs assessment.  you know what these bureaucrats are like - everything takes so long."" and moving on to a different topic as fast as possible.  it keeps coming back to the going home thing though, and as soon as its time to leave she's right on that topic with intensity.it occurs to me that maybe i might try changing the wording to ""*you're* waiting for a ..."" instead of ""*we're* waiting.""  if she feels like she's in charge and has it all under control, rather than relying on her hopeless family, maybe that'd work. could backfire though.so i've really got no good advice other than try saying yep, we'll be going to the house in a few weeks - just waiting for (a third party) to do a thing.  and have a good long list of shaggy dog tales to chat to her about to change the topic.  have a go at getting the focus off you as the fixer of problems.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8sbmnt/visits_are_getting_harder/,Visits are getting harder.

"i am new to caring for a parent with dementia.  my father is diagnosed with it. we thought it was full on alzheimers but was diagnosed differently. my father just can’t retain his memory of what he thinks is trivial is the best way i can describe it.  he doesn’t know the seasons, time, day or date. he knows what they are, but if you ask him he doesn’t know what day it is. he is able to go out and come home fine. he knows his way around and can remember how to get places he just learned about. (wish he would forget since he found out how to go to/from resorts casino). he does not remember to eat. i believe that is a typical dementia thing. they think they already ate so they will refuse new food. but if it’s cookies, grapes, beef patties or cashews he will not forget about eating those.my main issue is that, he has no money mgmt. i do not give him his social security to use, but i leave him his pension. i use his social security for his bills and medical bills.  so since he found out about resorts, he went  there everyday. needless to say, he blew over $1500 in 2 weeks. he would take money out of atm up to 5 times a day. now he ran thru all his pension for the entire month and wants more money.  i will not give him his ss $ to blow.  so he’s been running to the ss admin to figure out where his ss $ is. they are not helping him as he would like. but he forgets that we went and goes back and back.  i can’t make him stop. he doesn’t remember that i get his ss $ in a separate account.  i can’t lock him up in the house.  but when he’s fixated on something, he will not back off of it. this is the 2nd time of fixation irritation he has going thru. it is the longest by far. if someone’s here to watch him, he’ll still slip out of the house. do you know what can help? the art of distraction is not working."," my father was anxious and is a bit further along down the road, but he would get an idea on something he absolutely had to do and wouldn't let go of it.  i couldn't imagine what it would be like to be so obsessed and concerned about something and not get any relief. i got him to a psychiatrist refererred by the neurologist and he got a prescription for anti-anxiety meds.  this has helped a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8s437n/new_here_need_advice/,New Here - Need Advice

"i have been a bit reticent to talk about this but here goes. long story ahead.i moved back in with my father(now 87) last year. i am on what i hope is temporary disability. was suffering from bouts of vertigo(those have passed) and when they were running every test in the book to try and figure out the cause, they found i was low on testosterone. not that it was causing the issue but they started me on testosterone injections, which led to me getting a dvt in my left leg. now i have to elevate it above my heart to get the swelling out of my left lower leg/foot. i moved back in with him for two purposes, one my disability took over a year to process, so no income or insurance during that time. secondly, he needed someone to drive him to dr appts and such. he has congestive heart failure, his kidneys were failing(they just went kaput and he just started dialysis). i now have income and insurance through ssd(again, hopefully temporary, being stuck at home sucks ass). so i have setup physical therapy for my right shoulder(frozen shoulder) and joined the health club(with a pool) next door. i can do those while he is sitting in the dialysis chair. that is not what i need help with though, which is what brings me to this thread. at times during the past year, my father has went in to bouts of dementia, varying in intensity, from ones i can eventually bring him back out of to lucidity to ones where i had to get the ambulance out to subdue him and take him to the hospital. each time he has been dehydrated. whether that was the cause or just a coincidence, i am not 100% sure. he had the chf and takes diuretics, which keeps him from getting fluid on his lungs but also killed his kidneys. when he goes into one of these states, he does nonsensical stuff, repetitively. like he took a loaf of bread, broke each piece into very small pieces and then took a spoon to mix it up, over and over. also the last major time, we found him in his bathroom, stark naked, shaving his face with an electric razor. he went about that for an hour, with me trying to get him out of there, finally had to get the ambulance to bring some ketamine to get him to the hospital. he was fine after they gave him iv fluids. he does not show all the signs of alzheimer's, as he remembers everyone, he just gets stuck in a loop of repetitive nonsense.just wondering if anyone else here has had to deal with something similar, any tips or possible diagnoses?"," this is not dementia, but actually delirium. it happens when there’s an issue like dehydration, infection, lack of oxygen etc. basically it’s the bodies way of saying something is wrong. the difference between the two is delirium is short term, and can generally be resolved by returning the body to normal. while dementia is a long term on going thing. i would say you have nothing to worry bout, just make sure he keeps up with his fluids.

"so, yeah, what the title says.  i had a serious conversation where i suggested a sleep study- she told me her friend had one and they didn't find anything.  obviously denial is in effect, but there is also resentment for bringing up the topic.  i talked to her after a week long vacation together, her memory was problematic but her behavior was worse, she has become impulsive about things like crossing streets without looking. what the hell am i supposed to do here?  i'm afraid she will kill someone with her car.  i'm not yet afraid that she will burn her house down by forgetting about food on the stove, but i'm concerned that she isn't taking any steps toward cleaning out her hoarder house and moving to a condo or something.  this is not a situation where she would be considered legally incompetent to make decisions, but that day is coming and plans are not being made.  she has long term care insurance, unless she stopped making payments out of spite.no siblings or other close family members.  she used to be very close with my wife, but my mom seems to blame the wife for me asking her to see a doctor."," every relationship is different and i wish there was an easy answer.i understand the fear of finding out you have something so significant as dementia.however that fear & inaction is, from my experience, incredibly selfish.in all likelihood it will be you, and other family, who has to pick up the pieces when/if it gets too far to ignore.that point is likely to be a horrific situation for the dementia patient: car accident, a bad fall, becoming lost in a familiar place, a police incident, sudden public incontinence.then you will also be playing catch-up on care they should have been already getting.plus by that point their mental competence may be insufficient to participate in planning their future care.i.e. they will have no say in what happens to them going forward because they left it too late.i'm sorry if this is not the answer you want.but this is what your mother needs to understand.if they are hiding it because they are afraid, or ""don't want the family to worry"", they are in fact making things much, much worse for everyone.chances are it may not be dementia. the first test is often for urinary tract infection, which can have the same symptoms.but it doesn't hurt to have a plan & take the time to be brave and come to terms with it now.if it is dementia, and you catch it early, there are sometimes ways to slow its advance.plus you can make the most of the time you have before it's too late.you love your mum, you are clearly coming from a place of love.but unfortunately if she doesn't want to listen, all you can do is steel yourself for the inevitable and be there when she needs you.this is what happened with my mum. it was hell for a while. but we have got her settled into care now & will always be here for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8r41eu/need_advice_had_sincere_conversation_with_mom_to/,"Need advice.

"this is going to be a lot, and probably really long... i appreciate anyone who manages to get through some of it. i've only very rarely frequented this sub reddit, as i've kind of just felt lost and didn't feel up to reading it all. i hope that my less-than-sugarcoated approach to writing about my experience with my mom does not offend anyone. i also wrote this over the course of several, sleep-deprived hours. we all have our coping mechanisms. i'm not great at finding humor in this still. there's a lot of dirty laundry from the past that prevents that, still. i'm 26 (27 in a couple months), living with my parents, and my mom has early on-set dementia. she has pretty much three settings:1) desperately loyal housewife: she goes to extreme lengths to please my dad, which recently included forcing her bedroom door closed while i was trying to get in to get toilet paper so i could pee at 2 in the morning. when she's like this, she's extremely paranoid about doing something to upset my dad (even though he really doesn't get mad at her.) when she's like this, she'll often make sweeping statements about how ""oh we all love him, he's so wonderful, aren't we lucky?"" considering the past problems our family had before my mom got sick, it's pretty tough to hear.2) bitter, vicious bitch: self-explanatory. yes, i know it's not ""really"" her, and no, i generally don't let it affect me. our family has always had a pretty screwed up power dynamic, and my mom always had her passive-aggressive side and a hot temper. trying to discern in my memories which times were really her and which weren't have been a thorn in my side. 3) confused child: meek and confused, very much needs help to get a basic command done. we see a lot more of this these days. so yeah, that's my mom in a nutshell. she's been deteriorating for years, but my dad wasn't on board and was in denial right alongside her. my sister and i ended up feeling like we were in some twisted twilight zone where we were seeing things, maybe *we* were the ones going crazy, because no one else would admit to seeing what we did. eventually my sister got a chance to move out, i didn't, and here i am. i've finally figured out what i want to major in and pursue in my life. i've been at the city college on and off for years, working on and off at crap jobs, going back for a semester, rinse, repeat. i've been massively depressed for more than half of my life and fell into the trap of ""well i can handle it."" now i've aged out of my dad's insurance, i have no job, and am living off of about $800 left of financial aid until i find a job. i'm gonna be fine; my dad doesn't let me starve. he will pay for gas if he needs to. but i still feel like i'm just incredibly stupid and useless and doing it all horribly, stupidly wrong. it feels like life isn't worth living when up against the utter crap i can't seem to fix or get out of. my mom is dying, my family is screwed up, my dad is still in denial in some ways, and i just can't seem to find it in me to love anything about myself enough to think i have what it takes to have a good life. the person i always thought would be there to help me figure things out is gone. i have to work so hard to keep my emotional state hidden from my mom because all it does is make her feel upset or scared. i'm so tired.i'm trying really, really hard to prove i'm useful to my dad, because you guessed it, living at home and not having life figured out is a huge self-esteem downer. i do as many errands as my dad throws at me, and will do them at the expense of my time, my gas, and plans i previously had. i handle all of the grocery shopping, i take my mom to appointments if he can't, i am the primary caretaker for our four animals, two cats and two dogs. while i cannot afford to pay for any of them, i schedule their vet appointments, i take them in, i medicate them for fleas and anything else that pops up. i make sure they have food and water, i clean up the litterbox and any messes. i keep my dad apprised of anything going on with them. i make sure my mom eats something. i let him know when we're low on things like dish soap, toilet paper, and paper towels. i cook cold dishes that can last for a few days at a time, most often something like a pasta salad. i try and keep track of what my mom is eating and what she isn't (anyone else have dementia family members who have new cravings every few months?) i notify him of anything out of the norm with my mom. i have worked really, really hard to avoid getting upset with my mom or losing my temper. i'm much better than i used to be, but of course could always use improvement.none of it feels like it's ever enough. i'm still stuck at home. despite the few moments where i feel like i'm doing enough to prove it's okay for me to be home still and figuring things out, there are always the long patches of me telling myself no, you're doing it wrong, you're useless. i live in a very expensive state, so moving out by myself is really not an option. some days i struggle to get myself out of bed, let alone to look for a job. it induces such panic and anxiety in me to even think about going back to the dead-end jobs i used to work, but what else is there when you just have a high school diploma still? i just wish i could feel like what i'm doing is enough, but i don't. tldr: my life is a mess. triangle of take care of mom, get a job and work to save and live, and go to school are constantly at odds with each other and out of balance and i honestly just feel like i'll never be able to feel like i'm doing anything enough. my dad insists he never wanted my sister nor i to be responsible for my mom, and yet when we go over the list of everything that wouldn't get done if we stopped being involved... it goes on. we're afraid he'll wake up one day and lose his mind.is there anyone out there who has anything remotely similar to this situation? thanks for reading up until now. this has all been coming on for months, and it just kind of boiled over last night with me feeling really, really awful about not having a job and my own income. i feel like such a failure, and my mom is gone and not here to help me figure out life. she walks around like a ghost with greasy hair, unkempt clothes. i can't force her to shower. i can't force her to wash her hands. i don't think she's even on a single medication related to dementia, like anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers. i can't force my dad to get a caretaker. and when we finally get one, the relief i'll feel will quickly be replaced with the realization that i no longer have a purpose in this house, and that i'm just wasting space.thanks."," trying to find your own way in life has been greatly detoured by your mother's illness, you are of the age where what you want for yourself is perfectly normal; to be independent, working and still be a responsible family member. the fact that you have come to realize this (a bit later than you might have liked) does not mean you cannot still attain it.you are in a very difficult and challenging situation. dealing with a loved one's dementia is a draining, exhausting and ultimately tragic experience. there is help available and i would strongly advise you to insist to your father that it be utilized. he cannot realistically expect you to continue maintaining the home and caring for your mother to the exclusion of your own future. i would make every effort to assure him that you are not deserting him but rather you are hoping to make life easier and safer for everyone concerned. you are not abdicating responsibility. rather, you are trying to prove yourself as an adult. as your mother's condition worsens, being better prepared to deal with it will in itself offer some peace of mind. there are many services available for families dealing with dementia. some is dependent on where you live and your family's (your parents) financial situation. this can have a large bearing on what help they may qualify for. not knowing these things, i can offer suggestions of help available where i live (us, state pa) but i am not sure if it will be applicable to your area. a few include:the dept. of aging (by county) offers caregiver support, alzheimer's association includes care consultations, support groups, educational materials, etc., and mental health counseling for help in dealing with the stress and anxiety you are experiencing.you indicate you have made some headway towards attaining a college degree. if so, you have accrued valuable credits. talk to the school counselors and explain your situation. they may be able to offer resources and advice that can help you move forward.i don't know your family dynamics but the situation you face will surely strain them even further and likely cause a further breakdown. someone has to be in charge and that may willingly or not be you. doing your research and being knowledgeable and dependable will better position you within your family and earn their respect. organize your life to best reflect your position as a caregiver as well as valuing your own hopes and dreams for your future. believe me, you will be needed for a long time, even if you bring in outside help. but don't make that your entire identity. it is only part of who you are. i hope i have helped even a little and good luck to you. i wish you the very best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8r2kdc/am_i_doing_everything_wrong_rant_post_sorry/,Am I doing everything wrong?

"&gt;social isolation is as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.yet for many elderly individuals suffering from dementia or other debilitating conditions, it is a constant reality. family members too often struggle to provide —  and afford —  the personal care required to meet the emotional needs of their loved ones.recently found this new service called [mon ami]( \- a two\-sided platform that pairs college students (called ‘activity companions’) with elderly individuals to arrange house visits, where they engage in conversation, games, art, and other activities.", anyone try this or have information?  the website is annoying in that it expects you to provide a lot of personal information before entering the website.  so you can't even tell if it is available in your area until you give them that information.  not looking to just be a part of a dementia caregiver database - looking to see what is available.  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8qleof/bringing_play_to_dementia_care/,Bringing play to dementia care
"hi all, i am currently working on my final on dementia with lewy bodies (dlb) , and i need provide a social media post on the awareness . my questions: do you know about dlb? how did you first react to love ones with dementia vs now?my grandmother was diagnosed with dlb seven years ago, and i wished i knew what i know now. i was very impatient and frustrated the first couple years. it was only up until two years ago before she passed, i began to understand or know how to properly care of her when she was having her hallucinations. ps this is my first time using reddit. hopefully i am doing this right lolthank you! (: "," i had never heard of dlb (or, as i’m used to hearing, lewy body dementia=>lbd. is this wrong?) until my father was diagnosed in 2015. he is in the mid-late stages, still living at home with my mom, but with some help from friends and professionals. most people i tell have never heard of it. we were fairly impatient at first. he suddenly started complaining that he was worried he would fall if he didn’t drag his feet and look at the ground when he walked. around the same time, he started acting out his dreams, kicking, punching, etc. my mom knew something was wrong, but it took a year of doctors visits to get anyone to look seriously, let alone give a diagnosis. post-diagnosis, i’d like to think we’ve all been more understanding and supportive. my dad is naturally good-natured and doesn’t want us to worry, even when he doesn’t know what’s going on. that has led to some mistakes from caregivers and the like from time to time. i also think it delayed his diagnosis. the biggest difference is that now, when he complains about other problems (he may have heart issues and/or some form of abdominal cancer), his doctors and my family members who are making such decisions have taken a “don’t test, don’t treat” approach. i think they believe that death sooner rather than later would be preferable at this point. good luck on your project. i hope more people like you continue to look into this.

"is there anyone with dementia who is asthmatic as well taking asthma medication? there's an interesting study saying the medication zileuton helped reverse dementia symptoms in mice. i am wondering if anyone that takes this, whether you're or loved one's dementia gotten better. treating your or their asthma also unintentionally treats dementia.", zileuton decreases the activity of [5-lipoxygenase]( just like cbd. i am super excited about the role the endocannabinoid system will play in the [all sorts of brain disease](the future of neurology may finally be getting here. is anyone using both drugs together?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8pyvq1/asthma_drug_helped_reverse_dementia_symptoms/,Asthma drug helped reverse dementia symptoms

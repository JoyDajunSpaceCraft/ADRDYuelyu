"my grandmother has always had very vivid dreams. lately she’s gotten to the point where she can’t distinguish between her dreams and reality. for example, she had a dream that she was getting ready to travel someplace, woke up from the dream and started getting her things together to go wherever it was she dreamed about. it was difficult to deal with at first, but i’ve learned to use the situation to my advantage. my grandmother’s has also become extremely stubborn. she prefers to just sit around and do nothing except watch tv all day. she won’t wash up or get dressed. she just wants to sit with her tv and eat when she says she’s hungry. because of her dreams, i’ve been able to get her washed up and dressed in the mornings. her: when are we leaving?me: we’re not leaving for a while but in the meantime you can take a shower, brush your teeth, put on some clothes, and we’ll wait for [insert name] to pick us up so we can leave!these lucid dreams have been a bit of a blessing when it comes to taking care of her. unfortunately, my aunts and uncles view it as lying to and manipulating her. they feel that i should be truthful to her no matter what’s going on inside her head and that i need to stop indulging her belief that she’s getting ready to go someplace. mind you, these are the same aunts and uncles that barely paid my grandmother a visit before the pandemic happened. now they have ideas on how she should be cared for despite the fact that i’ve been doing it for seven years. and their ideas don’t include me taking advantage of her lucid dreams."," ask them to take your place for a couple of days, then see how fast they start lying to her. nothing will make them believe other than experience. when i first started helping with my uncle, i felt the same way they do. after seeing the agitation and worry that telling the truth caused a few times, i found out different and i firmly believe in what you are doing.you should handle it the way you see fit, if they're not helping they need to hush.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lhsc3b/lucid_dreaming_and_dementia/,Lucid Dreaming and Dementia

"hi everyone,this is the first time i’m posting in here. i’ve been a long time lurker and this sub has really helped with some of my struggles of being a caretaker. i’m hoping for some help from the wonderful people here. my grandmother with dementia continuously flushes the toilet in our home even when she doesn’t need to go. she’ll just walk in, flush the toilet, then walk out. we’re not sure if she flushed objects down or if it’s just water, but it’s constant. my theory is that she’ll throw a tissue or napkin in there and flush. we’ve asked her to stop flushing unless she needs to go, and to use the trash can for trash but she doesn’t remember. any help would be great. thank you in advance.", definitely sounds like she has developed a compulsion. does she have a history of ocd or other psychiatric issue in the past?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lhpzvt/grandma_keeps_flushing_toilet_for_no_reason/,Grandma keeps flushing toilet for no reason

"my mil has been feeding my cats to an early grave. before she moved in she would feed stray cats at her house in the country. when she got here i thought feeding the cats would be a good job for her. i was sooo wrong. my siamese meows, a lot. he’s a talker.  meows when he poops, meows when he’s doing his weird kneady dance on the pillows, meows when he plays with his catnip banana. meows when he sees my mil because he is a little shit. so she feeds him and he has a few bites them moves on, he’s not really hungry and my fat cat gets to gorge. fat cat is gonna loose her ability to clean her own butthole soon. so i got a $150 rfid chip cat feeder. i thought if there was always food available for siamese that it would give mil a break on feeding them and i could work on slimming down far cat. within one week of fucking with it while nobody else was home mil had accidentally programmed the feeder to the fat cat. so i hid all the cat food. put the bag of kibble in my personal clothing closet. mil started giving the cats cans of tuna, oysters, faux crab and going in my closet regularly to get at the kibble. so i put the kibble and all canned seafood in the storage closet on the patio behind lock and key. this led to nasty notes on the fridge about there being no cat food and my partner being told that i’m starving the cats and they haven’t eaten in days. fast forward to yesterday. before i leave for work i ask mil if she wants me to bring her home anything. she asks for canned tuna. i say that we know she’s been feeding it to the cats and it makes them sick. she says it’s just for her and her alone. i say i’ll talk to my partner (her son) and if it’s okay with him i’ll bring home some tuna. she slams her book on the desk and tells me not to ask him she’ll ask him her damn self. later, on my way home i call so and ask him about the tuna. turns out mil had called him and asked for one of those rotisserie chickens from the store. he had told her he’d grab one and got off the phone only to immediately call her back and ask her if the chicken was for the damn cats. she swore it was not. so i got her the chicken and the tuna. i’ll fast forward through the fiasco that was dinner that night (i pretended to be sick so i didn’t have to eat anything). i’m laying down this morning and i hear mil shuffling around the kitchen and the siamese meowing. i know this is a bad setup, but twice yesterday she promised me she wasn’t giving any food to the cats, and she promised it to my so. i spy through the crack in the room divider and what do i see? shes feeding the goddamn cat some goddamn chicken. she hears me her up and she hustles to pick up the chicken before i notice, but it’s past that.“mil you said you wouldn’t feed the cats”“i know but he was meowing.”“you promised.”do i take the chicken away? she clearly can’t be trusted with it.", good idea about the catnip!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lhpbv2/tuna_nazi/,Tuna Nazi

"hi all, i am very new to this. 2 weeks ago my nana was fairly independent (my younger brother lives with her) and enjoying being home working in her garden. she repeated things a lot in the same conversation but i thought that was the extent of it. i live out of state so phone and text is how we talked and she never let on that anything more was happening. since then, she has been in icu on a ventilator with metabolic acidosis, liver failure and a variety of other things. she hadn’t been taking her medicine. she is better now physically but needs 24 hour care. her insurance won’t cover in home care and the dementia has gotten much worse. she is being transferred to a care facility in a day or two. she called me (still has my number memorized) crying saying she is scared, that the people in the hospital are playing pranks on her and laughing at her. that they come in and bang on things to scare her while she naps and then leave. that she was supposed to get her hair done and no one would bring her a brush even though she asked multiple times. they make the crazy sign and point and laugh at her. she said there are feral cats there and the staff let them in because they feel sorry for them. i talked to a woman in the room with her and asked what was going on. she told me nana is very confused, she got her hair done and didn’t ask for a brush. my nana is my everything, she raised me and my brother and is the strongest person i know. i tried to tell her that sometimes when we are scared things seem different than they really are and she cried and said no one believes her and if i don’t want to help her then don’t. this broke me, i don’t know the right things to say to comfort her. she was on suicide watch until yesterday and she is upset she was left alone because she can’t be alone, that’s the rules. i told her she was much better and didn’t need anyone to watch her and she said i did it, like giving me credit for her being better. i tried to give her kudos instead by saying that she is working hard to get better and she did it all because she is amazing. she basically blew me off with a “whatever” and moved on to something else. what can i say to reassure her that no one wants to hurt her and that she is safe? also, i’m curious how it would work if i wanted to transfer her to a facility close to me? i’ve tried to get her to move to florida with me but she says she is and always will be a cali girl and never wants to leave. i’m just very lost at the moment.", ... and my latest entry probably dove-tails into this issue also >> [ .,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lh05t0/i_dont_know_the_right_things_to_say_anymore/,I don’t know the right things to say anymore

"hi, i just needed to rant and maybe get some advice. i'm currently living with my 66 year old mother, who is suspected of dementia but not yet properly diagnosed due to issues with the previous psychiatrist. we're trying to get her to see a geriatric psychiatrist soon. she is currently still capable of showering and eating on her own, despite wetting/soiling her bed occasionally. there are 4 of us and 2 kids living with her, so the responsibility of care does not fall too heavy on only one of us. she is very talkative, and tends to join in on any conversation made around her, even if she has no idea what we're talking about. the thing is, she would even blatantly lie and tell us things that never happened just for the sake of talking. she just wants to talk to someone. even when we're talking quietly among ourselves, she would make an effort to come closer and listen to the conversation, which annoys me a bit personally. the adults would usually go along with it, but the children (my sister's two children, 7 and 4 y/o) gets really irritated when their grandma lies to them. they get really confused, like they get scolded when they lie, so why is this elder woman always lying and getting away with it? we tried to explain about mom's condition but they still get irritated at times because my mom not only lies, but is also quite stubborn and gets aggressive (start shouting and banging her fist on tables) when people doesn't believe her. this resulted in her getting in fights with the two kids who are at home most of the time due to covid-19. then, when the kid ends up crying or leaving her alone, she would proceed to antagonize my sister and say that her kids are ill-mannered, even once tried to stuff some cloth into the kid's mouth because he started to shout. the kids are quite well-behaved, but they couldn't understand why grandma is getting angry at them for telling the truth, so i guess that's why it ended up with fights. but that's the thing. she always lies. she would lie saying she's taken a shower, but when we checked the bathroom, the floor's dry. she would lie that she didn't wet herself, or said that she cleaned them but when we checked her bed its still there all dried up. she even keeps food in her room, saying that it was for our late father to eat. but we never believed in spirit offerings. she makes super sweet cordial drinks, like with waay to much cordial to water ratio, yet still tells us that she's drinking plain water when we ask her about it. her first instinct whenever confronted about things is always to lie, and whenever we asked why, she would say that she's scared of getting scolded, but no one has ever scolded her before, and my sisters were especially very patient and gentle. her lying to us has been really frustrating, especially if it involves hygiene. i'm not the most patient one, and i've now snapped at her several times, especially for talking bad about my sisters. she always thinks the worst of us, and that my eldest sister is always doing bad things to her. she would say that we're all treating her like she's stupid, we all changed since our father passed away, that we're treating her like a maid in her own house, (just because one of my sisters told her to hang her clothes in the wardrobe by herself because she was always complaining about us going through her clothes, like once) always trying to control her and not letting her do the things she wants. we do control her sometimes like telling her to take meds, drink water and telling that she's putting shirt on weirdly, but thats about all, and it's all for her own good. we did used to ask her to exercise because her physio tells her she needs to do it, but she would give too many excuses that we have quite given up on that. my sister's still being gentle and understanding, but i could see that she's hurt by the remarks. my sisters are quite against sending her to homes or getting care because they believe taking care of parents is a filial duty, but i could see that the atmosphere in the house has gotten quite awkward and gloomy. sometimes, my sisters would lock themselves up in their rooms just to avoid having to handle my mother for some time. nobody really hangs around at the living room anymore. i think almost all interactions with her would result in someone being irritated or hurt nowadays. she's now resulted to knocking loudy on our bedroom doors and telling us to work downstairs because she feels like everyone is ignoring her. my sister who works from home and has to handle online classes for he two kids was really upset with this. her husband works too, and they've got some arrangement going so the kids are with her almost all day. my other sister who is a freelance graphic designer, barely has any sleep when chasing deadlines. i could see she's also pretty stressed out. i've been stressed out with studying and exams myself, for professional papers so this has taken quite a toll on my mental health as well. it's safe to say that this has affected us all. my sisters always feel guilty and say that we shouldn't complain about her because parents are not supposed to be considered as burden in our culture, but as much as i'm feeling guilty, i'm just tired of hiding the truth. i lived overseas for some time, so i'm not very close to my mother. i don't really have that much of a say for this issue compared to my sisters. but it pains me to see my family like this, my mother turned out like this after my father passed away last year and we're all pained by the loss and suddenly my mother became like this, it's quite difficult for the family. sorry for the long post, i have no idea who else to say these to.", thing is that family duty also places importance on the health of the family members. taking care of a member needing help is a virtue but it isn’t virtuous to teach family members that they don’t matter at all or it is their place to just be pushed aside.  those kids are learning what family values are doing to them and may reject family responsibilities later on because of it.  dementia is such an awful event in a family because it is so difficult and won’t get better; will get worse.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lgpnkp/first_time_handling_dementia_patient_need_help/,"First time handling dementia patient, need help (+Rant)"

"my mil (59) has lewy body dementia, she’s at a stage where she can participate in light conversation, but often loses her words and train of thought. she also has delusions and a lot of false memories. she is not capable of forming new memories. the only self care she can do is put her clothes on (usually backwards or inside out) and bring a spoon of food to her mouth. she needs help with every other aspect of her life. she’s been with us for two years. i’m her primary caregiver, a stay at home mom. i’m planning on sending this to her two sisters and my bil, none of which are involved in her care, other than the occasional check-in text. names have been changed.please let me know if you think i should add or change anything? have i over-explained? under-explained? donna - milemma - my 3 year oldgrant - my almost 1 year oldcharles - my husbandezra - brother in lawhey family, i’m so sorry to spring this on you so suddenly. as of today, our home is no longer suitable or safe for donna. i’ve been struggling with this for a while, and we had an  incident today that pushed us over the edge. everyone is ok, but this can’t continue as is. when we first decided to bring donna into our home, i told charles that our boundary would be if she becomes a danger to us or our kids, or if we become a danger to her, then it would be time to find her somewhere else. that time has come. today, while i was helping grant nap (he’s been sick all weekend), emma went into donna’s bedroom, and hit her hand with a toy (metal) hammer, it was supposed to be in the garage, and she was supposed to be going to the bathroom. donna is ok physically. but she’s terrified and disoriented, she had trouble getting from her room to the kitchen table. emma has been dealt with, hammer is gone, of course. but i just can’t help but feel that something is bound to happen again. keeping the two of the apart has been one of my biggest struggles since we’ve moved into this house. emma can operate baby gates and doors, donna cannot. the only ways to keep them separate is either inhumane (locking them both in their bedrooms, not happening) or extremely logistically difficult (what i’ve been doing, constant supervision, made impossible because of grant’s needs, me going to the bathroom, emma’s extremely independent attitude &amp; physical maturity, she’s the has size &amp; capabilities of a 5 year old). now that grant has started to walk, the house is about to undergo another baby-proofing transformation; and it won’t go well for donna. then plan that charles and i have had on the back burner is to find her a skilled nursing facility in city name (the town where charles works and ezra lives. about 20 minutes from our home). we wanted to wait as long as possible to make this transition. please keep us in your prayers, this will be extremely difficult for all of us.", all assets will be drained be careful,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lfm3a9/its_time_for_a_nursing_home_this_is_the_text_that/,It’s time for a nursing home.

(“if i were forgetting things, i would know!”) so i say something regrettable and feel terrible. everybody tells me what an ahhh-mazing daughter i am, and i just feel like a fraud. now she has it in her head that she wants a #%$& labradoodle. she can’t remember whether she took her medication this morning, but she is after me like white on rice every day now to find her a damned labradoodle. (thankfully she she is very specific and wants a young brown labradoodle from a rescue society, which is surprisingly hard to procure.) the only thing that has been at all helpful in mustering patience is this... a therapist told me to imagine how i would deal with a toddler who was behaving like my mom. if a three-year-old asked you a bunch of stupid questions, you likely wouldn’t lash out at her for it. and i don’t think my mom wants to be annoying any more than a little kid does. so i just try to tell myself she can’t help it and take a deep breath. i also do yoga every day. and sometimes i still snap at her. and everybody else. i’m so sorry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lcp0jc/how_do_you_deal_with_the_changes_when_the/,"How do you deal with the changes when the negativity is pointed at you, constant, & they refuse help?"

"first time posting, sorry for formatting. apologies if not allowed.my (55f) partner (68m) has a family history of dementia. in the last year i have noticed he becomes very forgetful in the evenings, (small things like what to have for dinner tomorrow and big things like a new fire pit). he’s also newly retired, so that’s a big shift. the forgetting happens whether we have cocktail hour or not. (trying to avoid this as well these days). but he’s also becoming really nasty (saying things like f-off and f-you - or worse) when we don’t agree on minor things. and he legit doesn’t remember 15 minutes later, let alone the next day.we’ve been together for 14 years. we aren’t married (we both have adult children and want them taken care of). he won’t talk to his doc about this stuff, and has accused me of making it up. my family of origin was abusive, and this stuff is triggering for me. all the resources i have found are about how to “deal” (i never know what is going to set any of this off), and no resources for my own mental health. just because he may not know why he’s doing it , doesn’t make it any less abusive. can anyone recommend some resources for me? especially how to address the abuse?"," you can tell the family doc you’re seeing x y and z symptoms and ask them to do a “check up”. that would get him in front of the doc under the pretense of a physical or whatever, but the doc will know what to look for, to evaluate neurological stuff. i would guess that would result in a referral to a neurologist.

"**nearly twenty years ago, when i first began studying alzheimer's disease, i began by looking at all the major hypotheses for alzheimer's disease and found out that almost none of them explained every case of the disease.  only one of them--calcium dysregulation--was present in every case of alzheimer's disease.  so when i read this article today it made me reflect back:**# does calcium overload mark dendritic spines for destruction?the work supports the decades-old hypothesis that calcium dysregulation is a driver of neurodegeneration, noted christopher norris of the university of kentucky in lexington. “the present work … is yet another example of just how vital the ‘ca2+ hypothesis’ is after all these years, and further cements the visionary status of its early proponents.”[****there are two sources of excess calcium in the brain.  one is the release of intracellular calcium.  drugs like aricept and anavex 2-73 inhibit this release.  the second which is connected to the first is the influx of extracellular calcium which is usually the results of the over-activation of nmda receptors which is inhibited by namenda.  the first problem decreases with the progression of alzheimer's disease whereas the second increases.  this may be why aricept is only effective for awhile during the early stages of alzheimer's disease whereas namenda is only prescribed during the moderate to late stages of alzheimer's disease.****my second step was trying to figure out what caused calcium dysregulation.  i found that there were many types of receptors (g protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, ionotropic receptors) and many factors that contributed to this problem (high glucose levels, high fructose consumption, pesticides, air pollutants, viruses, bacteria, fungi, amyloid oligomers, misfolded tau proteins to name just a few).  unless only receptor or only one factor caused someone's alzheimer's disease, inhibiting any particular receptor or removing any particular factor was likely to make little difference in terms of the treatment of the disease.****the final step was to figure out what does excessive calcium trigger cause.  calcium dysregulation leads to oxidants (hydrogen peroxide early on and then to peroxynitrite) and neuroinflammation which results in the production of more oxidants.  in addition to triggering neuroinflammation, peroxynitrite leads to a depletion of critical neurotransmitters needed for the retrieval of short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, inhibits neurotransmissions, inhibits the regeneration of neurons and synapses, causes dna damage, damages tisssue, and results in the death of neurons.  the only way to largely stablize alzheimer's disease is to scavenge peroxynitrite and to partially reverse the damage that it does to the brain.** **here are a couple of charts which help to put the above togethe.   (onoo-) is peroxynitrite.  for critics don't focus on me, focus on the scientists who put this together.**[**[**"," first, the top link you’ve provided never links calcium dysregulation to peroxynitration. it discusses how synaptic spines displaying aberrant calcium levels are removed, while neighboring spines are left untouched. they are removed by brain resident and infiltrating immune cells. how the spines are tagged for removal is unclear, but they’re hypothesizing complement tagging or something similar. again, here you making a wild leap to connect calcium dysregulation to peroxynitration, and trying to make it seem like prominent scientists agree with you by invoking their name earlier in the post. the diagram you link undercuts your own hypothesis by showing that peroxynitrates are way downstream in the pathological pathways implicated in alzheimer’s, and there are multiple other pathways driving pathology. so scientists did create these separate bodies of research, but you are the one trying to jam them together, like square pegs in round holes, to fit your hypothesis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l8ug6f/calcium_dysregulation_and_alzheimers_disease/,Calcium Dysregulation and Alzheimer's disease

"mom is 61, diagnosed around 7 years ago with early onset dementia. she's always been a pretty anxious &amp; paranoid person, but even more so with dementia. as of late, her perception of reality has come to be so distorted that she can no longer differentiate what's real from what isn't. long story short, she's become increasingly aggressive and has episodes where she can't be pacified no matter how much we try to calm her down (she thinks we're strangers/we're lying to her). i don't wanna dwell on it too much, but given the progressive nature of dementia there's always the possibility of the situation worsening and her becoming physically violent. if and when it does happen, what would be the best course of action? my dad &amp; i are her primary caretakers and have been having trouble thinking of how to go about it (other than just letting it run its course). no homes/facilities in our area and we haven't had any luck finding a private caretaker due to the lockdown. any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated."," i think first step is research then perhaps some calming herbs or medication can be found after you are certain of whether she has some lewy body elements in her dementia; considering young onset of dementia symptoms probability is high that your mom is dealing with either ftd, or lbd, in the mix of causes.  lbd (lewy body dementia) can very much distort the sense of reality, often involving hallucinations at an earlier stage than most dementias.  fronto-temporal type (ftd) often hits the area of the brain that can create personality problems.  much difference in source, and much difference in the complications (medications that might be successful in mediating anger and aggressiveness in a person with ftd could often be fatal or nearly-fatal for person with lbd).  written about hallucinations here >>  types by truthful kindness at [ ;  i wrote about not recognizing my husband at  context of appearance by truthful kindness at [ ;  both these symptoms are very much in the mix for lbd symptoms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l8m3j2/how_to_deal_with_aggression/,How to deal with aggression?
"hello everyone, this is not my first post here but i desperately need to vent. i am 24 taking care of my 86 year old demented father. i am his sole caregiver and as i have mentioned before due to our geographical location a facility is not an option. i have been feeling so angry and resentful towards him even though i know the disease is not his fault. this is why.1. both of his brothers died of alzheimer’s many years ago. that was before he had any kind of symptoms. he never got tested, never took precautions and never thought “oh i might get it too one day”. never saved any money for his retirement and never had plans about what he will do once he is old. 2. he choose to have kids at 61 ( my mom was 27) obviously they got divorced and my mom remarried. but isn’t it simple mathematics that you will be too old to enjoy your kids? that you condemn your children to not have a father for most of their life? that they will be 29 and 26 ( little brother) when you’re 90?! 3. he cares about my brother more than me. my little brother lives across the world and only comes home once a year and calls once a week. even when i was changing my fathers diapers some weeks ago and cleaning poop of him he was like “ what do you think your brother is doing today” omg.i cannot get over the fact that i’m paying for his choices in life and that he is stealing mine. i know it’s his dementia but he is so egotistical. doesn’t even bother to get up if he’s thirsty, he makes me do it. complains all day how he wants to die and is so bored, but every time i suggest an activity he turns me down. i don’t know if it’s the right choice but i have decided to distance myself for my own sanity. i make sure his essential needs are met, but i will not bend over backwards for him to be entertained. he made his choices. i know it’s harsh but i’ve been crying everyday for months and i can’t do this anymore. thank you for reading."," don’t feel guilty i went through the same thing my mom died a few weeks ago of dementia at age 77, took care of her for sometime but had to place her in a care facility, she lasted 4 months. it was so hard taking care of her, myself and my wife could not enjoy our lives as my mom took so much time. the constant phone calls from care givers and doctors because she would not follow directions it was horrible. the only silver lining was i knew she would be gone soon but what i realized was my mother had been gone for some time already, the women with dementia was not my mother it was just the shell of my mother. my mom died on jan 8 2021 and i must admit i was relieved, i miss her and still love her but her quality of life was horrible and no way for someone to live. don’t feel guilty you will only do harm to mental and physical health, you can only do so much for you dad and that’s all you can do",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l8kggr/guilt_anger_and_resentment/,"Guilt, anger and resentment."

"my grandma (91) is most likely in the early stages of vascular cognitive impairment/dementia. i’m not sure of her “official” diagnosis, but her doctors have tried a few different medications to help her and they settled on memantine since that’s the only thing that showed noticeable reduction in symptoms.she’s been on memantine for about 6mo-1y and for some reason she seems to have trouble taking it. by this i mean that she will take her other medication (blood pressure, etc.) just fine, but leave the memantine pill in her pill box or on her side table and just not take it. not every time, but this is a recurring event. she doesn’t seem to be doing this intentionally, but she gets a little offended when confronted about it. she also started cutting these pills in half for a few weeks without telling anyone because she was “running out.”i’m not the primary person “looking after” my grandparents (that’s my dad and uncle) so i’m not personally in contact with their doctors. i do have an undergraduate background in neuroscience though so i can push a little bit if i need to and my family will be receptive. that’s why i’m looking for input from your experiences.i feel like it could be a good idea to try a different medication but i don’t want to push for that right away before getting a better understanding of what could be going on.has anyone dealt with something like this before? when their loved one is fine taking medication but seems to subconsciously avoid a specific medication? how did you approach this? do you have any advice?"," does your grandmother absolutely have to take the medication? maybe she doesn’t like how it makes her feel but no longer knows how to verbalize it correctly?my grandfather is currently 91 also! will be 92 in a few months, aside from his pretty advanced dementia, he is totally healthy, however, there is a clear overall decline in him simply due to the dementia.a few yrs ago when he was still living alone, he was prescribed a similar medication, though the name escapes me now. he didn’t take it consistently but one of the side effects was that it would make him really dizzy, which he was unable to verbally express, but he had a couple of falls that weren’t due to anything else.ultimately, the medication which was to attempt to stagnate his worsening dementia, could have caused something more serious like a fall, etc., so the family just took the med away, no discussion. he didn’t know the difference. he takes zero meds for anything so it absolutely had to be the medication that was affecting him.as a concerned grandchild, don’t sell yourself short. i bet your family would appreciate your concern and involvement. i am pretty involved with my grandfather’s care, and i think i have a much more objective view since he isn’t my dad. he was the best grandpa ever, seriously, the absolute best. as a dad to my mom, she seems to have some childhood resentment towards him so sometimes her decisions are questionable to me. like sometimes she will say stuff, i’ll spare you the details, but her reasoning will be, “well, he used to force us to sit at the dinner table so now he knows how it feels.” and i’m like....are you for real? he’s 91 with the attention span of a toddler thanks to the dementia. he doesn’t even know my name anymore. anyway, so as a grandchild i think the perspective is a significantly less muddled. and i easily get to make decisions for him and no one questions me. like, he’s not alllowed to visit with family (because of covid), that was my choice. i know we all love him, but his safety trumps feelings, etc. good luck with your family!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l8erx4/grandma_has_a_subconscious_problem_taking_one/,Grandma has a (subconscious?) problem taking one medication specifically

"my dad died when i was 4 and my birth mom had nothing to do with me. my great grandmother and great grandfather adopted me when i was 4. however, my great grandfather died when i was 7. i'm currently 17 and live alone with my great grandmother. she has been showing signs of dementia for several years but recently it has gotten really bad. everyone around her knows she has it, but she wont get help. she constantly goes through old paperwork, neglecting to pay the bills because she looses them. i have a bank account and pay the bills when i can find them, but the money is almost out. she also wont trust me when i said i paid them and always asks questions about them. she wont pay the car insurance because she has to look over her ""bank statements"" all day and try to make sense of it. she wont get me a car, so i don't have a job. i'm fixing to graduate high school and cant sign up for college because i don't have someone helping me, and don't have a way to pay for it. she constantly babies me, wont let me out after dark because she is paranoid. she thinks the neighbors are the people that murdered her son, even though she has no reason to think they are. people avoid her because no one wants to deal with her. she is disgusting, she pees on herself and puts sheets over the seats and hangs her pants up to dry just to wear them again. she accuses me of stealing her money, which really hurts me because i would never do that to anyone. she asked me who a little girl in a picture was the other day (it was her grandchild). i'm mentally exhausted and my mental health is trash. i don't know what to do, she does not even have a will, so if she were to pass away i would have to deal with all the legal stuff and i don't know how to do any of that. she refuses to think she has any problem and calls me disrespectful all the time for getting annoyed with her. i feel like there is so much responsibility left to me and i don't know what to do, some days i wish she would just pass away and all my problems would go with her, but there would actually just be more. i'm also terrified to loose her because she is my mother, so i try to keep her as far away from me emotionally as i can, so when she does pass away it won't hurt as much, because i'm just used to people leaving me and that is my defense mechanism."," well you're not old enough to file for and get a conservatorship over her person or even think of applying for it but that's what seems likely to be necessary.my mother strongly resisted anyone touching her very meager personal finances but we went through with a conservatorship anyway.  of course she completely freaked out when she actually started having her bank accounts marshalled and her access to money shut down.  meantime end of the day she's learned to deal / live with it and is now in an independent living facility where her meals and accommodations are taken care of.my perspective is:1. you're clearly far too young to take personal responsibility for your great grandma.  even when you turn 18 and can legally take certain actions it's still a lot to ask of someone.  this is in no way a personal criticism of your character or abilities - just an observation that it is just a lot to ask someone your age to take on.  all this to say take the advice and help of people who do this every day.2. having said that i would work to get her under a conservatorship once you're legally of age.  is there absolutely no one in your family who could take on a conservatorship?  worst case the county you're in will assign a public conservator (essentially a welfare worker) however it's up to you and/or an adult in your family to start the process unless an agency like adult protective services gets involved and may act independently to start a conservatorship process.3. work hard to determine what medical options she may have through your state's medicaid system.  assumption is at a minimum your grandma has medicare and if she has medicaid.  medicaid would allow for more treatment options and coverage and could further subsidize her care.  note that depending on the state you live in and the deeming by your h&hs offices (welfare/health & human services; you should have local county-based offices who will ultimately be in charge of the conservatorship evaluation process most likely too) you could get paid to either take care of her yourself or pay someone to take care of her.  that could help considerably especially when you are of legal age and can get her under a legal conservatorship.i would see if you can get any adult in your family to assist with starting the paperwork for a conservatorship.  once you're old enough you can probably take over.  if you're almost 18 it may be easier to just wait a bit.take each step carefully and methodically.  remember the h&hs workers are vastly overworked and underpaid but they usually do genuinely care.she also needs some basic medical deeming for her cognitive issues.  yes it can be very tough to get someone with dementia in to see a doctor but i'd start with a general practitioner / internist first then see if they can refer her to a neurologist who can do a deeper evaluation.  when you're of age you should be able to get on as a medical power of attorney so you can then legally discuss her medical issues with the doctor.and remember this is a long game.  it took us over a year to make serious progress on a lot of these steps for my mom and really 1.5+ years until she was back living on her own in a retirement facility.  once you - or an adult in your family or a public conservator - has control of her finances they can make her financial decisions, make sure her bills get paid, etc. - and a lot of that stress goes away even if she's freaking out that she no longer controls her money.  given how apparently irresponsible she is over her money, personal hygiene, etc. you need to take steps to do what you can to help her or get others involved who can.   some people just let their elderly parents and grandparents wither away and die and it's heroic you're not willing to just let that happen.  keep at it and you'll get to the other side.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l87ei9/legal_guardian_has_dementia/,Legal Guardian Has Dementia

"i just want to quickly say that this is my first reddit post, so i'm not really sure what i'm doing but i needed to ask someone for help, at least.my grandpa has parkinson's and dementia. i knew he had the former since he was diagnosed a few years ago, but i only learned about the latter when my mom slipped up and mentioned it while we were talking about him. i think she wanted to hide that from me so i wouldn't be even more concerned about him. before, none of this really affected him much other than his hands shaking and him being a bit forgetful sometimes, but recently it's gotten so much worse. he's a very religious man and always has been, but now at least twice whenever i see him he'll go on very emotional rants about how i have to read the bible and pray every day, and i have to listen to god and all sorts of religious things. on at least three occasions (that i know of) he's gotten really mad and called my grandma the devil, and one of those times he went out the door and started walking down the road. my grandma absolutely does not help the situation at all. i don't know much about dementia or anything similar, but i do know that you're not supposed to yell at them or tell them that they're wrong about something they insist they're right about, and my grandma does exactly that. nearly everyone in the family has tried to tell her this, but she hasn't changed anything. he'll say he sees/ hears things, and my grandma will tell him he's crazy. he's also convinced that people are going to come and take him away to a care home, and my grandma will sometimes tell him that she just might call them to come get him if he doesn't stop. i feel horrible that can't do anything to help him, other than just visit my grandparents as much as i can. i live an hour to an hour and a half away and my grandma won't allow pets in the house, and i don't feel comfortable leaving my dog alone for so long (my mom is still there, but she's at work most of the day and my dog has severe separation anxiety). i'm doing school online, so i can bring my computer and still do my classes while i'm visiting them, that way i can stay longer than just a weekend.my grandpa says he sees and hears things all the time, too. he told my grandma that there's a motorcycle that drives past the house all the time, when there's nothing there. one night he woke my grandma up at around 3 in the morning saying he just had to chase some people out of the house. today, my aunt came to visit and she and my grandma were talking in the kitchen. the light from the window reflected off of her bracelet and onto the ceiling. my grandpa and i were sitting at the table and he tapped my shoulder and quietly asked me if i saw it. i just nodded and told him that it was from aunt's bracelet, and he just kind of discreetly shook his head and told me it was someone outside the house with a mirror. i know this is terrible, but i really don't know what to do or say around him, and it makes me really uncomfortable. i don't handle things like this well, and hearing my mom cry all the time because she's losing her dad makes it so much worse. i just don't know how i should act around him or talk to him. does anyone have any advice or anything to make it even a little bit easier?", my grandmother was strong woman who passed away at 104 with severe dementia. after that i started looking into dementia and formulate at pill that has showed effects on one person. he reversed from pooping his pants and not able to dress up and forgetting to back to normal and able to walk. second person it has been month have seen improvements. she is less agitated and eats on time . wants  to socialize.so i want to this to be available to everyone but don’t know how to not be sued by these big companies benefiting from people with dementia. advise,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l81lhp/how_do_i_cope_with_my_religious_grandpas_dementia/,How do I cope with my religious grandpa's dementia?
"i need to get this out the way. i don’t especially like my mom. it not an active dislike. it’s more we’re not friends , and never really have been. she’s always been really into classical music and i’m sure has some undiagnosed aspregers.as i wasn’t much interest in the same music as a kid she didn’t really engage much with me as weird as that sounds . by 11 i had my own life going on and she had no real interest . at 18 i moved out . i’m now 41.for 25 years i’ve been living in a different continent. have my own family and despite the covid suckiness that we all have i’m pretty good mental health and life .i came back around my mom when she got cancer . i was on hiatus from my job so moved back to england to look after her . i guess i had forgotten what she’s like . cancer cured but the dementia started.it’s pretty bad. police bringing her home twice in a week. scammed by plumber . spending 100s and 100s on nonsense . i don’t live with her but we all did and it out huge strain in my relationship and new baby. our son is now 2 and we live about an hour away. some weeks i’m there 3 times dealing with some bulls*it... lost keys or locked out of phone or something.  we got her a cleaner . she doesn’t like the cleaner . i get food delivered she moans whatever it is.we’re not close enough for this . i don’t care this much for how much i’m worn thin for someone i don’t really have much feeling for .it feels weird to call her mom. she’s a nan, but my mom is .... yeah . not feeling it .she was self absorbed when she didn’t have dementia and is 10x that now .so i feel guilty . i do t want her to be totally screwed . but i’m getting close to done with her turning down help from anywhere and anyone that isn’t me or her brother"," the dementia is not her fault but the way she treated you growing up is. you shouldn't feel obligated to be there for someone who wasn't there for you emotionally. i hope you can find a solution that gives you the space to live your life and care for your own family, you shouldn't feel guilty for wanting this but i understand that you feel responsible. i'm sure there is a middle ground you can find.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l7wozg/guilt_over_not_wanting_to_care/,[deleted by user]
"hi everyone,are there any adult diapers that meet the above description? thinking like the honest company diapers for adults? i think maybe a diaper that is less clinical would be more comfortable and confidence-supporting!", in the uk you can buy incontinence pants in black or with flowers- tena pretty i think they're  called. don't know if they would suffice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/l7u26v/ecofriendlyboutiquenonclinical_diapers/,Eco-Friendly/Boutique/Non-Clinical Diapers

"my parents divorced when i was 3 years, they werent a good fit for each other. my dad is a douche and my mother was horrible too. after they decided to move away, i went to my mom, they never spoke to each other or were even in the same room when i was present. my dad used to tell me about how horrible my mom is and how much money she was spending on herself.my mom has my bigger sister too, who is 10 years older. she was more of a mother to me. yet they both didnt help me growing up, my mom hit her and when she got older, they beat each other up. after an argument i used to be the one that mediated, told both of them to like each other again, when i wasnt even in elementary school yet. i dont know why no one ever called the police on them. when i was 5 my mom put my sister into a foster care and picked her up a week afterwards. because she was angry, she did that two more times and one time into a mental wards. always she told me that i would be next if i dont behave. even though i can talk about this now alot of my memories have been lost, like they are in a mist and i just forgot.i was the perfect child, my mom needed a best friend and i sure was hers. i didnt complain, my marks were always good, i was quiet and shy. books were my addiction. i could flee from my relaity and it gave my comfort.my sister mived out early and it was better for all of us. when i was 8, my mom tried to commit suicide. i found her in the bathroom and all the blood around her. no one in my family knows it. who does this? she had a child and she had to look out for me. it hurts so freaking much even today.a ew years later she finally got to know another guy, after 3 months he moved in with us. he is a psychopath, never told us about his job and after a few more months we found out he is in 3000 dollars of debt. even though he told me mother he makes 25.000 a year. he was living on wellfare.my mom had an accident when i was 11, she fell into a coma and afterwards she had dementia. the psychopath married her, i think its because he can just have someone listening to his every will. she changed ..... not for the better, telling me i am fat and a dissapointment. sometimes she doesnt even remeber who i am.i moved to my dad, he already had my stepmom and little sister, i didnt fit into that family. depressed and shy. my dad didnt know what to do after not knowing me for such a long time. my stepmom was mean. i heard her call me names, sl\*t, b\*tch, wh\*re and that i am worthless. she knew that i could hear her and my dad. he never defended me. my dad canceled therapy for me.the new school was terrible, the class i was in already had groups formed. i was the odd one out and even the friends i had, i knew they talked bad about me. i heard the laughter and i couldnt handle it. i started eating in the bathroom stalls. listening to music when i was out of the lessons, because i got scared and everything was too loud otherwise. my art teacher was the only one that got to me. he died a few years ago.when i got home, i coudlnt eat, couldnt handle the household. i went up into my room, with my clothes on i went to bed. there were times were i peed my pants, i am ashamed of it, but i just coudlnt go down. i got up 1 hour before everyone else, so that i could eat without my family. i lost 40 pounds. didnt sleep well. or too muchat 14 years i tried to commit suicide. i begged my dad to let me go into another school, that was the only time i saw him blow up at me. he locked me in my room from then on a few times. i didnt care anymore. if he found me it would have been his punishment. but then i remembered that my sister would have been the first one to find me. i couldnt do that to her. i never told anyone about it.i got into a relationship when i 16, my fist one, he was 11 years older. abusive, mentally and sexually. we were together for 3 years but then i started to study, moved away. it saved menow i am 21, living alone, studying social work, i want to help people not go through the same things as me. some people would think i made it. some told me i am strong. but i am struggling so much. i feel weak, i have diagnosed borderline, i am so scared to be alone and i start to cry when i am. my mom and dad arent in contact with me anymore. my dad only gives me money anymore. ifeel small, its hard to go out anymore. without headphones i cant do it. usually i barricade myself in my room and i shut myself off. i dont have many friends. everytime someone gets too close i push them away. someone who laughs behind me, a look, a joke. it makes me feel ugly and fat and worthless. i still cant eat when i feel bad, i still cant trust people. i left out a lot of stuff but the deal is this. i am trying to pull my life together, but sometimes its not working and i have bad days, where i want to die, where i am so angry i can smash my room or where i am so depressed that i cant even get up from my bed, today is one of those daystl;dr: my parents divorced, mom tried to kill herself, got bullied in school, still struggling"," sweetheart you can do this you have come this far. you will be tempted with certain thoughts and you can choose which thoughts to give your time to. you will be a helper and inspiration in this world. those people don't control you. your past doesn't decide your future. in fact, it doesn't exist any longer. you are going to talk to yourself in a strong empowering way every morning when you get up okay. fake it for awhile but eventually you will start to believe....little by little. just keep moving forward. it will be tiny steps. i have been doing this for 30 years and it does get better. surround yourself with positive things. listen to affirmations and uplifting talks. there are a lot of encouraging things you can put into your mind. this is your battlefield - your mind. fight!",https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8vaa4e/life_story_of_a_broken_individual/,,life story of a broken individual
"i’m 32 and i have been taking care of my now 91 year old grandmother for about 3-4 years now. i left my previous job because of health related issues. while looking for a more suitable job, my grandma’s mind went downhill and she was diagnosed with dementia. she also had a stroke and could no longer live alone. so i, not knowing how hard it would be, stepped up to the plate as caregiver. don’t get me wrong i don’t really regret it. i gave my grandmother my room, and i now sleep in a recliner in the living room. i have lost a lot of sleep, and most of my me time is late at night in-front of my computer watching youtube. i no longer have the want or desire to paint or draw anymore. it’s not laziness either. my mother says it is, but i don’t think i’m lazy if i take care of my grandma 24/7, cook meals for the family, and clean the house everyday. i haven’t been diagnosed with any mental disorder, but i have never gone to speak with a doctor about it. being unemployed makes it hard to afford or even get health insurance. so... no doctor and i have no idea why i am the way i am. i am almost positive i have anxiety. i am always worried and nervous, and panicking when the smallest things go wrong or change. my chest gets tight and i feel like nothing is ever going to go right again when this happens. my mood also seems to change at the drop of a hat. i go from chipper and happy, to angry or panicking, or i get really really depressed. not wanting to do much, feeling hopeless, useless, and with “dark thoughts”. i’ve also been a bit paranoid lately. i’m not going to go into it, but sometimes i’ve come to the weirdest conclusions, and believing them until my mom talked me out of it.lately i’m sitting at depressed because my mom’s legs are doing bad. she has an infection on her skin and it looks terrible. i feel helpless, i don’t know how to help her. grandma has changed so much now and it hurts to see her that way. my dad doesn’t really want to be involved, and the only other family members that could help ran away. lets just say aunt a and uncle b ran away  to another state because they were pissed that they weren’t given my grandmother’s house after she built them one, and bought them another property after they sold the first. sorry this is tmi, but i really haven’t had anyone to talk to... there is so much more, but i don’t know where to continue. i just feel like the girl who is slowly disappearing. i will be nothing when all of this is over. just the woman who lives with her parents, and looks five years older than she actually is..."," i feel these ""dark thoughts"" and depression you're experience is acclimated with lack of quality sleep and not having the freedom to do what you want (i mean, you're young, having fun should be what you do). what you're describing (chest pain and panicking) sounds like anxiety to me (i have it as well).it's unfortunate when siblings runoff when their parents get sick. i'm willing to bet, almost every family will experience this. i'm currently experiencing this with my client. she has alzheimer's and lives with her daughter. but her 3 other kids couldn't care less. however, the daughter, who has power of attorney, is fixing this by giving herself more when her mom dies. which i think you should do. if people cannot take care of their sick parents when the time comes, it shouldn't be split evenly, if 1 kid takes the burden, while the others are mia.now, is there any way for you to leave the house and have your mom watch your grandmother? you need a break. do you have any friends you can stay with, just for the weekend? just so you can get some r&r?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/8drizy/i_need_to_vent/,,I Need to Vent...
"background, 15 months caregiving for 89 years of mother with vascular dementia, with anxiety disorder, she lives with me.  last 2 months i developed panic attacks, numb feet, hands, and lips with chest pains, just increasing exercise to treat, no medications.  mom was a legal sectary and i have been helping with her taxes.  which has been a nightmare.  i work full time and i am on two community boards. i don’t have time to be as detailed as she wants so we were in constant disagreement.so, for past 10 days it’s been especially high stress with her.  i finished up yesterday, made a mile stone on community event i am putting on, yet when i call her to let her know everything is done.  she has forgotten all about the last 10 days, doesn’t care about her taxes, and when i got home has return to nearly normal.  *i did sort of snap inside, really, know she doesn't remember*i slept great last night, now instead of chest pains, i have a super warm chest buzzy feeling, lips tingly and hands and feet super warm, very clear minded and calm.  anyone other caregivers experience this?i feel so suddenly relaxed today, i almost thinking i should stop to be check out.", hi. i send you virtual hugs. i have not experienced what you described but i do know stress from caregiver role to 87 year olds. i hope you find time in your obviously busy schedule to schedule some self care. i take lots of epsom salt baths and drink chamomile tea all day long.  peace be with us. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/8a3b2x/any_thoughts_panic_attacks_suddenly_change_to/,,Any thoughts?

"hello fellow caregivers, i'm glad to have found this sub.  it'll be nice to have other people to talk to.  the story up to now:i am now 42, i have epilepsy and am on disability, my daughter lived with my mother as her guardian as i couldn't provide as well for her.  my mother has been an rn for 40some years, she works in upper management in insurance and has for about 20 years.  she is single.  my sister and her family live in town close to ma's, as does my mother's brother, who we have calculated has spent .1% of his time with his parents since this all started.at this point, due to ma working 70 hours a week or so and having a 50 mile one way commute as well as many business trips, we have yet to finish cleaning out their old house.  my uncle went to help us once early on, we had to keep pulling things out of the dumpster that were important, he also sold some possessions to his brother-in-law for next to nothing and tried to do the same with their truck and boat so we can't let him up there alone.  utilities are still being paid and someone maintains it for them.  he's proud of it, he literally built it with his two hands, but his memory of it is foggy now.  they take him by whenever they go up to that town, sadly that has mostly been for the funerals of grandma's and his sisters.  mentioning this also bc of him still having all of his accounts and property, so he has to pay directly for someone to take care of him.7 years ago in january my grandparents needed to move in with my mother for medical reasons.  grandma had nearly died from blood loss due to an ulcer and papa's memory isn't good enough for him to live alone.  ma had been building a house at the time with a room and accommodations for them and driving to their home 80 miles away weekly to check up, but the emergency occurred a month before the house was finished.  so we moved them temporarily into the house she had at the time while grandma was in the hospital.  about a week after she was released, papa had an appendicitis attack in the middle of the night, in the middle of a blizzard, seizing on the floor while grandma tried to walk over him with her walker to get to the bathroom.  we don't do things easy in our family it seems.  papa has a bit of dementia, but he still has a pretty good grasp on things, just short term memory issues, and grandma had a few mini-strokes which caused her to be a much different grandma than i had grown up with; she was suddenly racist, grumpy, and a bit spiteful.  papa would ask about every 10 minutes for a week why he was wearing sweatpants and why his side hurt.  when i'd tell him about getting his appendix out, he'd just say, ""well that's damned silly at my age."" and chuckle and let it go.  he knows he can't remember, but he remembers the important things and so far hasn't gotten depressed about it.as my mother works full time out of town and they could not be left home alone, i became the caretaker when she was gone.  initially this was meds, meal prep, putting the foot rest up and down for grandma every couple of minutes and assisting her with cleaning and bathroom duties.  she was incredibly specific about what she would eat (for months it was thin hamburgers, instant mashed potatoes, and brown gravy from a mix; and god help you if that hamburger patty was too thick or too large) and we had to correct her sudden racism and political rants in front of my daughter and my sister's children.  grandma also drove my mother to calling me on the phone in tears a few times at first just being spiteful about things.  my sudden absence from home for extended periods of time gave my then so an excuse to start drinking again after 6 years of sobriety, so my home life went to shit. we finally got them moved into the new house and after a few months of pt grandma was able to get around with a walker and papa was there to help with physical things, she was his memory, and she owned the remote control.  at this point, with a new cell phone, they were okay to be left home without supervision as long as ma got home at night and anytime she was on a work trip i stayed so they felt safe.  granted, i can't drive, but my sister and daughter both could and my sister lived nearby and were always on call.  my uncle lives less than a mile away but until this past may hasn't had a cell phone (which we gave him and forced him to use) and it could take days to get ahold of him.things were pretty good with grandma and papa for the past few years, she even got her sense of humor back somewhat.  i got rid of the so after many years of misery and now am with someone who appreciates family and isn't a drunk.  he puts family first and loves my family.  pretty much as soon as he moved in with me this feb though, a bunch of shit happened at once.  grandma was at an md appt and the pa didn't lower the bed or steady the step when she was getting grandma off the examining table and she ended up falling and shattering her ankle on one side and her knee on the other side.  they didn't notice the damage immediately so she ended up in a wheelchair but still taking some steps, incredibly painfully and with assistance, on them for a few weeks.  we hadn't had hhc in yet and as a full lift she was draping herself around my neck because that's how she felt safe and killing me.  when we finally taught her how to properly get up from the chair to rotate to bed or toilet, the weight and sudden stops for when a bad twinge of pain would hit her ended up causing me to hurt the hand she used to put her weight on.  it still isn't right, but at the time i assumed it was overuse so if i fractured anything, it's too late now. one night she tried to be tough when i was there and didn't call out to have help in the bathroom, while papa was in the er with ma for a coughing issue.  she fell ofc.  we ended up with both of them in the er within a week, she had been coming down with a cold as well.  at this time she was 85 and he was 92.  papa was so worried about her, they were a room away from each other with ma and i bouncing between, and i witnessed my papa cry for the first time in my life, he was so scared he was going to lose her when she was right next door and he couldn't see her.  she wasn't as bad off as he was except for the knee and ankle, but he couldn't remember that part.  we had to keep assuring him that she was fine and one of us with each of them at all times.the mds came to their senses after new x-rays on grandma and put her in a chi pt rehab facility with a no weight bearing restriction.  as often happens, she developed pneumonia, got transferred back to the hospital, and we lost grandma last may.  we made sure papa got in to see her every day in the hospital and finally to say goodbye before she passed.  i'm crying again, i hadn't done that for years before grandma died.  we promised grandma that we would keep papa at home.  so since march they have needed to have someone there 24/7, and now papa needs the same.  we'd had hhc for a bit and asked the rn we thought was the best (never talked to papa like he was a child, etc) if she could suggest someone like herself for taking on a few days a week of papa-sitting and also taking care of the dogs and doing up meals and dishes.  there's a lazy mini dachshund named daisy and ma's ""i need something happy in my life while everyone is in the hospital"" rescue puppy, peanut who is half mini d and half, wait for it, mini jack russell.  she's been chewing her way through every item in the house since a week before grandma passed (my sis and daughter snuck her in to see grandma in the hospital and got a smile out of her, then got kicked out.)  so it's a wee bit more than just sitting around with a nice old man who naps quite a bit and likes nature and cooking shows, but not much more.  she suggested her daughter who is a cna that was taking online classes, we met her and tried her out and she is great.  she even bakes and cleans the bathrooms.when i'm not there ma sleeps in a recliner in the living room so she can hear if he gets up.  with her job, stress levels, and thyroid issues, she maybe gets 4 hours of sleep during the week, and as he gets up to go to the bathroom and get a drink 5-10 times a night, those hours are interrupted.  when i'm going to be staying with him the next day, i sleep on the couch so she can sleep in her own bed.  at home i get 10 hours of sleep or more easily, there, not much and that causes me seizures after 2-3 days in a row.last month the girl told us she'd only be available tuesday and thursday for her next semester of school, which is a shit schedule for me but, trying our best.  today, the first day of classes, she texts me an ""oh shit!"" and lets me know she has class every day during the week and wants to set up something like me doing t/th mornings and then she'd drive me home at noon and take over, but then also m/w/f she wanted to come in at 3, but wouldn't be able to take me home. so basically she can barely work and lately she'd been picking me up at 5 on some of her days bc she had plans for before my mother got home, which is often late, though she tried to be home early for her.  all of these trips involve papa having to ride along with.i spend over half of my life at ma's.  papa keeps forgetting that i don't live there.  i've caught myself at my apartment saying, ""yeah, i'm going home at 5:00"" referring to their house.  now i will be staying there sunday night through friday evening until we can find someone to replace her.  were it closer to summer my sister's kids could, but for now, we're just floundering.my mother is working past midnight when i'm there and going in at 3am on nights she gets home before that.  she's under so much stress that i think she should get a hotel room some of those nights instead of driving home - last week once with her windows down, singing to stay awake.  my daughter is in her last year in uni and is doing as much as she can, and my sister works full time as well but she and her husband and kids do everything they can to help too.  i actually got my uncle to spend a few hours there the other night when the gal had to leave early yet again and i was still catching up on sleep from a 3 day stretch.  but even when he does come to do something, he doesn't give ma long enough to do anything, maybe 2 hours.  she takes him out to meals regularly, she takes him to every farmer's market, we went to the zoo a few years ago, he's a constant fixture on our whole family's facebook pages, everybody loves papa.  my uncle doesn't facebook so he's not even seeing any of this.  there are probably 50 people out there who could tell you his breakfast order by heart, they know all of the stories he's told that we faithfully record, and just generally know *him* better than his son does.  in addition to housing, med prep, paying for meds, food prep and paying for food, setting up and driving to md appts, laundry and housekeeping, and being a good daughter, she also spends time with her grandkids and daughters and buys extra groceries every weekend that she ""drive by drop off""s to my daughter, me, and my sister's family as well as my sister's ex as he has joint custody and is nice and she wants to make sure her grandkids and their father both are able to eat well.  i swear my mother is wonder woman.  she's set to retire in 2 years and is looking for property down in the gulf to have a winter home at for her and papa and the dog and the menace of a puppy to go to.  she's taking my niece to italy for a school function this year and trying to find time to take papa down to look for property, but he won't fly so it's a long bit of a drive.  she's on thyroid medication, and she forgets it at times, so i worry.  she's burning herself out hard, and i can't pick up all of the weight, i literally have seizures if i can't spend at least one day at home pretty much sleeping straight through after 2-3 days in a row at her place.  my sis and daughter try and are great for weekends, but i'm going to start being there every week day starting this upcoming week and i don't know how i'm going to handle it.  i miss spending time with my so.  i miss my bed and my cats and my comfy chair and my laptop.  i love papa and don't mean to sound like i don't want to be there, and i won't let anyone i haven't spent time with together with him be a new caregiver for him, but i'm exhausted.  then i look at my mother and wonder how in the hell she's doing it. she's done the driven work ethic thing for decades, and while i could work, i was the same.  now i need 10 or more hours of sleep and a lot of pills a day.  but she's doing that and everything else on top of it.  i fill the pillbox but she has to order the scrips, i can cook, but she has to get groceries, and i can't drive (and we don't have a vehicle so my so can't drop me off) so she generally has to pick me up and drop me off.  and then, there's the puppy.  the puppy that will literally go from dead asleep to bouncing off the walls (after sliding into them from the ottoman leap) and running a slalom path through the table and chairs, scrabble in the turn on the kitchen floors, and start doing laps at breakneck speed for about 10 minutes with a water break in the kitchen once or twice.  the puppy that has eaten papa's slippers, most of her toys, anything cloth she can get her teeth one, the rungs on the chairs, part of the floor of the deck, the bottoms of the cabinets, 4 dog beds, multiple pens, and -when he doesn't hit the door all the way shut and she can sneak into his bathroom -papa's razors from the trash.  the puppy that is scared of snow shovels (we had to give her 3 days of immersion therapy with one in the middle of the floor) and snow and needs to be on a chain to go potty, but only if the weather's nice enough, thank you very much.  the puppy that will not sleep anywhere but on me when i'm on the couch for the night, that got the lazy dog moving again, that makes ma smile, and gets papa to play (and remember her name, yay! new memory!)  yeah that puppy, peanut is sweet, but she's a handful.i've gotten way off into rambling land.  i'm sorry.  having all of this to say, i wanted to explain things before i complained about the new schedule, and i guess i got caught up in a stream of consciousness. anyway, that's our current situation.  i don't know how long it's going to take to find someone new that's suitable.  i don't know how long i'll be functional doing this.  i don't know how in the hell my mother does what she does and what i can do to help her more.  i'm frustrated with a puppy.  i'm resenting my uncle.  i'm missing my so and my home.  if you made it through this, wow.  thank you for reading."," hang in there, sounds like you are in the mix! rest, eat, try to laugh, even if its stupid cat videos

"warning: turned into a bit of a vent!hey everyone, recent lurker and first post! 29/f/east coast us here. i’ve been caregiving full-time for my mom’s younger sister (62), who has early onset alzheimer’s, for 2 years since i was 26. my mom and i recently gave up the reigns of caregiving to her kids because i was experiencing pure burnout. i was also juggling caregiving separately for my dad (divorced from mom) who is suffering from end-stage cirrhosis and awaiting liver transplant. he now needs full-time care. i graduated college and left part-time work to take care of my aunty and my dad. personally, i also struggle with major depressive disorder and anxiety, exacerbated of course with caregiving. (favorite coping mechanism? lol. getting lost in other characters’ lives on netflix binges like everything sucks and on my block.)i’ve been struggling lately with a very heavy sense of being left behind- professionally, mentally, socially. many of my friends and peers have graduate degrees, are already years into their careers, are getting married, buying houses, having kids or just able to go out to dinners or meet up over drinks and talk about things they have achieved or are pursuing. their lives may not be perfect, but their lives are at least progressing.  i feel stuck and left in the dust. i feel like life has paused before i even got a good chance to start. my own sibling who decided to move far away is established in their career, bought a house, got 2 dogs and is getting married in a year.  there’s a lot of family tension and rifts because a lot of people on different sides feel some are contributing while others aren’t, some people are getting praised for what they do while others aren’t. (i have my share of resentments, but i won’t delve into that here.) you all know the deal.anyway. bottom line is it’d be great to have more of an understanding, empathetic support system. i have a couple of sweet friends and an amazing partner, but i often feel like the “negative nancy” or that i’m repeating the same issues. are there any other young, unemployed unmarried caregivers who are experiencing similar stuff that would want to create a chat group? talk to each other throughout the day when we have pockets of downtime? vent or complain about the day? but also talk about light, fluffy things so we’re not a complete pool of misery lol. things we’re watching on netflix? hobbies? articles we read? maybe plans or goals? i know the issue of feeling left behind or stalled isn’t solely for young, unemployed caregivers, that’s just where i fall! if you feel you relate to anything and would also benefit from a support chat group, please comment or message!"," believe me i also know what you mean. i’m 32 and i have been taking care of my now 91 year old grandmother for about 3-4 years now. i left my previous job because of health related issues. while looking for a more suitable job, my grandma’s mind went downhill and she was diagnosed with dementia. she also had a stroke and could no longer live alone. so i, not knowing how hard it would be, stepped up to the plate as caregiver. don’t get me wrong i don’t really regret it. i haven’t been diagnosed with any mental disorder, but i have never gone to speak with a doctor about it. being unemployed makes it hard to afford or even get health insurance. so... no doctor and i have no idea why i am the way i am. i am almost positive i have anxiety. i am always worried and nervous, and panicking when the smallest things go wrong or change. my chest gets tight and i feel like nothing is everything going to go right again when this happens. my mood also seems to change at the drop of a hat. i go from chipper and happy, to angry or panicking, or i get really really depressed. not wanting to do much, feeling hopeless, useless, and with “dark thoughts”.lately i’m sitting at depressed because my mom’s legs are doing bad. she has an infection on her skin and it looks terrible. i feel helpless, i don’t know how to help her. grandma has changed so much now and it hurts to see her that way. my dad doesn’t really want to be involved, and the only other family members that could help ran away. lets just say aunt a and uncle b ran away because they were pissed because they weren’t given my grandmother’s house, after she built them one and bought them another property. also i’m not married, don’t have kids, and i feel like my career is gone. with that, my self esteem is down the tube. sorry this is tmi and a bit depressing , but i really haven’t had anyone to talk to... i tend to hermit a lot. i’m terrified of talking on the phone sometimes, and it’s hard to get out of the house. i have to force myself ti take my grandma to the doctors some days. there is so much more, but my mind won’t work anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/87sv1l/just_curious_how_many_young_caregivers_2030s_are/,,"Just curious how many young caregivers (20/30’s) are there in here who are unemployed, unmarried, no-kids and struggling with their own mental health?

"not a caregiver, but i could really use some advice on how my family can deal with the issues caused by my great aunt and uncle right now (both in their mid-80s).just a quick background: my parents, sisters, and i are the only family my aunt and uncle have, we all live 1+ hour driving time (one way) from their house, and obviously we love both of them very dearly.my aunt and uncle have each had their health problems over the years, but we are now at the point of no return. my uncle can no longer take care of himself, and even though he knows it, he refuses all help unless it's coming from my aunt. that last part might sound like a good thing, but it's not. my aunt is not capable of taking care of him for a variety of reasons, with the most difficult being that she refuses to see the reality of the situation. i cannot imagine the pain she has endured watching my uncle deteriorate the way that he has, and i understand that she is being faced with some unbearably hard truths, but that does not change the fact that she is allowing (and a lot of times forcing) my uncle to put himself in dangerous positions. she will still send him to get something from their basement even though he's had trouble keeping his balance lately. she asks him to fix stuff around the house even though he loses track of what he's doing and makes things worse. the most extreme example i have, which i only mention to show the gravity of this situation, is her letting my uncle lie face down on the floor for hours after having a stroke because she ""thought he was sleeping"".i feel like normally my family would be in a good position because my aunt and uncle are very well off financially and could afford any type of help they needed, but both of them refuse to acknowledge that it's necessary. we have tried everything we could think of at this point, but it wasn't much. my parents have more or less given up because they've tried things over the years (begged my aunt and uncle to move closer to us, spoke with them about independent living and assisted living facilities, etc.) and nothing has worked. they also say that we cannot force them to do anything they don't want to do, and that they don't want to anger them and ruin the time we all have left together. i went over to their house recently and had a heart-to-heart with my aunt (told her how sorry i was for what she is going through, told her my perspective, offered my help) but that didn't lead anywhere either. if i was able, i would be their live-in caregiver in a heartbeat.  anyone in my family would do that. unfortunately, we all have full-time jobs or are full-time students, and it wouldn't matter anyway because my aunt and uncle wouldn't want that. i just don't know what to do about what's coming...my uncle isn't going to get better, and i'm afraid he will die in terrible accident around the house, which my aunt will have to witness, if my family doesn't do something. but what can we do? edit: in my rant i forgot to mention that my uncle has recently been diagnosed with dementia (though we've suspected it for years)"," in my experience, it has to be their idea to get help.  they fear losing control and so hold onto it fiercely.   all you can do is to keep gently nudging them to accept help.  usually the elderly don't want to accept help because they don't want to be a burden on others.  what they don't understand is that by refusing help they are a bigger burden.  there are lots of in home services like home instead, visiting angels, etc.  there is also a referral service called ""a place for mom"", you tell them what you are looking for and they'll have the right people get in touch with you.  also check into your area wide aging agency.  they also have loads of information.

"i was a natural caregiver all of my life. even as the youngest child, i always tried to care for my mother and older sister. this was my nature with friends and lovers, too. i never had children, but always had a strong maternal instinct. i helped my mother care for my grandmother after a stroke and then dementia, but she was already in assisted living and we had a lot of help. my mother was diagnosed with cancer in the spring of 2014 and by september of 2015, she was gone. i worked full time and cared for her daily. her first round of chemo had to be administered in the hospital. that caused congestive heart failure, but she was given meds to reverse it and continued on with treatment. ladies from her church group organized a weekly schedule to take her for chemo. i would work all day and then go directly to her house to make sure she had whatever she needed and see that she was alright. i went to the pharmacy, the grocery store, and visits to see her oncologist. i did all of her cooking, housework, and helped her with baths. i had to ask about, keep asking, and finally complete a will for her online. my sister helped very little during all of this time. she would help if i asked specifically for her to do something, but she'd do as little as possible and then accuse me of being irrational if i complained. i was so disappointed and frustrated with her throughout that time. my mother was very strong in her faith and believed that she would receive a miracle, so the entire time she was dying, she was making plans for the future, which made talking to her about what i needed to do to get her affairs in order almost unbearable. mother refused to come stay with me. finally, when i could no longer lift her, the pain and symptoms of dying were unmanageable on my own, i had to make the decision to call in hospice. i had to tell her. she accused me of giving up on her. my rational mind knew that the disease and chemo had affected her mentally, too, but it still broke my heart to hear those words and see her eyes. i tried so hard to take care of her, and there's a lot more about the condition of her house that i had to deal with but won't go into it here. it was the hardest time of my life. after she was gone, i was so indescribably lost, and still so busy with probating the will, sending death certificates, making sure her mortgage was paid, cleaning out her house and eventually selling it. i had missed so much work in the last six weeks of her life that i had to go back immediately after her death. i could never stop. i had to keep going, just like before, except i also was grieving and beyond tired. i was exhausted in every sense of the word. i still am. i hadn't really recovered when my sister had to have rectocele surgery in january of 2016, three months after mom's death. the recovery for her was not easy. she stayed with my fiance and me for a couple of weeks to allow me to care for her. i took off a few days when she first came home but then had to go back to work. she would leave our house during the day when i was working and go to her house or do whatever she wanted, then come back for me to wait on her hand and foot during the evenings. i was frustrated with her, but showing her a ton of grace. a couple of months later she was diagnosed with breast cancer. she had a bilateral mastectomy but opted not to endure chemo or radiation because it was caught early, very small, and completely contained and removed. don't get me wrong. i am overwhelmingly grateful to still have my sister and to have her cancer free! her mastectomy july 2016. after the absolute hell of tissue expanders, she opted for the biggest implants her plastic surgeon would allow. incisions never completely closed. areas of thin skin around both incisions worsened rapidly. both were infected and had to be removed and replaced with smaller implants. again, thin skin and infection caused one of them to have to be replaced with an even smaller implant. now, fluid is leaking from the incisions again, which have been sutured and re-sutured to no avail. she will have to have both implants removed and has scheduled another major surgery for breast reconstruction, diep flap, for january. i've been caring for off and on for the last year and she has stayed with us multiple times and seems to enjoy me waiting on her. i never fully recovered from caring for our mom for more than a year. almost ever since she's been gone, i've been caring for my sister in a completely different way, but when will it end? why do i feel like such a heel for not wanting to care for her anymore? she doesn't have a companion or anyone else to do it. before the second set of implants didn't take, she was planning to have cosmetic surgery to have her lady parts revamped, and she sort of seemed to be informing me so that i would need to help her. i just kind of went off and told her that i could not support a decision to have any kind of surgery that wasn't absolutely necessary, and that my well had run dry. she has backed off of that crazy idea, but now another major surgery is scheduled and i just feel depleted of the ability to give care. i'm sure i'm not alone with the guilt and shame. i just don't feel like i'm the same person anymore. i wish everyone well but i don't want to care for anyone, but myself. my heart goes out to all caregivers. i know the amount of time i've endured doesn't hold a candle to many other stories."," presuming she has insurance to pay for the surgeries, would that insurance pay for in-home care?

"hello,a few years ago my dad became very ill and had to go to the hospital. while in the hospital it was determined that he was no longer capable of living on his own primarily because of his mobility issues. before he was showing signs of memory loss, but while in the hospital, his memory deteriorated further. naturally, it was decided that my father would move in with us. at my lawyers advice we had my dad sign a poa before moving in with us. this became a major issue. we had forgotten that we had taken my dad to make a poa over 20 years ago, which named me and my brother joint poas. in addition, we were unaware that my brother had taken my dad to sign a new poa that made us joint poas and also drafted a new will that was to my brothers families advantage, in secret. me and my brother have had a toxic relationship for years. when my brother found out about the change in the poa he was understandably upset. he demanded that we retract the most recent poa and honor the poa that he had taken my dad to make in 2009. at the same time he started trying to convince my father that his finances were under threat and that i was taking advantage of him, and that he would take him to make a new poa.several months later we sold my father's house, as it was no use to him anymore, and shortly after my brother served us with a court application alleging that my father lacked the mental capacity to sign the new poa while in the hospital and alleged that me and my family were siphoning money from my father's account. the legal proceedings dragged on for more than a year. during this time my father was assessed and informally deemed incompetent. we passed the accounts and my brother objected to virtually every disbursement and tried to argue that my father's finances were being handled incompetently. he demanded that we reimburse my dad most of the money. in addition, he argued that we should not be compensated for managing his property or for the personal care we provide, on the basis that his previous poa explicitly stated that the poa would not be compensated. finally we went to mediation and a settlement was reached. essentially, he acknowledged the legitimacy of the most recent poa. he agreed on a management plan that was based on how we had been spending my dad's money since he had moved in with us. he agreed that the compensation we had been taking for personal care was reasonable. we did not have to reimburse my father for any of his disbursements. we agreed that we would send him the accounting every month and receipts upon request. although he accepted the most recent poa, there was a caveat. we agreed not to take compensation for managing my dad's property for the period within the passing of accounts, but were paid out a similar figure from my dad's estate to cover our legal fees as part of the settlement, anyways. the partial minutes explicitly state that my brother reserves the right to challenge us if we try to claim compensation for management of property in the future.we're getting ready to pass accounts again and are wondering how successful we would be if we were challenged by my brother. he's going to claim that the last poa stated that no one is to receive compensation, therefore we shouldn't. our thinking is that (1) in his own affidavit he stated that my dad started showing signs of dementia almost a year before that poa was signed and (2) the previous poa had no such provisions and it doesn't seem in my father's character to not want to compensate us.  (3) that stipulation seems incredibly out of character for my father. he has always compensated us for any help we've provided. it's just the way he is.

"so i've worked with clients who are developmentally disabled and also have different mental illnesses. there were some personal factors going on in my life that interfered with it so i ultimately quit. fast forward some months and i'm thinking that perhaps i'd rather work with elderly people. i applied at a company and they called me for an interview on thursday. then this morning they call me back and actually offer to have me working with someone who needs 24/7 care. i'm told she has dementia, needs assistance with most everything, not too well physically. i think ""ok this will be challenging but i feel capable taking this on."" my mil worked in caregiving so i asked her opinion and she mentioned ""well people with dementia may get frustrated easily and be mean."" but i don't feel that anyone being mean to me, or even physically hostile is a deal breaker. (my problem with my previous clients were that they were young enough, with goals to achieve, yet they did not actually want to change themselves.) i've been trying to ground myself about the situation. this is someone who just needs care and is not setting out to achieve goals or do more in life. i feel well enough to be able to assist this person with their daily needs and be there. what can i expect from a situation such as this? i'd be working three 13 hour days, which isn't entirely new since i worked a couple 12s each week at the previous company. also i have an interview/likely offer at another job that i'm considering taking for the other 4 days of the week. it's not healthcare, just barista work which i love. it's very relaxing and much like a hobby to me. i am concerned about burnout but i feel that having something that i think is fun to do will keep me focused (rather than having 4 days off to potentially do nothing.)"," i got to watch my grandma become like she was as a little kid. so moody, so stubborn and independent willed, but so helpless and need all day help. it dawned on me that we were extremely lucky that her last boyfriend and dance partner was a skilled caregiver. the key is to find something that gives them a warm feeling as from a distant memory. you might brush up on some child psychology while you're at it...",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/51nw4j/curious_about_what_to_expect_with_dementia_care/,,Curious about what to expect with dementia care
"so i have been a professional care giver for about five years now.  i have worked with various disabilities both physical and intellectual, terminal diseases, brain injuries, dementia.  i also have worked with people of all ages from children to geriatrics.  i now currently work with three men in their 20s who all have disabilities.after reading about me before you, i'm very uncomfortable about how much people are taking to this story.  i find it very disturbing that any hired caregiver would start a romantic relationship with the individual he/she is working with.  not only does the person she works with have a disability, but also is battling depression and has attempted suicide.  to me, this would be the same as starting a romantic relationship with a person in a psych facility for suicidal ideation.  being a caregiver who mainly works with the male population i pray that the family members do not compare this character to me.  i take my job very seriously and i do care about the guys i work with, however i would never push those boundaries. also for any of those familiar with the story, is lou hired help from a home health care service?  how is she not concerned about losing any licenses or certifications for sexual abuse?  i'm very concerned about the effect a movie like this is going to cause and i am interested to see if anyone else feels the same way."," i don't think you have anything to worry about, because lou is not trained to be a caregiver at all. she isn't trained to do anything at all, this was the only job she could find. will has an actual medical caregiver as well, he just isn't there all day so they hire someone to make sure will doesn't commit suicide again.i liked the book, but i am also not any kind of certified caregiver, i just live with my intellectually disabled aunt, so i didn't think of that aspect while reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/4mhr7i/what_are_your_thoughts_on_me_before_you/,,What are your thoughts on Me Before You
" he had been to a kennel last week and i think he caught kennel cough, but it was tough on his old bones. he was wobbling all over the place, peeing, coughing, throwing up, and needed to be carried up the stairs. to be really honest i think he probably may have recovered from it. the thing is, he had been battling severe anxiety and dementia for over a year. he was on so many meds and was starting to build a resistance to them - he had not been my boy for a long time and i secretly always felt guilty because it felt like it affected my love for him. he was such a handful at times. but the joy was gone from his eyes. he was indifferent, even towards me. when he was not passed out because of the meds, he was anxious ridden and would not be comforted.that day he fought all the needles and the sedative. they gave me a few minutes with him but there was no comfort in that because he was high out of his mind. so i really just feel like i betrayed him.seeing his body wrapped up in the blanket was too much... squeezing his paws and not getting a reaction. i wanted to pet his soft ears and his soft little head cause i know i never will again .he is so integrated into my thought life that i was saving my pizza crust to give to him before i remembered.. and i will go to grab his leash before i leave in the morning.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/w5bkwm/i_miss_my_pup/,,I miss my pup

"so, as the title text says, my dad has suddenly had to move in with us, and i'm absolutely overwhelmed. the story is as such: a couple of weeks ago i got a call from the police. apparently my dad, who lives alone 3 hours away since my step mom died, had called the police to complain about people having a sit in on the front lawn, and having broken into his house. the cops arrived, and my dad is talking to bushes and there's no one there. he's been bothering the neighbors about it too, who saw nothing. the police said they couldn't admit him to the er, as his vitals were good, but he refused to go back into the house, and then drove to the local gas station and started having a fight with an invisible person in his car, and the police were called again, and so i drove up the 3 hours, and took him all the way back home with me, where after a good deal of sleep and some discussion about the possibility of hallucinations (he was an er nurse and understands the concept very well), he calmed down and seemed to go back to himself, though i could notice a considerable disruption in his normal cognitive abilities. we took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway. so they set us up with an outpatient appointment the following week, and we set dad up in the guest bedroom. we've since had the outpatient appointment, and the psychiatrist basically said that he thought dad had a mini stroke, and it caused an onset of dementia, and he didn't think dad should live by himself anymore based on how he answered the questions. so now dad is moving in with me.first off, dad seems able to take care of himself in many ways, like hygiene and self feeding, but has issues with more complicated aspects of living. he can't really work the tv (he could if it was just turn it on and change channels, but the whole smart tv thing and multiple remotes has him stumped constantly, even with a regular cable box and two remotes). he also has a hard time working the keurig, with its 3 buttons, and can't manage his dumbed down little flip phone, accidentally deleting phone numbers, etc. this is a man who used to work regularly in excel for a clinical trial management service, and the man who introduced me to the internet, set up a computer in our house when dos was the os, and had an atari 2600 from release, so he wasn't a luddite, but now he can't use a computer to save his life. it's heartbreaking to see him futz with his seatbelt for 3 minutes, or with the ac knobs, or the tv remote we got him which only has about 6 buttons, but i used to work in mental health, and patient care isn't something i have a problem with.my problem is this: how do i begin dealing with all of his stuff? he has a whole three bedroom two bath house filled with 40 years of stuff. he has two cars and a truck, a rental house, and two empty parcels of land, all 3 hours away from us. and, i found out after going up there and going through all of his stuff, that he got depressed after my step mother died and hadn't dealt with any bills in almost a year, and his taxes and god knows what else were all kinds of screwed. the first thing i did was get all of his bills paid up, and i'm trying to deal with his finances, but i've found so much stuff i'm out of my depth on, like that he never made any claims on my stepmother's life insurance or anything, and he gets money through investments but he can't really tell me how that works tax wise or anything.here's where i am right now:- i've got his bills paid for april, and i'm working on may's. i have years worth of paperwork to go through and i'm trying to sort through it a little at a time.- we went up this past weekend and i had him label everything he wanted to bring down, and everything he wanted to keep or put in storage.- i put one car in the shop because he just left it in the garage for a year, and we got a new battery in the truck, and drove it back down to our house. the other car is so old i don't think it'll make the trip.- i got his neighbor to cut his grass for the time being, after getting dad's permission to tell him what's going on.- the current tenant of his rental house wants to buy, so i guess i need to figure out how to sell a house without a realtor, which i've never done before.- i've gotten the name of an estate sales agency, to maybe go through and sell all dad's other stuff, which is the only thing i can think to do to deal with all the stuff we can't keep, and i've gotten the name of a junk remover for whatever is left.- dad's house will bare minimum need a major landscaping overhaul (he's let his land grow up significantly, and there are trees down in the yard), and possibly a new roof and definitely new flooring if we're going to sell the house. he owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless. i don't know.- i've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and i'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if i'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.- i let dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now i'm managing them for him.the whole time this is going on, all i can think is am i doing the right thing? how is this going to affect my life? how is this going to affect his life? am i missing something? and i'm constantly second guessing myself and my actions and whether i'm doing the right thing at the right time.i have no resources. my wife is still employed, thank the gods, but i've been laid off due to the virus, which is the silver lining to all of this because i'm getting unemployment with the extra money for the time being while i use my time to help my father, but eventually that's going to run out or i'm going to have to get a job to maintain our home and pay for him until we can get his finances figured out.so, i apologize for the long rant, but i guess what this post is about, is that i need help and though i know more than some i've never dealt with this and i feel like i'm drowning in stress, i don't know if i've missed anything important, and i don't know what resources might be at hand for this.and hell, in the midst of all of this, how do i actually care for my dad!? i'm managing his meds for him, and making sure he gets food, of course, but i'm at a complete loss for how to occupy his time, and help his life be worth living, especially in the midst of this virus stuff.and, selfishly, i need to figure out how i make sure that my dad's life doesn't consume my own? i know my life is derailed currently, and there is now a new normal, but what's on track for me going to look like going forward, etc.any advice, or resources, or anything at all is helpful at this point."," \- get power of attorney so you can deal with his finances, his property and other matters. his wife's insurance money will come in handy once that gets settled. \- put his name in for an assisted living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. my mother's place has assisted living and memory care in the same residence, just different floors. it seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. \- if he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. before my stepdad even started hallucinating, he would get lost and sometimes even ended up in the ditch. finally his kids started ""borrowing"" his car for weeks at a time until he was diagnosed with lewy body dementia and was told not to drive. \- check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. many places have senior's social workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a seniors' center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. \- it sounds like you are doing all you can so far. it will be challenging but the hardest part  is now when things are in such a mess. he is lucky to have you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/ggvuc4/dad_71_coming_to_live_with_my_wife_and_i_after_a/,,"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia.

"my 72 year old mother has been forgetful (getting her dates wrong for major events like weddings, misplacing things, forgetting to pay bills) as long as she's been my mom, but her memory has been steadily getting worse over the last few years and she is now acting weird in other ways.she loses her train of thought mid sentence and just starts stating facts that are sort of related to the thing we were talking about. she asks me the same questions repeatedly, although this might be loneliness and her trying to keep me on the phone. she makes really weird decisions and gets super defensive when you ask about them. this year she started taking out large sums of cash and carrying it around on her. she couldn't have a bag on her at work, so she'd stuff bills in her pants pockets and every time she stuck her hands in her pockets and pulled them out she'd drop money. she was dropping multiple $20 bills every week. i know there must be a reason- she's forgetting her pin or losing her wallet or something, but she gets angry and refuses to speak to me if i push the subject.she has short bursts of very petulant, childlike behavior and paranoia. they usually only last a few minutes, but they are very different from her normal behavior. this is what concerns me the most, she has a different look in her eyes, like she's confused and frightened.this week she left a tap running for hours and flooded her bathroom.i've looked up early dementia signs online, but most of them assume the parent previously had the ability to perform essential self care tasks, which my mother never has. she lost most of her teeth by 40 because she wouldn't brush them or go to the dentist. she has never been able to feed herself regularly, pay her bills often enough to not have services cut off, etc. she has always been bad at looking after herself, which makes it really hard for me to tell if this is cognitive decline or just her norm + aging. my sister has mentioned a few moments when she seemed ""off"" to her, but doesn't believe there is anything majorly wrong. she was working full time up until the pandemic. she seemed to be performing fine at work, her coworkers speak highly of her abilities when i interact with them.i feel like i should suggest she see a doctor to be assessed, but it may cause her to become angry and secretive. she would rather lie than have people worry about her. she once purchased a second kindle because i asked to borrow her kindle and she didn't want to tell me she didn't know where it was. if this is fairly normal for a 72 year old and she's probably going to be stable at this level of functioning for a while i don't want to push her and cut off any truthful communication. if this is actually concerning behavior i'd like to talk to my sister about  how we should approach it with my mom."," you should definitely not ignore this. make an appointment with her primary to discuss what you are seeing and what she is experiencing. if they discount what you have noticed it is time to switch doctors and find someone who has a better understanding of dementia. in the meantime, contact your local chapter of the alzheimer's association for guidance. you do not need a diagnosis to get help. they will be able to provide a lot of guidance and education for you as you figure out what is going on. they also have lots of support groups for caregivers and for those with dementia or alzheimer's. find your local chapter here:  [ hope that helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gf0bam/how_worried_should_i_be/,,How worried should I be?
"i’m not sure if this is a rant or a call for advice. basically my grandfather and his wife had a workplace affair in the 60s, and one day decided to walk out on their spouses and children to be together. i say “walk out on” but she left, while he kicked my grandmother and their four children out of their home with a few days notice. they’ve lived a purposefully isolated and reclusive life ever since. my mother and i are the only ones who ever came around and she was very clear that she would rather we didn’t, and only put up with us because he made her. i hadn’t been around in a couple years due to distance, but recently moved a bit closer (2 hour drive). my grandfather passed away last week. apparently, she’s been living with dementia for a few years. she should have been placed in an assisted care home long ago as she cannot even be left alone, let alone care for herself in any capacity. we found out she hadn’t showered or changed her clothes in 3 months. she won’t eat unless you put a cooked meal in front of her. most of her day is spent sitting at their small kitchen table, and going in the bathroom every 10 minutes to smoke. mom and i are taking turns staying with her and everyone involved hates it. mom is power of attorney/proxy, and i am the alternate. her children made it clear they want nothing to do with the situation or to help in any way. she has about a 10 minute “reset” time as we’ve been calling it. following the doctors advice we initially planned to tell her he died once, and then remain vague. but she’s so mean (was when she didn’t have dementia) and keeps telling us to leave her alone. my mom lost her patience and started telling her over and over that he died. now i can’t go back to the vague answers because while she can’t quite remember, she’s been told enough that she has a vague idea (saying things like “no...something else happened”) and getting combative until we tell her. she’s convinced that we just need to leave and that she can handle their house, their 7 cats, and her own care by herself. it’s clear that she can’t because she doesn’t even think to feed the cats or do anything for herself. we’ve been in contact with a few nursing homes and one seemed like they’d take her. we even had an appointment on monday where we took her there and they talked and they said they’d give us a decision in 24-48 hours but now they’ve just been ghosting us even though they have 12 open rooms. we’re in a pretty rural area so that was pretty much our only nearby option. my mom is now under the impression that at the first sign that somethings wrong with her (she’s been complaining of a pain in her head for a few days) that she’s going to take her to the hospital, where we can hopefully get adult protective services involved since we also can’t get them on the phone. it’s making us physically sick to be in that house since they both smoked inside of it for half a century. my mom has to do the bulk of staying there since i’m still working and like i said, live two hours away. my mom and i are both so exhausted from caring for this woman that always hated us and to be honest we never cared for her much either, that i’m worried for my mom’s sanity and my own safety. i’m just so exhausted and i drive all day for work on top of the drive there all the time (on top of my job which is very high stakes and stressful because of covid-19) that i feel like i’m constantly on the edge of falling asleep or passing out. i know my mom isn’t the type to do anything rash but if you make someone suffer physically, put them on the end of verbal abuse from their “stepmom” 24/7 all while trying to process the death of a parent, i’m worried she will do something in the spur of the moment. we’re both just so angry with the situation, that he put this on us, and that it’s all happening during a pandemic which makes everything 100x harder. we don’t even have death certificates yet to access his bank account so everything for her and his cats has been coming from us, and we both struggle to support ourselves too.", wow that's really hard.  you and your mom are good souls for taking care of her despite the fact that i kind of feel like she's not really your problem. have you considered getting any county or state agencies involved since her family doesn't really seem to want to take care of her?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gbhwca/grandfather_passed_his_wife_has_dementia_and/,,"Grandfather passed, his wife has dementia and hated us when she didn’t.

(they are on amazon, under able life universal stand assist.) all of the physical therapists with home health who came to see him were impressed; none of them had ever seen anything like it and most asked me what they were called and where i got them so they could tell their other patients. they might be worth looking into for your dad.my grandmother is the narcissist in our family, and i am fairly sure she has dementia now too, but it is so hard to tell what is dementia and what is her usual  personality. she complains over literally everything; even if she loves something to begin with, she will complain later.

"hello world of aging parents. i have a challenge to overcome. i’ve been taking care of my mother. my husband and i have lived with her (in tight quarters) for over a year now. she’s on a dementia medication which improved her condition greatly. she has refused to take any medications recently, so she’s no longer on her anxiety/mood medication. the only diagnosis i ever heard for her, psychologically speaking, is borderline personality disorder, which appears to fit.my feelings oscillate wildly. often i think it’s not so bad. and then i go to places where i think the plan to move and leave her with an aid (to make sure she’s covered, needs wise) is all she deserves. she can be incredibly mean and also incredibly supportive and that’s her struggle. but i’ve felt that she let the worst parts of her get the better of herself. so i’m having a hard time biting the bullet and signing off for a lawyer to get her on medicaid and get her at-home care and disconnecting myself from the responsibility. my mom is against having her finances interrupted and having ‘a stranger’ help her with anything. this would mean both of those things. i also signed on to work out of state at the end of the summer, and my husband and i agreed that we should take some time to ourselves out there to get a foothold before having her come out, around 6 months of time. that means it is imperative to get that care set up for her. so there’s really “no option”.questions, comments, words of constructive criticism and/or support are all welcome."," the adjustment will be hard, but it sounds like it is what is best for all involved. reassure her that you are not disappearing forever, but want to go back to enjoying the role of daughter. it will be a good thing for all of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g4w5oj/support_needed_afraid_to_sign_papers_send_check/,,"Support Needed: Afraid to sign papers, send check for retainer to get mom community care"

"my mother will be 68 in july.  i'm 30 and an only child.  my father is 76 with alzheimers and starting to slow down severely.   ever since she married my father she never really had to pay bills.  she always had an obsession/addiction with spending money and shopping since i can remember.  she has been on social security for the last 6 or 7 years.&amp;#x200b;i have another post describing my backstory in more detail, but the main issue is that she is absolutely obsessed and fixated on attempting to get a 'loan' by any means necessary.  my parents still have a mortgage of around 190k on their home, which is in somewhat rough shape, and probably $50-150k in credit card debt for the two of them combined.   last year she started doing gift card scams and basically throwing her social security check away every other month to these scammers.  she continued on through the rest of the year and even convinced (and one month straight up took money from him) my father to give him money so she could get her big payday, totaling to $4300 (in 3 months time) and they missed 3 mortgage payments.  i feel awful for my parents because these people now call their home phone all day, every day, according to my elderly father with dementia; he is very fed up with it.  and they call mom's cell phone non stop it seems like.  everytime i am with her these people are calling her.&amp;#x200b;i have control of my father's ss benefits now ($\~1600), they go to my bank account and i have control, and we can slowly catch up on the mortgage ($1050).  but the problem is that she is getting \~$800 a month that she has been throwing away.  in january she gave it all away, in february the scammers cashed a check for around 500 and she closed her account with that bank and got $200 out and then immediately bought a gift card, and this past march she sent her whole check away in a money order to some guy.&amp;#x200b;i have durable power of attorney and healthcare power of attorney for both parents. i have sent my healthcare poa to her doctor and now have the ability to talk to him about her medical stuff, but when i called last week the nurse wouldn't let me speak directly to him and the only option i had was to make an appointment.  i think this week i'm going to call back to the hospital where he doctor works and just tell the nurse everything i was hoping to tell the doctor over the phone in hopes they understand how dire the situation is.  because i have asked my mom the past few days if she will go with me to talk to her doctor and she is very hesitant because i think she knows where that path will lead.    she also wanted me to put the payment for her timeshare \[that i'm not even sure she will be able to go to\] on my credit card ($900) and at one point told me to 'just do it' and i knew i had to put my foot down, so i didn't pay it.  i told her i would pay it if she signed over her ss benefits but she refused.&amp;#x200b;what the fuck can i do?   i'm almost certain she has some form of mental regression or mental cognition issues, i don't know what to call it really.  she has been on ambien for at least 10 years and i think that has caused some issues.  she has a terrible memory and often tries to tell me that things i know are true, aren't (like her taking $4300 from my dad for her scams).&amp;#x200b;the only other option i know of is contacting adult protective services (social services) and hoping they create a case for her.  she told me about 2 weeks ago that someone had already contacted her from social services because someone else had called in about her anonymously but i don't know if that gained any traction.  if you met her you wouldn't think she is that bad but she is 110% obsessed with these scams and it is making my life so much more stressful and difficult.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;i am covering their electric bill, groceries, car insurance, health insurance, and other things here and there for my parents, with a high interest credit card.  i know this is a terrible choice financially, and the interest is starting to kick my ass, but its my only option unless i go no contact and go back to social security and tell them i can no longer manage my father's funds.&amp;#x200b;i may also have to take out another loan to purchase them a new car at some point. they both drive older cars and i'm not sure how much longer they will last.  my mom drives about 25 minutes to take care of her elderly mother (98) once a week for two nights).&amp;#x200b;lastly, they always talk about how they need to 'sell this house' and pay off the mortgage to then move and have some money to work with, but the house is 4k square feet, needs about $50k in repairs roughly, and they can't even get it clean enough to a point to have it shown. they're home almost every day but both so depressed i think they never get anything done. the house is pretty disgusting by most peoples standards.&amp;#x200b;can i go to a lawyer and try to have her declared as incompetent or something?

"i know ive posted more than my share but one more, because things are strange. i know its probably because i dont understand. from my perspective...i havent been living near any close relative who passed away. then a couple years after i moved back my mom passed. she was 93 and always very energetoc until the two weeks before she went. i think she somehow knew her time was short. the last week she napped all afternoon every afternoon. i didnt see any of the signs. my dad is 93, had a stroke a few years ago and started going downhill which has increased . he has parkinsons and dementia and is a narcissist. which i mention because it means he thinks he knows everything and better than anyone, even the doctors. thats part of why he is where he is. he walks now with a walker on good days and a wheelchair now on bad days. he insists on being over his own meds and gets offended if i try and help with anything. that said i have caught it a few times before he has mistook his meds. we made a trip to his doc a couple weeks ago and the walk to the garage had him gasping for air. halfway down the hallway to the office he had to sit on his walker and rest, i pushed him the rest of the way, all very abnormal for him. normally he sleeps til 11ish, watches tv all afternoon and crashes after the 10pm news. there was one day, maybe friday that he tooks a bunch of his meds rt before dinner on an all but empty stomach. messed him up bad. his tremors were the worst id seen em and he was very weak. the next day he was normal again and told me what hed done. he wont be doing that again. sunday and monday he was so weak he couldnt roll over or get out of bed. good that we had his wheelchair. he also didnt have bladder control. and he had pronounced brainfog. no fever or throwing up .  i talked to the er doctor and she set up a urinalysis for next day at his docs. took me 3 hours to get a urine sample from him and then got him a rush appt, urine and blood no issues, we then did a lung xray and it was clean. tuesday he was better. i walked thru his morning and evening routines and he was ok. buthes sleeping almost all day. sun-wed only awake for meals and get ready for bed. sun/mon he also either had a couple very lucid dreams or hes startin g to hallucinate. this morning he swears he was in the bathroom and he got a call from a house maintenance company he uses. no voicemail so i have no clue how he heard anything. tues and wed progressively stronger. today stayed awake all afternoon, i think, and walked across the house on his own, went and sat on the porch. is now at 8:30 snoozing. bad thing is i have no idea if hes taken any meds.  and standing rule since he does have trouble sleeping is dont wake him up. i dont understand why sun/mon he took a deepdive on his health and his brain went loopy, tests were all good. a few days later he was the strongest ive seen him in a long time. i know life/health is all ups and downs but the swing is bizarre. im afraid of another downswing where hes incapable . and im afraid that since they found nothing else that his heart is wearing out, im afraid that since hes is suddenly sleeping so much he is about to pass. i went thru all this with his doc but since his tests were all ok she is satisfied.one other question....my dad has had throat issues since the 4 years ive been back. he does cough alot, claims drainage, has allergies. when he eats or drinks he often will cough and at times choke and he passed it off as drainage. he will not admit to a weakness or problem. ever. i always notice he doesnt drink enough water, his neurologist says it could contribute to his weakness. then says hes just old. i am beginning to think that the prevailing attitude of medicine in us as regards seniors is not to care. theyre just old. anyway, he may get 2 glasses of water a day, needs 4. when i took his urine sample in it was dark yellowy brown. def dehydrated bad. we talked about that monday night, he was really out of it so i think he told me the truth but i can never tell with him. he said he drinks water until hes full. i asked how he knew he was full. he said he drinks until hes full and he knows cause if he drinks any more it comes out.couldnt quite understand cause thats not how things work. he said if he leaned over right then water would come out. thats when i put it all together. he has swallowing issues. he drinks and eats but it may not always go down. but where is it going? hes not coughing and choking on phlegm, hes coughing and choking because the food and water didnt get swallowed and pass down into his stomach. it gets caught somewhere. but where. this also could explain why he wheezes alot and sometimes makes gurgling noises when he breathes. even his doctor noticed and wondered yet that all she did. but the problem is he wont admit he may have an issue. ive brought it up and suggested he get it checked out but as he doesnt understand how that could be then its false and he wont see about it.he also has sleep issues and with the sounds he makes when he breathes i thought maybe this interferes with his sleep or he has apnea. he wont get that looked at either. anyway, sorry for this mess. am kinda numb after this week, really dont understand. but will see if he sleeps on thru the night and how he is when he wakes up. one thing i can guess, he didnt change his adult undies so will be doing laundry tomorrow. ok i will stfu now. you folks take good care and stay healthy."," i also had a parent who suffered with parkinson's for many years before passing away. the swallowing became a big problem in my dad's last year of life, he would choke and get food down into his lungs as others have described below; turns out that more parkinson's patients die of aspirational pneumonia than anything else. anyhow, once the swallowing problem became more pronounced my mother had to add this thickener to everything he drank, and mash up all of his food. he hated it, hated living like that, it really took away a big pleasure of his life, one of the last things left, eating and drinking!  i felt terrible for him but told him that it was unrealistic to think that any of us were going to stand there and watch him choke to death because he couldn't swallow his food, so he was just going to have to accept it. with parkinson's, people have to give up one thing after another in a humiliating cascade, and it's really heartbreaking to watch. i still tear up thinking about all my poor dad went through in those last couple of years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fpoi6w/confused_and_fearful/,,Confused and fearful

"hi, i want to apologize for the wall of text but i truly am lost, i am drowning and struggling to keep my head above water. (trigger warning for death.)i grew up with my grandparents, they took me in as a newborn because my mother didn't care to take care of me/was responsible enough to take care of me. they were in their 50s by then. growing up was fine and things were easy until my grandpa got a blood cancer diagnosis in 2011. it was manageable since he was in his 60s by then; i was still in high school but this is when i started taking my first steps into caretaking. i had to watch out for temperature spikes, i had to watch out for signs of pneumonia, blood clots, and other general things the more his disease progressed. in 2017, things took a turn for the worst and his health decreased more and more. 2018, i was officially in full caretaker mode; i didn't go back to school to finish the handful of credits i had left, i left the comfortable job i had there in order to be there to make sure he was okay which i never minded. my grandpa and i were closer than anyone in my family, so i felt like it was only right that i do this for him. in october 2018, i went on a short trip out of town without knowing how unwell my grandpa was, and he told me i should go, even though i desperately wanted to stay. but i bought the plane tickets and the person i was going to see in not so many words didn't want me to cancel the trip. four days into my trip, my grandpa went to the hospital and died of kidney failure as a result of his cancer. i feel guilt over this every day and it's hard to forgive myself; what do you do when a seemingly routine hospitalization turns into the last time you'll see them? this is where my grandma comes in. we've never been close, and she's been mildly abusive to me my entire life (verbal, emotional and sometimes physical) but the death of my grandpa made me feel as if i needed to reconcile and put the past behind us in order to make sure she was okay. she's turning 80 this december, and while i love her things have gotten exceptionally hard, even harder than it was dealing with my grandpa's frequent hospitalizations and incontinence. she went into the hospital august 2019 very sick, and i didn't know with exactly what until the doctors told us she needed to have emergency gallbladder removal. after her surgery, they moved her to physical therapy rehab to help her regain her movement since she was in a hospital bed for almost a month. it's at the rehab/long term care facility that the doctors told me she's in the early stages of dementia.while in the rehab, i tried to help the doctors and physical therapists with making sure she did the exercises (physical and mental) that she was supposed to be doing; but if she wasn't ignoring and yelling at the doctors, she was ignoring and yelling at me and it reminds me too much of my childhood. they wanted to send home help in the form of weekly physical therapists and cognitive therapy and medication except once she was home, she yelled and ignored them to the point they stopped coming with no notice all together. i felt too guilty after that to make her take the pills; i regret this, because maybe things would've been better. so now, it's just me taking care of things like cooking her meals, making sure her medicines and doctor's appointments are tended to, making sure she's keeping herself busy instead of staring at the television except she still fights me. she refuses to eat when she's upset with something i've said, she doesn't sleep normal hours, she won't let me ask the other family for help because it's gotten to the point where my health is finally plummeting. i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was 11, and living with her without my grandpa around to talk to has made my mental health worse. i can't see a therapist or make appointments for my health as often as i'd like because she has separation anxiety when i'm gone, and i can't talk to her about how i'm feeling because she takes it as personal attacks, calls me crazy or sometimes downright turns her head away from me in an obvious show of ignoring me. we argue more and more until it's gotten to the point i can barely get out of bed for fear of what she'll say that day to make me feel terrible or to make me cry, but it's the guilt of my grandpa and knowing he'd want me to take care of her that keeps me here. i feel guilty that i don't want to do this. i'm 24, i was only two years into my degree and now i'm not sure if i can even go back because i've forgotten almost everything in the midst of death and grief. i don't have any friends, and the only people i can talk to are people on twitter but. no one wants to hear about something so depressing all the time so i slap on a mask and pretend i am coping but i'm not. i haven't felt this unwell since depression first stepped into my life and not since my first suicide attempt (that my grandma initiated). i have two aunts, a mother and even an adult cousin that all have more resources than me except they're the ones taking trips, going to work and living their lives without any regards to us. they only call her to make sure she's not dead, they never call me. i've never gotten along with them either, except for one of my aunts but it still feels so unfair that this is all my responsibility. i hate the bitterness i feel, because you're supposed to do this for family, right? except i feel like a shadow of myself, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't recognize myself anymore. i don't feel pretty anymore, i don't feel like i have worth anymore. and it's hard trying to take care of someone else when it feels like they hate you every single day but cry and say they need you when you want just an inch of space. i'm not sure what to do anymore. i need help but we don't have the income for home help i don't think. any advice would desperately be appreciated because i feel like i'm failing her and my grandpa, and myself. thank you to anyone listening, not many do lately.", danghey tell your family she's their grandma too they fucking better step upguilt them into ityou did right by your grandpa you were present as much as possiblenowwwww it's a bit much. got to get a caregiver to hang out sometimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fh5i36/taking_care_of_my_grandparents_fell_on_my/,,"taking care of my grandparents fell on my shoulders, except i'm getting crushed under the weight of loss and grief."

"i want to start this off by introducing myself and explaining my situation.i have been a caregiver for members of my family since i was 20? or so years old.it started with my grandma, then both of my grandparents until my grandfather died. i went on to help my grandma until she was eventually placed in a home where she currently resides. they both have/had severe alzheimers/dementia and my grandma is a diabetic. i would cook, clean, and administer meds for them both. because of my experience with this, it was naturally expected of me to be there to help my mom adjust to taking care of my dad after his 3rd stroke. his first was in 2015 and his third and final was in march of 2016.i had been living with a friend for the past year and would occasionally visit my parents. up until the 3rd stroke, they were doing great on their own and they actually had a healthy dynamic. now some backstory: my parents have an extremely toxic relationship. my mom was a lifelong alcoholic until last year (explain later in post) and my dad was almost never home while i grew up. i am the oldest of 4, 3 girls and 1 boy as the youngest. i was expected to take on many responsibilities from an early age because of my mom's alcoholism. i constantly got into verbal fights with my mom while trying to defend myself. i would get in trouble for stuff my siblings did, i would fight back about how unfair it was that my youngest brother and sister were never made to do chores or clean. this affects their adult lives, with my brother only learning how to do basic things from his gf and my sister turning into an unchecked ego. ithere was a lot of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse that happened pretty much my entire life. my parents constantly fought and would refuse to divorce because they wanted to stick together for my brother. long story short about my brother: he is the christ child and can do no wrong. they worship him. standard sexism in the family unit stuff. my mom would bend over backwards to make sure my dad and brother got everything they ever wanted, while myself and my closest sister were treated like the help. i was the only one that was ever hit and anytime i did something that upset my dad, he would spank me and blame the pain on me, saying stuff like this hurts me more than it does you. i would get my behind shredded for making a b in 3rd grade. stuff like that. the one time i told a teacher about it, she contacted my parents and told them everything. i was having trouble sitting at school because my dad had beat my behind the night before for not cleaning my room in a timely manner.anyways, i will move on to the current situation. a few months after i moved back in with my parents to help out, my mom broke her back. burst fracture if her l1. turns out if you have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis, and you drink heavily every day for 30 years, you make your bones so brittle that a sneeze could break your ribs.who knew right?so i was suddenly not just helping, i was taking care of both of them.now keep in mind the emotional abuse i had experienced in the past.my dad's emotional filter in his brain was basically destroyed. he lost his left side to paralysis. he would verbally lash out at me and my mom for little shit and on a few occasions he tried to hit us with his cane.he could have actually killed my mom if he had hit her but thankfully that did not happen.fast forward to now. i have become their full time caretaker and take care of literally everything.i could go on and on about all the shit that has happened in the last 4 years but this post is already too long. now i am completely burnt out. i can't be around my dad without being triggered violently and i have to stop myself from blowing up. my mom is a narcissistic guilt trip master and i literally cannot leave the house unless it's to take them to doc appts or to buy groceries. the few and far between times that i can leave the house, they both guilt me and make me feel terrible and treat me like a child. i'm gonna be 30 this year. i have no life. i have one friend. i almost never leave the house. we are living off of my dad's social security disability check which isn't enough to actually survive on. my mom is waiting to get on disability but they are taking their dear sweet time. we haven't paid rent in the last 2 months because if we did wouldn't have any money for food or for medicine and that's a whole other bag of dicks right there. both of their meds together cost roughly 800 a month. and that's even with my dad now being on humana and medicare.i don't know what to do. i desperately want to escape and get on with my life. literally everyone i talk to tells me to get out and i know i need to.but here's the thing...i would feel so guilty, despite everything. i would feel like i'm abandoning them. i have tried to reach out for help. nothing is working.both of my parents are technically capable of taking care of some things themselves but they won't do it and when i try to explain how it would help me greatly, it turns into a ""you're so ungrateful and selfish"" argument.i have to make phone calls for them that they could make themselves. fill out paperwork they could do themselves. i even have to talk to their docs for them because if i didn't, they wouldn't care and wouldn't advocate for themselves. there is an extremely unhealthy attachment going on here and i just wanna hear from anyone who is or has experienced something similar. i just need help. i am so fucking tired and i'm scared that i will send myself into a cardiac episode or worse because i'm under so much constant stress. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'm sorry if i have posted in the wrong area.

"when your mom or dad’s [dementia]( or [alzheimer’s]( care requires more than you can reasonably provide, it might be time to start thinking about transitioning to a [memory care]( community. [a variety of memory care levels]( exist, from providing simple medication reminders to full care communities assisting residents with bathing, dining, and ensuring they won’t get lost. before considering a move like this, be sure to verify your loved one matches behavior associated with [the early signs of alzheimer's and dementia,]( and consult a trusted physician.## transitioning to a memory care communitythe first thirty days can be the most difficult as you and your parent work through the shift from independent living to a memory care community. in many cases, your loved one may not always remember why the move is a good idea and might become upset or argumentative. being patient but firm, and leaning on the staff and administration at your chosen community for help, can aid you through this process and make your mom or dad feel at home.## explore before the movetaking your mom or dad to enjoy lunch or recreational activity at their chosen memory care community can help give them familiarity with the building, grounds, staff, and other members of the residence. associating positive feelings and memories with the community can make it easier for them to feel at home once they move in. you can also discuss various alzheimer’s care options with the staff, and see how other residents enjoy their lives in the community setting.## share information with staffthe caregivers at your loved one’s chosen senior living community should have as many questions for you as you do for them. be prepared to tell them as much as you can about your parent’s life and interests. knowing which foods they like and dislike, what things they were passionate about when they were young, and other personal pieces of information about your mom or dad can help staff personalize your parent’s care.## initiating the actual movethe chaos of moving can be even more confusing and disorienting to a loved one living with dementia or alzheimer’s. having one friend or family member spend the day with your parent while the rest of you arrange the setup of their new room can help.choose belongings carefully to create a space that feels familiar as well as offering staff insight into your parent’s personality and interests. focus on items with personal value and sensory input, like a soft quilt or family photos.## take time to visit frequentlyyears ago, the standard recommendation was for family and friends to stay away for the first week or after transitioning to a memory care community. at the kensington falls church, we encourage family members to visit our[ memory care communities]( frequently, and even have a pet-friendly policy so you can enjoy time with the entire family while your loved one adjusts.by planning visits for a specific time of day, you can create a defined routine helping your mom or dad get used to the idea of you coming, leaving, and reliably coming again.## adapt your interactionsunderstanding memory loss can help you learn how [alzheimer’s]( and [dementia]( affect behavior.you may need to adapt the way you interact with your loved one. if they insist an impossible event took place, or that a fact (like the year) is different than what you know to be true, realize that this is their reality. arguing may only lead to unnecessary unhappiness. instead, enjoy listening to their stories and find small, meaningful activities to do together, such as sharing a meal or going for a walk around the grounds.## practice self-careit’s important to take care of yourself to make the most out of your time together. if you are experiencing grief or frustration, there is a good chance they will also pick up on your emotions and become upset. you may want to consider talking with a friend or therapy professional about your feelings as a way to work through your role in the transition.the better you care for yourself, the better you’ll be able to help take care of your mom or dad.## know that it gets easierthe initial transition into a memory care community can be challenging, and at times your loved one may say or do things that are hurtful. but remember, it isn’t personal.they are coming from a place of uncertainty, confusion, and frustration. accept that their unhappiness is temporary. they will have good days and difficult days.by attending to their care with compassion and love, you are ensuring that they are safe and will continue to have every opportunity for a fulfilling life beyond dementia.find out more about how the kensington falls church can help your mom or dad transition to the highest level of independence without compromising their safety.## recommended additional reading:* [how to pay for assisted living](* [dancing does an older body good](* [meet me at the memory

"i genuinely don't know what on earth to do anymore. before i get into everything, let me give you a little background on myself. i'm 18 years old living in a household with my mother, my father, four cats, and recently my grandmother. i'm in my last year of highschool so i've been super busy with school and basically getting ready for college. but besides that, i'm having a problem that i literally have no clue how to fix. my grandmother has been diagnosed alzheimer's for a little over 5 years now, and she's only been living with us for about 9 months. she hasn't been too bad or anything, she actually has been doing amazing lately, but my dad sees her as this burden. he always makes it seem like my mother and i never help him out with her (even though he leaves me for a day or two while he's hanging out with a friend at a brewery or something) and he constantly says how he is frustrated with life. the worst part is that it is now influencing my grandmother, having her say ""i want to die"" and ""no one wants me around"". what am i supposed to do in this situation? i know i'll be leaving for college soon, but i don't want to leave my mother in a toxic environment like that. how do i make him see that he is effecting the whole house with his attitude?", i suggest you contact the alzheimer’s association. they will be able to direct you to support groups in your area as well as what services are available for your grandmother.i hope this is helpful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/dqbmt6/my_dad_is_making_everything_worse/,,My Dad is making everything worse.
"typing this out just to vent. it's been a hell of a day. quick background. my dad died suddenly almost 2 years ago and we found out mom was farther along with alzheimer's than we'd known. i've spent the last two years helping as best as i can, and we finally got her moved into assisted living a month ago. but i feel terrible. i've taken here out of a familiar house (~45 years), taken her dogs away (she really couldn't care for them properly) and the new place is great with awesome staff and good food, but it's just not what she's used to. the transition is not going well. today we've been called by nursing staff twice. first time, i was already on my way up with her dog and we had a great afternoon. she seemed in great spirits and we walked the dog, talked, everything seemed good. late tonight we got a call again. she's upset, bad headache, talking about wanting to kill herself. i feel like i had to get her out of a 'living alone' situation. but i can't help feeling like i've messed everything up. we've sunk like 15k into the assisted living so far. i'm trying to sell her house to help fund things for the next several years. but if it's not working then i have no idea what to do. part time home care, live in home care, moving in with me or siblings, me or siblings moving in with her... all these options were weighed and i thought we made the best choice.how do you stop yourself from despair when the plans you make don't seem to work out? i feel like i've messed everything up and there is no hope. what a terrible disease. it just eats up everything and everyone. i can't believe how few options there seem to be and how bloody expensive it all is. most days all she wants to do is end it all and we can't even help her go out on her own terms. i feel like i've tried my hardest and failed spectacularly. how do you all do it?", i don’t know but perhaps at the two month mark things will be better? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/a6lyhr/what_a_rough_day/,,what a rough day

"so, as the title text says, my dad has suddenly had to move in with us, and i'm absolutely overwhelmed. the story is as such: a couple of weeks ago i got a call from the police. apparently my dad, who lives alone 3 hours away since my step mom died, had called the police to complain about people having a sit in on the front lawn, and having broken into his house. the cops arrived, and my dad is talking to bushes and there's no one there. he's been bothering the neighbors about it too, who saw nothing. the police said they couldn't admit him to the er, as his vitals were good, but he refused to go back into the house, and then drove to the local gas station and started having a fight with an invisible person in his car, and the police were called again, and so i drove up the 3 hours, and took him all the way back home with me, where after a good deal of sleep and some discussion about the possibility of hallucinations (he was an er nurse and understands the concept very well), he calmed down and seemed to go back to himself, though i could notice a considerable disruption in his normal cognitive abilities. we took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway. so they set us up with an outpatient appointment the following week, and we set dad up in the guest bedroom. we've since had the outpatient appointment, and the psychiatrist basically said that he thought dad had a mini stroke, and it caused an onset of dementia, and he didn't think dad should live by himself anymore based on how he answered the questions. so now dad is moving in with me.first off, dad seems able to take care of himself in many ways, like hygiene and self feeding, but has issues with more complicated aspects of living. he can't really work the tv (he could if it was just turn it on and change channels, but the whole smart tv thing and multiple remotes has him stumped constantly, even with a regular cable box and two remotes). he also has a hard time working the keurig, with its 3 buttons, and can't manage his dumbed down little flip phone, accidentally deleting phone numbers, etc. this is a man who used to work regularly in excel for a clinical trial management service, and the man who introduced me to the internet, set up a computer in our house when dos was the os, and had an atari 2600 from release, so he wasn't a luddite, but now he can't use a computer to save his life. it's heartbreaking to see him futz with his seatbelt for 3 minutes, or with the ac knobs, or the tv remote we got him which only has about 6 buttons, but i used to work in mental health, and patient care isn't something i have a problem with.my problem is this: how do i begin dealing with all of his stuff? he has a whole three bedroom two bath house filled with 40 years of stuff. he has two cars and a truck, a rental house, and two empty parcels of land, all 3 hours away from us. and, i found out after going up there and going through all of his stuff, that he got depressed after my step mother died and hadn't dealt with any bills in almost a year, and his taxes and god knows what else were all kinds of screwed. the first thing i did was get all of his bills paid up, and i'm trying to deal with his finances, but i've found so much stuff i'm out of my depth on, like that he never made any claims on my stepmother's life insurance or anything, and he gets money through investments but he can't really tell me how that works tax wise or anything.here's where i am right now:- i've got his bills paid for april, and i'm working on may's. i have years worth of paperwork to go through and i'm trying to sort through it a little at a time.- we went up this past weekend and i had him label everything he wanted to bring down, and everything he wanted to keep or put in storage.- i put one car in the shop because he just left it in the garage for a year, and we got a new battery in the truck, and drove it back down to our house. the other car is so old i don't think it'll make the trip.- i got his neighbor to cut his grass for the time being, after getting dad's permission to tell him what's going on.- the current tenant of his rental house wants to buy, so i guess i need to figure out how to sell a house without a realtor, which i've never done before.- i've gotten the name of an estate sales agency, to maybe go through and sell all dad's other stuff, which is the only thing i can think to do to deal with all the stuff we can't keep, and i've gotten the name of a junk remover for whatever is left.- dad's house will bare minimum need a major landscaping overhaul (he's let his land grow up significantly, and there are trees down in the yard), and possibly a new roof and definitely new flooring if we're going to sell the house. he owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless. i don't know.- i've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and i'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if i'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.- i let dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now i'm managing them for him.the whole time this is going on, all i can think is am i doing the right thing? how is this going to affect my life? how is this going to affect his life? am i missing something? and i'm constantly second guessing myself and my actions and whether i'm doing the right thing at the right time.i have no resources. my wife is still employed, thank the gods, but i've been laid off due to the virus, which is the silver lining to all of this because i'm getting unemployment with the extra money for the time being while i use my time to help my father, but eventually that's going to run out or i'm going to have to get a job to maintain our home and pay for him until we can get his finances figured out.so, i apologize for the long rant, but i guess what this post is about, is that i need help and though i know more than some i've never dealt with this and i feel like i'm drowning in stress, i don't know if i've missed anything important, and i don't know what resources might be at hand for this.and hell, in the midst of all of this, how do i actually care for my dad!? i'm managing his meds for him, and making sure he gets food, of course, but i'm at a complete loss for how to occupy his time, and help his life be worth living, especially in the midst of this virus stuff.and, selfishly, i need to figure out how i make sure that my dad's life doesn't consume my own? i know my life is derailed currently, and there is now a new normal, but what's on track for me going to look like going forward, etc.any advice, or resources, or anything at all is helpful at this point."," \- get power of attorney so you can deal with his finances, his property and other matters. his wife's insurance money will come in handy once that gets settled. \- put his name in for an assisted living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. my mother's place has assisted living and memory care in the same residence, just different floors. it seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. \- if he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. before my stepdad even started hallucinating, he would get lost and sometimes even ended up in the ditch. finally his kids started ""borrowing"" his car for weeks at a time until he was diagnosed with lewy body dementia and was told not to drive. \- check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. many places have senior's social workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a seniors' center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. \- it sounds like you are doing all you can so far. it will be challenging but the hardest part  is now when things are in such a mess. he is lucky to have you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/ggvuc4/dad_71_coming_to_live_with_my_wife_and_i_after_a/,,"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia.

"my 72 year old mother has been forgetful (getting her dates wrong for major events like weddings, misplacing things, forgetting to pay bills) as long as she's been my mom, but her memory has been steadily getting worse over the last few years and she is now acting weird in other ways.she loses her train of thought mid sentence and just starts stating facts that are sort of related to the thing we were talking about. she asks me the same questions repeatedly, although this might be loneliness and her trying to keep me on the phone. she makes really weird decisions and gets super defensive when you ask about them. this year she started taking out large sums of cash and carrying it around on her. she couldn't have a bag on her at work, so she'd stuff bills in her pants pockets and every time she stuck her hands in her pockets and pulled them out she'd drop money. she was dropping multiple $20 bills every week. i know there must be a reason- she's forgetting her pin or losing her wallet or something, but she gets angry and refuses to speak to me if i push the subject.she has short bursts of very petulant, childlike behavior and paranoia. they usually only last a few minutes, but they are very different from her normal behavior. this is what concerns me the most, she has a different look in her eyes, like she's confused and frightened.this week she left a tap running for hours and flooded her bathroom.i've looked up early dementia signs online, but most of them assume the parent previously had the ability to perform essential self care tasks, which my mother never has. she lost most of her teeth by 40 because she wouldn't brush them or go to the dentist. she has never been able to feed herself regularly, pay her bills often enough to not have services cut off, etc. she has always been bad at looking after herself, which makes it really hard for me to tell if this is cognitive decline or just her norm + aging. my sister has mentioned a few moments when she seemed ""off"" to her, but doesn't believe there is anything majorly wrong. she was working full time up until the pandemic. she seemed to be performing fine at work, her coworkers speak highly of her abilities when i interact with them.i feel like i should suggest she see a doctor to be assessed, but it may cause her to become angry and secretive. she would rather lie than have people worry about her. she once purchased a second kindle because i asked to borrow her kindle and she didn't want to tell me she didn't know where it was. if this is fairly normal for a 72 year old and she's probably going to be stable at this level of functioning for a while i don't want to push her and cut off any truthful communication. if this is actually concerning behavior i'd like to talk to my sister about  how we should approach it with my mom."," you should definitely not ignore this. make an appointment with her primary to discuss what you are seeing and what she is experiencing. if they discount what you have noticed it is time to switch doctors and find someone who has a better understanding of dementia. in the meantime, contact your local chapter of the alzheimer's association for guidance. you do not need a diagnosis to get help. they will be able to provide a lot of guidance and education for you as you figure out what is going on. they also have lots of support groups for caregivers and for those with dementia or alzheimer's. find your local chapter here:  [ hope that helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gf0bam/how_worried_should_i_be/,,How worried should I be?
"i’m not sure if this is a rant or a call for advice. basically my grandfather and his wife had a workplace affair in the 60s, and one day decided to walk out on their spouses and children to be together. i say “walk out on” but she left, while he kicked my grandmother and their four children out of their home with a few days notice. they’ve lived a purposefully isolated and reclusive life ever since. my mother and i are the only ones who ever came around and she was very clear that she would rather we didn’t, and only put up with us because he made her. i hadn’t been around in a couple years due to distance, but recently moved a bit closer (2 hour drive). my grandfather passed away last week. apparently, she’s been living with dementia for a few years. she should have been placed in an assisted care home long ago as she cannot even be left alone, let alone care for herself in any capacity. we found out she hadn’t showered or changed her clothes in 3 months. she won’t eat unless you put a cooked meal in front of her. most of her day is spent sitting at their small kitchen table, and going in the bathroom every 10 minutes to smoke. mom and i are taking turns staying with her and everyone involved hates it. mom is power of attorney/proxy, and i am the alternate. her children made it clear they want nothing to do with the situation or to help in any way. she has about a 10 minute “reset” time as we’ve been calling it. following the doctors advice we initially planned to tell her he died once, and then remain vague. but she’s so mean (was when she didn’t have dementia) and keeps telling us to leave her alone. my mom lost her patience and started telling her over and over that he died. now i can’t go back to the vague answers because while she can’t quite remember, she’s been told enough that she has a vague idea (saying things like “no...something else happened”) and getting combative until we tell her. she’s convinced that we just need to leave and that she can handle their house, their 7 cats, and her own care by herself. it’s clear that she can’t because she doesn’t even think to feed the cats or do anything for herself. we’ve been in contact with a few nursing homes and one seemed like they’d take her. we even had an appointment on monday where we took her there and they talked and they said they’d give us a decision in 24-48 hours but now they’ve just been ghosting us even though they have 12 open rooms. we’re in a pretty rural area so that was pretty much our only nearby option. my mom is now under the impression that at the first sign that somethings wrong with her (she’s been complaining of a pain in her head for a few days) that she’s going to take her to the hospital, where we can hopefully get adult protective services involved since we also can’t get them on the phone. it’s making us physically sick to be in that house since they both smoked inside of it for half a century. my mom has to do the bulk of staying there since i’m still working and like i said, live two hours away. my mom and i are both so exhausted from caring for this woman that always hated us and to be honest we never cared for her much either, that i’m worried for my mom’s sanity and my own safety. i’m just so exhausted and i drive all day for work on top of the drive there all the time (on top of my job which is very high stakes and stressful because of covid-19) that i feel like i’m constantly on the edge of falling asleep or passing out. i know my mom isn’t the type to do anything rash but if you make someone suffer physically, put them on the end of verbal abuse from their “stepmom” 24/7 all while trying to process the death of a parent, i’m worried she will do something in the spur of the moment. we’re both just so angry with the situation, that he put this on us, and that it’s all happening during a pandemic which makes everything 100x harder. we don’t even have death certificates yet to access his bank account so everything for her and his cats has been coming from us, and we both struggle to support ourselves too.", wow that's really hard.  you and your mom are good souls for taking care of her despite the fact that i kind of feel like she's not really your problem. have you considered getting any county or state agencies involved since her family doesn't really seem to want to take care of her?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gbhwca/grandfather_passed_his_wife_has_dementia_and/,,"Grandfather passed, his wife has dementia and hated us when she didn’t.

"apologies for posting so much, things are crapping out here. i will be calling his doc tomorrow and if she wont callback i guess ill have a caretaker out for a few hours. and cal social services. my dad (93) stroke dementia and parkinsons, tied to a walker on his good days and lucky to get around on his bad days hes also a narcissist so everything he says or does is god.  he has horrible balance issues. getting up from his chair to his walker is often an ordeal that involves struggling to get up and falling back into his chair. ive picked him up off the floor a few times and this morning he was callig cause he was weak and couldnt use his walker. tbh i never quite know if hes telling me the truth or hes running a game. even at his age and condition he still tries to manipulate.there is no one else to take care of him and he cant do anything. all i ask is he do things safely. but he doesnt use proper judgement. i see hime struggling to stand and ffer a hand and he gets belligerant. tonight he was hanging between his chair and walker, barely balancing and looked stuck, so i genty placed my hand on his back and he made it, then was pissed. i explained to him hos this is done and tgat if he had a nurse or caretaker here thgey would chew his ass for being unsafe and then give him a hand. he just spits venom. he was calling for help this morning but then tonight its 'i dont fucking need your help'. on the one hand i want to just say 'ok, fuck you, if you fall you fall'. if that happens im not waiting in him, he'll have to hire in someone. aight, sorry, but am i just being a idiot wanting to help him since he always complains of weakness and has horrible balance issues?  what i see when he tries to get up is he sticks his butt way back and that pulls his center of gravity back. ive told him that but of course he knows all. should i just let him alone and when hes trying to get up say goodnight and walk away?at tgis point i will try and talk to his doctor and if that fails social services or a carenurse. as far as i know fro someone like him he should not be allowed to do what hes doing but im damn tired of the belligerence and idiocy. he expects that he can jut tell me whatever and ill just go...huh? gosh ok well i guess i let you fall then, have fun.tbh im alone in this, will be searching for a caregiver supoort group, probaby online, cause at this point it feels like im lsoing the fight to mr knowitall.  i moved back to go back to school. lost my job and decided to study for a career change. mom passed and dads been going steadily downhill. he has 2-3 bad days then hopefully 5-7 good days. these last two down cycles were hell. if it gets any worse then i cant  take care of him. but despite all the crap it has been beneficial in that i do the chores and i get a place to stay and food. but here lately i can get anything done and it seems like im upset every night. hes starting to gaslight and thats not acceptable. unfortuantely i wouldnt find a jhob in this economy so i think im fucked. but am i correct to try and keep him safe or should i just let him struggle and walk away."," my papaw had the exact same issues you describe with standing, especially when getting out of his recliner. i got him a set of grab bars with handles that he could use to push himself up easier. (they are on amazon, under able life universal stand assist.) all of the physical therapists with home health who came to see him were impressed; none of them had ever seen anything like it and most asked me what they were called and where i got them so they could tell their other patients. they might be worth looking into for your dad.my grandmother is the narcissist in our family, and i am fairly sure she has dementia now too, but it is so hard to tell what is dementia and what is her usual  personality. she complains over literally everything; even if she loves something to begin with, she will complain later. (for example, i bought her new cordless phones a few months ago, and every time i’d ask if she liked them she would say yes, they were perfect. two nights ago she sends me a text asking if i still have her old phones because she doesn’t care for these.)it’s really hard not to let her attitude get to me, but i try to remind myself that she is making a choice to be miserable, but i don’t have to let her make me miserable too. if she’s in a mood i don’t indulge it, i carry on as normal and leave her alone as soon as i can. one way you might be able to tell what is dementia vs. narcissism with your dad would be to have someone else come in to help him. sometimes dementia patients are difficult with family but not with strangers, and will be perfect angels when a nurse tells them what to do. if your dad is hateful to strangers too, well, at least then you know that it’s nothing personal towards you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g9he21/when_to_know_they_need_help/,,when to know they need help
"hello world of aging parents. i have a challenge to overcome. i’ve been taking care of my mother. my husband and i have lived with her (in tight quarters) for over a year now. she’s on a dementia medication which improved her condition greatly. she has refused to take any medications recently, so she’s no longer on her anxiety/mood medication. the only diagnosis i ever heard for her, psychologically speaking, is borderline personality disorder, which appears to fit.my feelings oscillate wildly. often i think it’s not so bad. and then i go to places where i think the plan to move and leave her with an aid (to make sure she’s covered, needs wise) is all she deserves. she can be incredibly mean and also incredibly supportive and that’s her struggle. but i’ve felt that she let the worst parts of her get the better of herself. so i’m having a hard time biting the bullet and signing off for a lawyer to get her on medicaid and get her at-home care and disconnecting myself from the responsibility. my mom is against having her finances interrupted and having ‘a stranger’ help her with anything. this would mean both of those things. i also signed on to work out of state at the end of the summer, and my husband and i agreed that we should take some time to ourselves out there to get a foothold before having her come out, around 6 months of time. that means it is imperative to get that care set up for her. so there’s really “no option”.questions, comments, words of constructive criticism and/or support are all welcome."," the adjustment will be hard, but it sounds like it is what is best for all involved. reassure her that you are not disappearing forever, but want to go back to enjoying the role of daughter. it will be a good thing for all of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g4w5oj/support_needed_afraid_to_sign_papers_send_check/,,"Support Needed: Afraid to sign papers, send check for retainer to get mom community care"

"my parents are both their early 70’s.  my mom has early stage dementia.  both are relatively healthy physically.  because of what’s going on, i’ve severely limited my visits.  before this i visited with my mom several times a week.  i call daily, or sometimes several times a day.  i bring over things that they need so they don’t have to go out in public too much.  i have two older sisters.  they hardly ever call.  they don’t help at all.  this isn’t new to the situation, but because of the situation the lack of communication for my mom has made my mom an emotional wreck who calls me crying that she wished she had just died last summer (she had a small stroke and spent 17 days in the hospital) and asking why they let her live, that she feels useless and that no one loves her, etc.  i asked my one sister if she could call mom once a week and let her know she is ok.  my sister works in a hospital, so my mom is sick with worry.  my sister lashed out at me and told me that with all the pressure she is under she doesn’t need a guilt trip too.  she got nasty, so i ended the conversation.  i called my other sister and asked if she could call mom or at least answer the phone when mom calls or respond to a message and i got a load of excuses and false promises.  my mom was a good mom to us, so there isn’t any reason to be like this.  no bad family history or anything like that.  i will say that my moms filter has dissolved quite a bit and she has a tendency to “say what she’s thinking” a lot.  i’ve learned to basically ignore that or change the subject.  but it’s the dementia talking.  last week my mom called to wish my nephew a happy birthday, but she was a day early.  she got her dates mixed up.  my sister said “it’s not his birthday, it’s tomorrow” and my mom said “oh, i’m sorry, i’ve got my dates mixed up.  i’m having a hard time remembering what day it is” and asked to wish him a happy early birthday.  my sister said “i’m done with this conversation” and hung the phone up on her.  my mom called me sobbing,  my dad confirmed this conversation.  i’m taking all the emotional load here, and soon it will be a lot more, as you don’t recover from growing old.  i need help, i need someone to occasionally tap in so i can tap out.  i can’t just ignore my mom as i wouldn’t do that to her.  how do i get my sisters to help?  i know some of you will do the “not my job to facilitate a relationship”.  i’m not trying to, i want them to take their share of the care of our aging parents."," i'm in the same boat. i have a sister and two brothers who do nothing to help. my dad (88) moved in with my husband and i last year (hubby is awesome for this imo). my sister lives about 5 hours away and is currently battling lung cancer so i give her a pass, although she could call occasionally. oldest brother is a jerk. enough said about that. other brother lives an hour away but is so self-absorbed he can't be bothered. it's like my siblings think ""dad is with deb now so we can get back to life"". thankfully i don't work outside my home. the downside is the reason i don't work...i have had anxiety and depression my entire adult life and was forced to retire 15 years ago due to it.why don't my siblings understand? why don't yours? i don't know. i wish i had help but i'm not going to beg. it's just a shame for all of us who have to do this with no help. especially from people who should help. i definitely feel you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fsp90i/siblings_that_wont_help_how_do_i_handle_this/,,"Siblings that won’t help, how do I handle this?"

"i know ive posted more than my share but one more, because things are strange. i know its probably because i dont understand. from my perspective...i havent been living near any close relative who passed away. then a couple years after i moved back my mom passed. she was 93 and always very energetoc until the two weeks before she went. i think she somehow knew her time was short. the last week she napped all afternoon every afternoon. i didnt see any of the signs. my dad is 93, had a stroke a few years ago and started going downhill which has increased . he has parkinsons and dementia and is a narcissist. which i mention because it means he thinks he knows everything and better than anyone, even the doctors. thats part of why he is where he is. he walks now with a walker on good days and a wheelchair now on bad days. he insists on being over his own meds and gets offended if i try and help with anything. that said i have caught it a few times before he has mistook his meds. we made a trip to his doc a couple weeks ago and the walk to the garage had him gasping for air. halfway down the hallway to the office he had to sit on his walker and rest, i pushed him the rest of the way, all very abnormal for him. normally he sleeps til 11ish, watches tv all afternoon and crashes after the 10pm news. there was one day, maybe friday that he tooks a bunch of his meds rt before dinner on an all but empty stomach. messed him up bad. his tremors were the worst id seen em and he was very weak. the next day he was normal again and told me what hed done. he wont be doing that again. sunday and monday he was so weak he couldnt roll over or get out of bed. good that we had his wheelchair. he also didnt have bladder control. and he had pronounced brainfog. no fever or throwing up .  i talked to the er doctor and she set up a urinalysis for next day at his docs. took me 3 hours to get a urine sample from him and then got him a rush appt, urine and blood no issues, we then did a lung xray and it was clean. tuesday he was better. i walked thru his morning and evening routines and he was ok. buthes sleeping almost all day. sun-wed only awake for meals and get ready for bed. sun/mon he also either had a couple very lucid dreams or hes startin g to hallucinate. this morning he swears he was in the bathroom and he got a call from a house maintenance company he uses. no voicemail so i have no clue how he heard anything. tues and wed progressively stronger. today stayed awake all afternoon, i think, and walked across the house on his own, went and sat on the porch. is now at 8:30 snoozing. bad thing is i have no idea if hes taken any meds.  and standing rule since he does have trouble sleeping is dont wake him up. i dont understand why sun/mon he took a deepdive on his health and his brain went loopy, tests were all good. a few days later he was the strongest ive seen him in a long time. i know life/health is all ups and downs but the swing is bizarre. im afraid of another downswing where hes incapable . and im afraid that since they found nothing else that his heart is wearing out, im afraid that since hes is suddenly sleeping so much he is about to pass. i went thru all this with his doc but since his tests were all ok she is satisfied.one other question....my dad has had throat issues since the 4 years ive been back. he does cough alot, claims drainage, has allergies. when he eats or drinks he often will cough and at times choke and he passed it off as drainage. he will not admit to a weakness or problem. ever. i always notice he doesnt drink enough water, his neurologist says it could contribute to his weakness. then says hes just old. i am beginning to think that the prevailing attitude of medicine in us as regards seniors is not to care. theyre just old. anyway, he may get 2 glasses of water a day, needs 4. when i took his urine sample in it was dark yellowy brown. def dehydrated bad. we talked about that monday night, he was really out of it so i think he told me the truth but i can never tell with him. he said he drinks water until hes full. i asked how he knew he was full. he said he drinks until hes full and he knows cause if he drinks any more it comes out.couldnt quite understand cause thats not how things work. he said if he leaned over right then water would come out. thats when i put it all together. he has swallowing issues. he drinks and eats but it may not always go down. but where is it going? hes not coughing and choking on phlegm, hes coughing and choking because the food and water didnt get swallowed and pass down into his stomach. it gets caught somewhere. but where. this also could explain why he wheezes alot and sometimes makes gurgling noises when he breathes. even his doctor noticed and wondered yet that all she did. but the problem is he wont admit he may have an issue. ive brought it up and suggested he get it checked out but as he doesnt understand how that could be then its false and he wont see about it.he also has sleep issues and with the sounds he makes when he breathes i thought maybe this interferes with his sleep or he has apnea. he wont get that looked at either. anyway, sorry for this mess. am kinda numb after this week, really dont understand. but will see if he sleeps on thru the night and how he is when he wakes up. one thing i can guess, he didnt change his adult undies so will be doing laundry tomorrow. ok i will stfu now. you folks take good care and stay healthy."," i also had a parent who suffered with parkinson's for many years before passing away. the swallowing became a big problem in my dad's last year of life, he would choke and get food down into his lungs as others have described below; turns out that more parkinson's patients die of aspirational pneumonia than anything else. anyhow, once the swallowing problem became more pronounced my mother had to add this thickener to everything he drank, and mash up all of his food. he hated it, hated living like that, it really took away a big pleasure of his life, one of the last things left, eating and drinking!  i felt terrible for him but told him that it was unrealistic to think that any of us were going to stand there and watch him choke to death because he couldn't swallow his food, so he was just going to have to accept it. with parkinson's, people have to give up one thing after another in a humiliating cascade, and it's really heartbreaking to watch. i still tear up thinking about all my poor dad went through in those last couple of years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fpoi6w/confused_and_fearful/,,Confused and fearful

"hi, i want to apologize for the wall of text but i truly am lost, i am drowning and struggling to keep my head above water. (trigger warning for death.)i grew up with my grandparents, they took me in as a newborn because my mother didn't care to take care of me/was responsible enough to take care of me. they were in their 50s by then. growing up was fine and things were easy until my grandpa got a blood cancer diagnosis in 2011. it was manageable since he was in his 60s by then; i was still in high school but this is when i started taking my first steps into caretaking. i had to watch out for temperature spikes, i had to watch out for signs of pneumonia, blood clots, and other general things the more his disease progressed. in 2017, things took a turn for the worst and his health decreased more and more. 2018, i was officially in full caretaker mode; i didn't go back to school to finish the handful of credits i had left, i left the comfortable job i had there in order to be there to make sure he was okay which i never minded. my grandpa and i were closer than anyone in my family, so i felt like it was only right that i do this for him. in october 2018, i went on a short trip out of town without knowing how unwell my grandpa was, and he told me i should go, even though i desperately wanted to stay. but i bought the plane tickets and the person i was going to see in not so many words didn't want me to cancel the trip. four days into my trip, my grandpa went to the hospital and died of kidney failure as a result of his cancer. i feel guilt over this every day and it's hard to forgive myself; what do you do when a seemingly routine hospitalization turns into the last time you'll see them? this is where my grandma comes in. we've never been close, and she's been mildly abusive to me my entire life (verbal, emotional and sometimes physical) but the death of my grandpa made me feel as if i needed to reconcile and put the past behind us in order to make sure she was okay. she's turning 80 this december, and while i love her things have gotten exceptionally hard, even harder than it was dealing with my grandpa's frequent hospitalizations and incontinence. she went into the hospital august 2019 very sick, and i didn't know with exactly what until the doctors told us she needed to have emergency gallbladder removal. after her surgery, they moved her to physical therapy rehab to help her regain her movement since she was in a hospital bed for almost a month. it's at the rehab/long term care facility that the doctors told me she's in the early stages of dementia.while in the rehab, i tried to help the doctors and physical therapists with making sure she did the exercises (physical and mental) that she was supposed to be doing; but if she wasn't ignoring and yelling at the doctors, she was ignoring and yelling at me and it reminds me too much of my childhood. they wanted to send home help in the form of weekly physical therapists and cognitive therapy and medication except once she was home, she yelled and ignored them to the point they stopped coming with no notice all together. i felt too guilty after that to make her take the pills; i regret this, because maybe things would've been better. so now, it's just me taking care of things like cooking her meals, making sure her medicines and doctor's appointments are tended to, making sure she's keeping herself busy instead of staring at the television except she still fights me. she refuses to eat when she's upset with something i've said, she doesn't sleep normal hours, she won't let me ask the other family for help because it's gotten to the point where my health is finally plummeting. i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was 11, and living with her without my grandpa around to talk to has made my mental health worse. i can't see a therapist or make appointments for my health as often as i'd like because she has separation anxiety when i'm gone, and i can't talk to her about how i'm feeling because she takes it as personal attacks, calls me crazy or sometimes downright turns her head away from me in an obvious show of ignoring me. we argue more and more until it's gotten to the point i can barely get out of bed for fear of what she'll say that day to make me feel terrible or to make me cry, but it's the guilt of my grandpa and knowing he'd want me to take care of her that keeps me here. i feel guilty that i don't want to do this. i'm 24, i was only two years into my degree and now i'm not sure if i can even go back because i've forgotten almost everything in the midst of death and grief. i don't have any friends, and the only people i can talk to are people on twitter but. no one wants to hear about something so depressing all the time so i slap on a mask and pretend i am coping but i'm not. i haven't felt this unwell since depression first stepped into my life and not since my first suicide attempt (that my grandma initiated). i have two aunts, a mother and even an adult cousin that all have more resources than me except they're the ones taking trips, going to work and living their lives without any regards to us. they only call her to make sure she's not dead, they never call me. i've never gotten along with them either, except for one of my aunts but it still feels so unfair that this is all my responsibility. i hate the bitterness i feel, because you're supposed to do this for family, right? except i feel like a shadow of myself, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't recognize myself anymore. i don't feel pretty anymore, i don't feel like i have worth anymore. and it's hard trying to take care of someone else when it feels like they hate you every single day but cry and say they need you when you want just an inch of space. i'm not sure what to do anymore. i need help but we don't have the income for home help i don't think. any advice would desperately be appreciated because i feel like i'm failing her and my grandpa, and myself. thank you to anyone listening, not many do lately.", danghey tell your family she's their grandma too they fucking better step upguilt them into ityou did right by your grandpa you were present as much as possiblenowwwww it's a bit much. got to get a caregiver to hang out sometimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fh5i36/taking_care_of_my_grandparents_fell_on_my/,,"taking care of my grandparents fell on my shoulders, except i'm getting crushed under the weight of loss and grief."

"i graduated my bsn with a minor in gerontology in december 2018. i have had my cna for over 7 years by that point that i figured i should just study for my nclex in the coming months. living in the bay area in ca became too expensive i had to move back in with my folks in the greater la area. health issues flared again and money ran out, so of course my procrastination kicked in. i had to pick up another cna job. no hospital would hire me despite all my experience!! maybe my recent degree scared them as i would only be there for short period of time. so nursing facility it is... but then the cna license expired last summer. only other jobs available were home health. took the first one... woman running the agency said “oh she’s a sweet lady but has vascular dementia and alzheimer’s with recent stroke in june 2019 but is in a outpatient rehab recovering but she’s a catholic nun that’s starting to hit.” nothing against them. their community has been great. long story short new blood clots formed in her legs and she stopped being able to walk, so now she’s home hospice and bed bound now. this was back in august 2019.i am still here. i was working 12 hour shifts with her 3-4 day’s a week with her but her aggression and agitation was just becoming so bad i hated going to work. i burned out. i now just so 6 hour shifts a couple of times a week. my first cna job was hospice but at least we kept our residents comfortable. they don’t do anything for this poor woman. tylenol that’s it for her pain! she’s got severe arthritis/inflammation in her knees you can feel the warmth radiate when your hand just hovers over her. she screams every time i reposition her (no pressure ulcers yet. she still eats 3 meals a day with my help).i don’t take things personal. i worked in a major county general hospital ed with an interesting population and was told every degrading word in the book. she tells me to go to hell and shut up all the time. she tells me she’s going to kill herself and she wants my foot to kick her in the head. and she tells me she’s in pain her legs and back hurts. i tell her “main” nun/sister all this stuff but she says “oh that’s just part of the disease.” ummm no shit? i went to nursing school and worked in multiple units of a hospital... i know what i’m working with but just because she can’t tell you doesn’t mean she isn’t in pain. she grimaces all the time and she’s been literally laying in bed since august so i have no doubt she is very sore and in pain. the pressure on her pelvis and back must be so terrible. i do rom often but she is soooo stiff. i have yet to see the doctor come to do an assessment on her. only an lvn comes out. i voiced my concerns but he doesn’t listen. i reminded him 3 times to get me dicloflenac gel for her arthritic knee. she is prescribed 1mg xanax but of course the nun in control of her medication cuts in half so she doesn’t get her full dose. she claims it works for her but i’m the one with her most of the day and i’m the one that gets the lashing all day by this poor frustrated catholic nun. i need to get my nclex asap so i get out of this place but it’s just so hard to watch this lady essentially suffer. i’ve worked in a phenomenal hospice/palliative care facility and i feel we are failing at providing comfort to this women. i come home so agitated and helpless. i’m in no mood to study. the agitation, restlessness, loud vocalizations is just getting worse and the nuns that live in the house with her just close the doors. she apparently had a possible small tonic clonic seizure before my shift started this morning but i do see any signs of post ictal or high bp. though i know she’s very risk for it. sorry for the long post. i actually go on and on! i’ve been trying to watch teepa snow’s videos for some more resources.", why don't you take the test already??????,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f2xels/so_overwhelmed_with_my_11_demented_nun/,,So overwhelmed with my 1:1 Demented Nun
"i want to start this off by introducing myself and explaining my situation.i have been a caregiver for members of my family since i was 20? or so years old.it started with my grandma, then both of my grandparents until my grandfather died. i went on to help my grandma until she was eventually placed in a home where she currently resides. they both have/had severe alzheimers/dementia and my grandma is a diabetic. i would cook, clean, and administer meds for them both. because of my experience with this, it was naturally expected of me to be there to help my mom adjust to taking care of my dad after his 3rd stroke. his first was in 2015 and his third and final was in march of 2016.i had been living with a friend for the past year and would occasionally visit my parents. up until the 3rd stroke, they were doing great on their own and they actually had a healthy dynamic. now some backstory: my parents have an extremely toxic relationship. my mom was a lifelong alcoholic until last year (explain later in post) and my dad was almost never home while i grew up. i am the oldest of 4, 3 girls and 1 boy as the youngest. i was expected to take on many responsibilities from an early age because of my mom's alcoholism. i constantly got into verbal fights with my mom while trying to defend myself. i would get in trouble for stuff my siblings did, i would fight back about how unfair it was that my youngest brother and sister were never made to do chores or clean. this affects their adult lives, with my brother only learning how to do basic things from his gf and my sister turning into an unchecked ego. ithere was a lot of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse that happened pretty much my entire life. my parents constantly fought and would refuse to divorce because they wanted to stick together for my brother. long story short about my brother: he is the christ child and can do no wrong. they worship him. standard sexism in the family unit stuff. my mom would bend over backwards to make sure my dad and brother got everything they ever wanted, while myself and my closest sister were treated like the help. i was the only one that was ever hit and anytime i did something that upset my dad, he would spank me and blame the pain on me, saying stuff like this hurts me more than it does you. i would get my behind shredded for making a b in 3rd grade. stuff like that. the one time i told a teacher about it, she contacted my parents and told them everything. i was having trouble sitting at school because my dad had beat my behind the night before for not cleaning my room in a timely manner.anyways, i will move on to the current situation. a few months after i moved back in with my parents to help out, my mom broke her back. burst fracture if her l1. turns out if you have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis, and you drink heavily every day for 30 years, you make your bones so brittle that a sneeze could break your ribs.who knew right?so i was suddenly not just helping, i was taking care of both of them.now keep in mind the emotional abuse i had experienced in the past.my dad's emotional filter in his brain was basically destroyed. he lost his left side to paralysis. he would verbally lash out at me and my mom for little shit and on a few occasions he tried to hit us with his cane.he could have actually killed my mom if he had hit her but thankfully that did not happen.fast forward to now. i have become their full time caretaker and take care of literally everything.i could go on and on about all the shit that has happened in the last 4 years but this post is already too long. now i am completely burnt out. i can't be around my dad without being triggered violently and i have to stop myself from blowing up. my mom is a narcissistic guilt trip master and i literally cannot leave the house unless it's to take them to doc appts or to buy groceries. the few and far between times that i can leave the house, they both guilt me and make me feel terrible and treat me like a child. i'm gonna be 30 this year. i have no life. i have one friend. i almost never leave the house. we are living off of my dad's social security disability check which isn't enough to actually survive on. my mom is waiting to get on disability but they are taking their dear sweet time. we haven't paid rent in the last 2 months because if we did wouldn't have any money for food or for medicine and that's a whole other bag of dicks right there. both of their meds together cost roughly 800 a month. and that's even with my dad now being on humana and medicare.i don't know what to do. i desperately want to escape and get on with my life. literally everyone i talk to tells me to get out and i know i need to.but here's the thing...i would feel so guilty, despite everything. i would feel like i'm abandoning them. i have tried to reach out for help. nothing is working.both of my parents are technically capable of taking care of some things themselves but they won't do it and when i try to explain how it would help me greatly, it turns into a ""you're so ungrateful and selfish"" argument.i have to make phone calls for them that they could make themselves. fill out paperwork they could do themselves. i even have to talk to their docs for them because if i didn't, they wouldn't care and wouldn't advocate for themselves. there is an extremely unhealthy attachment going on here and i just wanna hear from anyone who is or has experienced something similar. i just need help. i am so fucking tired and i'm scared that i will send myself into a cardiac episode or worse because i'm under so much constant stress. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'm sorry if i have posted in the wrong area. this is my first ever post."," this is a truly terrible situation. wish i had better ideas for how to get you out of it, but someone already suggested calling adult protective services, which i

"when your mom or dad’s [dementia]( or [alzheimer’s]( care requires more than you can reasonably provide, it might be time to start thinking about transitioning to a [memory care]( community. [a variety of memory care levels]( exist, from providing simple medication reminders to full care communities assisting residents with bathing, dining, and ensuring they won’t get lost. before considering a move like this, be sure to verify your loved one matches behavior associated with [the early signs of alzheimer's and dementia,]( and consult a trusted physician.## transitioning to a memory care communitythe first thirty days can be the most difficult as you and your parent work through the shift from independent living to a memory care community. in many cases, your loved one may not always remember why the move is a good idea and might become upset or argumentative. being patient but firm, and leaning on the staff and administration at your chosen community for help, can aid you through this process and make your mom or dad feel at home.## explore before the movetaking your mom or dad to enjoy lunch or recreational activity at their chosen memory care community can help give them familiarity with the building, grounds, staff, and other members of the residence. associating positive feelings and memories with the community can make it easier for them to feel at home once they move in. you can also discuss various alzheimer’s care options with the staff, and see how other residents enjoy their lives in the community setting.## share information with staffthe caregivers at your loved one’s chosen senior living community should have as many questions for you as you do for them. be prepared to tell them as much as you can about your parent’s life and interests. knowing which foods they like and dislike, what things they were passionate about when they were young, and other personal pieces of information about your mom or dad can help staff personalize your parent’s care.## initiating the actual movethe chaos of moving can be even more confusing and disorienting to a loved one living with dementia or alzheimer’s. having one friend or family member spend the day with your parent while the rest of you arrange the setup of their new room can help.choose belongings carefully to create a space that feels familiar as well as offering staff insight into your parent’s personality and interests. focus on items with personal value and sensory input, like a soft quilt or family photos.## take time to visit frequentlyyears ago, the standard recommendation was for family and friends to stay away for the first week or after transitioning to a memory care community. at the kensington falls church, we encourage family members to visit our[ memory care communities]( frequently, and even have a pet-friendly policy so you can enjoy time with the entire family while your loved one adjusts.by planning visits for a specific time of day, you can create a defined routine helping your mom or dad get used to the idea of you coming, leaving, and reliably coming again.## adapt your interactionsunderstanding memory loss can help you learn how [alzheimer’s]( and [dementia]( affect behavior.you may need to adapt the way you interact with your loved one. if they insist an impossible event took place, or that a fact (like the year) is different than what you know to be true, realize that this is their reality. arguing may only lead to unnecessary unhappiness. instead, enjoy listening to their stories and find small, meaningful activities to do together, such as sharing a meal or going for a walk around the grounds.## practice self-careit’s important to take care of yourself to make the most out of your time together. if you are experiencing grief or frustration, there is a good chance they will also pick up on your emotions and become upset. you may want to consider talking with a friend or therapy professional about your feelings as a way to work through your role in the transition.the better you care for yourself, the better you’ll be able to help take care of your mom or dad.## know that it gets easierthe initial transition into a memory care community can be challenging, and at times your loved one may say or do things that are hurtful. but remember, it isn’t personal.they are coming from a place of uncertainty, confusion, and frustration. accept that their unhappiness is temporary. they will have good days and difficult days.by attending to their care with compassion and love, you are ensuring that they are safe and will continue to have every opportunity for a fulfilling life beyond dementia.find out more about how the kensington falls church can help your mom or dad transition to the highest level of independence without compromising their safety.## recommended additional reading:* [how to pay for assisted living](* [dancing does an older body good](* [meet me at the memory

"i genuinely don't know what on earth to do anymore. before i get into everything, let me give you a little background on myself. i'm 18 years old living in a household with my mother, my father, four cats, and recently my grandmother. i'm in my last year of highschool so i've been super busy with school and basically getting ready for college. but besides that, i'm having a problem that i literally have no clue how to fix. my grandmother has been diagnosed alzheimer's for a little over 5 years now, and she's only been living with us for about 9 months. she hasn't been too bad or anything, she actually has been doing amazing lately, but my dad sees her as this burden. he always makes it seem like my mother and i never help him out with her (even though he leaves me for a day or two while he's hanging out with a friend at a brewery or something) and he constantly says how he is frustrated with life. the worst part is that it is now influencing my grandmother, having her say ""i want to die"" and ""no one wants me around"". what am i supposed to do in this situation? i know i'll be leaving for college soon, but i don't want to leave my mother in a toxic environment like that. how do i make him see that he is effecting the whole house with his attitude?", i suggest you contact the alzheimer’s association. they will be able to direct you to support groups in your area as well as what services are available for your grandmother.i hope this is helpful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/dqbmt6/my_dad_is_making_everything_worse/,,My Dad is making everything worse.
"typing this out just to vent. it's been a hell of a day. quick background. my dad died suddenly almost 2 years ago and we found out mom was farther along with alzheimer's than we'd known. i've spent the last two years helping as best as i can, and we finally got her moved into assisted living a month ago. but i feel terrible. i've taken here out of a familiar house (~45 years), taken her dogs away (she really couldn't care for them properly) and the new place is great with awesome staff and good food, but it's just not what she's used to. the transition is not going well. today we've been called by nursing staff twice. first time, i was already on my way up with her dog and we had a great afternoon. she seemed in great spirits and we walked the dog, talked, everything seemed good. late tonight we got a call again. she's upset, bad headache, talking about wanting to kill herself. i feel like i had to get her out of a 'living alone' situation. but i can't help feeling like i've messed everything up. we've sunk like 15k into the assisted living so far. i'm trying to sell her house to help fund things for the next several years. but if it's not working then i have no idea what to do. part time home care, live in home care, moving in with me or siblings, me or siblings moving in with her... all these options were weighed and i thought we made the best choice.how do you stop yourself from despair when the plans you make don't seem to work out? i feel like i've messed everything up and there is no hope. what a terrible disease. it just eats up everything and everyone. i can't believe how few options there seem to be and how bloody expensive it all is. most days all she wants to do is end it all and we can't even help her go out on her own terms. i feel like i've tried my hardest and failed spectacularly. how do you all do it?", i don’t know but perhaps at the two month mark things will be better? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/a6lyhr/what_a_rough_day/,,what a rough day

"my mom has alzheimer’s. she’s 83. i am her only  caregiver, mentally, physically, financially. i’ve taken care of my mom my whole life.  she was married to satan and had his 3 spawns.  monday she was put in hospice for major anxiety. my mom is a type b personality. happy, always smiling. shes has episodes of sleepless, some as long as 5 days but this episode was different.  she’s between stages 7 &amp; 8. monday she woke up paranoid that “the man” was trying to kill her. the cna  saw it right away.  the hospice nurse gave her enough meds to be in a semi coma state. she slept and usually after sleeping and her mind resting she is back to her “normal” self.  this time, i don’t recognize her. her eyes are glazed over, she’s talking, holding conversations and speaking in cajun french.  she no longer recognizes me (which has devastated me) i’m so lost! i’ve only lost 1 other person in my life that has devastated me to my core.  on top of all of this, in may i lost my work from home job and my unemployment finished last week.  all my savings is gone! my mom collects $36 in food stamps and without unemployment insurance the money i collected paid the bills. now with just her as ssi to pay rent, her medical insurance and electricity, i’m financially at $0 in my bank account. in order to survive i need at least $750.  that would pay my car insurance, gas, cellphone bill &amp; provide me with the necessities to take care of my mom when she’s back home.  satan’s 3 spawns have their own liv s to lead and don’t help. they know the situation and don’t care.  they don’t care that i’ve given up my life to take care of her!! the even bigger crap is that she makes $700 a year too much in social security to qualify for medicaid which would allow me to get someone to watch her while i work or put her in a nursing home, where she’ll be sedated every day until she passes! my head hurts, my heart is devastated and i don’t have money to buy a soda!!  our government has failed my mom. she has worked her entire life, sometimes 3 jobs to make sure we had food &amp; clean clothes and they can’t help by placing her on  medicaid .  what am i supposed to do?  i’m praying for a windfall because my mom shouldn’t have to live out her final days in my car!", try talking to the social security office. they helped me by adding a bit to my dads ss to help pay for prescriptions or have his medicare supplemental ins come right out of the ss. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/7exbzg/switch_flipped/,,Switch flipped
"so, as the title text says, my dad has suddenly had to move in with us, and i'm absolutely overwhelmed. the story is as such: a couple of weeks ago i got a call from the police. apparently my dad, who lives alone 3 hours away since my step mom died, had called the police to complain about people having a sit in on the front lawn, and having broken into his house. the cops arrived, and my dad is talking to bushes and there's no one there. he's been bothering the neighbors about it too, who saw nothing. the police said they couldn't admit him to the er, as his vitals were good, but he refused to go back into the house, and then drove to the local gas station and started having a fight with an invisible person in his car, and the police were called again, and so i drove up the 3 hours, and took him all the way back home with me, where after a good deal of sleep and some discussion about the possibility of hallucinations (he was an er nurse and understands the concept very well), he calmed down and seemed to go back to himself, though i could notice a considerable disruption in his normal cognitive abilities. we took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway. so they set us up with an outpatient appointment the following week, and we set dad up in the guest bedroom. we've since had the outpatient appointment, and the psychiatrist basically said that he thought dad had a mini stroke, and it caused an onset of dementia, and he didn't think dad should live by himself anymore based on how he answered the questions. so now dad is moving in with me.first off, dad seems able to take care of himself in many ways, like hygiene and self feeding, but has issues with more complicated aspects of living. he can't really work the tv (he could if it was just turn it on and change channels, but the whole smart tv thing and multiple remotes has him stumped constantly, even with a regular cable box and two remotes). he also has a hard time working the keurig, with its 3 buttons, and can't manage his dumbed down little flip phone, accidentally deleting phone numbers, etc. this is a man who used to work regularly in excel for a clinical trial management service, and the man who introduced me to the internet, set up a computer in our house when dos was the os, and had an atari 2600 from release, so he wasn't a luddite, but now he can't use a computer to save his life. it's heartbreaking to see him futz with his seatbelt for 3 minutes, or with the ac knobs, or the tv remote we got him which only has about 6 buttons, but i used to work in mental health, and patient care isn't something i have a problem with.my problem is this: how do i begin dealing with all of his stuff? he has a whole three bedroom two bath house filled with 40 years of stuff. he has two cars and a truck, a rental house, and two empty parcels of land, all 3 hours away from us. and, i found out after going up there and going through all of his stuff, that he got depressed after my step mother died and hadn't dealt with any bills in almost a year, and his taxes and god knows what else were all kinds of screwed. the first thing i did was get all of his bills paid up, and i'm trying to deal with his finances, but i've found so much stuff i'm out of my depth on, like that he never made any claims on my stepmother's life insurance or anything, and he gets money through investments but he can't really tell me how that works tax wise or anything.here's where i am right now:- i've got his bills paid for april, and i'm working on may's. i have years worth of paperwork to go through and i'm trying to sort through it a little at a time.- we went up this past weekend and i had him label everything he wanted to bring down, and everything he wanted to keep or put in storage.- i put one car in the shop because he just left it in the garage for a year, and we got a new battery in the truck, and drove it back down to our house. the other car is so old i don't think it'll make the trip.- i got his neighbor to cut his grass for the time being, after getting dad's permission to tell him what's going on.- the current tenant of his rental house wants to buy, so i guess i need to figure out how to sell a house without a realtor, which i've never done before.- i've gotten the name of an estate sales agency, to maybe go through and sell all dad's other stuff, which is the only thing i can think to do to deal with all the stuff we can't keep, and i've gotten the name of a junk remover for whatever is left.- dad's house will bare minimum need a major landscaping overhaul (he's let his land grow up significantly, and there are trees down in the yard), and possibly a new roof and definitely new flooring if we're going to sell the house. he owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless. i don't know.- i've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and i'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if i'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.- i let dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now i'm managing them for him.the whole time this is going on, all i can think is am i doing the right thing? how is this going to affect my life? how is this going to affect his life? am i missing something? and i'm constantly second guessing myself and my actions and whether i'm doing the right thing at the right time.i have no resources. my wife is still employed, thank the gods, but i've been laid off due to the virus, which is the silver lining to all of this because i'm getting unemployment with the extra money for the time being while i use my time to help my father, but eventually that's going to run out or i'm going to have to get a job to maintain our home and pay for him until we can get his finances figured out.so, i apologize for the long rant, but i guess what this post is about, is that i need help and though i know more than some i've never dealt with this and i feel like i'm drowning in stress, i don't know if i've missed anything important, and i don't know what resources might be at hand for this.and hell, in the midst of all of this, how do i actually care for my dad!? i'm managing his meds for him, and making sure he gets food, of course, but i'm at a complete loss for how to occupy his time, and help his life be worth living, especially in the midst of this virus stuff.and, selfishly, i need to figure out how i make sure that my dad's life doesn't consume my own? i know my life is derailed currently, and there is now a new normal, but what's on track for me going to look like going forward, etc.any advice, or resources, or anything at all is helpful at this point."," \- get power of attorney so you can deal with his finances, his property and other matters. his wife's insurance money will come in handy once that gets settled. \- put his name in for an assisted living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. my mother's place has assisted living and memory care in the same residence, just different floors. it seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. \- if he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. before my stepdad even started hallucinating, he would get lost and sometimes even ended up in the ditch. finally his kids started ""borrowing"" his car for weeks at a time until he was diagnosed with lewy body dementia and was told not to drive. \- check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. many places have senior's social workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a seniors' center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. \- it sounds like you are doing all you can so far. it will be challenging but the hardest part  is now when things are in such a mess. he is lucky to have you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/ggvuc4/dad_71_coming_to_live_with_my_wife_and_i_after_a/,,"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia.

"my 72 year old mother has been forgetful (getting her dates wrong for major events like weddings, misplacing things, forgetting to pay bills) as long as she's been my mom, but her memory has been steadily getting worse over the last few years and she is now acting weird in other ways.she loses her train of thought mid sentence and just starts stating facts that are sort of related to the thing we were talking about. she asks me the same questions repeatedly, although this might be loneliness and her trying to keep me on the phone. she makes really weird decisions and gets super defensive when you ask about them. this year she started taking out large sums of cash and carrying it around on her. she couldn't have a bag on her at work, so she'd stuff bills in her pants pockets and every time she stuck her hands in her pockets and pulled them out she'd drop money. she was dropping multiple $20 bills every week. i know there must be a reason- she's forgetting her pin or losing her wallet or something, but she gets angry and refuses to speak to me if i push the subject.she has short bursts of very petulant, childlike behavior and paranoia. they usually only last a few minutes, but they are very different from her normal behavior. this is what concerns me the most, she has a different look in her eyes, like she's confused and frightened.this week she left a tap running for hours and flooded her bathroom.i've looked up early dementia signs online, but most of them assume the parent previously had the ability to perform essential self care tasks, which my mother never has. she lost most of her teeth by 40 because she wouldn't brush them or go to the dentist. she has never been able to feed herself regularly, pay her bills often enough to not have services cut off, etc. she has always been bad at looking after herself, which makes it really hard for me to tell if this is cognitive decline or just her norm + aging. my sister has mentioned a few moments when she seemed ""off"" to her, but doesn't believe there is anything majorly wrong. she was working full time up until the pandemic. she seemed to be performing fine at work, her coworkers speak highly of her abilities when i interact with them.i feel like i should suggest she see a doctor to be assessed, but it may cause her to become angry and secretive. she would rather lie than have people worry about her. she once purchased a second kindle because i asked to borrow her kindle and she didn't want to tell me she didn't know where it was. if this is fairly normal for a 72 year old and she's probably going to be stable at this level of functioning for a while i don't want to push her and cut off any truthful communication. if this is actually concerning behavior i'd like to talk to my sister about  how we should approach it with my mom."," you should definitely not ignore this. make an appointment with her primary to discuss what you are seeing and what she is experiencing. if they discount what you have noticed it is time to switch doctors and find someone who has a better understanding of dementia. in the meantime, contact your local chapter of the alzheimer's association for guidance. you do not need a diagnosis to get help. they will be able to provide a lot of guidance and education for you as you figure out what is going on. they also have lots of support groups for caregivers and for those with dementia or alzheimer's. find your local chapter here:  [ hope that helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gf0bam/how_worried_should_i_be/,,How worried should I be?
"i’m not sure if this is a rant or a call for advice. basically my grandfather and his wife had a workplace affair in the 60s, and one day decided to walk out on their spouses and children to be together. i say “walk out on” but she left, while he kicked my grandmother and their four children out of their home with a few days notice. they’ve lived a purposefully isolated and reclusive life ever since. my mother and i are the only ones who ever came around and she was very clear that she would rather we didn’t, and only put up with us because he made her. i hadn’t been around in a couple years due to distance, but recently moved a bit closer (2 hour drive). my grandfather passed away last week. apparently, she’s been living with dementia for a few years. she should have been placed in an assisted care home long ago as she cannot even be left alone, let alone care for herself in any capacity. we found out she hadn’t showered or changed her clothes in 3 months. she won’t eat unless you put a cooked meal in front of her. most of her day is spent sitting at their small kitchen table, and going in the bathroom every 10 minutes to smoke. mom and i are taking turns staying with her and everyone involved hates it. mom is power of attorney/proxy, and i am the alternate. her children made it clear they want nothing to do with the situation or to help in any way. she has about a 10 minute “reset” time as we’ve been calling it. following the doctors advice we initially planned to tell her he died once, and then remain vague. but she’s so mean (was when she didn’t have dementia) and keeps telling us to leave her alone. my mom lost her patience and started telling her over and over that he died. now i can’t go back to the vague answers because while she can’t quite remember, she’s been told enough that she has a vague idea (saying things like “no...something else happened”) and getting combative until we tell her. she’s convinced that we just need to leave and that she can handle their house, their 7 cats, and her own care by herself. it’s clear that she can’t because she doesn’t even think to feed the cats or do anything for herself. we’ve been in contact with a few nursing homes and one seemed like they’d take her. we even had an appointment on monday where we took her there and they talked and they said they’d give us a decision in 24-48 hours but now they’ve just been ghosting us even though they have 12 open rooms. we’re in a pretty rural area so that was pretty much our only nearby option. my mom is now under the impression that at the first sign that somethings wrong with her (she’s been complaining of a pain in her head for a few days) that she’s going to take her to the hospital, where we can hopefully get adult protective services involved since we also can’t get them on the phone. it’s making us physically sick to be in that house since they both smoked inside of it for half a century. my mom has to do the bulk of staying there since i’m still working and like i said, live two hours away. my mom and i are both so exhausted from caring for this woman that always hated us and to be honest we never cared for her much either, that i’m worried for my mom’s sanity and my own safety. i’m just so exhausted and i drive all day for work on top of the drive there all the time (on top of my job which is very high stakes and stressful because of covid-19) that i feel like i’m constantly on the edge of falling asleep or passing out. i know my mom isn’t the type to do anything rash but if you make someone suffer physically, put them on the end of verbal abuse from their “stepmom” 24/7 all while trying to process the death of a parent, i’m worried she will do something in the spur of the moment. we’re both just so angry with the situation, that he put this on us, and that it’s all happening during a pandemic which makes everything 100x harder. we don’t even have death certificates yet to access his bank account so everything for her and his cats has been coming from us, and we both struggle to support ourselves too.", wow that's really hard.  you and your mom are good souls for taking care of her despite the fact that i kind of feel like she's not really your problem. have you considered getting any county or state agencies involved since her family doesn't really seem to want to take care of her?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gbhwca/grandfather_passed_his_wife_has_dementia_and/,,"Grandfather passed, his wife has dementia and hated us when she didn’t.

(they are on amazon, under able life universal stand assist.) all of the physical therapists with home health who came to see him were impressed; none of them had ever seen anything like it and most asked me what they were called and where i got them so they could tell their other patients. they might be worth looking into for your dad.my grandmother is the narcissist in our family, and i am fairly sure she has dementia now too, but it is so hard to tell what is dementia and what is her usual  personality. she complains over literally everything; even if she loves something to begin with, she will complain later. (for example, i bought her new cordless phones a few months ago, and every time i’d ask if she liked them she would say yes, they were perfect. two nights ago she sends me a text asking if i still have her old phones because she doesn’t care for these.)it’s really hard not to let her attitude get to me, but i try to remind myself that she is making a choice to be miserable, but i don’t have to let her make me miserable too. if she’s in a mood i don’t indulge it, i carry on as normal and leave her alone as soon as i can. one way you might be able to tell what is dementia vs. narcissism with your dad would be to have someone else come in to help him. sometimes dementia patients are difficult with family but not with strangers, and will be perfect angels when a nurse tells them what to do. if your dad is hateful to strangers too, well, at least then you know that it’s nothing personal towards you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g9he21/when_to_know_they_need_help/,,when to know they need help
"hello world of aging parents. i have a challenge to overcome. i’ve been taking care of my mother. my husband and i have lived with her (in tight quarters) for over a year now. she’s on a dementia medication which improved her condition greatly. she has refused to take any medications recently, so she’s no longer on her anxiety/mood medication. the only diagnosis i ever heard for her, psychologically speaking, is borderline personality disorder, which appears to fit.my feelings oscillate wildly. often i think it’s not so bad. and then i go to places where i think the plan to move and leave her with an aid (to make sure she’s covered, needs wise) is all she deserves. she can be incredibly mean and also incredibly supportive and that’s her struggle. but i’ve felt that she let the worst parts of her get the better of herself. so i’m having a hard time biting the bullet and signing off for a lawyer to get her on medicaid and get her at-home care and disconnecting myself from the responsibility. my mom is against having her finances interrupted and having ‘a stranger’ help her with anything. this would mean both of those things. i also signed on to work out of state at the end of the summer, and my husband and i agreed that we should take some time to ourselves out there to get a foothold before having her come out, around 6 months of time. that means it is imperative to get that care set up for her. so there’s really “no option”.questions, comments, words of constructive criticism and/or support are all welcome."," the adjustment will be hard, but it sounds like it is what is best for all involved. reassure her that you are not disappearing forever, but want to go back to enjoying the role of daughter. it will be a good thing for all of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g4w5oj/support_needed_afraid_to_sign_papers_send_check/,,"Support Needed: Afraid to sign papers, send check for retainer to get mom community care"

"good days, bad days. dad just had full tests run two weeks ago, all fine. hes been doing well until yesterday when he was weak. today he was mentally wiped. tonight he kept talking about things that confused me. like how i paid taxes last year id have all these little guys chasing me around.  we had been discussing taxes but ive been out of work so didnt file, no idea what the joke was. anyway, about 10:30 he went to crash and i noticed at 12 or so he was still awake, which is very odd. i checked and he was brushing his teeth, so i thought ok hes almost in bed. at 1 he was stuck trying to get his shirt on. he had his hands in the wrong holes. got that fixed and his last pills down and he tells me he saw a little girl run through in a nightie. i blew it by saying theres no little girl, didnt want him to be scared. he said he knows she wasnt real.  i know thats his parkinsons/dementia. he didnt seem scared and got him off to bed fine. dreading to see how he is tomorrow.  normally since he has so much trouble getting around he watches tv all day.  but the last two days hes just sat in front of the tv and its not on.  dont know what to think except he is falling and is nearer the end. any advice from people who have dealt with this?thank you"," this is not unusual in the elderly. unless it frightens him, you can just pass it off. but if confusion or disorientation are present, you might look into his blood oxygen levels. this has been my experience with my mom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fyyowo/hallucinations/,,Hallucinations
"i'm currently living with parents, father 61yrs and mother 66yrs. my mother has dementia and parkinsons. my father is the primary caretaker. i help my father becuase due to the lack of my mother's physical mobility by dad needs help. he had back and knee issues. either with changing her and bathing her.i am the one that goes out to shop for groceries. and  i am honestly afraid of contracting covid, having no symptoms and infecting either dad, mom, or both. i'm doing the best to limit the space between my father and mother when i get back from groceries, i wash my hands. yet my father still gets close when i have to put away groceries. a day after groceries i had to help bath her and carry her. i am honestly afraid, paranoid, and anxious about all of this. i'm not sure if i'm doing enough."," what do you go out for? heres some ideashave groceries delivered, set on the porch. anything that can, set it in the garage for a day. everything else wash thoroughly. chances are pretty slight of catching it from a bag or box or can but best to be safe.  after you put food away yes wash immediately and change clothes, dont let your dad help put em away.if you go out to get meds see if they can be delivered, if they have medicare set them up with optumrx and do 90 day supply on maintenance drugs and get it delivered.if you need to make any check deposits? see if they can be set on auto deposit. if not see if the bank has an app, use it to deposit checks by taking a pic of front and back in the app. doctors visits, whenever possible use online visits.need other supplies? what can you get on amazon?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fycyxf/i_am_one_of_my_mothers_caretakers_and_im/,,I am one of my mother's caretakers and I'm concerned about contracting covid
"mom (72) &amp; dad (77) moved to pr 20 years ago. throughout those years i would visit at least once a year and they would come here maybe every other year or so. it could get expensive when you have kids and job obligations. i tried my best to be there for them and when i had better financial standing i’d send money or buy things for their home. i’m far from being financially stable now  and before the covid-19 came along i was looking for work because my soon-to-be-ex and i are parting ways. i need to get my life together. right now i am torn. my parents are there basically alone except for my younger brother who has not been able to work due to mental illness. he doesn’t drive or do much around the house. i worry constantly that should any of them get sick with the virus they will be done. dad has early dementia and mom is diabetic. i have crazy scenarios that play in my head of them getting sick and no one to help and just dying alone in their house. my mom said she knows it’s not fair of her to ask me to go there and take care of them. which is basically her way of saying, “when are you gonna be here to take care of us?” my husband thinks i should go now because i’ll regret not spending their last days with them. i do not like pr and the past few times i went i got sick every time. my parents don’t have air conditioning and i can’t take that kind of humid heat. the mosquitoes love me and i got so bitten up on one trip i had to be put on antibiotics and the doctors were afraid i had zika. maybe i’m just a crazy person but i feel like if i go now i will never come back. i’ll die there. my adult kids are here in the states and even though they are independent i want to be where they are especially during this stressful time."," altho i am in favor of honoring you parents if you can, you must do the right thing for yourself as well. your situation is full of doubt for now. you are about to be on your own? will you be getting any financial support from your soon to be ex? do you have reasonable expectation for employment that can support you? would you have reasonable expectation for employment if you went back to pr? it sounds like you have some life decisions to make. if you go can you get ac put in? if they have a small home maybe a couple window units.  if you dont is there anyone who can check on your folks every day or every other day? church, govt assistance or can they afford to pay someone? i know that medicare here in the states helps pay for some assistance. i know you dont want to go. i cant say that i blame you. its a very tough decision. but you cannot act so that you have no life left when they are gone. i dont know what kind of work you'll want but if there was a company that had offices here and there maybe you could start there and then come back.whatever you decide  take good care and be at peace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fvdbnz/feeling_extreme_guilt/,,Feeling extreme guilt
"probably just grasping straws and sinking but im wonderingmy dad 93...stroke 2 years ago, dementis mild and parkinsons. he has tremors in his arms and hands and at times head and body upper. he uses a walker and has been steadily degrading over the past 2 years. his biggest issues are tied together, sleep and strength. he has a sleep med and a parkinsons med and an alzheimers med it goes in cycles usually and varies in severity and i cant help wondering if theres anything that can set it off.  usually theres a down day or three followed by a string of good daysm maybe a week or so. but i think its getting worse. last sunday/monday he was so weak he couldnt get out of bed or get around. all tests at the docs were ok. starting tuesday he rapidly recovered and was stronger than ive seen him in a long time. he even walked without his walker for two days. but last night he didnt sleep and today hes been very weak. he did nap some this afternoon and this evening but it doesnt seem to help. his sleep med im sorry i dont remember the name but his parkinsons one is pramipexole (sp?). what struck me is that he was strong all wekk and wasnt taking his pramipexole, he started that again last night and didnt sleep and is very weak.  probably no correlation but any chnace reasonable that the pramipexole  is messing with his sleep or making him weak? i know hes had same issue for longer than hes had the drug but odd to me he cant tell a difference when hes not taking it then he starts again and the floor drops out. sincerely hoping he can come back cause that too weak to get out of bed and get around may see him go into a home. neither of us want that",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fv7bx6/med_conflict/,,Med Conflict

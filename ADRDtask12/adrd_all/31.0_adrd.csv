"i've had this dizziness/lightheadedness for 5 weeks now and it has consistently lingered for this entire period, at varying degrees, but never subsided. also it's gotten super bad as i type this. i cant recall any new memories since this started, and always have a super foggy memory, little to no memory, of what i've done throughout the day or days before it. every night,  i try to assess what i've done through the day or remember key events and i cant remember jack. i also space out alot, and time feels like it's just blitzing by, because it's already summer and it doesnt feel like it for me. i feel like i'm stoned, just living in a simulation, have a hard time focusing, and alot of difficulty communicating my thoughts. i'm getting the optimal amount of sleep, trying to think positive and nothings working out. feel like a zombie. everything is just moving by fast for me and i cant recall my experiences and enjoy life even if i tried. i dont even have the brain capacity to continue my college studies because i cant properly apply what i've read from a godamn page of a textbook. eveytime i try to play sports and get exercise, i just suck at the game and i also get even more dizzy. and my skills at the things i used to do ate deteriorating. i got diagnosed with panic disorder couple months back, but i hardly believe these symptoms have anything do to with stress, because i don't feel stressed or panicky whatsoever. i've also been extremely agitated and prone to raging and punching things, so it's probably alzehimers. wondering what you guys think because i'm borderline hopeless and about to give up on life.", sounds a lot more like ocd. talk to a doctor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bt5ic5/18_and_almost_positive_i_have_some_form_of/,18 and almost positive I have some form of dementia
"my mum doesn’t seem to know when she is full and after a meal will sometimes have two desserts, then two bananas and sometimes more. she doesn’t remember that she has eaten or what she has eaten obviously but i thought she would be able to feel full. the only time she’ll say she’s full is when she’s had a large meal like a sunday roast with a pudding and then she’ll often complain of feeling queasy. similarly with alcohol she’ll polish off a bottle of wine in a couple of hours and claims she doesn’t feel any effect."," this is something you really need to be conscious of. my mom(while asking who i am, and where my 3rd brother is((there is only one)) tends to do the same. constant consumption is a problem. you know they’re doing it then, but what are they doing when you aren’t there?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bsx58u/does_alzheimers_affect_interoception/,Does Alzheimer’s affect interoception?
"hello! i know this is a support group and usually people give advice about this disease and how to cope. i can't give advice today (we still don't know how to cope), but i want to share a new face of this disease. one i live with every day for some years now and i have not seen others talk about yet.&amp;#x200b;usually, when searching for any news or information on dementia or alzheimer's, i find health department sites or doctor's blogs or psychiatric doctor's blogs, or as on this site, regular people trying to spread positivism and support each other. the advice is valid for the incipient stages of dementia. for someone like my nana who is 9 years in, that advice is useless. currently she can no longer live by herself. in my country the nursing homes have a bad habit or drugging the patients  (to keep them calm and obedient) until they're vegetables drooling in a chair or their bed (plus they die quicker this way). because of this my family has decided to bring my grandmother in with us, and take care of her at home. &amp;#x200b;my nana has a weird case of dementia. she has no idea where she is (the fact that she's at our house) and she's convinced she's back at her old job, the one she had in her youth. she no longer recognizes us as her family, not in real life nor in photos. she has a vague concept of her estranged family and how they have ""abandoned her"", even if we see her daily (we live together).  these 2 symptoms are very common, however her reactions are not.&amp;#x200b;my nana is convinced that we are her interns (at her old job) so no matter what we tell her, that we're her family, we show her pictures of all of us with her from our youth to this past year, she will deliberately lie and fake a memory recovery. the moment the person she was talking to leaves the room for a moment and returns (in which time she forgets ever speaking with that person), she starts laughing and ""spreads the latest office gossip"": ""did you hear that bitch how she was pretending to be my daughter and how she tortured me with pictures and the lies she tells about my so-called family, if i even have such a thing. she want to ""get rid"" of me...(is what my nana will say)&amp;#x200b;she has a big blank in her memory. at times she remembers that she has a family other times she thinks she's in her 30's, but **she recognizes and remembers my mother** as ""the bad bitch"" that always likes to pick on her. she recognize me by name and face as the poor unfortunate intern also being bullied by my mother. to escape my mother's ""wrath"" when she is taking care of my grandmother, like feeding her or bathing her- activities which my nana hates with every pore of her being, my grandma fakes ailment. she fake cries and screams and yells for the police, she has yelled rape and tried to fake sue my mother several times (it has become a sad dark inside joke, be careful what you do or i'll sue). she has tried to teach me to do the same. to manipulate the ""bitch"" and force her to leave us alone. even if, for the time being, she trusts me, she is trapped in this fake world she made up in her mind and any information that she finds ludicrous, like us being family, she accuses us of being insane. she refuses to bathe, to eat or to take medicine. if we give her a pill she screams ""murder"". after a bath comes a shower of cussing and damning and ""suing"" .&amp;#x200b;since she started living with us (not being able to take car of herself), she became more unhygienic, she spits, cusses like a storm, has become evil (she brakes things on purpose to spite us and is happy about her accomplishments- she thinks this is a form of karma) . taking care of her is a nightmare! &amp;#x200b;all the post, the sites everything i've seen online talk about ""keeping their dignity"" and try to convince them to give some sort or incentive to cooperate...i have not seen a single piece of advice on how not to have a brain stroke when finding my nana drawing flowers on the bathroom mirror with feces.  how to keep your head and your depression calm when on a daily basis your family member/parent (whome you love dearly) cusses you out and damns your entire family (in a very biblical way. dementia has not affected her creativity).you give them food and after chewing a couple of times they decide to spit it back on the plate or on the floor. how to avoid an ailment from all the toxic fumes you've ingested cleaning her room and the rest of the house from the times she decided not to go to the toilet and just do it there and cover it with a towel, no one will know.&amp;#x200b;i need some advice/help/support  with this window of dementia! how not to lose my mind while taking care of the person i love! i need anger management advice on how not to go crazy when she brakes things or takes in vain all i do for her. because she will continue spitting her food, behave in an unhygienic way (trying to not make it to graphic), all the while pulling my mothers hair and screaming because my mom happens to wash her. god forbid' we use soap on a daily basis! (why do dementia patients hate cleanliness?)when i see posts like ""keep their dignity"" it make my blood boil! i'll admit it works for people in the first 3-4 years of this disease i'm not a hypocrite, but my nana has no dignity left! she's the worse kind of spoiled brat that you can imagine (and i say this with love because we care about her a lot!) she's lost all contact with hygiene and she likes it that way, she enjoys manipulating and lying to us to get her agenda. she refuses to leave her room, she just wants to be left alone with her mess. i need to see some advice on dealing with advanced stages of dementia. and if there is none, i at least want to post this ""lovely picture"". because there are many faces of alzheimer's.&amp;#x200b;i love my grandmother very much, she's the person who was always there to help raise me. she has taken great care and provided very much love to us all, and seeing her in this destructive way is killing us all...very slowly. my mother has already started having fizical issues because of the stress and daily torture. and putting her in a home in not an option, it's also very expensive. &amp;#x200b;thank you for reading!i hope i shed a different light on this issue.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bsl0v9/i_need_to_get_this_of_my_chest/,I need to get this of my chest
"i've been going back and forth about having a service for my mom who passed on monday.  it was one of the things we never discussed before she had alz, we discussed every other aspect of death and what precedes and follows it, except her wishes for a service.  she had a very busy and active professional life and was a prominent member of the local community here in the 90's.  since she was only 72, there are still a lot of local business contacts around and active locally here who have been following my updates on facebook.  a few family members, friends and former co-workers have asked about a service.  i don't have enough money for a traditional, funeral home type, memorial service for her.  i feel the normal celebrations of life that i can afford would be too......... low class, for lack of a better word or description (my mind is in a weird place right now, brain hasn't been working at 100% since she passed) for the life she lived and the friends she kept.  i don't really know what to do.  i would like to acknowledge her passing in a special way and honor the life she lived, but am lost at how to do it.  any suggestions?"," we cremated my grandmother and had the service at her church. the church helped out so much, they provided the meal afterwards, they came out as soloists and the ushers. if your family is connected to a religious group i would recommend starting there. even if you don't cremating the body and having a memorial service is so much easier and cheaper than having a service with a body. if your culture and/or religion is ok with it i highly recommend it. you can also have a service at a park or another cost venue. it's pretty easy to transport an urn. do what works for you and your family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bs49up/service_ideas/,Service Ideas

"my grandmother rarely recognized me for the last year but every time she saw my 6yr old daughter she lit up and said, ""well, look! it's my abbie!"" her smile was so beautiful and genuine. it's very hard when they dont seem to be the person you remember. sometimes there would the faintest glint in her eye and she would smile that beautiful gentle smile. it was then that i like to think she know me. i'm the oldest grandchild. she always called me her boy. with mom and dad working she basically raised me for the first 3 years and we never lost that bond.  well, until this terrible disease took a firm hold. i lost her on march 23, 2019.  she contracted a uti. i knew from the last time this happened that her symptoms would get worse.  they did. within a week she had pneumonia. then she was unable to swallow. even the smallest bit of water would choke her. on doc's advice and the facts it was decided to make her comfortable in hospice care. walking into that hospital room for the first time was the most gut wrenching thing i've experienced. she's lying there asleep ""breathing"". by breathing, i mean making an loud awful sucking sound. it was so hard for me to see her like that but i refused to leave her and my mom. we stayed. we wet her lips with a rag. we stroked her hair and held her hand. my grandfather was there too. i'd never seen him cry until that week. he was always so strong. they were married for 63 years. the only time apart was during his air force service in the 50s.  we had all dozed off until 0530 on 23 march, 2019. my mom shook us awake to say that her breathing had changed. it was much softer and slower. i stood there for 45 minutes and watching one of the most important women in my slip away. i watched my and grandfather sob. i stood there completely unable to do anything. i couldnt help her. i couldnt hug her. i couldnt make her laugh. i couldnt tease her until she slapped my arm and said, ""oh hush!"". i couldnt do anything but cry and watch her take her last breath. selfishly i want her back. every minute of the day is consumed by thoughts of her. i know shes better off. i know she feels better. i know she can remember the names of family shes seeing again in heaven. i know that she can hear every beautiful nd unruffled note of the angel's voices. but i want her back."," that's alright, man. it's alright. you go ahead and feel whatever you are feeling right now and don't you feel bad about it. thank you for sharing that with us. your grandmother sounds like a beautiful person, and she passed some of that on to you and your daughter. i'm so very sorry for your loss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/br3m4o/this_is_long_but_i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,"This is long, but I need to get this off my chest."

"my grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimer's three of years ago, so my mother had the idea to move her out of her house to a little apartment inside our house terrain. first year wasn't annoying at all. on the second year we hired a nurse that would stay with her only on weeks. but on weekends... it's really annoying. she knocks our door every 15 minutes or so, and if you don't answer, she knocks harder or goes to one of the windows and starts looking inside and knocking it. my mother literally gets no sleep taking care of my grandmother on her only 2 days she can rest every week, and my father has literally no patience with her at all. i just want my mother to get some rest, to feel good and not to be stressed by this. what can i do?"," it’s really good you care so much about helping your mom! i’m in a similar situation except i live several hours away (caregiving professionally for another family) and i feel guilty all the time for not being able to help my mom out. suggestions: it sounds like your grandma needs to be occupied. is there anything that can hold her attention? gardening, puzzles, coloring books, radio/ tv,  things she can kinda do on her own. maybe setting her up every hour or so with an activity will give your mom a breath. are you able and willing to physically help out? maybe you can take on the weekend duties since theres someone there on week days. i assume your mom does weekday evenings and nights and it would be so relieving for her to have you there on the weekends. if your mom feels uncomfortable accepting that level of help from you, maybe you could take a small stipend thats like half of min wage or something so she doesn’t feel like you’re “doing too much” (a problem i had with my mom and my other grandma years ago). your dad needs to learn not to be angry with her. try contacting or looking at info from the alzheimers association, maybe he needs a little education to be more patient. like someone else said, pull in more family members to help out. a guilt trip may be necessary. see if theres an affordable senior center with an alzheimer’s program she can go to maybe just one day a week for activities. the only alternative other than those is to get a caregiver on the weekends as well. i will add that as long as your grandma doesnt have bad physical conditions and she’s still relatively manageable, you dont need to hire a nurse or professional. a college student or even a responsible teenager could watch her on the weekends for minimum wage, its basically easy babysitting. and since every person with this disease is so different, experience doesnt always mean better care. i hope this helps, good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bqmumm/we_are_just_tired_we_need_help/,We are just tired.

"after months of backpedaling on my part, my brother and i have finally decided on a move in date for my 68 y/o mother with alzheimers: next monday, the 20th. she was diagnosed in april 2018, though she could've been diagnosed a year earlier (stubbornness prevented her from getting checked out, my forcing her to see a doctor was probably the start of me becoming the bad guy), and started exhibiting symptoms as early as 2014 (difficulty driving, which resulted in withdrawal from major events like my nephew's birth).after her sister died in december (also from alzheimers), she declined significantly, though i could see the behavior differences as early as september. she's definitely in the moderate stages at this point -- she has no problems with mobility, can mostly figure out how to heat a frozen meal (much to my displeasure right before i'm about to start dinner), and can make tea and waffles in the morning (all very routine for years), but her hygiene has really taken a hit (she washes, but i don't think she uses any soap), she stopped washing her own clothes months ago, can't pay her bills, takes a significant amount of time figuring out how to use the phone (when she uses it at all, which is rare), and when asked when her sister died, she said she ""maybe two weeks ago,"" and this was on a good day.of course, it's bad days that've lead us to this move, and as her primary caregiver, i've taken the brunt of her abuse and delusions. constant accusations of stealing her money, ruining her life, taking away her car, being mentally ill. i tried to explain to her she has alzheimers and she doesn't believe me, which is worrying. two months ago she burnt a microwave pizza beyond recognition, ruining the microwave and making the house stink for a week. last month she somehow knocked a burner on and gas filled the house -- luckily i caught it in time. she seems to have lost her sense of smell, which is troubling as well.still, i can't help but feel sad that it's come to this. it's an awful feeling taking your parent and placing them in a home, but she has enough money for years of care and my ultimate hope is that she flourishes among new people, makes some friends, and gets to have some measure of enjoyment before her alzheimers takes her completely. i'm also ready to just be her son again, to enjoy her company and not have the ever-increasing burden of caring for her wellbeing, a task she seems to resent. i'm excited to hit the play button on my life again too, and so is my very supportive girlfriend."," your story is so familiar. we moved my mom into assisted living 2 years ago in june. she was 70 at the time, having been diagnosed at 68. like your mom she was still able to some basic “meal” making and even was driving (very scary) but she needed more 1:1 care than we could provide. it was very tough but she actually gravitated towards the assisted living over an in-home aide. she did so well with the transition and was living on the “traditional” side until three weeks ago when we had to make another very hard call to move her to the memory care unit. again she’s transitioning well which is a huge blessing. all of this being said, please know you are making the right choice for your mom and you and your brother. your peace of mind will allow you to spend quality time with her, and she will get the attention, care, social life, nutrition, etc that she deserves. i echo what another poster said about keeping on top of the facility in regards to showers, laundry, fees, etc. my brother and i have quarterly meetings with the care director and head nurse to discuss my moms status, concerns, or questions we have. even if it’s only 10 minutes, it’s helpful for all. sending you strength and prayers. we’re here for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bou77t/monday_is_the_day/,Monday is the day.

"hello all! i’m so glad there’s sub for this. my dad was recently diagnosed maybe 2-3 months ago and was also diagnosed with dementia at that time. he’s also been dealing with hearing loss for years. i don’t know much about the disease but it seems in these last few months he’s significantly worsened. he went from being able to remember most things/people to barely remembering anyone at all. he remembers that i am his daughter but he doesn’t know who my mom is majority of the time. the hardest part is watching my mom tell him daily she’s his wife and him argue with her. my dad was never one to argue before, he was always very calm and would rather talk it out than start a fight. now he’ll yell at her and ask me how “that woman got into his house”. she’ll remind them of when they were married and he’ll just say “that was along time ago” and angrily follow her around the house asking how she got in or worse ask her to leave. my mom has confided in me that at night now he’ll sleep on the couch and get mad that she’s sleeping in “his bed”. they’ve been married over 30 years and he doesn’t remember that at all but remembers me and my name. i almost wish he forgot me instead of my mom, and i know that may sound terrible but, it hurts so much to watch my mom try and try for something that he may never remember again. i guess i’m posting this for advice. my mom has told me when they first initially went to the neurologist my dad declined any treatment they offered, i’m not sure what the treatment was. i don’t know what i can do to help or make my mom feel better or even take some of the burden off of her. i try to remind him to when i can but i’m not around majority of the days they’re together due to my long work shifts. i want to help more but i just don’t know how."," the best thing you can do for your mom is give her a break. even if you can't be there always because of work, take some nights and evenings to sleep there and keep an eye on your father so she can relax and do what she wants. living with someone with this disease can literally make you crazy, she probably needs a break more than anything. put together a photo album of your parents to show your dad if he doesn't believe who she is, but as others mentioned dont turn it into an argument of who's right and wrong about facts. it sounds like he needs an activity he can do, if he has the free time to literally follow your mom around the house and harass her...he shouldnt! puzzles, yard work, anything he might be able to focus on that will give him a ""task"" to do might help. if it's financially possible, getting him into a day program for alz patients so he can socialize and do activities a few hours a day will give your mom a break. you'll probably have to lie to him about what it is to get him to go though",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bnj6x0/my_dad_was_recently_diagnosed/,My Dad was recently diagnosed

"hello,this is my first real post on reddit, my family and i have reached a place where we need advice if anyone has time.we put my dad in a memory care facility back in october 2018.  we searched multiple facilities before choosing this one.  it was new, clean, and the staff we met seemed enthusiastic and excited for the work they do.  as soon as he was admitted odd things began happening.it seems small, but immediately upon visiting him we noticed his nails were quite long.  the staff informed us he was shredding his clothes with his nail clippers, and they had taken them from him.  the assured us they would make sure his nails were cut, but since then there has not been one visit in which his nails were trimmed.  in fact, recently when i brought him new shoes they hurt him, and we found that his toenails were far too long.  i've spoken with the management multiple times, i've received a different story each time.  sometimes they simply tell me the next time they have someone in to do nails, they'll make sure he gets them done.  other times they say they can't do his nails, only a podiatrist can, who comes once a month.  once they even told us they only have the women's nails done, not the men's. he is consistently un-showered, and his bed clothes and clothing (my dad is an avid shower-er, 2-3 times a day, so i'm not sure how they are preventing him from showering) .  we worry about his dental care, as if these things are not being taken care of, what are the chances his teeth are being taken care of?  every time we visit, someone comes along and tells us he needs more toiletries, but when we buy them they never get used.  i recently asked the staff to check their back room, and everything we had bought in our last visit was still bagged and unopened. the staff is constantly changing, and never seems to be aware of dad's needs (he likes to flush everything down his toilet, so we can't leave his supplies in his room as an example).when we discuss our concerns with management, they immediately get defensive. and then the assure us they will make extra efforts moving forward to make sure, for example, he is showered and his nails are cut.  we've asked that they communicate with us ahead of time when he needs supplies, instead of waiting until we visit, but this still has yet to happen.we've also asked for any records or information they can provide us detailing any care dad receives, or just a general summary of how he is doing.  they were unable to provide us with those records, and balked at the idea of sending us any kind of weekly/monthly synopsis of how he is doing.there is so much more to this, but our take away is that there is a management issue, and a communication issue.  we've tried to request a meeting with the owners, but management will not give us the owner's contact information.  management insists that the owners are busy purchasing a 3rd property, and prefer that management schedule the meeting instead of letting us contact them directly.here are the things i think i need to get a better grip on:1) what is appropriate to expect from a memory care facility?  2) are we not sympathizing enough with the challenges the staff/management face?  3) should we be able to meet with the owner's directly to express the concerns we have over my dad's care?things have turned so sour with management that it is awkward to go visit dad.  they've been bullying, defensive, and ineffective.  in all our discussions with management, the best the give us is they will focus on dad to make sure he gets more attention.  but that feels wrong.  shouldn't all the patients there receive this kind of basic care?  i yearn to hear management say they are going to implement something systematic to address this issue for dad and all patients.  sorry for the long post, but thank you for your time.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/blr4ex/problems_with_our_dads_memory_care_facility/,Problems with our Dad's Memory Care Facility

"so a little bit of a background: my grandmother is 89 years old and unfortunately has this terrible disease. she was able to live by herself pretty normally up until about the last year. this past christmas, on christmas day to be exact, she passed out in her front doorway when a family member was picking her up for christmas lunch at our house, and cut her hand. my cousin, who is luckily a doctor, was also at our house so he checked her out after she arrived and fixed her cut up. on that day, my mother decided that it would be best if she just went ahead and moved in with us. we have had a bedroom prepared in our house for her to move in for well over a year at this point, but my grandmother had always been too stubborn to actually move in. my dad works full time. my mom is a stay at home mother—she has full time custody over my 5 year old nephew, so my parents are raising a small child that permanently lives at our house. the disease has made my once sweet grandmother very argumentative and somewhat mean. this has started to take a toll on the entire family, especially the 5 year old. he is now too afraid to sleep in his own room due to her wandering during the night. my mother gives my grandmother all of her medicine throughout the day and helps her to shower. my grandmother can still go to the bathroom on her own (as long as we use one of the toilet chairs that sits over the toilet) and she can still feed herself and even walk up and down steps. it has just gotten to the point where my parents feel like they are not equipped to be her sole caregivers. it is having an extremely negative effect on the 5 year old, and my mom is barely able to even leave the house to get in carline to pick him up from school. we simply cannot afford a nursing home. but we also cannot have her stay with us at our home for much longer. even when we just go along with what she says to try to avoid arguments, she gets aggravated anyways and walks around slamming doors. she forgets where she is at numerous times a day, and calls my nephew “that girl” and keeps asking where “her” parents are and why they are not here. it is just a terrible situation all around. my parents are curious as to if we could set up hospice for her at her own house. would she even qualify since she is not incontinent, can still walk and feed herself without choking, and can still speak (even though the main thing she says throughout the day is “i’m confused only because i’m out of my routine”)? would this be a good idea? we want to care for her but we just cannot do it anymore and it is not okay to put my nephew through something so traumatic every single day. pros? cons? i’ve read online that a patient with alzheimer’s being considered for hospice must have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. is this correct? if she gets denied for hospice care, what in the world can we do? sorry this post got so long. any advice would be greatly appreciated by my entire family."," anybody, not just people with alzheimers, can get hospice only if the doctor certifies that in the doctor's opinion that they have 6 months or less to live.   your grandmother doesn't qualify, or at least your doctor doesn't know that she does.this is so awful, and i'm so sorry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bl5efy/hospice_eligibility/,Hospice eligibility
"so, my grandfather has had alzheimer's for quite a few years, but it has only ever affected his short-term memory. over the last year we've suddenly been having gastro-intestinal issues with him, and it's becoming more frequent. the first was a stomach bleed, which is not really related to his dementia. however, we have had to be more conscious about what he can eat so that his stomach isn't aggravated. we very nearly lost him when that happened. in the last month or two, we've noticed he is not chewing his food anymore. he has always been very greedy with food, with a massive appetite, which i think is making this chewing problem much more serious. an example was when we went out for a meal, and he was literally lunging at the bowls on the table, and before the food had even made contact with the spoon, his mouth was open and ready to have food shovelled into it. he ate two whole bowls of prawn crackers before the starter and main course, and it was honestly a very uncomfortable situation for our family to sit through, and we were very confused about why he was being so greedy and excessive with this. he isn't normally that bad.he went into hospital with a blockage a few weeks ago, and my father has been trying to encourage my grandmother (who is mentally very healthy, but physically not very mobile due to arthritis) to only make him soft meals, which will not block him up. last week he threw up a lot of unchewed food again, and then again today he has been sick. at this point it seems pretty obvious that his food is becoming a problem, and my grandmother is not helping the issue. she certainly understands that he needs small pieces of food, soft food, and healthy food to maintain his overall health. i'm especially concerned about the choking risk of him not chewing, which she seems to miss. my grandmother is actually lying to her children (my dad, aunt, and uncle) about how she chops his food into ""miniscule"" pieces, but we know this is a lie because we have seen the unchopped vegetables etc. she is very lazy and will talk about how they are eating well in front of us, but we have seen ready-meal packets in the bin at her house. i can't understand how she has seen the negative effects of eating certain things for him, and still gives him these things and is lying to us about it. we don't know what to other than constantly telling her what she needs to do. i am in education and her children are all in full-time employment and cannot give him the care he needs day to day, she is the person who needs to and she will not listen."," try blending fruits like banana,  papaya,  kiwi with honey. can add yougurt too to make a smoothie. can refrigerate for consumption during course of day. consider packets of milk supplements too. all the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/bkkzot/my_grandfather_keeps_having_problems_with_food/,My grandfather keeps having problems with food

"this is mostly a rant post but any advice would be greatly appreciated. my grandmother lives on her own in a large city. in the last year she’s developed dementia. we’ve recently set up cameras around her house to keep an eye on her since no one in the family lives particularly close to her. yesterday my mother decided to check the cameras just on a whim to see if my grandma was eating her dinner. when she opened the camera app she was shocked to see a huge strange man sitting inches away from my grandma in her kitchen. my mom quickly called my grandmother and asked to speak to the man. he told my mom that he’s a contractor and that my grandma was just about to sign a $5000 contract to fix her front steps. my mom told him that she has dementia and that she doesn’t have any signing authority and so if he could please leave that would be appreciated. he gave her attitude but agreed to leave but only if he could come back the next day when my mom would be visiting, to discuss the contract further with my mother. my mom, still shocked that this man is in my grandma’s house, agrees and tells him she’ll be arriving around noon. fast forward the next morning, my mom has a gut feeling that this guy is bad news. he had given her his cell number and texted her his business card info the day before so she texted him and told him that my dad had already hired someone to fix the steps so please don’t bother stopping by my grandmas today, thanks anyways. my mom then makes the drive to my grandmas and upon arrival checks her phone. a wall of texts from this man greets her, calling her a liar and telling her he’s not going to lose this contract and that he’s still going to show up for their meeting and if she really doesn’t want him to do the work that he wants her to tell him no in front of my grandma so my grandma knows “what kind of daughter she has”. my mom then texted back for him to stop contacting her. he said no and went on again how he’s still going to show up for their “meeting”. my mom then informed him she will call the police if he doesn’t stop texting her. as my mom is sitting in the driveway to my grandmas house, she decides to call the local police department anyways to inform them of this persistent man who won’t stop harassing her and is preying on her elderly mother with dementia. as she’s talking to the police over bluetooth in her car in my grandmas driveway, the man shows up. he starts yelling at my mom that he knows she’s talking to the cops that he doesn’t care what the cops say, he’s not letting my mom defame him. eventually after yelling at my mom for 15 minutes and refusing to leave my grandmas front lawn, he finally left. but then consistently drove past my grandmas house every hour scouting to see if my moms car was still in the driveway and tried calling my grandma.i don’t know what to do. the police said there’s nothing that can be done unless he comes back to her house and she lets him in again and we catch him on camera and call 911, because that would be trespassing. but this means someone has to be monitoring the cameras in my grandmas house constantly to catch this. we all work and are unable to stay with her for more than 24 hours at a time. we’re waiting to get her into a retirement home but we’re at the bottom of the wait list at the moment, so she has to remain in her home for the next little while. she has no concept of who anyone really is, if you say you know her, she’ll believe you and instantly trust you. she doesn’t understand what’s happening or why this is bad, she still thinks she knows him. tldr: my grandma let a strange man into her house, turns out he’s crazy and now won’t leave her alone until she signs a $5000 contract with him. she doesn’t understand why this is bad and will probably let him back in her house if he comes back. not sure what to do or how to keep her safe from him when no one in family lives close to her.", she needs someone there to keep watch.  you could hire someone.  is there someone you know in the city?  a friend's kid who needs a place to stay?  someone who needs a summer job?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/biks24/grandma_has_no_idea_the_danger_of_strangers/,Grandma has no idea the danger of strangers.

"(from a previous post of mine as per request.)&amp;#x200b;**i am going to be the bearer of bad news because it's easier to hear from an anonymous source.  if you're feeling awful and depressed, stop reading now.  this is a hard thing to take in.  make sure you're ok before continuing.**​dementia is essentially untreatable, irreversible, is a horrible thing to live through, and ends in death.  there are a few drugs out there, but most of them don't do much and the side-effects are worse than their benefits.  there are a few human drug/treatment trials going on, but they're few, far between, you have to live near a hospital that offers them, many times they don't work, and anything they do find is years away from being available to the public.the sufferers and caregivers who do the best with this disease are those who plan for the future.  they know what the next stage is and they've already done the research and signed the papers.  the ***best prepaired*** progression is usually:&amp;#x200b;1. ""impaired cognition"" noticed by family, usually in ""help me find my  car, i don't remember where i parked it"" situations.  electronic gps like a tile can help here. 2. poa/healthcare poa signed by sufferer, or other documents such as trustee, etc. 3. all financials nailed down, local laws researched, support group/network for caregiver found and activated4. dnr, ""quality of living"", death, corpse arrangements, burial arrangements discussed ahead of time5. long-term care health insurance attained (asap, the longer you wait the more expensive it will be) 6. shared home prepared for sufferer to live with caregiver (separate doors, ramps, extra rooms, extra baths, etc)7. patient diagnosed with dementia, usually ""mild to moderate"" stage8. medications to deal with side-effects prescribed, such as sundowner's, violent tendencies, hallucinations, etc.9. medications to help with actual alzheimer's prescribed.  they are usually not very effective, and are expensive and have serious side effects.  some experimental treatments, such as specific forms of light therapy, are showing promise but these will not be available from hmos for 7-10 years from now. 10. driver's license revoked11. apply to state/fed/insurance for any assistance, from financial to in-home.  this may take many tries and many years.  talk to your hospitals' elder care representative.12. if sufferer is violent, hallucinating, or wanders, talk to local police so they can be prepared.13. get an electronic tracker, bracelet, or other identifier for any wandering patient.14. around this point a few sufferers take their own lives to spare  their loved ones from dealing with a body without a mind.  this is not  common with boomers and silent generations as they generally believe  suicide to be a sin, but we're seeing it become more and more common in  patients who are younger.15. this is the point where we used to institutionalize our elders.  it  was very common in the 70's and 80's and even 90's to put them in care  homes.  now we know that they decline much faster when  institutionalized, and it's cheaper to keep them in the family home,  where they get better care.16. in-home care becomes necessary during the day.17. 24/7 in-home care becomes necessary or the patient needs to be  admitted to a memory care facility.  this is a locked ward where trained  professionals deal with hallucinations, violent tendencies, etc.  this  step is usually triggered by a tragic incident, such as patient  wandering and being found by authorities, patient harming caregiver,  patient injuring self, etc.  memory care facilities are not cheap, they  can run between $2,000 - $10,000+ a month.  &lt;&lt; this is where  caregivers with insufficient preparation or insufficient healthcare  access burn out... badly. 18. patient loses memories entirely, needs help with every daily activity 19. patient loses ability to feed self20. patient loses ability to swallow​please note that this progression can take months or decades.  i hope that anyone else can chime in if i've missed anything.​eta: thanks to u/[mitzukai\_9]( for the tips on costs, and added/modified points 1, 5, 9, and 18."," we're at #17 and it is becoming clear after applying for all state benefits and trying to get my father in a nursing home with our limited funds and only medicaid to pay; i honestly hope he moves on to the inability to swallow stage and chokes to death. i said goodbye when he still knew who i was. i've grieved, cried, said help to the lord. so let's get on with this. let the guy die. peacefully though; i really don't want him to choke but it's the next stage left. as for me; if i ever realize i've got alzheimer's/dementia i most certainly will commit suicide before becoming a burden to my family or drain in society.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/beno4e/progression_what_to_expect_how_to_maybe_avoid_the/,"Progression: what to expect, how to maybe avoid the worst"

"new to this sub, as we got the official alzheimer's diagnosis for my 75 y/o mother this morning. even though my sister and myself already knew my mom's mind was deteriorating, it was still a shock to hear the doctor confirm our suspicions. only 4,5 years ago we lost our dad to a very rare brain disease (corticobasal degeneration), two years after that my mom got breast cancer (from which she is completely recovered) and now alzheimer's. when it rains, it pours.thankfully we have a very good healthcare system here in the netherlands. we're getting a home care nurse to apply medication patches once a day (and to check up on her), and a special dementia care coordinator will contact us soon to help us find the care we need for our mom. right now, my sister and me can still handle most things (making sure her bills are paid, taking her grocery shopping once a week, etc) but in the future she'll need help with self-care, keeping her house clean. my mom is very resistant to the idea of getting care like that. and it's not just the disease talking, she just doesn't want to accept help especially from strangers and never has. any tips on how to break the need for future care to her gently and peacefully? if push comes to shove my sister and myself have power of attorney over her (we had a legal document made with her permission and filed at a notary for this when we realized she probably had dementia) but we would rather not force the issue. she told me flat out over the phone just now she didn't even want the home care nurse to stop by. tough, tomorrow i'll be at my mom's for that appointment to make sure things go smoothly (fingers crossed)."," my mom is the same way. we kinda have to force it on her. we got the home health aide by telling her we would pay for the first month to see how she likes it. that worked for that. she still would probably prefer if they didn’t come by and she likes her aides. we got her meals on wheels the same way, we’re gonna pay for it so you can try it out. my mom doesn’t think she needs the care or help so she doesn’t want to pay for it. some decisions we just have to make for them, i find my mom accepts those decisions once they are made for her. good luck and i’m sorry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/b8zdbm/got_diagnosis_now_to_convince_my_mom_she_needs/,"Got diagnosis, now to convince my mom she needs care"

"i posted to this group about a month ago about my violent grandmother and how my family is doing nothing about it. my grandparents live with us and it’s driving me crazy.i recently found out i’m pregnant. i was excited but scared because i’m only fifteen, but something struck me. i can’t raise a child in this environment. it’s dangerous. it’s unsanitary. it’s no place for an infant to be. it can’t be healthy for me or the baby to be around my grandmother who pisses herself and shits wherever she wants. i’ve been avoiding her as much as possible since i found out i’m pregnant. i can’t be in the house with someone who’s violent and will hurt my baby. i’m in the process of moving to my boyfriend’s house for my safety and our child’s. i’ve been moving stuff out and i’ve been a lot less stressed lately. i’m finally getting out of the hellhole that my house is.

"last night was a new level in the alzheimer's game. my mil forgot and then remembered tom petty died. first she came downstairs and slumped on the couch. when we asked what was wrong, she announced she's on a hunger strike. we were a little confused, so asked her to elaborate, and she said she was too sad because tom petty just died. she has literally been grieving this since it happened in 2017. i know now that it was 2017, because we looked it up together. the only thing that cheered her up was knowing that ""i'm gonna go meet him up in heaven, just you wait and see!"" i don't know what's gonna happen when she remembers what happened to george harrison... also, meeting fans might not be heaven for artists, but who am i to judge?"," awe :( but meeting heroes is heaven for art lovers!i'm also a petty fan and i assure you, he wouldn't want any of us going hungry on account of his dying. sometimes when i feel very sad from loss, i will listen to ""it's only a broken heart,"" cry a little, and then i feel a lot better.<3edit: my grandma often says she won't eat when she's upset tho, i get it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/b7qjdz/when_you_remember_your_favorite_artist_died/,When you remember your favorite artist died

"my grandfather have alzheimer's and it's been pretty hard on my mom and i. i've read some stuff and it says that she has a higher chance of getting alzheimer's which has really gotten me worried she is 50 and whenever she forgets somthing my brain always jumps straight to ""she has alzheimers"" how can i stop this"," alzheimer's actually can start presenting its self that early on, and its never a bad idea to get an early screening for it. doctors can do all sorts of physical and mental tests to tell you where your mother stands on her likelihood of having or getting it, which can ease your mind to know. having a regular sleep schedule, drinking lots of water, and having a good diet can have a positive impact with her chances of getting alzheimer's, or the pace at which is gets worse. but for now, try to focus on your grandfather and dont worry so much about the healthy members of your family!

"note: not native english speaker. sorry if any word is not apropiate. and not sure if this is the proper sub; tell me and i'll remove if it isn't.my uncle is going through this disease. he is an elderly person. he has always lived alone and has no children or wife, only us. last week, he went for a walk and fell, hitting his head very hard. fortunately, our neighbor found him a few minutes later.this has been the last incident in a long list. we try to take care of him (he doesn't want a caregiver, only us), but we have decided that he can't go out for a walk without supervision. but he hates this situation - we understand - and is getting agressive. so we are looking for a device so that he can go for a walk and we can know where he is and if he is ok.we tested - without success - a device [like this]( and [this one]( but he didn't use it. he also hates tech (no even regular phone, since i have memories), so an smartphone is discarded.we have thought of giving him a smart watch (analog appearance). maybe he wants to take it and not take it away, but we're not sure about this.any ideas? any source to look for a solution?we just want him to be happy for as long as possible, but in a safety way.thank you in advance"," you could attach a bluetooth tracker like tile to items he usually carries, such as keys. it's not 100% coverage but a good backup if he forgets or disables another device.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/b73cnp/best_device/,Best device

"my grandmother has had dementia for several years, and has been rapidly declining in recent months. she had become less verbal and aware each week that i‚Äôve seen her. visited yesterday and was told prior to my visit that morning she has been singing and asking for food. however, i walked into her room and she was in bed staring at the ceiling. wouldn‚Äôt say a word and didn‚Äôt acknowledge my existence. put on music which usually works and she wouldn‚Äôt sing along. i might as well had not been there. it‚Äôs like a switch had been flipped and she was completely gone. doctor came in, and she finally spoke. ‚Äúam i dying?‚Äô‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp my son‚Äù she muttered. after doctor left it was back to staring at the ceiling. i said my goodbyes just in case, and i was leaving i got a very weak ‚Äúi love you‚Äù which was the first time she seemed to be aware of my existence in the room. given the rate of decline week by week i know i don‚Äôt have much longer with her, and it‚Äôs really hard. this is my 4th grandparent going though something like this, and it hasn‚Äôt gotten easier.  i really feel for all y‚Äôall going through something similar. it‚Äôs one of the most difficult things to go through watching someone you love go through this horrible thing."," the apparent awareness and pain in her statements is devastating. i‚Äôm sorry. it sounds like she is really fighting, too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pdapji/yesterdays_visit_with_my_grandmother/,Yesterday‚Äôs Visit With My Grandmother
"i‚Äôve been reading up on the idea that dementia, alzheimer‚Äôs and other neurodegenerative diseases are caused by lipofuscin buildup, which is caused by excess metals like iron and aluminium, and lipids, specifically polyunsaturated fats (seed oils) and highly unsaturated fats (omega-3). vitamin e and consuming saturated fats over unsaturated are among some ways that can apparently reduce/halt lipofuscin production but i‚Äôve just heard of a nootropic drug called piracetam which apparently significantly reduces the accumulation of lipofuscin in brain tissue in rats. if anyone has any experience or knowledge of this drug i‚Äôd be really interested to hear about it. thanks!"," while i am all about alternative medicine, when it comes to dementia we need to be careful. there are many supplements that are being considered as able to help dementia. but in most cases, there are more helpful to the company or person who sells them. unfortunately, there is no cure for dementia and everyone is desperate to find one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pd1lhe/does_anyone_have_experience_using_the_piracetam/,[deleted by user]

"so i always thought my mom (f62) was really smart. she was really good at being social, she has a few degrees, and always knew what to do no matter what it was. her mother had dementia and i caught it two years before anyone ever noticed. lately, something has been off with her. just barely, but i still noticed. so today we went to the hospital i work at, i needed to pick a few things up and i was going to buy her lunch and go to the little boutique inside. when you walk in we have a machine that tells us if you have covid symptoms, your temperature, and what you‚Äôll be doing while there. i signed in and she argued with my coworker about how she didn‚Äôt think she needed to be signed in if she was going to be walked around by an employee. this is out of character for her normally. she told me she‚Äôd by me an outfit because i bought her lunch, so we went shopping. i picked out an outfit and she told me she would buy one piece but not both. i wasn‚Äôt upset or anything so i just put both back and told her it was fine. she got mad and told me to leave so i walked out the store. she followed me yelling. she tried to argue and cry all the way home even after i told her everything was fine and i wasn‚Äôt mad. i was so confused because i was perfectly fine with her not buying anything and truly didn‚Äôt think anything of it. she told me a few weeks ago that she had trouble remembering the details of things that happened recently. she also can‚Äôt understand new concepts anymore. she is usually pretty good with technology. she hooked up/wired  her own surround sound around her house, hooked up her printer and fax machine, she even took apart her wifi router and put it back after dusting it. lately she can‚Äôt understand why she shouldn‚Äôt have an iphone 4, calling me to understand what a smart tv is after owning it for two years and using the apps, or why she needs both cable and wifi to watch tv and use internet. i got my own phone plan and bought us each a phone. she canceled her phone plan. she returned the phone i brought her, and took her line off of my contract and got mad because her contract she had was canceled. i didn‚Äôt even know this happened. we were putting her on my plan because my job would pay for it and now she has nothing and says it‚Äôs my fault. she canceled her own contract and asked to be put on mine. she says it never happened but i didn‚Äôt just dream that up. she also says we‚Äôve been fighting a lot, but she starts arguments and is the only one arguing. she basically repeats the same stuff over and over, but it has nothing to do with reality. i leave her house so confused because everything was normal and i still don‚Äôt know what she was arguing about. she‚Äôs never been one to argue with stranger but now she does everywhere we go. i don‚Äôt know what to do or why the sudden aggression and confusion all the time."," 62 is a young age for dementia but not impossible.  dementia is an insidious disease and what you described sounds like pretty drastic changes.  is everything you said over the course of years, months, or weeks? had she recently started any medications?like others have said, it's important to make sure there's no acute infection or something causing delirium.   psychiatric issues should also be explored.if there's a memory clinic in your area you should take her there.  otherwise, a neurologist would be second best option.  they will likely want her to take a ~ 4 hour neuropsychiatric test to assess her cognition and a brain mri at minimum.  if not, then insist on these. hopefully, this is just a uti and is easy to treat!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pc9ci3/i_think_im_starting_to_notice_signs_in_my_mom/,I think I‚Äôm starting to notice signs in my mom?

"hi everyone, we're moving my 76yo mother with dementia into a memory care unit next monday.  she has no short-term memory but her long-term is still relatively intact and she knows who we are. we've told her that she has to move out for a few days while the workers fix a leak in her ceiling (which is true) &amp; that we've found her a nice space where she can stay until they've finished.  any thoughts on how i leave her at the residence once we've shown her around?  i've read here about avoiding formal good-byes so do i just say that i have to meet the workers at her house and will swing by afterwards?  do i call and go by daily afterwards or do i give her and the staff space to figure it out?  she will have a phone there and i'm her person so i know she'll call and ask when she can come home. i think i can handle that but am not sure about how to just leave her there and about how much i should talk to/visit her for the first few weeks.  this sub has been a wonderful resource for me as i've navigated mom's care after my father passed in november.  thank you for all you've shared - i've seen myself in so many posts and it's helped tremendously to know i'm not alone."," the staff will definitely help.here's what happened when we moved mil into mcu. it took a lot to get her out of the home (that's a whole story) but once in the car she was fine (short term memory shot). we arrived and she was babbling on and on about how this place (the mcu building) was this awesome restaurant she and fil used to go to. my husband ran in to tell the staff we were there. he actually locked the car door as he worried mil might bolt. while she and i were in the car, mil had a rare lucid moment, and told me (paraphrasing as it's been a few years, mil has passed since then), ""i know where you are taking me, i may put up a fight, but i'm okay with this, i've been terrified at home on my own. i don't want to go in there but i know it's for the best.""my husband believed me that she actually said this (she and i were very close), some of his siblings think i was making it up. but i swear she said something to that effect. > do i call and go by daily afterwardswe visited regularly. your mom will get better care if the staff thinks you care. dropping her off does not mean signing her off. it's just a new chapter. hopefully a chapter where you can enjoy the better parts of her while you still can, when you aren't so stressed and worried and you know she is getting good care, and is in better circumstances than being at home alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pbf2wv/advice_needed_for_transition_into_memory_care_unit/,Advice needed for transition into memory care unit.
"hey all,my father died from ftd a few years ago. no other case of dementia in my family is known to me, but there was never any contact to my grandfather, in fact, birth certificate says ‚Äòfather unknown‚Äô. so there is still a chance his case is familial.after reading up on it i found out there is still a considerable chance i might inherit it, so i went to a genetic counselor. unfortunately, i failed to take a hair or really anything else of my father in time, so he could not get tested before being cremated. the counselor told me that while it would be possible to have me tested, without having my fathers results the answers would be unsatisfactory, in the sense that a negative result would still not mean much, and a positive is, well, awful news.i wasnt as informed back then as i am now, but the way understand it now, familial ftd is almost always caused by a known mutation in c9orf72, mapt or grn, so why would my fathers results be important? only for some of the other much rarer cases where some other gene might be the issue, but the relationship between the mutation and development of ftd is not entirely understood? i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this wasnt more of an attempt to shield me from a potentially devastating reveal then anything else. can somebody enlighten me?cheers"," i don‚Äôt understand. why would you need your dad‚Äôs dna to find out if you, personally, have a gene abnormality? my mom has ftd, and we got the genetic testing results back yesterday (negative, as far as they can tell). it was just a gum swab. perhaps this is a payment issue? my mom got some of it covered by aftd because she has a diagnosis. is there a similar assistance plan if you have/had a diagnosed parent? is that the hold up? i know the testing out of pocket is exorbitant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pbbm41/genetic_testing_and_frontotemporal_dementia/,Genetic testing and frontotemporal dementia

"hi everyone. this may be a long one, as i‚Äôm not sure of how to ask for advice without explaining the family dynamic. a little background info: i‚Äôm a (26f) part time caretaker for a family friend (78f)which i started about a month ago. when i‚Äôm not caretaking i‚Äôm at home caring for my 2 year old and 3 month old. when i began the job i was very excited, because she(mary) is always so fun to be around and has a wonderful energy, but i‚Äôm afraid i‚Äôm close to burn out. she had a fall 6 months ago so now has a caretaker from 5-9 and i take the day shiftin the 5 hours a day i am there i‚Äôm pretty much in charge of everything. all meals, dr appts, shopping, med management, and every small request she makes. i can‚Äôt even go to the bathroom or pump(i breastfeed)without her calling my name to ask me to do something..the shadowing is extreme, but i digress.. i love this woman as if she were my grandmother, so it is hard to see her family have little involvement in her life. mary is very wealthy and has always had conflict with her daughter whom is known for being extremely money hungry, her granddaughter lives in barcelona, and her twin brother(the closest family member she has) cares for her very much, but as far as care he doesn‚Äôt do much bc he lives about 2 hours away. she has not been officially diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs, but after a week with her it was very clear and i don‚Äôt think her family knows or cares that it‚Äôs progressed a lot, though she still is in the early stages of dementia. i want her to get the treatment she needs, but it‚Äôs been difficult. she has claustrophobia and we have tried an open mri twice to no avail. the first time she refused, second one she couldn‚Äôt keep her head still. they now suggest that she be sedated to take the mri. she‚Äôs also has had a neuro doc call to have a memory study done, which she refuses. she is afraid they will use a diagnose against her and start taking her things, put her in a home,etc. i assured her i wouldn‚Äôt tell her family anything about what her test results may be, but she compared taking the test to ‚Äúif i was dying of thirst and you had a glass of water i‚Äôd rather die‚Äù. i‚Äôm reluctant to have her do the mri bc i‚Äôm not sure how being put to sleep will affect her brain. she also really doesn‚Äôt want to bc she‚Äôs afraid. some days you would have no idea nothing is wrong, but the next day i‚Äôll get there and she will have a burner on with nothing on it, or i will overhear her talking to a friend about ‚Äúpracticing driving‚Äù even tho she‚Äôs no longer supposed to after getting in 2 wrecks last year. i‚Äôm torn between making the memory test appt for her bc i want her to get the best help she can and to be able to live in her home as long as possible, but she would be so mad at me if i did that. do i make the appointments bc i care for her or let her make the choice to not be officially diagnosed? she is getting more and more anxious during the day and it‚Äôs taking a toll on us both, so i also want her to get diagnosed for my own selfish reasons i suppose, hoping they can give her something to relax and let me do what i need to in the short time i‚Äôm there during the day. she also fired her caregiver of 6 months and hired me because her other caregiver was ‚Äútoo demanding‚Äù. so i also don‚Äôt want to risk her getting so mad she fires me. thank you everyone for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated, as my brain feels too fried to think on the issue any longer. üòê", taking her to the memory clinic is probably the best idea.  a head ct would work just fine she doesn't really need the brain mri but it is important to rule out other causes of cognitive change like a tumor or what not.   she may benefit from an ssri that helps with anxiety as well so that could also occur with the doctor visit.  she just needs a visit with the memory clinic and a moca cognitive test which takes about 10 minutes that would probably be enough to diagnose her given what you've described.  pretty much everyone with dementia is given  aricept and eventually namenda which are two fairly benign memory medications.  though if you're worried she will fire you perhaps convincing the family to bring her would be better.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p8jgss/need_advice/,Need advice

"found out the hard way when i tried to make a withdrawal that didn‚Äôt go through. the state called me to tell me after i already had figured out what happened and figured out who the conservator would be. i kinda knew this would be on the horizon after my dad saw the most useless psychiatrist ever. she took him off his anti depressant, and made a recommendation to the court that someone else be appointed the conservator. i was hoping that 1) it would take more time; this appointment was at the end of july and 2) that she would hear my plea that this isn‚Äôt what my father (if he was in his right mind) or i would have wanted, and that this potentially could ruin my life as i know it. i helped him sell his previous house late last year in a high cost of living area, and to move to a new house in the same state with lower cost of living. i didn‚Äôt have malicious intent, but did want to ensure that my needs were met; food, medication, clothing, etc. he constantly accused me of wrongdoing because i wasn‚Äôt able to devote my life to constantly shopping for him, and didn‚Äôt want to spend $200+ a day buying himplants. i already cut back a lot of my expenses. it took me a long time to find stable employment where we live now and now i‚Äôve had a job for a month‚Ä¶ making half of my previous income doing 2-3x more work. i‚Äôve barely been able to pay off debt and pay bills, let alone save anything. i do have some peace of mind knowing i‚Äôm no longer responsible for his financial or medical logistics. i was in way over my head with that and now don‚Äôt have a responsibility on me that i can‚Äôt handle. however, i have no idea what the future has in store. i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm going to be kicked out of my house. i don‚Äôt think my dad is going to be happy when he realizes a court appointed conservator is going to be much more expensive and give him much less of what he wants than i would have. i know there‚Äôs a probate hearing coming up next month, but have no idea what that means or what to expect. my friend who used to be a caretaker mentioned that it‚Äôs possible i could insist on being paid for half the value of the house, since my name is on the title. this would be the most ideal outcome, since then i‚Äôd have a safety net and the ability to figure out a plan. idk how realistic that actually is though if they don‚Äôt want to sell the house in the immediate future. he hasn‚Äôt declined enough to need to memory care. if anyone has gone through this and has any idea of possible outcomes to expect, that‚Äôd be very helpful. any support or advice is appreciated."," update: the meeting with the conservator today went better than expected. the hearing is just to establish who the permanent conservator is since she‚Äôs technically temporary, but wants to be appointed permanent after the hearing. we‚Äôll have to start paying our share of utilities and for food - which is going to be hard - but not as hard as having to leave in the immediate future. she also said she‚Äôs not going to look much into financial history so that‚Äôs a relief. she thinks he‚Äôs going to need to move in to a home in the next several months or so, but not necessarily just yet. apparently he‚Äôs further along in dementia than i knew - she called it ‚Äúmoderate-severe‚Äù - so she thinks he could end up being a danger to himself or others by staying at home. part of me thinks he could remain at home for longer; he doesn‚Äôt have a lot of medical needs, he‚Äôs only 66, he can prepare some food for himself and has caregivers that come and get him groceries and are supposed to be making sure he eats. i know moving to a home is very expensive and he‚Äôs nowhere near as far along as a lot of the people i see on this sub. i can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôd be less of a liability for the conservator to have him being watched 24/7; then the responsibility falls on the facility if anything goes wrong, not on the conservator. however, it‚Äôs possible i‚Äôm in denial about how far things have advanced, or not able to do enough to keep him safe here when he‚Äôs very resistant to anything i suggest. gonna keep this up here for a few hours so the people who commented know what happened then delete the post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p7rez5/found_out_today_that_someone_else_was_appointed/,"Found out today that someone else was appointed conservator of my father‚Äôs finances and affairs, nullifying my financial POA‚Ä¶"

"first off my situation:i'm a male. i'm a high functioning autistic person between age of 30-35. i live with my parents, unemployed but trying to make money in my own way. i've tried the normal way, but it simply doesn't work for me between the workplace harassment and other problems. to the point where if i ever have to go to a normal job, i will off myself (this isn't the problem i'm trying to fix. this is simply caused by a life of horrible events, and again i have to do it my way since the normal way doesn't work for me).luckily i live with my parents who do seem to care at this time, but i do worry a lot what happens if they stop caring or what will happen after they are gone. but because i live with my parents i also have to deal with my drunk sister and her kids at this time. this does add a ton of stress on me and i'm sure it has made things far worse and made new problems. but some of these problems were around when i was 15.i did try to talk to a general doctor about some of this, but my mom who was in the room passed it off as stress and the doctor quickly agreed. sitting down with a mental doctor the first thing they asked without me saying a word prior is ""what drugs do you want"". so they aren't any help at all (in fact, i found they are more for the kick backs they get from drug companies)what is happening:* my memory is getting far far far worse over time. like if my mom ask me to get x item from the fridge in the garage. by the time i'm halfway there i forget what she wanted. sometimes it's so bad that if a person says something like ""can you get me some tea? oh, and did you"" and that quick i forgot they asked me for tea. like i know they asked me for something, but i 100% forgot what they asked of me. once this happened, i asked what they wanted, i went in the next room and forgot, and this happened 2 or 3 times.   * it should be noted at times my memory is really good. like to the point i can remember what was said when i was 3, what the room smelled like, and everything else. but these moments are happening less and less. like there is events i'm having a hard time or impossible time recalling anymore.   * it should be noted i have 4 degrees, and some of the info i was quickly able to recall, i'm not able to recall at all. like at all at all.* my spelling is getting worse. like i never been that good at it, but i have noticed a major decline in quality even when i'm trying as hard as i can. for something like this i have to review a good 4 or 5 times. when trying to write a paragraph for something i'm selling on etsy i have to spend a solid 1 to 2 hours on it.* i noticed i'm stressed out far more easily.   * note: i think this is directly caused by my sister. my sister came back into my life before the lockdowns and before she came along i was starting to be at peace with my life. because she most likely is a real sociopath and she drinks heavily. we had 3 dogs that died in the time she was here, and she was a nightmare each time. it was so bad that we had to deal with her being drunk while literally one of the dogs was bleeding out of their nose. (1 dog died to cancer in the throat, another died to liver problems, and another died due to malpractice which is being investigated. the one with the cancer the vet did bloodwork and said she showed signs of being extremely stress, and in a roundabout way she said the stress was a major killer. (my sister's kids is below 6 years old (i think 3 and 5), and they are complete brats when she is around. jumping until stuff gets knocked off the walls, yelling, running, stripping, and so on. my sister does nothing to stop any of this. my sister is the type of person who had her kids pee outside (even with one of them being a girl) because she will have to go out of her way.) it should be noted the dogs died in the same year.* i noticed i get worried about this far easier.   * idk if this is caused by my sister and her kids. i think part of it is, but i've always had this problem.* my memory problems can be dangerous at times. like when i was a passenger in the car when picking up my sister's kid from school one day. i seen the stop light that was red. i kept wondering to myself what it meant, what was it, why did all these cars in front of us had red lights, and why the person that was driving was slowing down. it wasn't until maybe 3 hours later i remembered what all that was and what it meant. this isn't the first time something like that has happened in such a place. and if i was the one driving, i wouldn't of slowed down. prior times this happened i was driving but by myself (i think this happened 2 times). i kept wondering why everyone was so slow, and i forgot what a speed limit was. like at the point i was going 100+ mph before i slowed down since i knew something was wrong. i'm just lucky it didn't get someone killed or a cop come after me.* on most days i have a solid 2 hours where my head is clear enough to do anything. like some days is more and some days is slightly less. there is no way to know how much time i have or how much brain power i have before the mental fog sits in. like some days i can go all day with no problem. but most after a few hours mentally i'm no good.there is a few other things, but i'm pretty sure if someone knows what i'm going through they might be able to point out what it might be. at least point me in the right direction.note it is possible i might of had a stroke at some point (if not a few). but i have no way to test this i think. one of the other things i was thinking of is maybe early dementia. but idkthe only reason why i'm seriously iffy on that is i remember when i was 15 the alarm beeping and i sat there trying to figure out what an alarm clock is, why is it beeping, what does the numbers mean on it, and so on. like this is the first major event that i can think that that seems to relate to my memory problems.note i have had blood test and get them yearly for general base line checks. there doesn't seem to be anything here that is too far out of normal if at all.i never had my brain scanned, and i don't think i have the money for that."," 30? i wouldn‚Äôt worry about it. i‚Äôd check a brain or sleep clinic but perhaps your house‚Äôs noise and your stress is causing you to be forgetful. to be fair, if you had dementia(even early onset) , you probably wouldn‚Äôt be typing this post. stay strong! ü§ç",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p6m543/is_it_possible_i_have_early_onset_dementia/,Is it possible I have early onset dementia?

"not sure if this is the right place, but i‚Äôm so frustrated and at a loss here. my mother (63) had a tbi 2 years ago and her memory has gotten progressively worse. yesterday, called me to tell me my grandmother died and we talked for about an hour. and about 30 minutes later, she called me to tell me that my grandmother (mom‚Äôs mother) died again, forgetting we had just spoken about it. then about an hour later, she calls me in tears, saying she is so confused and doesn‚Äôt remember if she told me that my grandmother died. at this rate, i‚Äôm terrified she won‚Äôt even remember her own name by the end of the year. we have always had a strained relationship, particularly during the past few years. it‚Äôs totally devastating that her memory is worse than my 86 year old grandfather‚Äôs at this point and she is only 63."," first, sorry for your loss. i hope you have the time and space you need right now.my mother has had several strokes resulting in minimal processing and short-term memory skills. her low skill levels in these areas are compounded by anxiety and depression/anger about them.i find that traumatic events trigger this kind of repetition moreso than day-to-day life. if there's a hurricane approaching, if a friend gets a cancer diagnosis, if the dog gets hurt... i get these calls in succession. it's almost like the magnitude of an event like this short circuits her brain and keeps her stuck in a loop.i offer this to say you might want to re-evaluate in a week before worrying that perhaps the decline is accelerating. she may need time to cope.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p478zi/mom_called_me_3_times_within_the_hour_to_tell_my/,Mom called me 3 times within the hour to tell my my grandmother died
"hi all,just a quick shoutout to what an incredible community and resource i have found this subreddit to be. i only wish i had found it sooner, but i'm glad to be here now. i know so many of us go through similar struggles, and it's just been incredible to see such a wholesome place where people feel comfortable sharing their experiences, their emotions, their struggles... asking for help, looking for resources, and seeking to educate themselves to better navigate such a challenging life event. you are all incredible and have created such a supportive space.my grandmother had steadily been declining for years, but her behaviors took a turn for the worst earlier this year. my grandpa, in failing health himself, could no longer care for her (she started hiding her meds/not taking them, turned into an escape artist, and thought family members were trying to poison her, became verbally abusive and semi-violent, or at least threatening violence). i saw her for what i felt was probably my last ""good"" visit back in january. it was the first time i saw the alzheimers at its worst, much more than the normal repetition of sentences/questions/stories. my uncles moved her into a memory care home, which was a whole ordeal in and of itself, but that's a story for another time.mainly i just came to ask for recommendations or suggestions on activities that i can do when i visit her in the memory care unit. i also am interested to hear if anyone has ideas about gifts that have resonated well with their family members?my grandma was an avid game player, so we brought yahtzee with us on our first visit (and she kicked our asses üòÇ). she did really well with this, we just had to keep her on task.are there any other games you've had success with? would love to hear about them.she also responded fairly well to us looking through old pictures together. my dad (vascular dementia, primary progressive aphasia) responded really well to this previously (his diagnosis and move into a caregiver's home came before hers) which is what gave me the inkling she might enjoy it as well. are there other things or activities that any of you have had success with? i always want to come prepared with a goodie bag because it just seems to make the visits a little easier, and in general it doesn't seem to get her worked up. i'm going up to see her again this sunday and thought i'd ask around for others experiences and ideas. especially anything more creative or out of the box. we are limited to some degree because she's not allowed to have some things due to her tendencies to still occasionally get violent.it sucks because she was never a violent or mean person. i see her lovely personality still shining through when we visit, and i think she feels my love and energy even though she no longer recognizes me. she doesn't even have that many belongings in her room because they're worried she will throw or break things or use them as weapons. or just flat out lose things because she takes them out of her room and leaves them places. it breaks my heart, and i try to bring her small gifts to make her more comfortable (socks, blankets, stuffed animals) because her room just feels so empty and clinical. i don't care if she loses any of the stuff i bring, i honestly expect it, i guess it just makes me feel like i'm doing what little i can for her.anyway, i'd love to hear from you all on what things you've done or gifts you've given that you felt your loved one enjoyed and responded well too.on the flip side, i'm all ears for what to avoid as well if anyone has had a negative experience.thanks in advance for taking time to read my post. i'm looking forward to hearing from you all!"," if there's an outside area where you can take them for walks, that's a good option.  listening to music together.  my dad enjoyed funny videos of kids and animals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p42e8e/activities_during_visits_with_my_grandma_alz_in/,Activities during visits with my grandma (Alz) in her memory care unit?
"i'm curious about the communities experience with discovering the signs of early onset dementia in their loved ones. what were the signs, how long did the process take to receive a diagnosis, what was that journey like, do you have any recommendations for a neurologist or neuropsychologist in new york city by any chance?for some context, my mother (62) has been out of work since june 2020. she exhausted her short-term disability and was terminated. i (24/f) think the jobs insurance is still trying to contact her doctors for a diagnosis. there is no diagnosis. she has seen a neuropsychologist who said she has cognitive decline but it's not on par with dementia so we just have to wait and see it get worse. i'm drowning because my mother has not maxed out her credit cards. she only received 1,000 a month for social security retirement and now i'm all of a sudden the sole breadwinner in the household. i live with my mother. i'm an only child with no family support system. i want to move out and live my own life and not have to take care of my mother. i'm just curious how long it's taken for other people to get a diagnosis because this journey to getting my mother one is insufferable. i need help."," mom has been in decline for years, i don't even remember exactly. perhaps 2016? maybe even earlier. ever since i have plead with my parents to go to the doctor. she's at the point where she's mumbling, staring in closets and looking all over for things but when asked she cannot tell you what she's looking for. she has no skills and no hobbies left.last christmas i broke down and told my parents that i didn't recognise her anymore and begged them to go get a diagnosis. she promised she would, finally. 2 weeks later i overheard a convo and she didn't want to go and that she thought she had not changed much.dad put his foot down (a first, he was an enabler all these years, the poor guy's in denial) and they went to the neurologist. well... doc wanted an mri, and my mom didn't. that's it. end of story. she'll never get diagnosed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p3s5v1/how_long_did_it_take_for_you_to_get_a_diagnosis/,How long did it take for you to get a diagnosis?

my mom got diagnosed with mild dementia today. she is  only 57. i am currently in another country. it is a shock and i have no idea what to do. should i go back and care for her? will she get better?," first, i'm sorry for such an early diagnosis and the shock to you both. on the flip side, you have time to educate yourselves and prepare for what's to come. and to hopefully get some of the harder conversations about long term care and end of life planning out of the way if she's in a good enough cognitive place for that. it is so critical for both of you, so that you can try to accommodate her wants/needs while balancing them with your own. it is only going to get more challenging from here on out, i don't say that to scare you, but it's a progressive disease. it works on its own timeline.as others have commented, no, it is unlikely she will get better. but that doesn't mean there aren't things you can do to try to slow the process! meds, cognitive activities, speech therapy, occupational therapy, socialization, etc. she might have good days and bad days - days where you feel hope and days where you feel frustrated and angry and sad. ultimately you will have to make the decision about whether to move back for yourself. but the reality is... caregiving is incredibly challenging, even moreso depending on what kind of behaviors your loved one is exhibiting and what you'll have to deal with. it takes a very special person to have the kind of composure to weather the ups and downs of it.i think to myself all the time that i wish i could just quit my job and care for my dad and grandma in my home. and then my logical brain kicks in and reminds me that's not feasible if i want to keep pursuing my own dreams and aspirations for my life. it sounds selfish, but it's not. i couldn't honestly care for them in the ways they need. and i think it's so much harder for family members as caregivers because of all the emotional strings attached.read through this subreddit to hear stories ranging from somewhat mild to quite intense. it will give you a window into the myriad of things you and your mom might encounter through this.don't jump/rush to any major decisions just yet. get as much of a read on the situation as you can. do you know what her struggles are? is she challenged by any activities of daily living? what ""symptoms"" was she having that ultimately led to see a doctor and end up with a diagnosis?the distance will certainly make it hard. i was 5 hrs away from my dad when he was diagnosed, and i worried myself sick over him while we tried to figure out our options and he continued to live alone. i can't imagine dealing with it all from another country, but that doesn't mean it isn't possible.as others have mentioned, you're not alone in your struggles. we're all here for you, and i hope what you hear from us brings you strength to do what you can for her but also what you need to do for you. i know it's scary and overwhelming, but it gets easier to deal with as you tackle the challenging parts. educate yourself as much as you can, start having the important conversations with her (if possible), and don't forget there's a whole bunch of amazing people in this sub who'll be here when you have questions or even just want to vent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p3oq6f/mom_got_diagnosed_with_mild_dementia/,[deleted by user]

"as the title says my dad and his sister decided to get my grandma into a home. my part of the family( dad‚Äôs side) were the primary caretakers. she was doing ok at home mostly could do a lot by herself living in her home, we coked for her and well cared when that was needed usually morning and evening helping with everyday things... the nights were quite hard tough she would wake up snd wander in her apartment lost and disoriented and it became quite difficult the last months because we all work, i usually visit at weekends but cause of corona my business was closed so i helped. i do get that they could not handle it anymore it is difficult and we knew it would come to this and searched quite s few homes to make sure she would get the best care possible. anyway she always knew who we or any relatives were. not even 2 weeks in they drudged her because she was up at night and other residents complained abbot her knocking and waking them up at night. totally understand that they want and deserve their peace but i do not think that the solution to this is a psychologist prescribing 2 drugs and well today‚Äôs she didn‚Äôt recognize us and was all depressed. they openly told us what they give her and if she would be moved to the dementia part of the facility( shes in a normal part in her own room with her own bathroom now) they would do the same.l because they like that there is peace at night.i‚Äôm totally angry at everyone but also there are no other homes that don‚Äôt take the same approach. they also don‚Äôt encourage her to walk snd push her in s wheelchair so she‚Äôll probably loos all her strength.. the only thing they do is bring her to daily activities but shes drudged from the night anyway so she has nothing from it.. i also should add that i and a caretaker at home once gave her a drug when she had a really bad day actually worked for her and didn‚Äôt made her all depressed and wore off till morning, but as usual one is listening to me.i don‚Äôt know what to do or to think, only that people are a‚Äôoles including my dad and his sister who agree with all of that. and sucks that we don‚Äôt have private facilities"," i empathize. the challenging thing about dementia and dementia care is that not only are there no perfect answers, often there aren't even any good answers. you have to balance out what is best for everyone involved including your family as care takers. and the horrible injustice of dementia makes all of us angry sometimes. &#x200b;it's a terrible disease. i'm so sorry you and your grandma and your family are caught up in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/p3db16/my_family_decided_to_get_my_grandma_into_a_home/,[deleted by user]

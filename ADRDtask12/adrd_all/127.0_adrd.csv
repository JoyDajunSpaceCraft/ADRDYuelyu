"i am posting for a family member who is caring for her 85 year old husband who has dementia.  he has medication he needs to take for seizures, that he has taken for many years.   as his memory issues worsened, he's become more angry and controlling.   today he's announced that seizure medications are dangerous and he shouldn't take them any more.  before, his wife thought the worst problem was him forgetting medications or taking a double dose.  this angry refusal from her once gentle husband has her stumped.   if anyone has any suggestions on getting needed medications into a dementia patient, it would be so welcome.", i know this sounds awful but i just lie. my grandad gives out about drinking water cos it makes him pee. recently he has noticed he is forget things or doing odd things.. i tell him it's because he hasn't drank water.  he thinks about it and then will agree. some times lying is the best way. tell him there vitamins or something you'd think he'd take. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8po0dv/how_do_you_get_someone_with_dementia_to_take/,How do you get someone with dementia to take their medication?

"this has been a tough day. the ladies at the nursing home put some of my fears to rest, and i know this needs to happen, but i'm still sick over the thought of my mother-in-law being picked up tomorrow and placed in the care of strangers.i hate what alzheimer's has done to my mother-in-law. i hate feeling like i've failed her somehow. i hate what it's done to my family. i hate what it's done to me. i hate that i actually broke down in front of a stranger as i was giving her my emergency contact information. i hate that she is going to be frightened when the medical workers come for her. i hate all of this, and i am so tired of hating it.this disease has stolen so much, and i just want it to stop."," you are absolutely right - this is a horrible, horrible disease.  it leaves no-one intact.i think a lot of us feel like we are failing as we struggle through it.  maybe it's because we are ""supposed to"" be able to nurse our loved ones back to health.  but there is no recovery.  this is the awful truth that is so hard to face, much less accept.  so, we feel like we are failing when the peope we are caring for get worse rather than better. if i may make a suggestion - if you are able to go to a support group or some other form of therapy, it might help.  take care of yourself and know that you are not alone.hugs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8pgr82/motherinlaw_goes_to_a_rest_home_tomorrow/,Mother-in-law goes to a rest home tomorrow...

"so this all started in late march. we only see this aunt a hand full of times a year being we live a few hours apart, so if things were progressing with her on a day to day level it's not something i would notice. she was seemingly normal at our wedding last year, at a picnic over last summer, and even up to this past christmas. she is about 65 years old. in late march we went down to his parents to surprise them with the news that we are expecting. his aunt \(and uncle\) were there and were elated at the news, as was everyone. the day was nice and we eventually parted ways.maybe a month or so later we found out the sex of the baby and told his parents over the phone since there is physical distance between where we live. his dad \(her brother\) calls to chat with aunt a few days after, and asked if my husband has called her yet and told her the news. she goes, ""oh, don't tell me they are pregnant!""...*wait*, **what?** she was there when we announced. his dad said, well...yeah...but didn't say anything further, and eventually ended the call. \(which frankly i don't understand, i would have been like...you were there...\) the other thing we learned from this call is that she abruptly retired from her job of 20ish years, after just 6 months ago saying she wasn't going to retire any time soon and wanted to work as long as possible. my husband calls her a few days after that and gets the machine, leaves a message and asks her to call him back. weeks go by, she doesn't. this is odd in itself because she adores him and always jumps at the chance to chat. eventually he calls her again and she answers. when she picks up he says it's him, and ""how's it going?"" in a very abrupt way she says ""everything is fine. why?"". he was just greeting her, i found this extremely odd and almost defensive. he eventually tells her the gender of the baby, and that we are naming her after his grandmother, her mother. that made her extremely happy. she insinuated to him that his father had told her we were expecting \(?!!?\). i'm not sure if it's something with the men in this family but again he didn't say anything. she did mention she had been to the doctor and had an mri but that everything came back normal. they talked for a while about other things and everything seemed fine.now my husband's mother called yesterday and told me that she called said aunt and asked her how she felt about the babies name. the aunt said, ""what was the name again?"".???????????so i guess at this point we can see something is very wrong. these aren't just little things. i'm not sure if she is on medication, or what her stress level is. she has been to the doctor, but i don't know how truthful she would be if something were wrong, she is a sweet lady but it seems like it's a pride thing.personally, my side of the family is very close, and at the first instant of someone forgetting i was having a child i would have been asking them what was going on and making sure they made it to a doctor to get checked out. it blows my mind that everyone in their family is essentially just ignoring it...but also don't feel like it's my place to do or say something. it's just not sitting well with me and i don't know what to do. his uncle lives with her and has to realize something is up. you would think if she mentioned to him that her brother told her we were pregnant he would be like...uhh yeah they told us in march at the last dinner. yet nobody says anything to anybody."," who is closest to the aunt (physically and emotionally)?  is she seen by a primary care physician?one i resisted, but glad i took was a neuropsychological test. oh, my it lasted a full eight hours, and after they decided to have me come back for another day.  in my case, to you you hear me on the phone. to me i hear the person on the phone, the computer fan, the microwave fan, the ac noise, the tv next door, the birds chirping. every little noise causes a distraction to the point i can not really process what you are saying. you told me you're pregnant, but 10 minutes later i have forgotten! oh my, my.i do fine with written email (hint i can go back and re-read it on good days to try my best to remember). the comment ""she has had an mri, and it was fine"" sounds like she has been seen by a neurologist for her memory issues. it may be her brother has been taking her, but otherwise protective of his sister and not sharing details.mood changes, personality changes, and being agitated along with forgetting things could mean alzheimers / dementia.  hopefully, she is working with her medical team to see if there is medication to help.

"my grandmother (84) recently suffered a stroke, luckily it was not that bad. she has been left with some deficits regarding her balance and movements.since the stroke she has been living with my aunt, normally she lives alone. mows her own lawn, drives her own car and takes care of her brother who has a very bad case of ms and cannot leave his house. prior to the stroke she was extremely independent.  she moved in with my aunt for post stroke recovery about 7 months ago. in that time, she has been more easily accessible to the entire family, so there are things that we are all noticing such as short term memory loss etc. she is under the impression that she has suffered no deficits from the stroke and is itching to get behind the wheel of her car and ""go home"". however it is very clear that is not possible to everyone other than her. we are in the process of requesting that her doctors send away to the mva to ask that she be retested, we do not what to allow her to drive until then, and we are certain that she will not pass. but in the mean time, are there any books to help people ""deal with"" their parents entering this stage of life? she is getting more angry by the day but we cannot in good conscience let her go back to being independent, not only for her own safety but for the safety of everyone else on the road.*tl;dr - looking for self help type books the assist with people/families transitioning into early dementia and alzheimer's. no diagnosis yet. maybe a book to help someone come to terms with being checked for it? tia!", ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8omoad/helpbooks_for_early_dementiaalzheimers/,[help]Books for early dementia/Alzheimer's?

"hello, i am concerned because i have been catching myself having irrational thoughts recently.  i am 26 years old, but i have had a handful of unrelated concussions in my life.  i had one just recently a week ago, but this is a problem i have been noticing for some time.as an example, just happened today:  i work on a big property.  i was planning on driving over to a storeroom.  i went to borrow my coworker's keys, but he was just about to run an errand of his own.  no problem, i thought, i will just bike over instead.  it took me a minute, on my way out, to realize that biking or driving over had nothing to do with the problem at hand:  he had the keys to the storeroom.  i am not sure why i thought biking vs driving would make a difference.i am scared, this is not the first time this has happened, every few weeks i will catch myself in some similar situation.  i have always been mildly forgetful, but over the last few months this has happened a handful of times.  i am not looking for specific medical advice, just a general opinion:  is this abnormal enough that something may be wrong?  i suspect that these kinds of brain farts do not happen to most people very often.  i have read up on the effects mild traumatic brain injury can have on long term brain health, so i am curious if i am experiencing early dementia symptoms.thanks for reading."," definitely seek medical advice if you are truly concerned. but don't let your mind jump to the worst possible scenario. concussions or not, a certain amount of illogical thought and forgetfulness is normal. it happens to me far too often.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8ojtbs/catching_myself_in_nonsensical_thought_processes/,Catching myself in nonsensical thought processes.
"my mother’s mental condition spiraled out of control over the past year. my two sisters and i are her only family nearby. with the help of a local policeman we were able to convince her to check into the hospital. after being there for a week to restore her fluids and nutrition and visit with the psychiatrist she was relocated to a geriatric psychiatric hospital. shortly thereafter she was diagnosed with dementia psychosis. she has been in the facility since early april receiving treatment. my sisters and i in the meantime are searching for an assisted living facility. while cleaning out her condo my sister uncovered a summons to appear in court - petty larceny. apparently she attempted to steal something from a local gas station. we’re not sure of the details since she can’t remember. the doctor she’s currently receiving treatment from wrote two letters to the court requesting they dismiss the case. the court refused, and has just postponed the date until july 2018. my sisters have requested i write a letter to the court requesting they dismiss the case. has anyone gone through this experience before, and if so, what should i highlight in my appeal?i simply can’t imagine dragging my sick mother to court. she is newly medicated, disoriented and anxious. this attempted theft is completely out of character for her, and we all want to protect her from the stress of moving her around at this time of transition.", i am surprised and concerned that the doctor's letters weren't enough for the judge. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8oae0g/court_date_for_mom_recently_diagnosed_with/,Court date for mom recently diagnosed with dementia
"i wanted to thank each and every one of you who responded to my post.  your experiences and kind words really helped.(previous post: my dad has a high pressure job.  he had gone out of town on a planned work trip a few days after mom's diagnosis/i posted on here... i offered to check in on mom while he was gone.  i went over daily to check in, then she called 3 days into the trip, saying that she was having a stroke.   i rushed over after she said she didn't want an ambulance... 6 hours waiting at the er later, she wasn't having a stroke, i have no idea why she thought she was.  she obviously could not be home alone. she had refused to come stay with my husband and i (when my dad has a business trip) previously, but she listens to my husband for some reason.  i think he's always been kind/never gave her any ""expectations""/pressure when she was having memory issues.  my dad and i have an established dynamic with her that lingers in her mind, but my husband does not.  so he got her to stay with us for 5 days.she had not bathed in a while, and my dad was having trouble getting her to before he left.  (not bathing is a new development, and this is all new to us)  she sounds ""normal"" sometimes, yet isn't bathing... it's so baffling.  my husband decided to draw her a bath with eucalyptus epsom salts.  he told her he drew a bath for her, and she went for it!  i then stealthily took her clothes- that desperately needed to be washed- and washed them secretly while she was watching tv.  she is dressing inappropriately, wearing clothes and shoes that are too dressy and meant for colder seasons.  so i'll have to weed through her wardrobe, my dad needs help.  here's what i'm learning-   the most important thing is keeping her happy.  if she is searching for an ""answer,"" i take all the pressure off by answering for her or making a suggestion.  she says the same thing over and over?  i agree with her... over and over.  i also think that it's ok to laugh about this sometimes.  because it's sure better than despair.    i am pregnant with my first child.  my mom was an amazing grandma to my nieces and nephews.  i hate this disease for robbing my child of such a wonderful grandma.  but i know that my mom not calling to check in on me is not her fault.  it's time to accept that the mom that i knew is gone, and let's make the best of this.  i hope that the upcoming baby is a distraction for me and my father, adding some joy to this crappy situation.my dad needs to travel for work sometimes, and he needs to keep his financial security now more than ever with the cost of care.  my mom had a wonderful time with me, and it was great to not have to worry about her/allow my dad to take a business trip.  the comments from my last post helped me make her stay here a success.  we have now established that my house=fun for mom, so she can stay here in the future.thanks for your advice on my previous post."," just take it one day at a time and cherish the periods of clarity.  my mom also has dementia.  could sit around all day worrying about what's coming as it progresses, but that robs today with tomorrow.  her long term memory is still okay right now, so i try to keep the conversations about the ""old days"".  when i talk about normal stuff like what she had for dinner that's where the frustration starts for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8nvobn/update_and_thank_you_mom_diagnosed_questions/,"UPDATE, and THANK YOU (""Mom diagnosed- Questions"")"

"ever since my grandmother (paternal) developed dementia, i've been hyper-aware of my parent's behaviors. i'm only 21 and they're in their early-mid sixties because they had me in their early forties. although my dad is the one who's more at risk on paper, as his father died (supposedly) in the early stages of dementia and my grandmother has it quite badly now, he's doing everything he can to mitigate his risk - taking tons of different supplements, exercise, diet, religiously monitoring his blood sugar, blood pressure, etc. (he has a phd in a scientific field). my mom is just as educated as he is and works in the health field, yet i worry more about her even though she doesn't have a strong family history of dementia that we know of (i believe she had one uncle who had dementia, her father died of a stroke but still had a sharp mind, and though some family members think her mother was beginning to develop dementia before she died, others assert that it was simply her eccentric personality and normal aging). my mom takes the supplements my dad tells her to in a kind of lackluster way (but doesn't take nearly as many as he does). she doesn't religiously monitor her vitals and doesn't seem to be too concerned about blood results that are off, unless something is *really* off. the most concerning thing though is that she refuses to talk about anything dementia related. just the other day when i was talking to my dad about lowering your risk, she said that it's ""disturbing"" to see us blame people for getting dementia. when i told her there's no blame but you can lower your risk, she got up and left annoyed. my mom doesn't like to talk about these difficult topics. she's a great mom but does have a habit of shutting down in the face of these sorts of things because she takes a ""it's out of my hands"" attitude. it's frustrating because it's *not"" out of her hands. there are things that can be done to lower her risk. she has several protective factors on her side - the fact that she's highly educated, likes brain stimulating activities like reading and puzzles, is bilingual, and has a healthy diet. there are bad risk factors too though - namely the fact that she has type 2 diabetes due to her weight, likely due to an antidepressant she's been taking for many years that is known to cause serious weight problems. after a ton of needling, she's finally going to try something more modern. she also has some autoimmune issues that are borderline, just like me. i know i'm probably overreacting, but over the last six months or so i've been focusing so much on my mom and her behavior, getting worried anytime i see any hint of cognitive decline. she seems to be a little more forgetful lately - leaving her phone at home when she goes to work and coming back ten minutes after leaving to grab it. leaving something at home that she needs when we go out. taking something with her that she was supposed to leave at home (like a form my dad still needs to sign). forgetting the details of a conversation we had the other day (she's always been very distracted, but i feel like it's gotten worse lately... maybe i'm reading into it too much though). i'll be talking to her in a room with just the two of us and she won't pay attention unless i say ""mom"" loudly, because she doesn't know i'm talking to her (she says ""you could be on the phone""). in general she's just *very* distracted - like i said, she's always been this way to a degree, but i have a feeling things might have gotten worse. she also seems to be more temperamental and stubborn as of late. she's always been easily agitated, but i feel like that's also gotten worse.   maybe i am just overreacting. i don't think she's gotten any complaints from her work, and she works in a higher position managing a team of people. i know she's been stressed ever since most of her staff was laid off post-trump. and i know a lot of this could simply be normal aging plus me being more sensitive. i can't get these worries out of my head though because i feel like she doesn't take dementia as seriously as she needs to. there's a dementia crisis upon us with aging baby boomers, and i think everyone over the age of 65 should be doing everything in their power to lower their risk. the fact that she won't even have frank conversations with her children about this sort of thing doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in me. i really get the feeling that she'd be the kind of person to hide any cognitive decline that she noticed until things were too late. does it sound like i need to worry yet? how do i know what's normal and what isn't? do you believe there are serious interventions that can be done to lower your risk? did your family members with dementia have untreated risk factors, and if so what were they? again, i know i may be overreacting, but watching my grandmothers decline has probably been the most disturbing thing i've ever witnessed. it's traumatized my father. just thinking about how i could be in his shoes one day makes me feel extremely depressed and afraid."," i'm 22 and i get where you're coming from. my dad's dad was diagnosed with dementia almost a year ago. it's such a terrible, terrible disease and he used to live with us but now is in assisted living. it never gets easier. since he was diagnosed, i can tell my dad is scared that the same thing will happen to him. i start to get panicky when i see my dad start fixating on things, like only watching the office every night. but then again, idk if i'm just hyper-aware because i'm scared. he's highly educated, but so was his dad. i just keep reminding myself that his dad was alive in a different time and lived a completely different life. but biology is biology. he's still really active, so i think i'm just overanalyzing things. my mom tends to forget things sort of regularly. she's sort of the ""momager"" of the family and takes care of all the grandparents, works, and has me and my brother. she has a lot on her plate and is really health-conscious so she started going to a neurologist a few years ago when she thought that her memory was problematic. the neurologist did scans, and concluded that she's being a hypochondriac. her forgetfulness is related to her stress. it's really easy to be hyperaware and assume the worst, especially when you see a loved one suffer with dementia. we've had a couple in my family suffer from it, and i've seen the next generation have to care for them. i'm not going to lie, i am fearful of having to do that one day. for now, my parents are still my parents. i think i overreact, probably like you, because we're just in overprotective mode. no matter what, we just need to enjoy all of our time with them now. i think that's the biggest thing i've learned after watching family members with dementia. if you need to vent or anything feel free to pm me!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8n0k4x/im_so_scared_my_mom_will_get_dementia/,I'm so scared my mom will get dementia
"context: my grandma is 90 and since a surgery last july has been in a rapid alzheimer’s decline. she also has a significant blockage in a main artery in her brain so has had a few tias since then as well. i was dealing with it with humor at first because she still knew who i was and had her spunk. when asked at the hospital if she knew who the president was she responded with, “yeah, that man nobody likes.”  another time she offered me $50 to cut her tubes and break her out of the hospital.  next, she started forgetting who i was. sadness came, but still used a bit of humor to deal with it. i greeted her last thanksgiving i sat down next to her. a few minutes later she turned to me and said, “who are you? i assume i’m your grandma because you called me grandma, but honestly, i don’t know who you are.” i was stunned more than anything because that was the first time she hadn’t remembered me.there’s been a few incidents since then. once she swore i was the actress who plays kate on this is us after seeing her on the cover of people magazine she saw at my aunts. just went with it. this last weekend though broke me more than before. maybe it was just seeing how rapidly she’s declining. she’s gone to needing 24/7 assistance and doesn’t even recognize her own house. she has to be reminded to use the bathroom, she’s not talking as much, and i just don’t know how to continue connecting with her. i just got with her flow. my grandma is the matriarch in this big mexican family. she’s the one who taught me my strength, work ethic, how to cook, and even how to cuss. definitely inherited my stubbornness and ability to murder you with words from her. so it’s hard, i mean hard to see her like this. thankfully , my family is super close, but we are all dealing with it very differently. we were all fighting at first but agreed to a stalemate since this shit is hard enough on it’s own. adding our own bickering and judgement towards each other, warranted or not, doesn’t help. but today i was driving back to my city after a visit and got angry. like rage angry that i’ve maybe felt once in my life. i didn’t even feel that when my dad passed away, but i am closer to my grandma. but i mean i’m just so fucking angry at this awful, horrible disease. i know she’s 90 and i can say “this is a lesson that all time is important” but right now i just want to flip alzheimer’s the middle finger and punch it in the face for stealing the last years i could’ve had with my grandma.  not really sure why i decided to post. partly to vent and partly for support. like i said, my family is all dealing differently and i don’t have anyone who’s gone through this to confide in. it’s making me feel like i’m mourning already. like that feeling of grief you get when you’re mourning and you’re not sure if you’re going crazy because you go from sad to angry to sad to grateful to denial to anger again.  tl:dr fuck alzheimer’s for stealing the last years with my grandma. i’m a hot mess over it.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8mrfcj/xpost_from_ralzheimers_finally_accepted/,(X-Post from r/Alzheimers) Finally accepted Alzheimer’s has taken my grandma and it SUCKS
"it's a mixed bag of emotions caring 24/7 for a parent with dementia. last week was such a good week. my mother started physical therapy and she was doing really well after falling 3 times in one week last month. unfortunately we started this week off with another fall yesterday and today started with a massive diarrhea disaster, which are common but not usually this gross.i haven't slept through an entire night in weeks. i'm so drained of energy, patience and love, that it's having a negative affect on everything else that i can't even think straight.it's 8:30am on monday and i'm already drained of all my energy and good intensions. i washed and changed my mom and just put her back in bed. i can't keep up with her anymore. we had such a good week last week and now all i can think about now is how awful the reality of the situation is. i suffer from my own depression and health issues and just one bad episode with my mom completely devastates me for days, but there's no one else that's willing to help, so when i need a day to myself, it usually involves me just ignoring my mother for the day, (minus meds and meals)… and i end up feeling worse than i did before because of guilt. my guilt is killing me. my mother's condition is killing me. caring for her alone for 24/7 for 5 years is killing me. my families lack of empathy is killing me. i just want to be a good son and do the right thing for my mom but when we have bad days like today and yesterday, i just want to curl up and die.i feel like the good times are meaningless at this point.sorry i just needed to vent, thanks for listening :)"," it sounds like it might be time to consider placing her in a memory care facility... she would not want you to make yourself sick caring for her, i'm sure.

"thank you for reading. i just read through the top posts in the sub and i just want to let you all know how sorry i am that your are going through this. many of you seem to be caretakers of a loved one. i'm 28 years old, i live with my husband and friend/roommate. my grandfather, who lives in the city about an hour away from me, was just diagnosed with dementia. we've had suspicions for a while, so i guess it's somewhat of a relief to know. his living situation is toxic. he lives with his wife/my grandmother but they have been horrible to each other their whole marriage (mexican, very catholic don't believe in divorce). my grandmother is more active and she's younger than him, but she still instigates fights with him everyday and he's scared of her. my aunt, their daughter, lives with them and is there to support and care for my grandpa. our plan is to have them sell the house and my aunt and grandma will find a house and i want my grandpa to come live with my husband and i. our roommate is planning to move out in january but i'm wondering how fast his dementia could progress. should i rush my roommate to move out earlier so that my grandpa could move in sooner and take her room? the house belongs to my husband's parents and her plan from the start has been to move out after she saves enough money, so this isn't news to her. what should i expect when he moves in? our house is great for him, one story, easy access shower, etc. i work monday through friday six hours a day. should i quit my job to care for him or does that come when he is completely unable to care for himself? i just don't know what to do. or expect. im pretty terrified of what's to come."," i'd get in touch with the professionals that dx'ed your grandfather with dementia and ask them what they suggest, and ask them what resources they can put you in touch with. if he's in a hospital right now they probably won't release him without arranging social services/outpatient care. listen to what they say and take it to heart, if they say he needs 24/7 care then no moving him to your home where you are gone six hours a day isn't going to work. if they say he is okay without 24/7 care but would be better in familiar surroundings then no moving him from his familiar home isn't going to work.ask what his prognosis is and what you can expect. my mil went pretty rapidly from okay in familiar surroundings on her own, to 6 second memory and needing 24/7 care. we tried having her at home but 4 adults couldn't handle her. she needed a lockdown memory care unit. we only regret not admitting that to ourselves sooner. she did better in lockdown memory care unit than at home.i get that you are terrified and it is terrifying. the good news is that there are people who are experts in this, you just need to reach out and ask for help and resources. from the people that are treating your grandpa right now, the ones who've made the diagnosis. my fil was pretty horrible to my mil too...... in retrospect, a lot of it was because mil was showing signs of dementia way earlier than the professionals and everyone else figured it out. in retrospect, we have a lot of compassion for what fil was going through. he was protecting us all, dealing with a frustrating situation all around.

"i've been playing in this dementia locked ward for a bit more than a year, and one patient has grown completely intolerant of other patients singing or moving with the music. as you can probably guess, one of the primary benefits of bringing them live piano music (from their era--songs many of them know by heart) is to encourage them to sing and dance. she has declined a good bit in the last 14 months, and is not very verbal to strangers now (she used to tell me every visit that she survived the holocaust), now using a walker, and no longer tries to move her hands in rhythm to the music. she always was grumpy at the man who vocalises instead of singing lyrics (like my former church choir soprano who can still hit high e's and f's on good days). she is now yelling at the soprano too. i used to be able to calm her by praising the efforts of the singers, but that is no longer working. i'm close to asking for this lady to be taken to another activity during piano hour, but i know she loves the music (watching her sprint down the hallway behind her walker when she hears 'the piano lady is here' is both heartwarming and -breaking). i would welcome hearing your thoughts. thanks for reading."," first, thanks for bringing music to those folks! if there isn't a staff member who can sit with her and redirect her attention away from other residents and back to you, maybe try having her sit up front. with other residents behind her and you and the piano right in front of her, she might be less distracted by others. does the facility have any instruments? i've had great success with little shaker eggs - we bought ours, but the could also be made by placing uncooked rice in plastic easter eggs and sealing with duct tape. its good for keeping time, easy to hold, but not so loud that it would irritate sensitive ears. good luck and keep being awesome!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8kgt24/need_help_with_intolerant_dementia_patient_in/,Need help with intolerant dementia patient in group home during piano hour.

(she was a nurse before, maybe she knew something was wrong and was in denial, but now is so far gone that the denial has wafted away to apathy?)she scored 11/30 on the test, ""severe.""   she's now on aricept.  woah.  they don't know the specific dementia, she's going to get more tests.   my siblings think if she had gotten help sooner things would be better, but you can't force someone (who was not a danger to themselves or others) to get help when they refuse, right?  i think we should stop the blame game and come together. questions:-my dad saw that nursing home care is 100k a year.  holy smokes.  is that always necessary, or can you ever get away with in-home care?  i feel for him, her diagnosis is obviously so hard on him, and now the prospect of those insane costs to give her the best care possible.  -bathing:  mom hasn't bathed recently.  my dad told her she should take a bath, she gave pushback.  then she lied and said she took a bath.  anyone else gone through that?  she's not quite at a place to get a nurse in, but we aren't sure what to do about the bathing.  he can get her to change clothes by saying that he's dong the laundry, but she needs to be bathing!"," big hugs to you. went through this with my mil (early onset - passed this year at age 77), going through it now with my dad (age 78). how old is your mom?  my dad didn't do that bad on the test -- he's not severe. they put him on aricept and it's made a noticeable difference, he's stabilized and improved a bit, so there is that. > my siblings think if she had gotten help sooner things would be better, but you can't force someone (who was not a danger to themselves or others) to get help when they refuse, right? you are right. it's such a balancing act. in reality it was my parents seeing what we were going through with my mil that brought them around to getting my dad in for tests. better to know what you're dealing with, there are treatments now, and planning needs to be done. it's scary for them, take your own fear and magnify it by 1000. > my dad saw that nursing home care is 100k a year. holy smokes.here's an in for you: encourage your dad to go to a financial planner who specializes in elder care. that 100k isn't so bad with estate planning in advance, where you spend down so medicare kicks in. it's only going to be 100k if your dad lets his fear and denial prevent him from seeing an elder care financial expert to make prudent decisions -- to protect him and not just your mom. > is that always necessary, or can you ever get away with in-home care?you can for awhile. then there comes a time when you just can't anymore. with mil first fil was taking care of her, he pushed all of us away insisting he could handle it, didn't want any help, well... he wore himself into the ground because mil needed 24 round the clock care, which we didn't realize even though we saw them at least once a week. there were hints. i started to suspect he was keeping her locked up in a room (which later i realized why... ). he wore himself into the ground so hard caring for her, he ended up passing before her. when fil was hospitalized we hired in-home care for mil, round the clock... only to find that they were not reliable and would leave a half hour early or whatever before next shift. in which time mil would wander, shit herself, swallow pills.... so... we thought we could do better. and we brought her into our home. four adults (me hubby two adult children) couldn't manage her-- we had to sleep in shifts but it was so hard. that was a truly eye opening experience, and i began to understand why fil may have locked her in a room -- for her own safety.you may be awhile away from that point, and that's the line you have to walk. it is best to keep her in her own home as long as possible (familiar space). we are aiming for that for my dad right now. there comes a time when it's unmanageable. for anyone. and you have to watch your dad so he's not wearing his own health down. > bathing: mom hasn't bathed recently. my dad told her she should take a bath, she gave pushback. then she lied and said she took a bath. anyone else gone through that?yeponce we got mil into long term memory care things greatly improved. they are professionals. they know what they are doing. they could get her to bathe, change her clothes, all that. it was like a miracle, but this is what they all do for a living!! seriously bless all dementia care aides who specialize in this, are good at it, and make it their life work. mil lived several very healthy and happy as possible years, with a 6 second memory. they took great care of her. this year she suddenly lost her ability to walk... got rushed to er... dx'ed with mets all over including her brain. passed a few short weeks later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8jmjqx/mom_diagnosed_questions/,Mom diagnosed- Questions
"hi there.i've wanted to post on here for a while, but did not want it to be real.  since about 2011, i've noticed a change in my mom.  she slowly became less active, more withdrawn.  she used to be an avid gardener, it's now been 3 years since she pulled a weed.over the past few years, her memory has been declining.  and the personality changes- my loving mother barely called me to check in when my husband was in chemo in 2016.  (he's fine now!)  she doesn't call her grandkids.  she forgets birthdays.  my dad, a busy workaholic, now has to do all the cooking and cleaning, everything.  it's like each month, she stops doing another thing.  he has tried to get her help, she would not accept it or admit that she has memory issues/has changed.  she has been getting worse.  2 weeks ago she tried to pay a bill with a deposit slip, and she is now not bathing.  a new doctor recently gave her the mmse test- she scored an 11/30.  that hit us hard.  she is now on aricept.  (awaiting more tests to determine which specific dementia this is)my mom was a charge nurse in geriatrics.  she was a phenom.  she cared for people with dementia lovingly. my siblings live far away.  they blame my dad for not forcing her to get help.  i try to explain that you can't force someone who was not a danger to themselves to get help.  the only reason that she is accepting help now is that she doesn't understand what she is getting help for.  i love my sibs, but they are making it hard by blaming the person affected by this the most.  my dad recently discovered that nursing home care can cost 100k/year.  wow.  is it possible to do in-home care instead?  i guess not, or people would just do that.  man this sucks.  i feel for my dad, and my mom.  and i'm having my first kid, and a woman who was an amazing grandma to my sibs' kids won't even be able to babysit by herself.  any ideas on how to get her to bathe?  my dad tried to have her take a bath and she gave him pushback, then lied and said that she did take a bath.  we are new at this, not sure what to do.  hoping my dad can find some local experts to help us through this. sending love and support to all who deal with this.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8jmbrn/mom_diagnosed_wow_this_is_a_lot/,"Mom diagnosed, wow this is a lot"

"hi, i'm not sure if this is the place to ask this but i'm wondering if anyone has had to deal with someone hallucinating a phone call.my dad is getting dementia but he won't except it (pretty common i'm sure). my mom and i are worried that some of his phone calls are not really happening. these phone calls are also about important stuff like, possibly working for an employer that broke the law etc, and little stuff like talking to his brother who he never talks to. neither of us ever hear the phone ring and today when confronted about it he swore that he deleted the call because he deletes all his calls.so the reason i'm posting this is to learn if this is even possible. i've read about hallucinating people or animals and situations but nothing about phone calls. has anyone heard of this? is this actually a thing? and if so how did you even begin to deal with it?", sounds like lewy body dementia,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8j95c1/question_about_hallucinations/,question about hallucinations
," my mom was diagnosed in march with ftd at the age of 61. the signs and symptoms rapidly showed up last summer and we thought it could be early onset alzheimer's at first but it wasn't quite the same as what we experienced with my grandfather who passed away over 10 years ago. she's still active and playing on her tennis team and such but we have had to tell most of her friends so they know why she struggles with communication. her main symptom is aphasia right now. i also sense apathy when talking to her. she's not the same overly concerned and empathetic mother she always was to me, but she still expresses some emotions. when our son was born last year something just seemed ""off"" about how she reacted to everything and those were some of the first signs to me. it's hard not knowing where things will go from here. my dad and sister have seemingly taken it harder than i have but we all deal with our emotions differently. having a 1 year old son helps keep me occupied but there are days i wish i could just cry in bed thinking about the past and the ""what if's"" in the future but i try to stay strong for my own family.

"my story:&amp;nbsp;i've worked with individuals with dementia and their families and friends for almost 10 years now. it was natural for me to enter in this industry after the loss of my grandmother. she didn't have alzheimer's, but she didn't remember me the last time i saw her. she had vascular dementia (dementia induced by strokes), and i had no idea how to interact with someone i cared about so much who no longer could remember my existence. i was 25 years old. 25 years gone. i didn't know about dementia at the time - heard of it, but had never seen it up close and personal. it seemed embarrassing at the time, or we just laughed as a family.. because although she didn't know me or others, she still had her same smart mouthed and playful personality she always had. she was funny, loved, and i miss her so much. but i was grossly naive the last time i saw her, and didn't know how to respond to this situation. &amp;nbsp;thus launched my career in taking care of others specially with dementia. it came so naturally, so quickly. what i lacked in knowledge, at the time, about dementia and the gross impact it has on the brain and body, i made up for in compassion and my drive to help others. the training came over the years and accelerated my ambition to help individuals impacted by a disease that robs families of cherished moments, relationships, and memories. &amp;nbsp;compassion, validation, emotional support, and person-centered care are so vital to taking care of anyone impacted by alzheimer's/dementia. it came so naturally to support families and to enhance the quality of life for their loved ones... make them laugh, sing, dance, exercise, grab ice cream, create, reminisce, throw parties, go out to lunch, and ultimately provide purpose, companionship, and comfort. in hindsight, i like to think my grandma has been there all along showing me the way.  inspiring that compassion and understanding - something i wasn't cognizant of seeing her for the last time. &amp;nbsp;so i worked and worked and worked, sometimes feeling compassion fatigue myself in a field that is always going, never ending, filled with an entire spectrum of emotions, complicated family dynamics, misplaced anger, and a lot of loss. so much loss. as a professional, i can't count the times i've seen a life taken due to complications of alzheimer's or dementia. if i estimate 12 losses per year of someone i've personally seen (this is probably a low number) and multiple it by the years worked (9) - that's about 108 people.  this number is too low. those are just the lives i would have personally seen lost - whereas there are so many more individuals i worked with that may have passed over the years when i wasn't present any longer. add in all the families and friends to those lives lost and the number is tremendous. and this only represents a small sample based on my experience. in fact, it's estimated that 5.7 million americans of all ages are living with alzheimer's and alzheimer's disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the united states, and is the only top 10 cause of death that cannot be prevented, cured, or even slowed. &amp;nbsp;i came to this subreddit today to talk about my personal story and to share my fundraising efforts for alzheimer's and brain awareness month - but aside from that - i know there are so many unheard stories in this world of individuals impacted by this terrible disease - the statistics are there. i hope this can or could inspire you to share your story either on my page, on this subreddit, or even on the abam website. &amp;nbsp;links:&amp;nbsp;june is alzheimer's &amp; brain awareness month: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;fight alz - my fundraiser to help combat alz in honor of my grandma and all those i've had the honor of working with that have had their lives personally impacted by alzheimer's or related dementia. &amp;nbsp;*been a lurker for a long time - created a reddit account for this cause*",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8iwl9q/i_know_you_have_a_story_to_share/,I know you have a story to share
"my mom was diagnosed with alzheimers &amp; dementia about 2 years ago, and my sister moved her into a memory care nursing home in the city she lived in (seattle), and was her power of attorney. she setup a trust from the sale of mom's property, and things appeared to be well organized.i was not very involved, because i've been living and working in thailand. my sister kept me informed of how things were arranged, and made me the backup trustee on mom's financial affairs. but i have not lived in the us for 3 years, and i'm now married in thailand. i return to the us about once a year to visit.my sister then passed away, leaving my mom with no close family in seattle, other than a half brother, who is now the durable power of attorney. my sister made him the backup poa since he lived in seattle. however, i don't think he really wants to be that involved, he was just trying to help. nobody really thought my sister would pass away. he offered to transfer poa to me, but we discovered it is too late, since mom isn't competent enough to sign new poa documents.so, i believe i need to find somebody to become mom's guardian. i can't move back to the us, because i don't meet the current financial requirement to sponsor my wife to come with me, and my life now is in thailand. i run a small esl school here, and don't want to live in the us.i've considered moving mom here, and there are nursing homes here that cater to westerners, but i think the trauma of a move like that for her, might do more harm than good. such a move would also cut her off from qualification for medicaid and medicare, which i think could be a mistake if she were to become severely ill.the only other option i really see is to find a person to take on guardianship, but i'm really unsure where to start with this. i have consulted with an elder care attorney, but they are charging massive amounts of $ just to talk about this with me, and so i'm trying to get some second opinions. i'm concerned the attorney might try to steer me towards a very expensive guardianship process, and not fully explain what other guardianship options exists.mom's trust has money to cover this, and her nursing home costs, probably for at least 8 more years, unless a guardian begins to charge extremely high fees.any suggestions where i should go to get more information on my options? i want to get information from sources other than just attorneys. thank you", also check with your mothers area council on aging.  they may be able to provide additional information and resources.  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8ipzaw/finding_a_3rd_party_to_act_as_a_guardian_for_mom/,"Finding a 3rd party to act as a Guardian for mom... where to start? ...and what do Guardians normally charge?

"my grandmother has dementia (my dad's mom - i live at home while attending college). she lives in a retirement home in our city. at this point, she's very much ""out of it"" - it's very difficult, if not impossible, to hold a conversation with her, as her communication is severely limited (a lesion was recently found on the speech center in her brain, although we don't know how old it is). she has memory issues as well and seems to be confused chronologically. no one really knows just how much she's aware of. a speech therapist came recently to work with her, and my grandmother struggled with very basic questions (things like ""how many children do you have""). pretty much the only time she shows emotion nowadays is when she a) cries at random, or b) begs my dad not to ""take her back to that place"" when he's bringing her back to the retirement community after a doctors appointment. she obviously doesn't want to be there and we feel as if she's depressed. it makes me feel awful thinking about what her quality of life is - she essentially sits on her couch all day long until someone comes to take her to her meals or give her medication and other care. she was previously diagnosed with lewy body dementia and takes antipsychotics to control delusions. before moving to the retirement community, her communication skills were still quite good, but she had issues with persecutory delusions and some smaller lapses of confusion. is there anything that can be done for depressed patients like her? even if it's some novel drug treatment that will help her feel better (even if the happiness - or at least sedatedness - is ""fake""). everyone in my household is very busy. though a big part of why we don't visit her too often is because of our hectic schedules, it's also because seeing her is so difficult. in addition to her very diminished communication skills (sometimes spending time with her feels like hanging around a brick wall), what further complicates the situation is past baggage. my grandmother was very narcissistic when she was younger, and while she didn't alienate her family completely, there was definitely bad blood between her and all of her children. her daughters in law also have a lot of bad blood with her - it's hard not to, because she could be very nasty before the dementia set in. she was not an easy or pleasant woman to be around and refused many of the measures that were taken to try and help her before her decline (didn't want to take her pills, didn't want to exercise and would skip her classes, didn't want to be social or reach out to the friendly people in her facility, etc. - and it's a *very* nice facility). as such, her other two children - my aunt and uncle - have essentially abandoned the situation. they don't come and visit her ever, and have placed the burden of her care on my father, because he's always been her ""favorite"" son (he's the oldest). does this situation resonate with anyone here? i want to visit her more often, but being around her aggravates my own depression greatly and puts me in a very morbid mood. both of my parents are older, so thinking about how this could happen to them makes me feel sick to my stomach. being around someone who's quality of life is so poor, particularly when we weren't very bonded to begin with, is also hard - i feel like i'm too weak to deal with this. i also get the feeling that everyone is just waiting for her to die, because she doesn't seem to enjoy life anymore. i've tried talking to my parents about possibly trying to find a therapist/counselor who works with dementia patients, even if it's only for the social interaction, but they aren't sure if it would help because of her memory and communication issues. i wish there was some antidepressant or other drug she could take to improve her mood, but i don't know if that would help either, especially since she's already taking such strong psychiatric medication.advice?

"the word dementia has been something that i've always grown up hearing. about half of the people on my dad's side of the family has/or is going to have dementia. my great uncle and aunt both were had and died of it, my aunt has it, my great grandma had and died of it, my grandma has it and so on and so forth. my dad grew up in a family of denial, nobody accepts what illness they have because basically illness is equal to weakness in their eyes. over the past 2 years i've noticed a change in my father's (currently 61) behavior, he asks questions frequently, is quick to anger and has lost the little amount of patience he had to begin with. my dad was diagnosed with rem sleep disorder 9 months back, he takes over 12mg of melatonin each night but still screams and thrashes in his sleep every night. my mom took him down to mayo for a checkup on the sleep disorder and the doctors had bad news. because the episodes still happen each night they think he's on track to developing a brain degenerative disorder (parkinsons or dementia with lewy body). he has a 30% chance of developing one now, a 75% chance of it happening within the next 5 years and a 90% chance of developing one in 10 years. i honestly just dont know what to do or say at this point. my mom is making us set routine around the house and making us set up structure and boundaries so he can be comfortable. i'm 16, i've had the hardest year of my life so far recently and this has just put the icing on the cake for me. the fact that he most likely either wont be able to walk me down the aisle at my wedding or even recognize me in a few years is eating me alive. every time it crosses my mind that he's sick everything around me turns black and i get lightheaded. the worst thing about this is that he's super embarrassed about it and has the mentality that he's weak so he doesn't want anyone to know, except my siblings and my mom, so i cant talk to about it to any of my friends until it gets bad and i can no longer hide it. i've had boyfriends pick up on his behavior before, they've asked me why he asks so many questions. im not super close with my dad since his personality changed but because i was his only daughter i would spend the most time with him, bikerides, walks, football games, church, you name it. i'm just sick of this and i really just need some advice on how to cope with it because the future i had planned for myself has disappeared. my grandparents have dementia and it's put a bunch of stress on my dad to help care for them because my grandpa hates his care facility and all the staff in it. i havent visited them in months because their room smells of urine and my grandma always confuses me as her daughter who died at around the age i am. i just want him to go back to the way he was 5 years ago. sorry if this is disturbing to anyone who has dementia but i feel really lost and because i cant counsel myself in a friend i just needed to vent and get this out of my system. and for those who were in the same place at one point, what do you do?"," hi.  i completely understand and resonate with the things you're going through because of the dementia in your family.  i have gone through a similar ordeal, and it took me a great while to find peace with myself and how to handle the dementia with my father, which has torn apart his life and much of our family.the most important discovery for me was understanding that none of this is my father's fault and most of the fears, aggravation, embarrassment, frustrations, disappointments, and so-forth are directly under my control.  moreover, i realized that i was letting the issues this generated within myself and our family negatively affect my relationship with and how i treated my father.i could write about this much more at length, but i just want to point out a few things, even though they may be trite by some standards (it's hard to know where anyone is when it comes to how we view dementia, especially when it is within our close family) and sorry if i am too abrupt or frank:	1. don't care what your boyfriends think.  why should what someone else thinks about your father having dementia affect you in any way?  as it is, most people don't understand and make light of dementia as much as people do the same with, say, misunderstood mental illness.  people can think of those with dementia (as well as the family for the changes they make to accommodate it) as just plain weird.  that's just people reacting to anything different in a negative manner, and there is a lot of people that will tell you what you ""should"" do.  a true friend (to you, your family, and your dad) would jump right in with a positive attitude even if it is a little awkward at first.  sometimes people reflect off of our attitudes as well -- in other words, my advice is to not worry about what people think and they will get strength from you to be your friend.  if not, then forget them anyway.	2. not visiting your grandparents because the place smells like urine.  i don't want to be too forward here, but this does hit me at home a little bit, with my father being in a nursing home where i constantly have to smell many similar things, if not worse, on a regular basis.why not visit your grandparents because you're uncomfortable?  think of how they feel being in a place like that.  nursing homes can be awful places, especially for those that cannot help with their own personal grooming and other habits, as they also lose their voice to make changes.    i don't know what your grandparent's situation is in terms of possibly taking them outside, or opening a window for a while, etc.  whatever their status is, visiting would make their lives better, which makes it more about them -- which, in turn, does come back to make it about you and feeling good for helping someone else out.	3. enjoy what you have now.  my father is not the same person he was a few years ago.  it took me a long time to figure out that the real person is still in there, with the same feelings, plus a whole lot more -- he is much more like a child and needs to be taken care of as such.  however, that has allowed me to form a new relationship.  in many ways, our roles have reversed and i act like his parent -- he calls me his father every once in a while.  sometimes he thinks i'm his brother, or my brother.  however, even when he does mistake me for someone else, it is clear the feeling of family and that a ""i like this person being here"" mentality is still there.  just because he may forget who i am doesn't diminish the value of our relationship, or my desire to help him have a higher quality of life.  	4. constantly look for new avenues.  we often hear a lot of stories about people with dementia -- screaming, agitation, blank stares, etc.  this does happen and, in many cases, there is not much you can do about it as it is a genuine cognitive breakdown.  however, it's amazing what little changes can do.  for example, there is one case where a women was completely upset and agitated when her family changed her clothes.  well, you have to change someone's clothes, so what could they do?  it took a while, but they realized it was because it was different clothes.   as soon as they realized that they just needed a few separate sets of the same exact clothes, everything was fine.   in my dad's case, he was getting very upset at staff in the nursing home.  i like the staff in this nursing home, but they do need much better training.  i finally realized it was because they were pulling a curtain behind him unannounced, which triggered him (this is classic dementia behavior, by the way).    once i was able to convince the staff to not walk behind my father without announcing themselves, things were much better. 	5. listen. the issue with the people walking behind my father was one of 50+ things we discovered over time (like making sure the tv stayed on cnn at all times, or leaving the light on, or closing the curtains, etc. etc.).  this is the way it is with dementia, and the smallest thing (like a stuffed animal, for some) can make a night-and-day difference in how they feel and how they relate to others.  some of it is obvious (look up triggers for dementia, for example), while others take a lot of listening.	6. it's their universe; learn how to listen.  this was probably the hardest part of understanding that i was placing my view of the way things should be on my father, which was simultaneously not helping him and causing me to be upset and frustrated.  things that seemed painfully obvious wouldn't work.  i needed to learn to listen and understand how he relates to his world (a subject that needs a lot more writing space).  once i did that, things became much easier.  i've been much more at peace with things, and my father has a much better quality of life. don't get me wrong -- his life is still awful and dementia is such a scourge.  however, is life is 10 times better with the efforts in understanding what works for him and letting go of any expectations on who and what he should be that we once had.anyway, i just thought i'd throw some thoughts out there.  i guess my basic message is that, while dementia is horrible and a strain on the family, there are ways to deal with it that can make it so much better for many with dementia, and much easier on the family taking care of them.i think the idea (from other people) of a support group is great!  being able to talk to others with the same situation makes our seem so much easier to handle -- and definitely a little less lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8hkx1p/i_just_need_to_get_this_out_of_my_system/,i just need to get this out of my system

"i work with a lady that is about 7-8 months from retirement and she’s got symptoms of some type of dementia. we’re just kind of letting her ride it out so she can get full retirement but she’s extremely frustrating to deal with. about a year ago she started with our company and at the time, she was in a position of leading a few bodies of work. she would blame coworkers and always tell people they weren’t being clear, they didn’t communicate well, something was always someone else’s fault when she didn’t understand things. she would get angry and nit pick people over nothing. we honestly assumed she was just a lying c*nt. she displayed what i thought were classic bpd symptoms at that time, complete with mood swings and inability to get along with people.we reorganized and they offered her a lower position with less responsibility. she took it. after a few months it became readily apparent - she would be shown something, be very hard to teach, eventually get it and then two days later completely forget how to perform the task. she would confuse technical words we use in the industry that she definitely knew well enough when she started with us. she repeats herself often, has conversations and then can’t remember two days later. a coworker says when she gives her steps/tasks she does so one at a time, and by step 3 she’s forgotten the first one. she can barely operate a copy machine, has been shown 20+ times how to scan and send things to her email and can’t do it. she can’t focus well, some of it is her eyes - another problem because if you give her written instructions either she can’t retain what she’s reading or she is having a vision problem, it’s tough to nail it down. some of our management team knows, particularly my boss. it’s a cruel thought to begin documenting on someone so close to retirement and rob them of any percentage of benefits. we are short staffed and it’s hard not to get angry about having someone who is not doing an fte’s worth of work and eats so much of everyone else’s time. i digress...she can be almost childlike and emotional, weeping when people are kind to her. other times, she’s difficult to deal with, stubborn and contrary. she has diabetes, and i know that causes brain fog, so it’s either the underlying cause or exacerbating things. she’s repetitive, obsessive about some things. she does like to travel, does want to be social, but part of the reason why i thought she had bpd is because she nags people to help her and then will blame them when they’re busy or she doesn’t understand when they explain things to her, so she alienates people. she also seems clueless that there is an issue. no problems with gait, if you asked her who the president was she would definitely know that, seems to be able to retain names of people she’s met, find her way around town, etc. mostly, her ability to learn and retain information is affected, logical reasoning is affected, remembering conversations, perhaps reading comprehension, trouble maintaining relationships, emotional, mixes up “technical” terms (not everyday objects or words). i was hoping to get a hit or lead on what is going on, because i’ve seen this before in another person who was diabetic and that relationship ended badly- i’d like to be able to help this person how i can, adjust how i’m giving instructions or find tasks that she can actually do that would fill an fte and are appropriate, even if it takes me awhile and a lot of aids to help her through the next few months. i read that there is over 100 different types of dementia and the 6 or 7 most common have symptoms she doesn’t seem to have or it isn’t severe enough yet, but she has a lot that hit “moderate” in some of those categories, just not certain hallmarks."," i can see how the office talk can assume some form of dementia. but, there is no way to truly know without a medical evaluation. hoping your company has at least a good health insurance package and encourage time off so this woman can actually address her health. this situation and story is sadly going to become increasingly common. there is a line in your story that got my attention where you say she cries anytime someone is nice to her.i would highly recommend your company to seek out a dementia friendly america program to better understand dementia. many people don't go for testing to determine what type of dementia because all of the stigma faced in our communities.  no matter the memory or functional deficits, folks with dementia are still people who think and feel, so i cannot even imagine what she feels in this fast paced, demanding work environment. i get it your work/life balance sucks but this woman is facing a major health crisis. how differently would the company react if she had cancer? those differences in how we treat the two is the stigma i speak of. for others, i would start this conversation at your workplace on how they would handle? i found this legal piece on how to possibly start a conversation.  and google japan and great britain dementia workforce...their population demographics are the usa's in about 12 years. we can learn a lot of lessons from their experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8fhs5z/wondering_what_kind_of_dementia_does_anyone/,Wondering what kind of dementia?

"my mom is 64 and has been experiencing dementia since feb 2016. from then until aug 2017, she was in a nursing home. she had a head injury and combined with her medications, she was super out of it in the beginning. over time, she improved to the point where my dad believed he could care for her at home. it quickly became apparent that her being home wasn’t going to work - she has no impulse control... she’s going to get what she wants, come hell or high water, regardless of what anyone says. one day, she snuck out of the house and took a ride from a stranger because my dad wouldn’t take her shopping.  after several weeks of stress, arguments, drama, and police intervention, we finally got her into a new nursing home with a locked dementia unit. she’s been in the new location since late october, and absolutely hates it. she is still in the “earlier” stages of dementia... she’s pretty with it most of the time. every time we visit, she’s constantly telling us she doesn’t belong there (most of the residents are significantly older and have much more advanced cases of dementia), and asks when she can go home. she’s in total denial that she has dementia, even though the doctors have told her she does. since october, she has caused quite a stir at her nursing home. in january, she tried to pack up all her stuff - she thought she was going home, even though nobody told her she was. she tried to reach something on a high shelf in her wardrobe, so she stepped up inside the cabinet. it wasn’t anchored to the wall, and fell over. mom ended up with a broken toe.  a few weeks later, she was repeatedly throwing herself out of bed. the nurses were concerned that she would injure herself beyond her toe, so she ended up staying in a mental hospital for a week. she has been known to scream for help when she needs something, rather than turning on her call light. in a recent care conference, i asked the social  worker if mom was going to be kicked out, and while she didn’t come right out and say yes, she did imply that if the behavior continued, it would be a possibility. last year, she had some baseline cognitive assessments done, and recently underwent the testing again to see if any progress was made.  in response to her latest queries about when she could go home, my dad told her we would see what the doctor had to say at her next appointment, and we’d go from there.  she translates this to mean that she can go home after her appointment. the doctor has already called my dad with the test results and has informed him that he recommends she stay in a locked dementia unit. mom is not going to take this news well.  i’m concerned that she is going to resume her negative behaviors and potentially get kicked out of her nursing facility. it was so hard to get her into this one, i don’t know what we’ll do if she gets kicked out... there are only so many facilities with locked units, and not all of them accept medicaid. just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and how you handled it... thanks for reading this long rant!", thank you so much for the tip! i may see if they can direct us to a good psychiatrist in our area. it’s been really difficult finding one that will accept her medicare/medicaid dual plan. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8egcx4/what_to_say_to_mom/,What to Say to Mom...
"my mother-in-law has been declining with worsening memory loss, confabulation, cognitive function loss, and worsening self care in a dramatic way for 2-3 years. she has three sons. one of them has been aware of the situation and trying to help for a long time. he recently said she was diagnosed with alzheimer's more than ten years ago, before her husband died. at that time, they set up a living trust and poa papers, but the rest of the family were not told about the diagnosis. my fil passed away, and mil has been on her own for seven years. she has steadfastly denied anything was wrong with her and refused any and all help, even minor, common sense measures. she has poisoned family relationships through paranoid/confabulated stories of abuse. she speaks negatively of all family members behind their backs, and this has poisoned family relationships because people have believed her stories rather than talking to each other.she hasn't been able to manage her own medications consistently for several years. last year, i took initiative and with her permission and cooperation, i found her an automated medication dispenser. she paid for it with her own credit card and agreed to use it. i also went with her to a doctor's appointment, with her permission, after i talked to her about concerns about her memory and she agreed she shared the same concerns. at the appointment, we saw a pa who confronted me about why i was there, told my mil she ""didn't need anyone to go to appointments with her"" and gave a mini-mental status exam that i'm pretty sure she assisted mil to pass. then declared her as having ""only normal age-related memory loss."" at this time, i didn't know about the longstanding alzheimer's diagnosis and neither did that medical practice. she ended up putting the medication dispenser somewhere and forgetting it existed. a couple months later, my husband pulled it out from under a desk and she was shocked. didn't recognize it. had never seen such a thing.each time a family member has tried to get involved in her care, mil has initially been receptive, and then refused to share information about her appointments and removed any information releases she had previously signed so we could not know anything about her health care. she had breast cancer and was going to all of her appointments alone, refusing help, unable and/or unwilling to tell us what treatments she was receiving, what her prognosis was, or anything. she could not tell us anything about her many health problems. she has insisted some of her doctors came into the exam room and sat silently staring at her before leaving without a word. she has not been compliant with her meds. she is prescribed many medications. she does not take them on schedule and sometimes takes too many. until last fall she was still driving. she only lost her license because i called and reported her to the dmv. she failed the road test abysmally, but thinks she was done wrong and had her license revoked unfairly. now she has had an incident where she locked herself out of the house and spent 24-hours outdoors before anyone missed her. she lives way out in the country on her own and has repeatedly said she would rather die than move or have any professionals come into the home to help her. her doctor ordered a visiting nurse and she refused the service.we are the long distance family. the two local sons are not dealing well with the situation. one knew about the dementia and has been trying to help for years. his reward for all of his effort was for mil to tell everyone that he's been trying to put her in a nursing home and steal her property. the other son has been in total denial and has avoided the situation until recently. now he's jumped in and is taking her to doctor's appointments, which is great, but is also actively getting in the way and raging out regularly. he is still in denial about the dementia and thinks she ought to be living on her own and still driving. he recently threw a fit because his wife told him i was the one who reported her to the dmv. he confronted my husband about it and ended up punching a wall. he also got in an argument with his mother and pulled back a fist to punch her. my husband had to jump in between them, and he put down his hand, but it's really got us shook up. i have no regrets about reporting her to the dmv. the idea of her behind the wheel of a vehicle is terrifying. we finally found the living trust and dpoa paperwork after searching the house for over a year. (her paperwork is a mess--she hasn't paid her taxes yet and we have no idea what's happening with her bills). but these documents require all the brothers to cooperate and that is not happening. the ragey brother goes to her doctor's appointments with her, he is making medical decisions for her via bullying--not the dpoa that she and her husband prepared when she was still competent--and he is making financial decisions for her. he is refusing care on her behalf as doctors and social workers are increasingly attempting to intervene. the burned out apathetic brother is not participating because he is stressed out and thinks his dead father meant for him to be in charge of everything, even though the paperwork has all three names on it.we have consulted our own lawyer and are trying to find our way through this mess. it's beyond frustrating and heartbreaking. we know now that the years of conflict in the family have been created by the mother's paranoia and confabulations--every time something happened that upset her, she would blame somebody and make up a wild story about why they were at fault. until recently, her stories were mostly plausible. it's very difficult to navigate all of the hurt feelings and damaged relationships. most of us understand now that it was never personal, but ragey brother is causing a lot of problems with his behaviors. he also packs a pistol everywhere he goes and has bragged about brandishing it in order to intimidate others. he's never pulled his gun on us yet, but obviously the fact that he's showing up armed to family discussions and raging out is making it difficult to advocate for his mother in the face of his bad decisions, gatekeeping, and poor understanding of her limitations. rage bro is also lecturing her and trying to train her to stop her dementia behaviors.she's not safe in the house. there's nothing keeping her from getting locked out again. she has free access to a stove, many appliances, stairs, bathrooms, etc. where she could get hurt. and she's making a mess of her medications. she is due to finally get a neuropsych eval in may, but her condition is obvious and every doctor she's seen lately has acknowledged she obviously has dementia. rage bro and his wife are still hanging on that evaluation, though, and are holding up addressing her safety needs until they get their ""proof.""i think we're doing everything we can. it's a nightmare. we spent last weekend with her after she had some teeth pulled, and then we had to just leave her home alone, where she is clearly not safe, because the local brothers think that's ok. rage bro bought her a medical alert device from walmart, but we're expecting about the same success with that as the medication dispenser. she's insulted by the idea of it, and it needs daily charging, as well as her to cooperate with wearing it and remember to wear it.has anyone else been through this? any thoughts?"," your story and my story have some similar elements. my mil has an undiagnosed mental illness that she’s had her whole life (probably a personality disorder.) she was diagnosed with “mild dementia” about 5 years ago, but to us it was just a continuation of what has been going on her whole life, just with more confusion. she also talks badly about whoever just left the room. she has played my husband and his two sisters against each other their whole lives. his youngest sister has always been their mother’s enabler, and helped her hide her obvious mental illness and villified anyone who dared point it out, no matter how kind the approach and intention.we are also the long distance family members, with my husband’s two sisters nearby their mom. we had financial poa for years, and i managed to get things straightened out and even got her approved for medicaid which got her some home care and eventually covered her nursing home costs. her condition has definitely worsened over the years, mostly because my husband’s enabling sister has medical proxy, and won’t let them give her any neuro-psych meds or be seen by that doctor. she’s showing signs of increasing frontotemporal dementia: getting aggressive and being sexually inappropriate. she also wets her bed every night and refuses to let them change the sheets until the next day. still, my husband’s sister swears it’s not the dementia and that she’s just unhappy in the nursing home. so, out of the blue, his sister has a lawyer draw up a new poa that put her in charge, and their mom told us (after whispering that she’s not supposed to tell us) that his sister is working on getting an apartment for the two of them to live in together. oh...did i mention that his sister has ms and is disabled and needs daily care herself?yeah, so basically it’s a shit show, and we have no power to do anything anymore, and now his mother tells us to f-ck off when we talk to her on the phone and tells my husband i’m a b-tch and he never should have married me. we had a very good relationship for many years (i’ve been with my husband 18 years.) now she blames me for everything that goes wrong.the only advice i have for you, is to think about getting guardianship of your mil. bring whatever evidence you have to court that your husband’s brothers are neglecting her needs. or, you can do what we have done, which is to let them have their dysfunctional mess, and get your own therapy to deal with the pain of watching it all happen. if your husband’s family is anything like my husband’s family, they will find a way to ruin you if you try to take control. for us, it was too big of a chance to take. it is extremely painful, though, for my husband and i to watch, and we try to offer whatever comfort we can to her that she will accept. you could also call adult protective services anonymously, but you’ll have to weigh that with the possibility that they might know it was you because of your previous action with her driver’s license.whatever you choose, know that i am with you in spirit, and wishing for the peace and safety of all of the family members involved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8eefjc/nightmare_family_conflictdementia_situation/,Nightmare family conflict/dementia situation

"so my bf's father has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (progressive nonfluent aphasia variety). i found a memory care that was supposedly great and offered higher levels of care. his father is not aware enough to be able to make the decision to go to a memory care or not. he is having problems with normal care for himself even at this facility (note that they are charging him extra for care to help with bathing/getting dressed but its not getting done). to be honest, his father has become a bit of a problem with threatening self harming behavior and having tantrums. his doctor has said that this is possibly because of the medicine his previous doctor put him on as there isn't really a medication treatment for his type of dementia. the problem has come from the memory care asking my bf to dedicate his weekends to caring for his father (when we are paying the memory care for this feature, and extra for med management/help with daily care. over 8k a month). i feel like they are doing subpar care and should not be asking this of him at all. has anyone else had this type of response from a care facility?"," find a new facility. they should not be asking your bf for help, at all, regardless of what they're charging you.. that is very unprofessional of them.

"on the 25th of march my father in laws father passed away. his wife (the mother of my father in law, they were married for 66 years) was already a bit confused sometimes, but this situation made it a lot worse. during the week between his death and the funeral (he was buried on the 31th of march), she caught the flu (which is not strange, given their is a long running flu epidemic in our country and her immune system probably took a hit from the stress and sleep deprivation during the weeks of terminal illness her husband suffered). she was hospitalized for this and became very confused. we, as a family, think she might have beginning dementia (it ran in her family) which she hid behind grandpa. we didn't think she could safely return home in this situation, so she was kept at the hospital until after easter and on tuesday the 3rd of april she went to a temporary nursing home for observation. during the period she is there she will also be examined by doctors in the hospital.she is absolutely not happy in the nursing home. she thinks she could easily go home and is very angry at her kids (my father in law and his sister) for forcing her to go to that nursing home. she is willing to go to an elderly facility elsewhere permanently, but she does not like the nursing home where she is now. there was no other option, so as a family we don't regret this decision. this was the only nursing home in the region that offers a place in this short notice. she thinks the place is to far from where her children live (it's only marginally farther than her home, actually, but she doesn't feel it that way), and the nursing home does not align with her religious views. she aims for a permanent spot in a specific facility that is in the same town as where her daughter lives and strongly matches her beliefs.nobody in the family told her she is there because we fear she might have dementia and can't go home alone safely. all the conversations about this result in outright lies that she is there because of fear she might fall of the stairs or other physical concerns. she is physically fine for someone her age, so this is bullshit and she knows it. but my father in law and his sister do not want to tell her why she's really there. going demented is her biggest fear, so they think it would hurt her a lot of they tell her. i think they mostly don't want to tell her because they fear the pain her reaction will cause them and not out of genuine concern for her wellbeing. i think not telling her the truth greatly contributes to her negative feelings about the nursing home.can you offer some advice? i told my parents in law that i strongly disagree with the decision of not telling her the truth, but they stay in their position. are they maybe right? or am i right? is there literature that show what is wise in these situations?"," about 80% of dementia sufferers have anosognosia, which is the inability to accurately assess their physical and mental condition (lack of self-awareness).  if she has this condition, she will not believe anyone that tells her she possibly has dementia and will, in fact, argue with them about it.  and, if she does have dementia, her brain is unable to ""save"" most short-term memories, so she'll forget she was even told about her condition.  this is why it doesn't make sense, most of the time, to bring up the diagnosis to the person. has she actually been tested and diagnosed?

"warning: rant ahead.  tl;dr at the bottommy grandma's (86) husband (89) of 9 years has decided to leave her (so much for in sickness and in health).  next week is when he is moving out.  she's had dementia for about 5 years now, and used to be an extremely independent woman.  she's been paneled, but isn't even near close enough for a nursing home (when she gets to that point, we fully intend to move her in with us for as long as we can), and they've granted her 16 hours of respite work a week as soon as they can find someone to come in.  apparently he can't be bothered to see how it goes.now normally, i would be understanding.  dementia is so hard to deal with alone.  the issue i'm having regarding her pathetic excuse for a husband is the time leading up to this decision.  since we first started suspecting she had dementia, my mother had been trying to book appointments for her to see various doctors and specialists to see what we could do to a) get her officially diagnosed, b) learn how we could adapt to and cope with the behaviours that would present themselves, and c) slow down the dementia's progression.  well, apparently this was overstepping, and husband threatened to leave her if my mom even tried to make an appointment.  this stemmed from my mom inquiring about weaning her off a medication she had been on for years that she did not need, and because of its negative effects on dementia.  her doctor agreed, and ended up cutting the dose in half.  as a result she got very sick, and so, grandma's husband blamed my mother.  we also discovered he was giving her medication that was not prescribed to her that he was getting from his brother (who is a pharmacist) when he gave her a sleeping pill that made her pass out on the living room floor and a nurse had to be called (they are in assisted living).in the months leading up to now, never once did he tell us he was struggling, and instead plotted with his children behind our backs to try to get her into a nursing home, and ultimately leaver her.  when we offered to help, none of our suggestions were good enough.  i ended up quitting my job to be able to take care of her in the mornings so he could either go work in his shop (woodworking) or take a nap.  well, apparently, my availability of 8:30-11:30 (i have university classes if the afternoon) wasn't good enough, and he would be much happier with 9:00-12:00 (!!????!), so i suggested coming in at 8:30, but leaving closer to 11:45 (likely making me late for class), and he had the nerve to say ""well to make this work, i'd also need you here from 1 to 4"".  why?  because apparently this man needs to be in his damn shop all day.  when i quit my job, i took a huge pay decrease, and opted for them to pay me just enough to cover my bills.  since we were mostly doing this for him, we expected him to pitch in for half of what i was asking for (it would have cost him around $400 a month).  apparently this was completely unacceptable, even though a month prior he had said that he would be willing to pay for someone to come in and watch her for a few hours while he was gone.there is a ton more bs that has happened between then and now, but just this past week, and without warning, his kids have a meeting with my family (the useless husband didn't even come) to tell my mom that he is going to leave.  oh.  and all a week before my grandma's birthday.  they even expect us to tell her what is happening.here's the biggest issue.  though i'm more than happy to never see him again (i never liked him), my grandma absolutely adores him.  every morning, before he leaves, she tells him to ""please come back!""  she is constantly talking about how lucky she is to have him, even signing his birthday card ""from lucky me"".  so not only is she not going to remember he left her, she is going to be absolutely devastated.  what can we do to help her cope?  i am at a complete loss here.  any advice would help!tl;dr: grandma's husband is leaving her almost out of no where because of her dementia, despite our family trying to work with him.  how do we prepare her, and help her cope in the weeks to come?"," when my grandfather died, i just told my grandmother that grandpa was working late at the factory and wouldn't be home until late. then is make up a story about how they just got back from the beach or another trip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8cc4e7/grandmas_husband_is_leaving/,Grandma's husband is leaving...

my grandma has not spoken of my grandpa since he has passed. she was in the early stage of dementia. it has been 4 years since and he dementia has gotten slightly worse but she still knows what’s mostly going on. but lately she has been asking my mom and i to call my grandpa to pick her up to go home. any suggestions on the best way to help her remember that she is home and that he has passed would be very helpful.," in my experience as a pca, denying a dementia patients reality is rather horrible.i try to explain it to my friends like this. say, you walked out of your house and looked up the sky and remarked to someone how blue it was. they look at you like a crazy person and tell you that it's red, and you are absolutely adamant that it is blue. the other person constantly saying it's red when it clearly isn't (to you) will obviously make you agitated.when i'm at work, i like to try redirection instead. if they ask about a dead husband for example, don't tell them that they're dead - ask about them. what was your husbands name? what did he do for work? what did you like most about him? - things to that effect. that way you're still satisfying their need for meaningful discussion and moving them along from their initial thought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8c1w8u/my_grandma_with_dementia_keeps_mentioning_my/,My grandma with dementia keeps mentioning my grandpa who has passed away.
"my dad was recently admitted to the icu for pancreatitis and pneumonia. when he arrived the doctors noted he was going through alcohol withdrawals and had signs of dementia. he had always been a drinker but i didn’t know that he had increased his drinking so much. i’m 25 and we live 3000 miles away from each other. he still has most of his long term memory but keeps losing things like his keys and wallet and according to a friend gotten lost at least once. if he is returned to his own care he will drink again and then the pancreatitis will come back and kill him. i’m trying to obtain durable power of attorney but he is currently sedated and intubated as he is recovering in the icu. when i arrived at his new home he bought for the first time it was very clear that something was wrong:he hadn’t vacuumed in two years despite owning four vacuum cleaners and a carpet cleaner (he has a black labrador retriever who sheds a ton). he left notes and to do lists all over his home and  never did any of the things he wrote down. he was aware of his condition, as he had a couple of books on dementia and alzheimer’s on his nightstand. he bought this house brand new 2 years ago and he didn’t have any blinds or curtains or towel bars.  none of his paintings he loved were hung.his house was covered in a thick layer of dust.his garage was full of junk and a complete mess.his dog, historically very active (old family dog) is very fat and has trouble breathing. he has 6 tv remotes and 2 tvs but only ever set up one tv. he wrote a bad check to pay for some contract work despite having funds in another account. i saw him last about six months ago when he came to visit my wife and i and while he seemed to be getting worse i had no idea it was this bad. we spoke weekly on the phone and hid various health problems from us like the fact he had prostate cancer and didn’t tell us until he began treatment five months later (january).my mother (his ex-wife) and i had planned on coming down next month to check up on him and make some decisions about this eventuality, but life just kicks you in the nuts sometimes.  any advice on how to deal with this difficult situation is greatly appreciated."," so sorry you and your family are going through this. yes, from everything you've described, it sounds as though you've reached the point where your dad can no longer be responsible for himself or others. it's going to get harder before it gets easier, i'm afraid.not sure which state/country you are in, but the laws about how this can be handled do vary. it's very good that you are seeing an attorney who can help unravel the options.i had a similar situation with my own dad and the healthcare institutions impressed upon me that since dad could not safely live alone in his own place, if they released him to that end against medical advice, they would by law be required to make a report to adult protective services. my dad hates dealing with government authorities, so this was enough to get him to at least agree to transfer from the hospital to a skilled nursing facility (snf) for rehab for a few weeks, and this gave me and my siblings time to figure out what to do next.during that time, we toured several types of nursing homes, personal care homes, memory care facilities, etc. to find the one that we thought would fit dad the best and would be within his budget. we also got the hospital to refer him for a neurological exam and mri to get a definitive diagnosis of dementia/alzheimer's, since his pre-existing legal documents had specified that 2 physicians must certify his incapacity before his various poas would go into effect.one thing i did, in case any of these decisions were ever called into question, was to collect all of the evidence that i could to show dad's decline. i photographed everything from his piles of unopened mail, to months worth of prescription medicines that he had not taken, to expired food in his pantry and refrigerator, etc. to notes about his interactions with neighbors & caregivers that demonstrated a change in his behavior (withdrawal), and so on. i took notes at every conversation with any of the health care providers and also made notes following my visits with dad about his condition and behavior.everyone is different, but prepare yourself for the possibility that your dad may get pretty angry and belligerent during this process. he's surely scared and confused and it's often the loved ones who receive the brunt of the backlash against that. when we were face-to-face, my dad could seem perfectly reasonable and calm, but when he would call me on the phone, he would be irate and curse me out, demanding that i come remove him from the snf or he was just going to walk out (a difficult proposition by this time, when he was using a walker and 6l of oxygen). it was sooo stressful to hear him so upset at me, especially when i was spending every free moment i had to try to find a safe place for him.it helps to reach out to others, like you've done here. come back and get support whenever you need

"my grandmother died last week. it was sort of gruesome death, but i'm grateful that she's no longer in pain and that she and my family are free of the hell that her undiagnosed disorder caused. i wonder if anyone could give me more information on what was happening to her.the reason she never got a proper diagnosis is partially because her symptoms were atypical. she never became demented in the straightforward way that her husband, who has fairly classic parkinson's, is now becoming. she didn't forget much, or lose speech, or become disoriented. but for many years she was plagued by increasing mania and anxiety. she couldn't sleep, and she was terrified all the time about absolutely every thought that entered her head. it seemed to me that her system was suffused with adrenaline and in 100% flight-or-fight mode for about 4 years. she called my mother at all hours of the day or night with crises every day for all those years, over things that in fact were quite manageable, or not urgent. when i would drive her anywhere, she would shriek at me not to run into things. her speech was pressured and shrill. it was a mix of high-pitched anxiety, sadness, fear, and depression that inhabited her body like a demon and never quit.this was not her typical personality before, and she was heartbroken because she knew something horrible was happening to her. and there were some physical symptoms, but again they were vague and hard to pin down. her face adopted a pained expression, as if she was fighting the demons that plagued her constantly. her skin became sallow and pale, and her movement deteriorated and become slower, but not in the trembly way of parkinson's. when we see pictures of her from that time, all of us can tell that she had become a shell of herself. she was simply perplexed by and preoccupied with her own suffering, but none of us could quite define that suffering or find any way to help her.last year, she had a stroke. all of us sort of take this as hopeful proof that there was something truly wrong with her brain and brewing all that time, even though we'll never know quite what happened. in the months before, things became even more insane and weird. she accused one of her caretakers of sexually assaulting her, and then actually said a day later that she'd made it up. it didn't seem like dementia, really, but whatever it was pulled her and my family into a pit of horrible, creepy insanity that we are just beginning to shake off now that she is gone.i know this is a vague description, but that's what was so maddening about this process. my grandmother was never an easy woman in many ways, but whatever this was took her from all of us. i was not able to have a true relationship with her for years. no one was. i miss my grandmother, and all of us would like to know what happened to her--if only because if it is genetic, we would like to be able to recognize the early symptoms and kill ourselves before things get too extreme. it was a horrid death and the whole process was shrouded in mystery. i don't know much about their medical process, but i do know they were in consultation with many neuro doctors and she never received a firm diagnosis.any insight any of you can give me would be helpful. thank you."," was she examined by a neurologist? even if it didn't seem like dementia, everything you wrote describes a brain disorder. multiple diagnoses from different neurologists might have also helped. unfortunately, neurology isn't perfect. i feel for your loss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8b2cd0/grandma_never_got_a_proper_diagnosis_for_the/,Grandma never got a proper diagnosis for the progressive deterioration that destroyed her

"first i should mention she is in the nursing home, so she is at least safe and taken care of.it's interesting because she has what i guess they would consider fairly severe and advanced dementia, however, she still remembers people. she almost always remembers us, friends, other family, neighbors from 40 years ago. every once in awhile she'll need reminding but over all that part of her memory is somewhat intact.she doesn't remember places, homes, towns, anything like virtually at all and thinks north is south and vice versa. she's been in the nursing home for over a year now, but never remembers her room and constantly thinks she's in a different room.  for some reason the last month or two she's latched on to the idea that every time my dad and i come to visit we're there to take her home, even though she doesn't even remember where ""home"" supposedly is.  her issues are further complicated by the fact that she was in a freak accident at the nursing home last year and had a lot of trauma from it. just to give a short idea - her back was broken, her pelvis was broken in two places, she had 7-9 fractured ribs, her left leg was broken in 4 places with two major compound fractures one which required a skin graft and her heel was crushed, and the other leg was broken in 2 places i believe. i don't know how much metal she has in her legs now but it's a lot, in addition to already having two false knees from before. after hours and hours of multiple surgeries, she recovered remarkably well, especially for being 86 at the time of such a traumatic accident. however, she did lose the ability to walk so she can't use the restroom on her own, etc. she is wheelchair bound now though she actually is in fairly good shape physically. she just never regained enough strength and mobility after the accident to walk again.this creates a problem in itself because she can't remember that she can't walk anymore and tries to stand up to ""prove us wrong"" all the time or show people that she can walk. we didn't really worry about it too much because we didn't think she had enough upper body strength to pull herself out of the wheelchair but apparently that is not the case because the other day she managed to get out without hurting herself and was sitting on the floor putting her shoes on getting ready to ""go home"" when the staff found her.we haven't been able to get her out of that delusion. so now any time we visit she becomes inconsolable and varies between violent anger and crying the entire time while yelling at us, staff, other residents, and anyone who's around. she's still verbal but limited in that a lot of what she says is delusional or non-sensical. it's impossible to reason with her or calm her down because she can't hold conversation anymore. we used to be able to just steer the conversation a different direction or remind her that she used to be happy at the nursing home, but it's not working anymore.at this point it's getting more and more aggressive (kicking things, kicking her wheel chair, throwing things) and we're afraid she's going to start lashing out at us, the staff, or the other residents.she is on ativan as needed but it's not enough anymore. at this point dad and i don't know what to do anymore. do we just stay away completely in case we are triggering the upset? then she's just sad and asks about us and is mad thinking we don't care. we can't just go visit her and be yelled at and abused the entire time, that's not good for anyone involved. the staff is frustrated, we're frustrated, and i'm sure she isn't happy as well and that's the most heartbreaking thing. our goal has been to preserve whatever quality of life she can have for as long as possible, especially after the accident, but i know she's miserable all the time right now.did any of your loved ones go through this stage? any recommendations or advice would be super helpful!   edit: i should mention - surprisingly she's in fairly little ongoing pain from the accident. her worst leg and her back does get sore sometimes, in addition to arthritis in her hands but she is still very good about speaking up when she has pain and we and the staff make sure to ask frequently if she's in any pain. so they're fairly certain she's not lashing out in response to physical pain."," that sounds really hard, i am so sorry you and your family are going through this. does your mom take anything other than a sedative, like an anti-depressant or anything? my mom’s psychiatric issues from alzheimer’s have been far more difficult to deal with than the memory issues. there was this 6 month period leading up to her diagnosis where things were so bad i don’t know how i did it. and i don’t think i can ever do it again.we finally got a good neuro and he put her on zoloft. i was actually really disappointed when he wrote the script because i was so spent and didn’t think such an everyday drug could deal with her level of instability, aggression, and psychosis. i thank god everyday i was wrong. silly question, but have they tried anything like this or was it only the sedative that they gave her?edit: the zoloft made it so i could also redirect my mom more easily. which unfortunately is what you will have to do with your mom. delusions are a part of their reality and you can’t logic your way out of them.

"i am 19 yrs old and i constantly forget things.i give pencil to someone,i forget it. i put my phone on charger,i forget it.i forget assignments as well.is this alzheimers or just adhd?"," i don't think it's either, more just having a lot of things on your mind and being worried about both things because you've read about them in the media.best thing, in any instance, is to go and have a chat with your doctor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/8a32cp/do_i_have_alzheimers/,Do i have Alzheimer's?
"i was told by the hospital psychiatrist after a inpatient stay due to a stroke that my 75 year old mother's dementia was much worse according to her cat scan.  they told us she had a cat scan ten years ago and comparing the two showed much deterioration.this was the first i had heard of it and my mother said the same that no one had ever told her anything about dementia.  after rehab for the stroke, we moved her into an assisted living facility.  she still has not been formally diagnosed or treated for dementia.  she is does not fully believe she has it.  she wants to drive her car which i have been trying to put off anyway i can find (she rear-ended two cars before going into the hospital).her new primary doctor has referred her to a psychiatrist but she is reluctant to go because she doesn't like them.i just wanted to ask if it is more common for a neurologist to treat or diagnose dementia or a psychiatrist?i am just amazed at how difficult it is to get any doctor to address this issue.  they only want to give her refills for her blood pressure medication and see you in a few months.thank youmeli"," i would recommend a neuropsychological assessment.there are cases of major brain damage, but a person who was still very functional. keep in mind in teaching hospitals you may have a resident stay something like ""shows severe brain damage."" an assessment shows a highly functional person who comprehends written text but gets confused with verbal instructions due to how they may process the information.rear-ending two cars, yes that is a major warning flag. aaa's 65 plus self-driving assessment helps us identify issues:",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/89q1c1/neurologist_or_psychiatrist/,Neurologist or Psychiatrist
"my mother (70) is in generally good health, but she seems slightly confused at times lately.  she can't remember if she told me something, repeats herself (though that's always been a bad habit of hers), and today she thought there were 355 days in a year.  there have been a few other things over the past 6 months.    my grandmother (her mother) had dementia starting somewhere around age 75.  my mother also suffered a bad concussion a little over a decade ago. what signs i be looking for?  what steps should i be taking?  i decided i should start logging any odd instances like the 355 days comment.  how do i go about approaching this?  she is still more than capable of taking care of herself.  my mother is single and lives alone.  she see myself or other members of the family 2-3 times a week."," it's tough.  the line between mci (mild cognitive impairment) & normal aging can sometimes be too thin for even professionals to gauge correctly.  and sometimes mci can be caused by things other than early alzheimer's or simply never progress to it.  my mom is 66 & has gotten more cranky & confused in the past few years...she's rapidly losing her sense of hearing, has horrible sleep apnea & pre-diabetes, all of which are risk factors for developing dementia.  she's apathetic & just sits at the computer all day w/ no social life.  refuses to go to the doctor for checkups or even if she's deathly ill.  so i feel your pain.  wish i could tell you one way or the other, but it's just too difficult to be sure.  one key thing about dementia is that the sufferer often goes to great lengths to deny or downplay the fact that they're slipping while people without it will generally be concerned about small changes in their cognition.  that's because dementia sufferers genuinely don't realize there's a change in many cases.

"first of all, i'm not an expert and i do not want to give professional opinions about whether or not your loved one should go into aged care. that's entirely up to your family, your medical team and your loved one where able.but i'm a 20 year old male pca (personal carer) in an aged care home. i work in a dementia specific part of the home i work at, with residents ranging from mild to severe dementia and i absolutely love it. if you have any questions at all you might want answered from a pca's perspective, please ask me! anything from what we do in dementia specific care to what you can do as family to make it easier for everyone involved when your loved one is in care."," do you have any experience with ftd? my dad (52) has recently been diagnosed and we are putting him in a home as he has been progressing rapidly, but from your experience (if you have any) what are some tips to make him feel more welcome in the home? i have 4 siblings (all under 18) and my mother and so this is going to be a drastic change for him (for the better though as it will help with routine) but i am just curious if there are some things that typically work to help them feel more at ease.

"hi all, i've been noticing some differences in my grandma's behavior. i went to her house yesterday for easter. usually, she showers/ does her hair and make up and the house/ her bedroom is usually spotless. yesterday though, she clearly hadn't done any of those things. she's been very forgetful lately. she's been sleeping way more than normal. and she forgot how to play an easy card game yesterday that we've been playing for years. i've been researching online and it seems like the couple of options that continuously came up were early stages of dementia or just general old age forgetfulness. her behaviour, in my opinion, seems like it's worse than just general old age forgetfulness. i was hoping that some of you could share your stories of when you started noticing signs of dementia in your loved one(s). i know a diagnoses from the doctor is best, but i would also like to know about others experiences as well. thanks in advance!"," one thing that is always recommended is a plain old physical, with a standard panel of diagnostic tests, including urinalysis to check for bladder infection.for some reason, bladder infections in older people sometimes (or maybe even often) don't have the usual symptoms and discomfort, but having an untreated infection can drag down one's whole system, including mental aspects.not to mention that problems with other systems, for instance insulin resistance, undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, thyroid issues, for some examples, can have an impact on energy levels, motivation, etc.good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/88z7xu/detecting_early_signs_of_dementia/,Detecting early signs of dementia.

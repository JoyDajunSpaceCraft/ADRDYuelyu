[deleted]," really, in the whole scheme of things, this is of minor importance to the families who are living with and caring for a dementia patient. giving somebody a label is not ignoring them, it's accurately identifying them as having specific needs.dementia, in all its guises, is a ghastly condition that hurts the families probably more than the sufferer because they at least have the benefit of a very short memory. you will see your clients (or your patients) in very controlled surroundings and they'll be with you for a reason - inpatient care - and whilst there you can pretty-up the terms all you like, but these nice words won't hide a brutal and harsh reality.step into the outside world, the one that most families with a relative who has dementia have to live in, and you'll soon learn it's very different.maybe you truly believe that a 'dementia friendly community' is the way forwards, but if i were to try letting my mil loose 'in the community' she could not cope.on a shopping street she has to be held onto because she has no sense of danger, much the same as a toddler, and if she sees something she 'likes' on the opposite pavement will walk into the road without a moment's hesitation.she is incapable of using a shopping list, finds supermarkets visually confusing because there are too many small patches of bright colours on the shelves, has no recall and so does not even recognise the items that are in her shopping basket - even though she's chosen to put them there - and no longer recognises the face value of modern currency. she will hand a cashier a £20 note thinking it's £1 and has no concept of the value of coins because she's back living in the times of £sd (pounds, shillings, pence). she has to use cash because she no longer remembers her pin number.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6c6gxv/does_anyone_else_get_bothered_by_the_phrase/,"Does anyone else get bothered by the phrase ""dementia patients""?"
"hello r/dementia!i am from austria, and i have a degreee in what is called ""socialcare with main focus on eldery care"" (loosely translated). people with my degree get a two year training in nursing (which means i am basically trained for everything that contains eating, mobilisation, cleaning, observing, incontinence, reacting in emergency situations, giving medication and a lot more), with an extra focus on the eldery and the diseases that come with old age - diabetes, strokes, arthritis, and especially, dementia. i am trained in different theories about dementia, i know the pure medical definition, i am trained in validation by naomi feil and other approaches of the disease, like the tree-worlds-model from switzerland. we learn how to understand dementia-patients and how to support them on their way, and make it easier. i am well aware that many of those who care for their relatives have no clue of how to deal with difficult behaviour. how should they if nobody told them? dementia is hard for those who have it, but also very hard for the wifes or husbands, for the kids and grandkids that care for dementia patients. that's why i wanted to make an ama. you can ask me anything, on the medical side, but also on how to deal with different aspects of the disease and how to deal with diffucult behaviour. i can also give insights on what may cause some of the strange things dementia patients do.i will try to explain everything as good as i can. "," hi i am full time carer of my mother with dementia. level ?????if allowed she will escape, locks on all gates and front door always locked, my current problem, flooring. brand new carpet before she moved in 19mths ago. had them cleaned 3 times since. looking into just polished floor broads in her bedroom, bedroom is the only place with carpet, on the coast of adelaide, australia, so not really cold here, simply put no frost. urox has stopped the bed wetting, still not sold on the product. she has even killed the carpet in the spare bedroom( found a stain , 2 weeks after her bedroom carpets cleaned), i've got nightlights in her bedroom and in the laundry, which is right next to the toilet. adult diapers, she now wears really don't help much. it's a incontinence/dementia problem, ask her she never pees the bed let alone the floor. if you don't laugh, you cry. i try to be a glass half full kinda person re not negative but if that half glass is full of bourbon the better.

"i posted a couple of months ago about my volunteer piano playing at a dementia facility. i am now well underway and learning quite a bit and it has been very successful, with a few exceptions. i will explain and then i hope you might have some ideas. please do not be afraid about hurting my feelings--i wouldn't be doing this work if i couldn't handle myself.first, let me say that i play a yamaha clavinova at home, and they have different upright pianos in every lodge at the facility, and they are all pretty out of tune, with rough action on the keys (meaning they may not repeat properly or sound at the same volume with the same pressure). the yamaha has a very gentle and sensitive touch, so at home i am spoilt with a piano that is easy to play. the bottom line is that i make more errors when i play at the lodges. it seems to me that my audience suffers worse when i make errors than perhaps the average audience. do you think that is true? do you have insight? i guess to myself it is because if they remember a song they want to hear it the way they remember it--without mistakes.so, because i am worried about making mistakes and coping with these old keyboards, i will sometimes slow down. i am pretty sure that my rhythm problems are super annoying to the audience members. as you may be able to imagine, often behind me (the pianos are up flat against the wall, so my back is to almost everybody) there will be people clapping in rhythm, singing along (or 16 bars previous) or vocalising to the melodies they remember. there may also be people screaming at the singers or at somebody else who is making noise they don't like. bottom line, i remind myself that being able to perform under these conditions is pretty good, even for an amateur such as myself. another thing i have noticed is that it seems the audience members really like the peppy songs much better than what i would describe as 'lounge piano' songs. do you think this is pretty common with folks with dementia?at this point i am going to do a few things to alter my work. i am going to only perform songs that i have practiced enough to be flawless. i am also practicing at home with the metronome in the electric keyboard, and marking each song with the rate that i think sounds good and is slow enough for me to be able to play. i am also going to download a metronome app on my phone and try putting it one ear bud while i play so i have something helping me keep proper time besides the variety of claps and voices i hear around me. what do you think of these ideas?also, i think repetition of the songs from week to week is helpful, particularly once i know that many audience members recognise the song. testing this out has been an adventure because i am from the usa and these are people aged 50's through 90's in australia. i am often quite surprised at what songs they do know and what songs they don't. i have had a request for more al jolson! i can oblige that.a couple of other things i plan to do are to drop down to just the melody if i make an error, rather than slowing down, and to photocopy the third and higher page of each song so i do not have to turn pages while i play. the music stands on these uprights make page turning an adventure, and i will often lose a beat, and i'm sure you see my problem.it may sound like i am fishing for compliments with this post--i am not. i wonder if any of you have similar experiences about the desire for peppy rhythms, the desire to clap along, and frustration when rhythm is not maintained. i also wonder if you have insight about how these issues affect humans with dementia.thank you for reading this and my very best to you in navigating your experience of dementia, however that may connect to your life.", i asked for help and some of the audience banged rhythm for me. i played slower simpler songs. i need to remember to collaborate with them just like i collaborate with staff. i am also going to work hard to get better free pianos in each lodge. thank god for freecycle.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6budue/request_for_help_in_understanding_the_importance/,Request for help in understanding the importance of rhythm to folks with dementia.

"my mom was so smart. she was abd from a ph.d. she read obsessively. she pushed us kids to do as best as we could in school.she lives 1000 miles away and i am poor, with no resources to see her (including family). i am trying to save money but it took me three years to save up for the last time i saw her, two years ago.she's in her mid-80s and she's clearly entering the middle stage of alzheimer's. she was formally diagnosed with the early stage about four years ago.  when i last saw her she had short-term memory problems but her long-term memory seemed fine.now it's all going. she recently had to make a temporary apartment switch in the same building, and for some reason she keeps thinking she's moved to another city. but then a bit later she realizes she's thinking badly.she's forgetting her past. she fights with the care worker about getting out of bed and taking a shower.  she'll forget to eat if not reminded, but, ironically, she seems to be feeding her cat many more times a day than he needs. it doesn't help that she has a long, long history of hiding her health issues from me. when i talk to her she sometimes tries to pretend that she doesn't have alzheimer's and that i don't know about it.i doubt i will be able to see her again before she forgets who i am. i suspect she's getting closer to needing a memory unit in an assisted living place.as my family has shut me out, i am terrified for the day that i find out after the fact that she's gone.thanks for reading.", bless you. i am so sorry. everything is pretty hard on planet earth these days so please don't be harder on yourself. phone calls count no matter what she remembers.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6blhqd/rant_slipping_away_from_a_thousand_miles/,[Rant] Slipping away from a thousand miles

"i'm 20 and i've felt pretty normal but i've had an issue with remembering things. for example when i see that i have completely watched a youtube video i can remember the title and the thumbnail but i can't recall what the content is about exactly, sometimes i even rewatch a video and all i hear is new information. i wouldn't even be able to give a small summary of the video. i forget things i saw last week. if i were ever questioned by the police and they'd ask: ""where were you 2 weeks ago on tuesday"" i'd have no idea. i also have a problem where i type a sentence and in my mind i've typed it perfectly but when i look back at it a couple hours later the sentence doesn't make as much sense or i used a completely wrong word.i just cooked some burgers and left a small mess in the kitchen and when i returned to the kitchen i totally forgot what i had left exactly and it feels like i haven't been there for hours.i'm 99% sure i'm hugely overestimating this but i'm scared."," stress and lack of sleep are common reasons for all these sort of things happening, so does having a busy schedule and not much time to think.people remember things in different ways. here are some examples - my other half knows actors names, all their roles, film titles, and the whole story. i can watch something to half way through and suddenly realise i've seen it before - which makes me feel rather pathetic. i'm hopeless with names, so have to repeat somebody's name when introduced otherwise i won't know it a few minutes later. this isn't something new, i've always been like it. yet give me a book and i'll instantly know i've read it before - the title is enough.ask two people to recall an event and they'll give different tales, because that's the way memory works. police etc rely on this and use different witnesses to build up a complete picture of an event. you may not remember 'the day' but something would trigger your memory for something important.try not to stress. you're fine. get some sleep!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6bcnsq/im_scared/,I'm scared

"my grandmother has been suffering from dementia for the past 3-4 years and it's progressively getting worse and worse. at first she was very aggressive, we had to lock her inside to be sure she won't do anything, she would open the fridge, turn on the tap, turn on the oven, she has been verbally abusing us, shame us, yell at us...the prescribed medications sometimes wouldn't even calm her a bit. right now she has basically the mind of a 2 year old kid, she barely speaks, mostly replies with yes and no's. you have to force her to eat anything that is not meat, sometimes i force feed her. she has urinary and fecal incontinence. i've been trying to explain to my father that she has to wear diapers all the time (he only put her diapers at night), because he thinks it's way easier to remind her to go to the toiled every half an hour. sometimes we bath her three times a day. she has also recently found out a way to take her diapers off and tear them off. sometimes she goes half naked outside. yesterday i was alone with her, she had to go to the toiled, but was too late. she had pooped in herself, i was yelling at her maybe for 10 minutes to take her clothes off so i can bath her, she tried to get a hold on me, but i pushed her away from me and she fell down on the tiles, everything was covered in feces, she managed to drag herself to the hall somehow, i was waiting for my dad to come for hour and a half so he can lift her as she is way to heavy and doesn't know how to rock herself up. he bathed her, i started cleaning everything, took the carpets out washed them, bleached them, pour hot water over them, repeated the same thing on the rest of the dirty place. today my boyfriend was here, we were having a lunch, right before i finish my meal she gets ups to go to the toiled, i set the food aside and go to see what is she doing, the couch, the other carpet, the wood it's all covered in feces, i go inside the toiled and i see her trying to wash her hands, she has pooped right before the sink. at this point i'm starting to loose my sanity, i swear i didn't care that my boyfriend is there, i started crying and yelling at her again to take her clothes off so i can shower her. i am having a breakdown i can't believe i will have to clean the whole thing all over again. my grandmother will not go to shower unless you assault her. i slapped her face, because she doesn't wanna listen, then my dad woke up from all the yelling and i start yelling at him to put diapers on her once already. again cleaning, bleaching, hot water...it's 2 am right now, i've been crying all day, i can't believe what am i doing, i am abusing her, i am hitting her. i have no strength to deal with this anymore. i used to hate my grandmother, she was abusive and she used to hate me, before she suffered from dementia. most days i feel very sorry for her, sometimes she stares at me with such a delusion when i yell at her and gives me that innocent child look that asks what have i done wrong? i understand that this is not her fault and she doesn't know any better. if someone told me before 5 years ago that i would feel sorry for my grandmother i would laugh, i loathed her, but watching her loosing her dignity this way was heartbreaking. i don't know how we will endure this, i feel so bad for my dad having to deal with this, he has been so nervous. i can't stand the yelling every morning, i haven't had a proper sleep since november. i am sick of this all and i feel like an abuser, i just want it to be over. i'm going to move out of the country soon. how will i let my father alone with this? this is so traumatic, we can't do it any longer. sorry this is probably all messy, but i just wanted to vent, i can't think straight today."," yes, you are abusing your grandmother.remember that it's not her fault. do you think she would want to soil herself if she didn't have dementia? she doesn't understand, and you yelling at her and hitting her isn't going to make her understand- it's going to make her anxious and upset.she needs to be in a care home.failing that, at the very least buy some adult diapers for her.i know that it's frustrating and difficult for you, but she simply doesn't understand what she's doing. she might not know where the toilet is, she might not even recognise it as a toilet.you *cannot* keep hitting her and yelling at her. you just can't. you need help. today.

"my dad passed away from cancer 3 years ago, around that time i noticed a decline in my mom's memory and her behavior started to change. at first, i thought she was simply in mourning, but as her problems became more severe, i took her to see a doctor. sure enough, she has early onset dementia (she's only 55). i am 23 years old and i live in a different state then her. despite this fact, i am on the phone with her for hours a day, and i am the one who talks to all of her doctors, schedules appointments, and reminds her of them. she has been living alone. my sister lives in the same state as her, but shows no interest in helping to take care of my mom. along with all of her doctors, i have been trying to convince her to accept the help of a caregiver or to move to an assisted living facility. she wants neither. she has also refused to give me poa. a few days ago aps came to her house and took her to the hospital because they say she is unsafe to be living alone. she is still adamant about avoiding an assisted living facility, but seems to be more willing to accept a caregiver in her home, although she still talks about hiring a lawyer to sue aps and the hospital because she thinks she doesn't need any care.my sister wants to move in with my mom, but this idea really has me worried. my sister is 19 and acts pretty selfishly. she wants to move in with my mom because she needs a place to stay over the summer. she has no real intention of caring for her and i know it because i've seen her behavior in the past. she easily becomes frustrated with my mom and refuses to help her clean, make food, or even change a lightbulb. i am only 23 and i have plans to travel in the near future. partly i feel guilty because i know my mom wants to be with family and she doesn't want to have strangers take care of her. i am just so young and not prepared to move back in with my mom and become a full time caregiver. early onset is so hard on families, especially because my mom is a widow so us children are the only family she has to help. i don't know what to do, i feel like i am suddenly facing the decision to give up on my dreams and become a caregiver for my mom for what could potentially be decades. i am trying to decide how to best handle this situation and what next steps should be. any advice or insight is greatly appreciated", you might find this article helpful:,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6938wj/mom_has_early_onset_dementia_next_steps/,"mom has early onset dementia, next steps"

"part i of this post here:  so i finally talked my mom into seeing a doctor about her memory issues (finding words, leaving the stove on, etc).  she saw an ear/nose/throat doc and they did a ct scan of her brain and some blood tests for urea or something.  they didn't find any infection in the sinuses or other abnormalities on the scan.  she was prescribed prednisone and sent home.  the ent was thorough and didn't sound too concerned about her memory issues but agreed to refer her to a neurologist if the meds didn't clear it up.  what's weird is that, while my mom was on prednisone for 10 days, her mood and memory improved *markedly*.  she wasn't mixing up words or forgetting to do important things.  she was just generally sharper.  not manic or abnormally elated, just normal.  the 3rd day after she went off the prednisone, she was mixing up words again (she said: ""i spent an arm and a *load*"" twice instead of ""an arm and a leg"" in conversation and wasn't aware she said it when i told her later).  then today she left the stove on all day again.  ugh  :\i was so relieved when the medication improved her symptoms, now it feels like we're back to square one.  **would dementia respond that dramatically to steroids, or is it likely something else causing her memory issues?**  she goes back to the ent this thursday but i don't think much will come of it.  i don't think she even had a legit sinus infection or blockage according to the ct scan, so i don't know why the prednisone would've helped her function so much better.  she does have constant post-nasal drainage.  could allergies be affecting her memory?  i'm really spinning my wheels trying to figure this out.  she has depression that gets worse in the summer, as well as adhd and sleep apnea.  and she was pre-diabetic 10 years ago and has only gained weight since then.  so there's a lot going on.    any ideas appreciated.  i'm planning to make her follow up with the neurologist if i can (she's stubborn and hates doctors) but i'd rather not let my ocd get the best of me in the meantime.  thanks!"," an ent is the last physician that should have anything to do with diagnosing and treating dementia.   they are wholly unqualified and untrained in this disease category.   if your mom balks at seeing a neurologist, try a gerontologist. dontrunreds is correct.

"i work with dementia patients and one has type 1 diabetes.this person can have some outbursts and get rather upset, which is somewhat normal in dementia anyway. i know that having out of range blood sugars can make someone emotional.so does anyone care for someone with type 1, and have you found any link between blood sugar and their dementia?thanks. :)"," hi,i do not specifically work with individuals with type 1 diabetes but i do work with people who live with various dementias and i also have a degree in dementia studies.outbursts and getting upset are usually the individuals way of communicating to you that something is wrong. i can't say what is wrong, and the difficulty is the individual may not be able to either. if this person has type 1 diabetes then i would assume they are having regular insulin injections  (usually daily) and are having their blood sugars monitored on a regular basis, so if the individual was feeling poorly due to their diabetes it should be fairly easy to find out. your first step when this individual is upset would be to check their glucose levels and respond accordingly, and see if this improves the persons mood. unfortunately it is very trial and error.if their levels are normal or they do not seem happier once treatment is received, it would be safe to assume there is another cause. this could be anything from pain, needing the bathroom, being tired, having an infection, or a stone in their shoe. it could even be (if this is a continuing issue) issues with communication such as hearing and sight. unfortunately as i said before, it is very much trial and error. with pain it can help to ask if specific areas of the body hurt such as ""does your head/back/arm/foot hurt?"" whilst gently touching the area you mention. if you know that individual may have pain in one area (i.e. they've recently had a fall/have known arthritis etc) then giving a low dose of a basic pain killer and monitoring for improvement in mood is a good idea.having outbursts or getting upset is often also a sign of frustration. do these outbursts happen at particular times? it may be that the individual doesn't understand what is happening. this has turned into a mini essay so i'll stop now, but if you have any questions feel free to message me and i'll do my best to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/68aoh2/anyone_got_experience_with_type_1_diabetes_and/,Anyone got experience with Type 1 diabetes and Dementia?

," had my 1st gig! it went just beautifully. in a low-density dementia wing with an old out of tune player piano. brought 3 books & my grandma's wool-batted quilt and pulled the piano out and hung the blanket to dampen the wonky sound. i probably had a dozen to 20 residents in and out during the hour, and at one point there were at least 4 dancing and probably a half a dozen sang along. one lady had a great voice and remembered so many lyrics. i asked the volunteer supervisor if lola had been reading over my shoulder and she told me she was facing the other direction and dancing as she sang.it was really really fun to feel them relate to the songs as i was playing. it makes me want to expand my repertoire by thousands of songs. things you've heard sung by barbershop quartets did great, and 50's moon songs--moonglow, moon river, blue moon. late 20's stuff. things that would have been heard when these people were very young or basically the stuff that their parents listened to. i played some 60's like raindrops keep fallin on my head and didn't get much traction. a couple of wwi war songs were known by absolutely everybody and it was australia's memorial day yesterday. my guess is that the wwi songs became absolutely entrenched in the collective memory when australia participated in wwii.i need to annotate my book right away with what songs they really liked. my staff person said she had never seen some of these folks so lively. i hope i didn't overstimulate any of them. i performed for a solid hour from 2:30 to 3:30 in the afternoon.so, there you have it. thanks to the moon for all your helpful suggestions and encouragement. i did try to keep my pace in time with their singing voices, and i repeated some songs over and over. as i get more comfortable accompanying voice (it was basically how i performed on the keyboards as a student and as an amateur at my church in usa) i should be able to recover when they slip a part of the song so they can keep going from where they are. it really was mind-blowing some of the lyrics these folks were singing along.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/65sh1q/question_i_will_be_playing_piano_in_a_dementia/,"Question: I will be playing piano in a dementia care lodge in Australia.

"grateful to have found this group, i have been trying to find actionable advice for quite some time in how to improve our situation. apologies in advance for the novel of a post...my mother started showing signs of memory loss about 5 years ago, about two years ago things took a turn for the worse. in the past year we have clearly passed a point of no-return with her condition drastically deteriorating week by week.about 9 months ago she went for a cognitive evaluation, and also received an mri to look at her brain function. while the mri did not pick up anything the doctors did note via the cognitive tests that she had impaired memory. they recommended that she see a psychologist and get her affairs in order.which brings us to the issue i’m sure many here have experienced, and could really use some advice on: whenever the recommendation is not what she wants it to be she goes completely negative.in her mind, the doctors do not know what they’re talking about and are uncaring. in her mind, my father and i do not love her and think she’s stupid and losing her mind. in short, her reality is that everything is terrible. if we offer a solution, she only has reasons why it will not work or is a bad idea.recently, this has escalated from her not understanding or remembering the truth over to her making up her own reality. she shows up with medicines and lotions she says i gave her. whole conversations are remembered with the converse outcome. she is often disoriented and i haven’t had a clear conversation with her in years.my father feels that big changes need to occur as well. he is retiring by jun 30th in order to spend more time caring for her, however she often becomes aggressive and combative with him and will storm out of the house. he is committed to trying to find the best way to care for her, but as a third party i see and am concerned by the effect this is having on his own health.the crux of the matter is that my mother will not accept the reality of what is happening (she still thinks that she has the ability to drive 6 hours to see a friend in a city she never visits, while she gets disoriented in the city she has lived in for the majority of her life).she will not accept my help in menial tasks such as cleaning out the house (she hoards items) or in developing a care plan for her.i'm at a loss of how to overcome her combativeness so i can organize resources to care for both her and my dad.**tl;dr: does anyone have insight on how they overcame this initial hurdle of getting their parent to acknowledge your concern is because you care for them, and in turn getting them to accept your help?**edit: formatting"," i know this is a hard time for you.  with your mother, i'd say you just step in - trying to get agreement is pointless.  the person who needs to accept your help is your dad - try to help him avoid burnout.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/65s6mi/new_here_could_use_some_help_how_did_you_overcome/,"New here, Could use some help: How did you overcome hurdle of convincing your parent to allow you to help them?"

"(sorry for the length here, just trying to show how quickly this all happened!)so my poppa is almost 80, and in the past year or two he has had some signs of his memory failing. most often he forgets to eat (my mom or aunt usually will take him out for lunch, but he has gotten very skinny) and he has had a thing with figuring out what all of his 25 or so keys go to, every morning. more recently he's had trouble with falling asleep in his easy chair, waking up and not knowing what time it is. his companion is the anchor point for this; she calls every night at 9pm to tell him to go to bed. then he knows when he wakes up it's the next day.this all changed on saturday. my parents were supposed to pick him up at 1pm at his house to go to a mall about an hour away. he showed up at my parents house at 6am, and scared the shit out of my dad. he said he had been up since 1am shoveling the driveway and plowing  snow for his neighbor. there was less than an inch of snow on the ground in northern ny. on the way to the mall, he was saying how he's been talking to his mother (who died probably 60 years ago), and started talking about how people are following him. he thinks that his neighbor across the street is a member of this secret police, watching him all the time.when they get back from the mall, he drives to my aunt's camp. basically to get from his house to her cottage he has to go up his street, turn left onto the highway, and turn right into her road. it's about a 10 minute drive. when he's leaving, he somehow got turned around and was driving up a walking trail at like 9 at night. (no walkers thankfully, they close at sunset!). he gets to my uncle's house at who knows what time and is saying how the police are after him and all this, my uncle calls the city police station and asks if they are looking for my poppa. they said no.then on sunday, he is all upset saying that his neighbors are going to put something in his gas tank so he can't go anywhere. my aunt agrees to let him park his truck at her house for the night, and she brings him back to his house (about 8 blocks away, around 7 pm.) about an hour later he shows up at her house again, he walked the whole way. she goes ""what are you doing here??"" and he said he just came to hang out. she says, ""we just brought you home, remember? your truck is here for the night."" so then he starts seeing people again and cars going by are all people trying to get him and he is all upset saying ""they"" won't let him leave. he has had similar conversations with my mom in the past few days. my aunt finally take him to camp again, where he says ""now they can't get me because i'll see them coming in the day time."" this continued into monday. my mom and aunt couldn't get him into his doctor until wednesday, but even then... this doctor is apparently anti medicine (holistic?) and may not do anything to help anyway. he goes there pretty regularly but insists on going alone and does not tell the truth about his symptoms. my mom and aunt are planning on taking him to the emergency room though, if they feel this doctor is not providing the care my poppa clearly needs.my mom and aunt are completely at a loss and pretty devastated to boot. can this happen? can he slip so quickly in a matter of days into this? the only thing we can think of is a ""snap"" due to his companion/anchor being out of town for a few days."," the hallucinations  and paranoia, plus the up and down mental state makes me immediately  think of lewy body dementia.  that's  likely the kind a relative  of mine had.  i would caution  you to get his general  health checked out right away with the sudden decline.  my relative  went from, ""yeah maybe that's  a touch of dementia"" to noticeable moderate  stages of dementia in the matter of a couple days when they became very ill.  later, when they recovered it was back to mild dementia.  in any case, co-occurring  illnesses  can really diminish someone's  mental state.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/63eyth/grandpa_sliding_downhill_fast_like_3_days_fast/,"Grandpa sliding downhill fast-- like, 3 days fast."

"my grandmother just turned 82. physically, she's doing much better than the average 82 year old is doing. she goes to the gym and never learned to drive so takes the bus and walks everywhere. however, my family suspects that mentally, she's not doing so great. my grandfather passed away 20 years ago this year, and she's been living alone in a condo for around 15.  about 12 years ago, she had a depressive episode and stayed with my aunt for a few weeks. she seemed to be out of her mind, and everyone thought she was having a stroke. the doctor said it was high blood pressure mixed with depression. she's been taking medicine ever since.recently, she's been acting a bit more strangely than usual. she calls my aunt to tell her about the problems she has with her downstairs neighbors being too loud. she calls about her door not working. and various other problems. but when we try to remedy them by having her move somewhere else, or checking out her condo or door, there don't actually seem to be any problems. she also has been having angry outbursts that are not characteristic of her at all and behavioral problems when we go to family functions. she's always embellished stories a little bit, but never flat-out told lies like this before. we suspect that there's an onset of dementia as my grandmother has an older sister who has dementia (it's so bad that she doesn't recognize the family anymore and needs constant care from my great uncle). my family is korean, so even if my grandma goes out on a daily basis, she isn't really having much human interaction, as she doesn't know enough english to hold an engaging conversation. she has hardly any stimulation, as she usually just watches tv, cooks, knits, reads books over and over again, reads the korean newspapers we bring her, and then goes out to go to her biweekly swim class. she's been doing this for the past 10 years, and even thinking of myself doing this same routine, i think i would go crazy as well.i think that having someone to talk to would greatly alleviate this (though obviously not fully cure it), but as i said, she only speaks korean. my aunt tries to meet with her when she can, but she's a small business owner and works 7 days a week. my father also tries to meet with her when he can, but he's also extremely busy with work and does all the housework as well, as my mother works even more. my cousins don't really speak enough korean to go visit her often (though we do have family gatherings maybe once a month). and though i speak a little more korean than they do, i was out of state for college and might be leaving for graduate school again in the fall. i also can't speak enough korean to really intellectually stimulate her and can't visit her every day.my family has discussed multiple times moving her into a retirement community. there are even korean ones around the area. however, she doesn't want to move into a community, as she thinks it'll curb her independence, as she is able-bodied to get around by herself. and she also hates socializing with other koreans, so we can't get her to go to korean senior activities clubs or anything like that. edit: oh, and forget about assisted living. she would hate to have someone come to her house. i suggested seeing a counselor, just so she has someone to talk to. however, seeking mental health is still a huge stigma in korea, and she keeps insisting that she's ""not crazy"" so why would she go see a doctor. we're just at a loss for what to do. my dad and aunt are kind of at their wits' end and are getting annoyed at her frequent phone calls. they know that she just wants a conversation, but most of the conversation just is her complaining about some problem that doesn't exist. i had a little more faith in her and was wondering if she was telling the truth and tried to check some things out, but sometimes she tells stories that just completely contradict each other, so i might just be having a hard time accepting the truth that she is mentally slipping. anyways, my dad and aunt, though they've lived in america for a majority of their lives, are pretty korean and also don't really have a good grasp on mental health. they also just have no clue about the resources available to them. i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for what to do in this kind of situation. i know a lot of people have problems trying to get their aging parent or grandparent to get the help that they need, but i feel like there's another layer here because my grandmother is korean and can't really communicate with anyone here besides my aunt and my dad. we haven't really come across many korean doctors in the area, nonetheless korean mental health professionals. i also was wondering if anyone has any tips on helping her keep her brain active while we work on a longer-term solution. i know there are tons of apps out there that are aimed at keeping the mind active, but again, she can't read or speak english, and she also is just completely unfamiliar with technology. we got her a smartphone and set it to korean language so that she might find some books on there or text us if she wants to talk to someone, but even after teaching her multiple times, she can't use it.thank you for listening. any suggestion or even words of encouragement would help."," op, most hospitals in large cities have translators. can your family arrange to have her visit a doctor for an evaluation, and make sure there's a translator?  if nothing else, you can get a baseline for the doctor to measure how she's progressing.she must be a tough independent woman to have been able to create a life for herself when she's not fluent in the language.can your family members skype with her every week?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/62xmfo/nonenglishspeaking_grandmother_showing_signs_of/,Non-English-speaking grandmother showing signs of dementia and no one knows how to help
"about 2 years ago my grandmother was officially diagnosed with alzheimer’s. my grandmother has been living with my mom and dad for about 9 years’ total at this point (she moved up to pa to be with us after my grandfather died, they were from tx).&amp;nbsp;my mom does not have a great relationship with her mother, never really has. my grandmother always was spiteful and angry that my mom wanted her to move up to pa (my grandmother was not able to keep living alone in tx after my grandfather died...)&amp;nbsp;when i was a kid my grandmother was my favorite person in the world. she always had a personality that was attention seeking, but i loved her and cherished our time together. she was beautiful, and artistic, and always doing exciting things. she was kind to me. i *can* understand when my mom tells me that growing up with her was not easy… but as it always goes, the grandkids always seem to get the best of people.&amp;nbsp; unfortunately, after my grandfather died, my grandmother cultivated a pretty intense mean streak (my mother says she always had this, but it got much worse). she would be passive aggressive and catty non-stop, mumble very mean things under her breath.  i still love her… but i began to not want to be around her (this began when she was still mentally good). i have a great deal of guilt over feeling this way, but it is reality. i do still try to spend time with her, and to sit with her, and before she got bad we would go out to eat sometimes. i have durable power of attorney for her that she signed over some years ago. i got it when she was having trouble keeping her bills straight, and i was always her favorite grandchild so i stepped up to the plate to help.&amp;nbsp;a little backstory on my mother: she is the most loving, kind, and strong person i know, but she also has ptsd from a bad thing that happened to my family about 5 years ago. she copes with taking care of my grandmother poorly (we also always have an abundance of regular family drama, as well… so that doesn’t help things). when she gets too stressed she shuts down mentally and has  terrible stomach cramps. i know my mom loves my grandmother deep down… but when i tell you my grandmother has been cruel to her for almost 7 years at this point (or longer)… it drains the life out of her. she continues to care for my grandmother day and night because she wants to honor her fathers (my grandfathers) memory by doing what she thinks is right. my mom has basically been a prisoner in her home for the past 2 years because she is afraid to leave my grandmother alone. my grandmother has almost started fires before, let the dogs run away, but now she mostly does things like flood the bathroom or get poop everywhere… or eat things off the floor.&amp;nbsp; my grandmother just recently became almost fully incontinent. i can hear the stress and pain in my mother’s voice when we talk on the phone. my mom lies to me though, and tries to play it off like it doesn’t affect her as much as it really does. for example, i know she was up at 1am last night cleaning diarrhea from the entire bathroom and my grandmother because my grandmother had an accident and forgot how to wipe properly.&amp;nbsp; i am thinking this is progressing to the point of putting my grandmother in a nursing facility… but i am so overwhelmed. everything falls on me to figure out and i think i inherited some of that “stress shutdown” because i am having a hard time trying to figure out a plan. when i mention this to my mother, she starts telling me “no nursing home”, and that she will just keep taking care of my grandmother. i think she says this out of guilt, and fear of the unknown, or fear that a nursing facility will hurt my grandmother. from the ptsd she lives in a constant state of trying to avoid fear triggering and confrontation, sometimes to the point of absurdity. i am watching my mother get worse and worse as the stress of being a caretaker is eating her alive… and i don’t know what to say to her. i don’t want to lose my mom, because she is killing herself taking care of my grandmother who at this point, mostly doesn’t exist anymore.&amp;nbsp; i would like some advice if there is any to be had. any ideas for how to approach this with my mom? i have suggested going to a support group or something before… but she refuses. this stuff stresses her out so much she tries to avoid dealing with it any more than she absolutely has to. my grandmother has a little over 120k left in savings. i know my family is going to most likely need more than this to care for her until her death. the situation gets complicated, because my aunt (my grandmother’s other child) is a truly bad person who has leeched money from my grandparents and manipulated them her entire life. i know she is going to be an issue after my grandmother dies no matter what because my grandmother’s will stipulates that my aunt gets half of her assets upon death (money and belongings) … however i don’t think there will be any money left after this disease rages on, we'll probably be in debt. i have the durable power of attorney so i know *i* am the one going to be sued no matter what… but i’ll bite that bullet when i have to (my grandmother’s care and mother’s health come first).&amp;nbsp; is there anything… any programs at all that can help pay for a nursing facility? i know they are ungodly expensive (especially here in pa). do medicare or medicade offer any help? i literally know close to nothing about these things (i am an ignorant millennial trying to do my best, please forgive me). all i know is my grandmother has about 120k saved, gets 1,000 social security a month, and i need to figure out how to stretch this money to try to get her in a place that is not a state-run abusive hellhole. i want this money to all go to my grandmother’s care…. it’s not for my terrible aunt to use to keep being unemployed. my grandmother does have nurse assistants that come over during the week to help my mom out, but she does not have anyone full time. do you think maybe a night nurse would be better? i don’t want to just ship my grandmother away, but at this point, my mother is who i need to save. i know stress and mental trauma can make people more likely to get this terrible disease… i want to help try to avoid this horror if i can for my mother (and myself…).&amp;nbsp;this was long and rambling… but thank any of you who have listened… and to any of you suffering from this disease i would reach out and hug you if i could. stay strong. (also if it matters my grandfather was in the national guard... i don't know of that helps with anything)"," i'm so sorry.  that's an impossibly difficult situation.  when my grandma started declining from vascular dementia, we allowed her to live at her house with a nurse that would check in on her daily.  it was what she wanted and insisted on.  she functioned relatively well at that point despite a severe stroke.  after about a year, she said she was ready to go to the nursing home to be with her husband, and so we honored that.  it really couldn't have gone any better in terms of her getting to choose how it went.  she declined quickly after that.  it was like she knew it was time to go.not all nursing homes are equally awful.  some are quite good.  you may not be able to convince your mom that that's the way to go, but eventually i fear she will have no other option.  i would begin at least exploring your options and seeing what's out there.  it's not realistic for a non-medically trained family member to take on all that responsibility by themselves for years on end.  as someone else said, dementia patients can live for years or decades.  nursing homes are expensive, so i don't know what to suggest there.  maybe some sort of part-time home nurse like my grandmother had would be a good solution for the time being so your mom could get a break?  i'm sorry, i really don't have a good practical solution.  best of luck to you.

"hi,  i am trying to find a clock or timer that is to be a reminder to my grandmother.  she often forgets to use the bathroom, and although she is in assisted living, it would be nice for her if she had a little control over something.  she is showing of dementia, and her nurses notice that she is embarrassed/hides messes when she isn't able to make it to the bathroom.  she has pants for these times, but i think her confidence may be boosted if she has something to help remind her.i've looked around amazon, but all i have found are full on alarm clocks.  dae have an idea or product that helps.  i worry if i get one where i can record a message, she may not like it saying ""try to use the bathroom"" when others are around, but i am not sure she will remember what the buzzer is for...tia"," i use this for my mom to remind her about mealtimes.    i put it on a cheap android tablet that is plugged in and always on.  it doesn't do alarms, though.  you might play around with some other apps and see if they suit you better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/60hb36/reminder_clock/,Reminder Clock
"any help or advice on helping me to understand my wife and/or helping her express herself.after many health issues over the past 7 years my 60 year old wife has been in nursing home since having a leg amputated about a year and a half ago. i started noticing memory issues about 6 months ago. i was ignored or told it was just depression until a few weeks ago when i finally got a diagnosis of vascular dementia.the biggest problem i'm having now is aphasia or she just trails off because she can't find the words. examples: today i brought in clothes i had washed and was hanging it up, she asked ""is that the heartburn diet?"" later she said ""the second shift nurse from last night found something wrong it was ....."" and trailed off because she couldn't find the words."," i'm not a professional in this field, but have worked in a facility that is focused on providing care for those with dementia/alzheimer's. when i am faced with this kind of situation during conversation with a client, i find it can be helpful to simply make conversation of the info they can give. like your example ""the second shift nurse from last night found something wrong it was ....."" could be followed up with a remark or question like ""oh dear they found something wrong? are you okay?"" or ""i hope everything is okay."" it can take some creativity to work with what you get but doing this can help the client track better and make visiting more enjoyable for both parties.

"i feel like my family is uncaring or they are just being dismissive about my feelings. or maybe i'm just stupid. i don't know. my grandmother will be 78 this year. she has needed care for the past year. one year ago she was found outside by neighbors walking around. my mother and her siblings take turn caring for her in her home. she is still cooking, cleaning, and doing basic things for herself. she is just confused a lot of the time. has crying spells. sees things that aren't there constantly. they won't tell me anything. except that the doctor thinks that it's lewy body dementia and that she is in late stages. i took a picture of her medications and posted it above. i think that this looks insane. do most people with late stage dementia get doped up so much? could any of this be reacting with the other? she hasn't seen me in over a year. she remembered me immediately and hugged me. she doesn't seem much like her old self. most of the time she sits staring off into space. i know this is kind of all over the place. my family seems to just like sit here and take care of her and that's it. when i ask questions they don't answer. have you seen another doctor? what's the prognosis? this is just it? sit here and wait till she dies? it just seems dumb to me. is that really it? we just sit here and wait? i know there isn't some magical cure that will make her normal, but it seems like everything happened so quickly. a year ago she seemed like herself. somewhat lost when you would look at her, but was able to be alone and could care for herself. i don't believe she was diagnosed at that time, but again no one will tell me anything.  it's just a really crappy thing to see happen to a woman who was so caring and strong herself. life can suck."," i forgot to add, your grandma is taking senna right now for constipation--it acts by stimulating the nerves in your bowels so they will contract.your grandma might like (but ask the doctor before giving any!!) fiberwell gummies.  you can buy them at any pharmacy.  they are gummy bears with fiber in them--your grandma thinks she's getting a treat (you said she's not a big eater right now), and she gets added fiber to help with the constipation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/608dkk/adviceinformation_wanted/,Advice/information wanted

"my mother-in-law clearly is getting/has dementia or alzheimer's.first of all, her mother had it and every symptom that i have read about it, she has. my husband agrees. my 10 yr old even knows that grandma isn't normal.she should not be driving. oh my god, she shouldn't be. when she enters a parking lot, she can't figure out how to exit it. she's gotten into a handful of fender benders and almost causes big accidents multiple times each time she drives. there are a million other reasons why she shouldn't be driving but i won't get into all of them.i don't allow her to drive my son. she babysat him like a year ago and he told me that she would ask him (a 9 yr old) if it was safe to back up in reverse.i have also been in the car with them and my son will say ""grandma, you ran a stop sign"", ""you forgot your turn signal"". (this was before i stopped letting her drive him.)she is going to get into a bad accident. i know this. hopefully she won't kill anyone.my husband has casually brought up his concerns of dementia with her and his dad. they just get mad and she barks out ""i'm not senile!"", even though that word was never brought up.she makes random comments about it too. one time my husband asked her what the name of something was. and she couldn't remember. then later on says ""oh i remembered"" and said rudely ""see- i remembered- so i must not have alzheimer's."" (even though that topic wasn't brought up in any way.) it was like she was thinking it in her head and just happened to say it out loud. like she's trying to convince her/us that she doesn't have it.another time, she randomly said that she won't get alzheimer's because she doesn't use deodorant with aluminum in it.she will run around her house all day long. literally running around in circles. on thanksgiving and xmas this past year she spent like 8 (unnecessary) hrs cooking and then when everyone eats, she forgets to eat! someone said ""lets do dessert"" and then it's like- wait- you didn't eat? she played it off but we all knew.she also does not stop talking. every thought that comes in her head, she has to verbalize it. she also does not stop humming. she also hums and talks at the same time. i didn't think that was possible but believe me, it is. i know that might sound innocuous but when it is that constant, it gets to you. try having a conversation with someone who is humming while you're talking to them. then get interrupted by her saying something (most likely off subject) and then many, many times she will just run out of the room when you're in the middle of a sentence. sorry i'm kind of venting here, i have a rocky relationship with her because i have a hard time dealing/coping with it.thanks for letting me vent. any advice on anything i mentioned would be nice. thanks, guys."," you should send her doctor a letter with the stuff you, your husband and son have noticed--especially all the driving stuff and how she can't figure out how to exit a parking lot.include how her mom had dementia and what other symptoms you have noticed.  her doctor can't talk to you about her care because of hiipa laws (unless she signs a release), but you can definitely write to him and let him know what you and your husband find concerning.regarding the previous xanax prescription--i'm not a doctor or nurse, but i suppose it could have been appropriate at the time.  when you are really anxious about stuff (and she seems to be anxious about getting her mom's dementia), it can really affect your ability to concentrate.running in circles (too much energy) and talking/humming all the time could also point to her being in a manic state of bipolar disorder.have you or your husband ever talked to your father-in-law separately from the mother-in-law?  what does he think?you can also ask the doctor to be the ""mean person"" who tells her she can't drive anymore, if he agrees she's having trouble--they are used to doing that for families.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5zpgqq/venting_about_my_motherinlaw/,Venting about my Mother-In-Law

"hi everyone.first of all, excuse my english, i'm from belgium so english is not my native language.my grandmother is in the early stages of dementia and i don't really know what to do anymore. for a while now everyone in my family has noticed my grandmother forgetting small things. the address my girlfriend works at (she still knows the company though), the name of our cat,... small things like that.when things became worse we decided it was time to have her tested. at the hospital where she did some tests it became clear she couldn't interpret time anymore. when asked what year it was she said 2013 while it was 2016 at the time.the doctor suspected alzheimer's although further testing needed to be done so we booked her an appointment for the tests a few weeks later.when the appointment approached the hospital for some stupid reason decided to call my grandmother, asking if she still wanted to go through with her appointment. so of course she says no, because she forgot what it was about and she believes the doctors are trying to pull a scam on her by having her do as many appointments as possible so they get paid alot.this of course put us quite a few steps back, as she absolutely does not want to visit the hospital to get diagnosed now.in the meantime my grandfather, who also happened to be diagnosed with kahler's disease at the meantime (cancer of the bloodcells), has to cope with my grandmother who is becoming increasingly aggressive and forgetful.every week they do groceries together and every week they bring home the same things they already have 9 of because she believes they ran out.when my grandfather points this out she becomes angry and doesn't believe him and even throws a fit right in the middle of the store.anyway, i'm drifting. i would like to know if there are any possibilities of getting my grandmother to the hospital to get a diagnose, i already know what dementia eventually does to people but i would like for my grandfather to have it easier. perhaps if she can take some meds that calm her down it would be a huge help.also if she has to be admitted to a nursing home it would be easier if she has a diagnose.it's just so hard because everytime the word doctor is pronounced she just immediately refuses any cooperation and we can't really tie her down and drag her to the hospital for tests.does anyone have some tricks?thanks for letting me vent and providing advice everyone. stay strong.", my mother takes no medication and absolutely refuses to see a doctor of any kind. i have not done this yet but it has been suggested to me that we try to get a doctor to come visit her at home.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/5z4k56/need_advice/,Need advice

"my grandmother recently entered a nursing home from living with my family full time after being diagnosed with dementia. recently, she has been coming up with delusional conspiracy theories she sees as true about the staff at the facility. these theories range anywhere from what they do with the milk she does not get to finish at meals to secret facilities the doctors have placed their loved ones several states away. i have contradicted her on occasion about her theories and tell her that they do not seem reasonable and she got quite angry with me for not believing her. i have also attempted to explain that what she discovered really isn't that big of a deal and does not need to worry about the staff's business. how have you dealt with this sort of issue?

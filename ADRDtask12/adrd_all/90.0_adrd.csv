"hi, im a 21 year old college student and this is kind of odd for me to be sharing i suppose but at this point i kind of feel as though i should reach out in some way. i work at a jewelry store in florida and my boss whom i respect greatly, has been taking care of his wife for some years now. he is the owner of the store and also the jeweler and as a result of being a small business he bears a great burden at work, home, and financially. while i believe i understand that there is little that can be done with the state of his store especially during a pandemic, i have to imagine that there is at least some feasible way out of the situation he has fallen into. he simply is losing all grip on his own life and this wonderful caring man is not well. he has no one to turn to to help him at home with his wife and has little financial ability to afford being able to keep her in any hospice. it is sad to say, but at this point in his life, he sees the only way out for his wellbeing is her passing which is unpredictable.the situation is thus. my boss does not have as much money as many would imagine a jeweler to have and his wife is becoming too much of a full time job for him to just live. he has only just recently reached out to a lawyer specializing in elderly law and he's being pushed to pay 3000 dollars a month to have her put in a facility that he doesn't have. his prospects are not bright. are there absolutely any resources that this man can pull from to help himself out that an older man might not be aware of or stubborn to use? i simply wish the best for him as he has been kind to me and if i can even just suggest some sort of solution to help him get his wife out of his home and into a place where she can be taken care of thats reasonable financially, that would be great. but i too am skeptical due to his unique situation. i just hope someone here might have some sort of experience in any matter relating to this."," i’d recommend you help your boss join a local support group! they’re all on zoom now so he may even be able to join non-local groups (i did!). the group has been a life-saver to my sister and i as we care for my single father with dementia. the folks in the group are going through similar things and have provided us with a ton of invaluable suggestions and recommendations having gone through this themselves. i think it would also be helpful to your boss emotionally, but it really is such a valuable resource for information as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lrnlyn/my_bosss_wife_has_dementia_and_hes_caring_for_her/,My boss's wife has dementia and he's caring for her by himself.

"my father has finally been diagnosed with alzheimer's but appears to be in denial. he is in hospital under section but it's hard work for him to accept what the hospital staff are telling him. he refuses to take one of the pills. he keeps saying 'i'm not crazy'. his heart rate is very slow and so he can't really take the full dose of the medicine he needs as they also slow the heart rate down so he is on a micro dose. on this, he is quite lucid. he actually phoned us today to tell us that when he gets home he is going to have a really big meal and he is looking forward to it. it broke my heart. he is not coming home. he doesn't seem to know.we had a meeting with hospital staff last week and they said we would not be able to manage at home. he won't take the pill he should, he didn't agree to home help, he refuses to shower and he keeps wandering. when he was still at home, he kept trying to leave at night and got angry if we didn't let him so we had to let him then we called the police (which they told us to do).it's hard because i think if it was me, i would want to be at home however i would not want to cause my family stress by having to constantly watch me because i would keep wandering off. today felt like a very difficult day as he is 'alert' today. he was concerned for me and my mum and wanted to know how we were coping without him there. he wanted to know his bank statement amount... all 'normal' stuff. how do you deny someone so lucid the chance to be in their home that they worked for all their life?were you in a similar situation? how did you deal with this?"," hi, perspective of a caregiver here. i work with dementia patients at an assisted living facility. it's hard on everyone involved when you make these decisions. i can tell you that dementia patients are usually frozen at a point in their life, they might think they're back in high school, for example. because of this, their biggest obsession is ""going home"" when they're sundowning, having a moodswing, or are agitated/anxious.the best thing you can possibly due to make it easier on them is to visit them as much as you can, either in person or over video or the phone. if you can't do that, send them lots of cards and goodies. it really makes them feel good to get letters from their family, they walk around with them, show them off, and read them over and over. i always make a point to stop and read whatever cards or letters they show me. it really lifts their spirits. sadly, some families don't communicate at all, and that really has an impact on the resident.edit: cleaned up that giant run on sentence in the first paragraph lol. i also wanna add:many families seem surprised by this, but we do not remind residents that they have dementia, that they are so-and-so years old, or worse, that their dad, mom, or spouse are dead. all it does is upset them and make them unhappy, and they just forget it later. with dementia patients, we focus on making them happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lrhhum/how_did_you_break_the_news_to_your_family_member/,How did you break the news to your family member that they would be going into a home?

"i hear of all these hero’s on here...taking on the impossible...the stories that are happening and the heroics you are doing. then i think how it is going with my mom and i feel like i am the worst person in the world. my husband and i both work full time and travel for our jobs so we are not here much. my mom is living with my aunt (her sister) and things are good some days bad others. the issue is my mom isn’t calm, or nice, or pleasant. she is combative, angry, mean and refuses to cooperate if you tell her to do something (even if posed as a request etc) like take her meds. every request is taken as a demand and turns into a match of wills.so today there was a big argument over mom cleaning her room...the day spiraled out of control and at the restaurant mom threatened to beat jo up...jo called the squad because she has had enough and my mom had taken her purse and went outside. she refused to come back in. she is now at the hospital and i have asked them to keep her overnight. she is past the point my aunt can keep her and i can’t bring her here. my brother and sister can’t take her for various complicated reasons (autistic children in one and abuse in the other). she can’t afford assisted living and makes too much for medicaid help.   i don’t know what to do. i feel helpless and selfish .i would have to quit, likely file bankruptcy and lose my house to take her in. only to end up in a mess that doesn’t make either of our lives better. e how do you know when it is time?  she has tried suicide twice in her life before alzheimer’s and has always had a mean streak but with this disease it is amplified to a level we literally can’t handle. i don’t want to put her in assisted living and have things be worse for her because it is strangers but she has alienated what family she has and the ones that aren’t can’t.   any thoughts are appreciate. just beside myself at this point. thanks for listening...."," does your or your hubby’s employers offer employee assistance programs? if so, you may be able to get a free consultation with an attorney. if she has a pension that pays a lot there may not be an easy solution but if she’s taking payments out of a retirement account it’s my understanding a lawyer could set that money aside in a trust, paving the way for medicaid. the lawyer i spoke to said that setting that up would cost like 3-4k which is too much for me since i’m still just a lowly fellow, not on a full salary yet. besides eap, the senior center in the county where i live offers a class on financial management for seniors. there i learned my mom is eligible for veterans benefits since she’s the widow of a combat veteran. they can provide like $1200 a month for homebound care. they suggested lots of other things too, could be worth looking into....someone at the caregiver support sub recommended i contact county services to see what assistance is available. they said that they can send a social worker out to do an assessment but that some minimal assistance would likely be available (day care subsidies 2x a week)....i guess there are lots of resources out there. it’s not necessary to burn your house down to provide quality and loving care to your mom. some people have different histories with their parents, than you with yours, which explains differences in decisions. be accepting of your boundaries — this shows your strength, an admirable trait — recognizing that comparison will whittle your self esteem away until there’s nothing left. in reality, none of us can really be the giving tree...we are all humans after all. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lr2gml/feeling_guilty/,Feeling guilty

"i started caring for him about two months ago. he does not remember i am his grandson anymore but knows i am there to help. during his very brief moments of lucidity, he does thank me for being there and asks me about my brother or my dad, but that is about it. for a while we had a daily routine of waking up, showering every-other day, eating breakfast and playing dominoes in the morning/early afternoon.  he starts to decline rapidly about 1:00pm. that is when the obsessive behavior really starts to set in. he used to be a handy man and loved sports. so he is either obsessing about something outside that needs to be fixed or he thinks that we are playing some sort of game where everything in the house is worth points. this goes on for a few hours, we eat lunch, and then he takes a nap. about 6:00pm sundowning usually starts. the usual obsessions begin and he gets angry. sometimes he says he doesn't need his clothes and takes them off.  i found just staying calm, not raising my voice, riding it out and making sure he is safe; shortens the durations of his sundowning. then we usually eat dinner around 7:30. afterwards, i give him his evening meds and put to bed between 9-10pm.  we have nanny cams throughout the house that sent alerts if he gets up in the middle of the night.over the last week or so, he has been sleeping later and later.  when he gets up to use the restroom in the morning, i will go check on him to see if he wants to get the day started and he just wants to sleep more.  so i let him and check on him about every 30 min to see if he wants to get up. the answer is always ""i want to sleep more."" yesterday he got up a 4pm, wanted to take a nap at 5:30, slept until 7, ate dinner, went to bed at 9:30pm and slept through the night.is this normal? does anyone else experience this? any pointers?", it happens in cycles for some. you might want to have him checked for a uti or anything that might be causing him to feel more tired.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lqncho/currently_caring_for_my_grandfather/,Currently Caring for my grandfather

"i could really use some advice about obsessive behaviors. one of my dads behaviors is constantly checking the boiler. he’ll go add water to it up to 6 times a day &amp; empty it just as many times or more. he does this all day, every day. i understand it’s one of the few things he can still recall to do somewhat but it’s a huge problem. i’ve taken that responsibility on so he doesn’t have to but he does it anyways. sometimes he forgets he’s adding water or emptying water from the boiler resulting in him flooding our basement. this has to be the 5th time in 2 years. he was obsessing over the boiler not working correctly tonight (even though it was fine) &amp; proceeded to empty the boiler &amp; refill it but left the basement because he forget what he was doing, flooding it once again. he had been told the boiler was fine multiple times tonight. i had been trying to stay awake to avoid just this but i dozed off for not even 30 minutes &amp; he managed that. how do i manage this? is there anyway to detract him from being so focused on the boiler? important to note: he’s 56, was diagnosed with dementia in his late 40’s."," 3 issues in what you discuss.  (my husband and i are answering this together; me as person living with dementia, and husband as my care-partner who is very involved with maintenance of buildings and water-and-sewer-plant supervisor.)1)  your dad may be feeling he needs to take care of something (and probably needs to feel he is contributing to care of home and ""family"").  this may be a carry-over from his profession, but all people want to contribute to family and home.  we want to be a contributor, but especially if we feel that we are requiring care ourselves, then that desire becomes a need.2) you are feeling anxious that something will go wrong.  i dont know anything about the safety devices on your boiler, so dont know if the over-rides will prohibit functioning of boiler if it is not properly prepared.  but it sounds like there have been times where some safety protocol insured the safety of the system, and you were able to set things back in order.3) from my perspective, ""flooding"" is a subjective term that goes from a wet floor draining to a sump, to putting on your bathing suit to get to the equipment.  do you have a ""flood-alarm"" system in the basement?  are the sump and sump-pump working properly?  is the water-quality used to fill the boiler safe for so many drain-and-refills?

"i'm only 18 but i feel like i might have dementia of some sorts? im not sure what it really could be but very frequently ive been having what i call intrusive thoughts that take up my whole conciousness. for example, ill get up and out of bed and think ""i need to take micheal to the gate"" and ill get dressed and spend time thinking about how and where to take micheal and then ill snap out of it and realise i dont know a micheal or why i would be taking him to a gate. all i remember from that instance is the phrase ""i need to take micheal to the gate"" . im sure there was more than that while i was thinking about it but thats all i can remember. i thought it was nothing at first but its starting to happen more often and for longer periods of time. i had a brief panic attack today after snapping out of one of these thoughts because i couldnt remember who i was for a small amount of time. this time it lasted for an hour and i cant even remember what i was thinking but i know there was something. sorry if im being ignorant and this isnt related to dementia but i have no idea what it is and its very scary.", agree with the suggestions to see a doc. disassociation is an alternative to ocd/anxiety. these episodes could also be sleepwalking or other things. no one here can say. if you don’t want to physically see a doctor (which you should cause managing psychiatric stuff before it gets worse helps with overall course) then post this question to askdocs. even then i’m pretty sure the answer is going to be you need to see a doctor.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lpamvu/do_i_have_some_sort_of_dementia/,do i have some sort of dementia?
"my (49f) mom (75f) has dementia, probably alzheimers, stage 4ish, which she knows but will not talk about. she'll say that she has memory problems because she's had some strokes (she hasn't). she's struggling with loss of freedom, both because of the dementia and covid. there's been ongoing difficulties with her and the pets when she won't listen to me or follow the guidelines i set down. one dog has kidney damage, so she can't have too much protein or salt, and should be on a special diet, but that's impossible because mom has spoiled her by rewarding begging anytime we eat. the second dog has had at least one bout of pancreatitis caused by mom's indulging and shouldn't have fatty foods. the cat's diet is (was?) fine, but she was not to be let out after dark because there are a lot of predators in the neighborhood. i used to have two cats, but last june, mom opened the back door to let the dogs out and left it open, and the first cat escaped and never came home. we ended up having a huge fight about it, because i was trying so hard not to be angry while my mom decided i was angry at her, so she got mad at me and bugged me until i did get angry.very late last wednesday night, my mom deliberately put the second cat out, thinking the cat would run up to my bedroom window and meow to be let in. well, she didn't. she disappeared into the night hasn't been seen since, and both my mom and i are devastated. trouble is, i'm dealing with my feelings by working on any chance to get my cat back if she's not dead, and my mom is putting away the cat stuff and talking about how we should get another one. i've told her that i cannot bear the thought of getting another cat, but she's forgotten already.it just breaks my heart. my mom used to be the smartest, most responsible person i knew, and her emotional age has regressed to something like a 12 year old, which is not fun. on top of that, i can't grieve openly for my cat, because then my mom feels terrible, and that's not the point. i'm not interested in making her feel bad. i just want to keep the animals safe and healthy.", lock her in!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lpahnt/my_mom_deliberately_put_my_cat_out/,My mom deliberately put my cat out
"hi all,so sorry about the extremely long post. not sure where to start with this post but its about my father with lewey body dementia, covid and financial questions. he is extremely vulnerable to predators.backstory:my father has been dealing with frequent hallucinations for few years. it was a once in a blue moon thing starting around 2015/2016, that was typically dismissed. then with time, it progressed into a more frequent occurrence. by 2020 50% of our phone calls would be about the spirits in his house and what they had done and how he would use the power of god to dispel them. he comes from a culture that is not big on mental health and a country/continent with comparatively low dementia rates. he was proud of his “visions” as he said god had chosen him as one of the prophesying elders mentioned in the bible. he would insult and act aggressively towards any one who would suggest seeing a doctor. he also developed an obsession with international lottery mail scams which he believed with his whole being would be the key to making him a multimillionaire. he would wire money to them. with what frequency or how much… i don’t know, most likely 1000s+.his only asset is the home he lives in and he would allegedly rent out the basement and a couple rooms for extra income to supplement his social security payments. i was comforted that he was not lonely as he sometimes rents to his “friends” or people he knows from his church. other than that he seemed pretty lucid to me but i didn’t know the severity of his cognitive problems; he seemed more “quirky” than anything else. he has been seperated from my mother for maybe ten years but they have been on friendly terms with once a month contact and live in the same town. i have lived 100-1000 miles away from both parents for about 15 years so contact is less frequent on my end. the quality of his tenants started to get sketchier. a year ago he had a man move in, described as homeless who had gone through a recent operation and needed medical care. i asked why he would take someone in like that. how would he pay? he mentioned this man had relatives in the church he goes to and they pressured him because god is caring. he said this man could pay rent. that was the end of that. he allegedly kicked out that man a few months later and took in another questionable man in the summer of 2020. he kept on mentioning how this man was his true friend because he would listen to him about the spirits and his secrets. then it turned sour because this man didn’t want to hear about the “secrets” or the lottery anymore. this man contracted covid in december and was sent home from the hospital to recover. my father then contracts covid from him and is sent to the hospital. my father had changed his number a couple weeks earlier and hadn’t placed any of his families numbers in there. my father never learned how to use a computer and has trouble with smart phones so any chance of remembering our numbers from memory was nilch.  since he was not able to give out our contact numbers, this “tenant” he contracted covid from was made the point of contact. my mother goes to the house for her monthly visit and is met aggressively by this tenant. he was asking who she was and why she was there. he tells her that my father has been in the hospital for a month and he doesn’t know if he died or got lost because of the dementia. the lack of tact and blatant misinformation was appalling. turns out this man was just a couple days away from being given guardianship over my father, whether this meant power over finances… idk i’m still ignorant over what types of guardianships have what rights. the hospital social worker said that don(not the man’s real name) had already decided that my father was going to be sent to a nursing home permanently after the hospital because the hospital and don both agreed that my father was incapable of dealing with his personal affairs. we showed up just in time to stop this motion. i’m surprised and relieved my father survived. he had a hole in his lungs and was on oxygen. he lost the ability to walk and his leg muscles atrophied. his body was/is recovering but his mind seems to have gotten worse. his convos now make no sense. for a week straight he was talking about how obama was trying to steal his land and how trump would come through. we have to remind him who is talking to him on the phone. and sometimes he asks my mother about their son(she has no sons). he is now in rehab and has regained some movement in his legs. he sounded a bit more lucid on the phone yesterday. honestly i do agree with the hospital’s record of mental incapacity. i recently came across his bank statements from all the way back to 2017. **turns out he has never charged rent to any of the people living/passing through in his house for years.** his basement is alway occupied by a family… right now its a family of 5. the two bedrooms upstairs, occupied by randoms. another room is empty… reserved for this pastor that comes from his country every summer. his home is essential serving as a shelter/halfway house as he gathers people pushed on to him by the church he frequents or people he meets along the way. now it makes sense that don was offended when we called to give him a heads up about rent. he simply just said “i don’t have the money!”. apparently he’s broke because he spent so much money getting movers! this house still has a mortgage and is filthy. cockroaches are also very visible “tenants”.another concerning piece is that my father spends $1000-2000 a month on counter checks. this basically eats up the majority of his social security check. where these go to… i don’t know but now i suspect he was wiring this money to the international lotto scams or maybe just giving it out to people? a year ago he was flagged and banned from wiring money at his local supermarket because what he was doing was considered gambling. at this point, i would believe you if you told me he was paying rent to the people living there rentfree because they told him to. apparently don felt so comfortable he is using the garage as a hoarding space and got married during these few months he has been living in my fathers home. is his new wife going to move in? all of this has been so overwhelming for me, especially when thinking about my father’s future. how do you remove these people, essentially squatters? none have leases. my father needs financial supervision. would the hospital backing me up be enough to get a conservatorship(or poa?). when the time comes for long term memory care, i can see that maybe his social security + if the house is rented correctly would be enough to pay the exorbitant prices of a home but right now his finances and spending situation is a mess. he has always been very independent but now i don't think that is an option for him anymore."," my heart goes out to you! i am familiar with this type of chaos and the stress it causes. my narcissistic bi-polar mother has dementia, and her story is similar to your father's. she lost everything due to mental illness and religious fanaticism. as far as the squatters: you could obtain legal guardianship/p.o.a and kick them to the curb, but only suggested if you're mentally and emotionally prepared for the stress that comes along with cleaning up your father's mess. i'm sure the hospital can give you a recommendation for court-ordered conservatorship. i think you have plenty of additional evidence to provide to the court, as well. i've been my mother's legal guardian for a year, and i often question my decision to sign up for this. thankfully, after months of chaos, i found her an apartment in a senior living residence where she has 24/7 staff and nursing care to handle her nonsense. it's a relief to know she's safe, and i can finally focus on my mental/emotional health. last year was rough!  😆senior/assisted living is absolutely recommended to ease the weight of the responsibility. there are programs available to provide financial assistance if the cost is an issue, but it sounds like renting the house may be a good option.  kick the moochers out! please make sure you're taking care of yourself and have support.

"i’m a freshmen college student. whenever my grandmother calls, i always let it go to voicemail. it’s hard and awkward for me to talk on the phone especially when she repeats a lot of long stories. i love hearing them. instead i though of trying maybe to send her a care package. she’s french and grew up in morocco. i went ahead and bought an eiffel tower 1000 piece puzzle for her, a little lion stuffed animal, and a dominos  set, cuz she loves that game. i got a card saying “i love you” on the front. and then it says “happy  anniversary” on the inside, but i crossed out the anniversary and wrote “belated valentines day”. i thought it would be cute. i’m not worried about by efforts being vain or a waste of money. i just don’t want to patronize her. how should i help her? i live about 1.5 hours away from her. and can’t really visit cuz of covid too. any feedback is well appreciated.! :)"," speaking as a person living with dementia symptoms a care package is nice, but  depending on abilities 1000 pieces might be very frustrating ((it certainly would be for me)).however, more to the point is that a care package does not connect with your voice.  personally i have a difficult time putting sounds together to make words and sentences, but i no longer recognize the look of my husband, i only recognize his voice.  same is true of my sister.  audio memory is in a different section of the brain than visual memory.i almost never call anyone, but if she is calling and you do not talk to her, i guarantee a care package will not substitute; there is a good chance that she will not even closely relate that you gave the package to her (even if you include a picture with the gift- which i would strongly suggest).  when you do talk to her, she probably will not remember what you say, or maybe even that she talked to you, but her feelings of emotional closeness remain.  those feelings are the crucial stuff.yes, i know the repeating long stories are frustrating, i have lived it with two grandparents and my mother, but you might have more patience with those long stories if you put yourself in her shoes ... and also if you realize how much you would give, in the future, to have the opportunity to listen to her voice say even a few words.  sorry, but she has brain failure, and you are running out of time to treasure those words.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lp9whn/helping_my_grandma/,Helping my grandma
"throwaway account because of the situation. please remove if not relevant, bit of a slightly different situation. so, my mum \[52\] was diagnosed with early onset dementia in the summer just past. things have been pretty tough emotionally. i moved back home with my parents (only child), though that was mostly covid related as i lost my job.   i'd been planning to move in within a 30 minute drive as opposed to 2 hours away as i was before. my mum is mostly struggling mostly with her short term memory, speech (finding words etc) and general comprehension - she'll often contribute to a conversation with something completely incongruous that makes absolutely no sense, or struggle to make a point. anyway, as tough as it has been, coming to terms with the fact that i'm going to be losing my mum while i'm still in my 20s, my dad wanted me to reinstall all the software on his computer this weekend after he had to wipe it. i re-installed his emails, a notification came up - he's been sending explicit messages to an online prostitute, including making plans to meet... i understand this is nothing really to do with dementia in and of it self but it just compounds so many issues and stresses that life has brought over the last 12 months. now my dad financially props up the whole family, he was paying my rent for months when i lost my job, he pays my mums credit card bills (which was a pre-dementia thing) and on the whole he's always been an amazing dad. but this just has me shot. i get that my mum having dementia is hard. the fact she's depressed now, has a general feeling of low self-worth and now fears ringing my grandma (91) because my grandma is more compos mentis than she is. but i don't even think he truly realises that this is just the start, it gets a whole lot harder and more difficult, if he's already cheating now, how will things be later?i don't begrudge my dad wanting to chat to 'other women'. i won't begrudge him when my mum reaches a certain point... i don't think it's fair for someone to live alone, unloved etc, but could he not wait until she's 'dying' or 'gone'? i just can't understand why he would do that now. literally throwing away 35 years of marriage. what do i know? maybe they weren't happy before, but i struggle to believe that. since i left home they were always so loved up, they became more so once i left home, and even coming home for christmases etc i'd hear them in the act. the joys of paper thin walls at my parents home. i'm sorry for the graphic detail. i'm just at a loss. i can't bear the thought to think that there's nothing to do save my mum, but also that undercurrent of at least a stable and loving 'household' just seems to have completely gone to pot. i'm just at a complete loss, and we're only at the start. i'm so sad."," i just want to thank you all so much for taking the time to reply. this has honestly been so helpful and i'm so grateful that you've taken the time to come back to me and offer support. it's sometimes weird when i think about these things. i haven't had a conversation with my mum where she's had to 'parent' me, or console me, or offer advice since i was 18. when i went off to university i pretty much just got on with things, and had amazing friends at uni to support me whenever crazy stuff happened in life. it's just sad that i'll never get to have one of those 'supportive' conversations with her again. my mum was always kind of an 'agony aunt' for the rest of her family and friends. they'd always call her for advice as she was the stern but sensible one. i'm sorry for all of the self wallowing. there's some stuff that i've always wanted to talk to her about. like i've never come out as bi to my parents. i need to do that before my mum loses her mind completely. i struggled to get anything done this past few days since i wrote that first post. which is not a great place to be in as i'm working two high pressured jobs right now so i can save and hopefully have a decent future. back to my dad. well, i went further than maybe i should have. i looked at his phone while it was charging. everyday non stop all day long pretty much is he messaging prostitutes, on a site that encourages people to have an affair, and looking at some really extreme pornography - nothing that would land him in prison, but still, very questionable. the general consensus on here before was that i should just leave him to it, but i'm worried what he's doing is extreme, dangerous, and not only is he getting his sexual fulfilment this way but he's also just completely self medicating in an awful awful way. i think i need to stage an intervention and actually have a conversation with him. that feels and is weird, but we're both adults. but i also now just feel disgusted with him, and totally let down by him.he's always been the stable one of our family, able to handle a crazy situation calmly.i'm stuck between being desperate to get out of this house and leaving this situation, to wanting to stay here and not leave my mum for one second so i can make sure he's looking after her properly. i want to stroke her hand and for her to be okay. but i know none of us are. i thought acting normal and pretending like nothing is wrong all round was going to work, but clearly it isn't. i'm sorry again this is part about dementia  but mostly about the effects of handling the complete change of family dynamics that this situation has ensued. thanks again for support and advice",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lp8lm1/how_to_cope/,How to cope...

(i.e. we have 5 brand new bags of chips) #4 she has had a cough since prior to moving in, but she will only cough when i’m not in the room. in the mornings i listen to her cough about every 3 minutes from my bedroom. #5 she has a very hard time changing her normal routine and has to plan anything outside of work 3 weeks in advance. #6 she will hear noises that aren’t there.

"please remove if not allowed i just really need to get a few things off my chestmy grandma got diagnosed i think last year, but she’s been deteriorating for about two years now. we were never really “close” in a way where i hung out with her and talked to her a lot, but i did/still do live with her so i was close to her in a physical sense. i just never got along with her very well, our personalities never meshed, she’s always tried to make me into her daughter trying to control what i was interested in and how i dressed etc. all in all i just never felt close to her emotionally.lately it’s been bugging me that i’m not close to her and i feel like such a piece of shit for it. when i go downstairs and see her watching tv i’ll say hi but do my thing and go back to my room because it just kills me seeing her like this. i make her food and stuff and will occasionally sit and talk to her but it’s so hard. like looking at her makes me wanna cry she just looks so worn out. and i think part of me is scared to get close and have her die. i’ve never had anyone this close to me die yet and i’m seriously terrified for it. like sitting up at night not being able to breathe i’m so anxious.also honestly a part of me is really pissed off at how unfair this is. she used to be a social worker for people with dementia ffs she was such a bright and lively woman literally 3 years ago and her light went out just like that. it happened so fast. i want to know why her. i don’t want anyone to ever have to go through this, as a caregiver or as a person with the condition. i feel so awful about my grandpa too since he’s doing the majority of work around here but the sadness i feel for him would be a whole other post. i don’t know what my point here is i just have a lot of thoughts running through my head right now, thank you for reading."," it’s normal for personalities to mesh or not mesh. i’ve lost all of my grandparents, and my father. my mother currently has dementia and i care for her. if your grandma is still able to remember anything, i would get videos of her stories and your grandpa’s. there are so many things that i wish i had asked my grandparents. just hearing their voice and seeing their face when they are gone would be a treasure. i’m at the age now where family history and stories interest me, but much is lost. luckily i still have some aunts that i can ask. i just started recording their stories of my grandparents. i ask my mom some things, but mostly i just listen to her random memories. she thinks i’m a distant family member or roommate most days. it’s normal to feel the need to distance yourself to protect your heart. just make sure you ask what you can while you can, and give her a hug, you never know when it will be your last. i miss all the things that my dad used to bug me about. he was a smoker, so i avoided hugging him a lot, i was allergic and didn’t want to smell of smoke. i would give anything for another hug. as far as the being anxious part, if you want to learn more about death, i recommend books by allan kardec. they are very old, but it is a study of spirits and spirit interactions basically. i was around when one of my grandmothers was passing, she saw her deceased family in the room. since then i have seen spirits with my own eyes, which is why i recommend the books. death is an inescapable, natural part of life, an end to suffering. i also recommend the solfeggio app and the brainwave apps. i have anxiety, so i have tried many things. also, find out what perfume she wears(or used to wear). i found a scent that smells just like my grandmother, it brings back memories. so that’s another memory to save for your future family when you tell them of grandma.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lnjnk0/are_we_allowed_to_vent_here/,are we allowed to vent here

"hello, i'm working on writing a paper for school based around dementia. i havn't written a paper in years and i wanted to share what i have thus far. all of this is based around my personal experiences and what i've picked up on working with patients/residents who are suffering from dementia. after a few years of work experience in a couple nursing homes i am looking to use what i have learned to hopefully shine some light on what dementia is and how to interact and assist those who are affected.i have not had a chance to look up and fact check any of this yet as it's all just off the top of my head and annecotdal experience but i'm curious what some people who have family members with dementia think. thank you for your time, here's what i have so far._______they're are many different types of dementia with 70% of cases being diagnosed as alzheimers while their is also lewy body dementia (dlb-dementia with lewy body), and vascular dementia. it is most common after the age of 65 but can happen in even earlier years, exessive alcohol intake is known to damage the pre-frontal cortex overtime which can lead to dementia even sooner such as in your 50's.dementia is a vast spectrum, every case of dementia is particularly unique to the individual as it is a very wide spectrum of both symptoms and behaviour stemming from the nature of the illness being brain failure in different regions of the brain. depending on which areas begin to shutdown will affect the behaviour of the patient, such as if the pre-frontal cortex is failing then executive functioning will suffer and the patient may start to have trouble communicating as well as staying focused on tasks.dementia is a blanket term that describes the progressive loss of brain function and issues may arise with simple tasks such as brushing teeth or remembering to flush the toilet as well complex tasks like remembering dates and managing money.dementia starts off slow and only  progressesivly worsens with age and time, never improving. although symptoms such as hallucinations, aggression and agitation can be managed with medication there is no known  reverse or cure currently. they're other ways besides medication that can help reduce symptoms such as music to help soothe the mind. appreciation and recognition of music is thought to be one of the last aspects of the mind to falter. often times people with dementia love listening to old time classics they enjoyed in their youth, and it is not uncommon for quiet classical music to be played when a resident is palliative and nearing end of life. converserly a quiet environment can also help reduce stress, as sensory overload from too much going on can be disorientating. physical contact like handholding when escorting someone somewhere can reaffirm a feeling of connection. although care must be taken as some residents/patients may be physically strong and unable to control their impulses and accidentally or intentionally hurt you. being a careaide has one of the highest risks of recieving injury, even greater than say being a police officer, a tree faller, a security bouncer etc. having a toy like say a baby doll, can help comfort the eldery as well having a tactile object to hold can help distract them as well as potentially bring back memories of a time when they had to nurture their own youth. a warm blanket can be a very powerful tool as when someone ages blood flows slower throughout the body causing many residents to be in a perpetual state of feeling chilled sometimes with even many layers of clothing on. some residents may prefer more simple shows such as cartoons intended for children as the plot is easier to follow, as well as shows about nature such as planet earth where there is no plot to follow but is instead relaxing.giving a resident with dementia small simple tasks can help stimulate their mind which helps slow the progression of the disease and give feelings of accomplishment. tasks such as folding laundry, or collecting dirty dishes or say setting a table for dinner can make a resident feel valuable/useful. we never lose our desire for agency, and oftentimes without a purpose we can fall prone to depression. this is still very true and perhaps even more relevant when one has a mental illness such as dementia. it is not uncommon for people with dementia to fall into depressive tendencies so we must make an effort at all times to help enrich their lives and remind them they are loved and not a burden.it's important to try and include someone with dementia in day to day living and still treat them as if they are an adult, even if parts of their mind is failing. ask how their day is going, if they like the weather outside, what type of food do they like, while remembering to try and keep the questions simple without much nuance.we can easily fall victim to assuming we are an authority figure over these people due to their constant need for care, such as needing help with showering, eating and having their meals cooked, changing clothing, being escorted to bed, etc. though the truth is that while we are their guardians and caregivers they are still an adult with their own sense of autonomy and while we may be at a job and in a hurry to complete it, this is their home and with that their progression of time will feel vastly different than ours.we can not forget these people have lived a very long life and still want to be treated with the dignity of being an adult. a mistake i often see is people saying the job is just like taking care of babies, or is as simple as ""wiping someone's ass"", this is a fallacy as a baby is fresh and new to the world, while an eldery person has been around a very long  time, longer than the caregiver for certain.in order to facilitate communication it is important to keep conversation simple and to the point. avoid long winded explanations and instead approach the patient in a calm and quiet manner and refer to the resident by their name as the name is one of the last things generally forgotten. ask yes or no questions and remember that body language is 80% of communication, so maintain eye contact and be assertive while speaking loudly, as much of the time they will be hard of hearing and ask you to repeat yourself. it's important to remain calm at all times and understand it may take rephrasing of questions in order to effectively get your point across.with the limited brain functions of the patient we need to not take things personally, we have no idea what is really going on in someone's mind and an outburst of rage may simply be because of a misunderstanding. _____i need to edit this quite a bit and move stuff around but i'm on my phone and waiting until i get on my laptop

"hi everyone, made this account because i really don't know where to go for help about what's going on right now. sorry it's a long one, tl;dr at bottoma little bit of background: my grandmother, who used to live in a different state, moved in to live with my mom and dad (that's his mother) because she developed paranoia (constantly thinking someone is taking her things, being untrusting with everyone around her) over the years. she used to live alone in the state she was in, but sold her house and lived with relatives there. however, because of the increasing paranoia, her relatives thought it best for her to move in with her son. since the paranoia wasn't getting better, my parents brought her in to a doctor where she was diagnosed with cognitive impairment about 2 years ago (not sure if it was dementia since i wasn't there at the doc appointment) and was given donepezil to take for it. she adamantly refused to take the medications because she ""wasn't crazy"" and ""wanted to age naturally."" my parents asked if she could be placed in an assisted living facility, but again she adamantly refused, and because at that time she was still competent enough to make her own decisions, she continued living with my parents. i know it was bad but after that matter the issue was dropped because my parents had other pressing matters to deal with. my dad's kidney failed again and his colon cancer came back, by the time it was diagnosed it was stage 4. with all the health problems they had to deal with, the best they could do at that time was to just encourage her to take her medications, which she continued to refuse.the problem: my dad's health declined drastically last year, and he ended up passing away in january. with his passing, my grandma's mental health took a hit as well. she has become increasingly more paranoid, sometimes doesn't know that her son has passed away, and is now claiming that my mom is abusing her. my mom calls me weekly asking me what to do, and i honestly don't know. i know my mom is not abusing her, we talk on video chat and as far as i can see, there are no bruises or marks on her body. when i ask my grandma what's going on she only tells me she needs help? i ask her what kind of help she needs and she just keeps repeating that she needs help. i told my mom to make another dr appointment so she get reassessed and hopefully get placed into an assisted living facility since my mom can't take care of her and is worried that she may hurt herself while she is at work (grandma forgets she's cooking things sometimes and leaves the stove on). unfortunately the dr appointment isn't untl mid march, and with the increasing episodes where she's accusing my mom, i'm worried my mom will get in trouble with elder abuse when she isn't doing anything. i just don't know what to do anymore. i feel like it's unfair for my mom to deal with this, my dad was bedbound when he passed so it was only her taking care of him, and now not only does she has to deal with his passing, but she is left with her mother-in-law who is constantly accusing her of stealing her things. what do we do??tl;dr: grandma getting increasing paranoid after my dad's passing and now accusing mom (who is her daughter in law) of stealing her things and abusing her (she is not being abused). have no idea what to do",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ljvyhj/need_advice_with_grandma/,Need advice with grandma

"i’ll try to keep this as short as possible.this week has been the hardest one of my life. earlier this week my mom told me that my dad was all of the sudden hallucinating (in all honesty we don’t know how long because he didn’t tell my mom until this week) and was acting strange / memory issues.so i decided to take matters in my own hands and drive him to the hospital. he had blood work, urine tests, cat scans, and an mri done as well. all of his tests came back “normal.” this doesn’t make sense because...well...he’s hallucinating after not previously hallucinating (he’s 68 years old). he’s not making much sense and super paranoid. they wanted him to stay the night but he refused...so...we took him back home and he didn’t go to sleep that night. the next day he was acting weirder and hallucinations were stronger. my mom took him back to the hospital and she made him stay the night. they ran the same tests and everything is somehow fucking normal? clearly not. he does take medicine for restless legs and migraines...we researched and saw that elderly patients who take them can become confused and hallucinate. we brought it up to the hospital and they agreed to taper him off over the next week (he can’t go cold turkey because doing so could cause seizures). anyways, he stayed the night (and didn’t sleep...so that’s 2 nights) and tests were normal so the next day i came to see him and he seemed to have some moments of clarity and i thought we made real progress and that my dads mind might be coming back. before i took him home and i asked them to give him medicine to help him sleep. big mistake. he got home that day and took it before bed...it had the opposite effect. he didn’t sleep again. this is 3 days of no sleep. maybe an hour here and there. he kept waking my mom and sister up and hid their car keys. he got aggressive and threatened to hit my sisters kid claiming that he was trying to steal the house? so today i come over and take him back to the hospital demanding answers. fun fact - my dad hates hospitals. the only reason he went every time is because he forgot he went the other times thankfully. i take him today and it got ugly. i told them they needed to sedate him and keep him for my families safety and so he can finally get sleep. they gave him ativan (the same stuff that made him not sleep in the first place) and about 15-20 mins later he started getting anxious and not making sense. he said i was his lawyer and i was being a bad friend by making him be there. he asked for us to leave so we could get a burger and then come back. i explained we couldn’t do that and he got angry. then shit hit the fan. he tried to leave. security had to try and escort him back to his room and sedate him. he forgot i was his son and said if i came any closer he’d fight me. he said i was a terrible lawyer and that he’d know if i was his son. he was super confused and agitated. i just don’t know what else to do. is it dementia, effects from his medication over time, mold poisoning, lead poisoning? i forgot to mention in november his medicine dosages went up - it was around december that he started getting confused here and there but no one knew. also, they are renovating the kitchen and the floor is ripped up and exposed. could it be toxins or mold? the house was built in the 40’s...could it be lead? the doctors brushed me off when i mentioned either and didn’t test for it. i’m just frustrated and don’t know how to help get my dad back. is it stress related psychosis?i just feel like health care, apart from surgery, is a joke at this point. any suggestions or positive thoughts?", ativan can be very dangerous if he has any lewy body dementia.  personally i would strongly avoid ativan because lewy body dementia is not well-understood by doctors (so frequently not diagnosed until years later).  there are no blood tests or scans that will reliably show lbd.

"don’t really know what i’m looking forward here, but i have to share this somewhere.. my grandmother had been living with alzheimer’s for over 10 years. it of course started with forgetting simple things and slowly got worse over time. i lived with my grandparents up until spring of 2018 and saw her slowly decline every day. when i moved out, she was still mostly my grandmother. she knew she was starting to lose her memories and would say her brain isn’t working right. after moving, i still went to visit at least once per week. she fell and broke her hip in october 2018 that required surgery. the anesthesia sped up her decline. my grandfather had to take care of her a lot, and the stress and lack of sleep is when his dementia “started” and he has no short term memory.whenever i had to go longer periods of time between seeing her, there was a drastic change in her the next time i saw her. covid hit last year, and i went 3 weeks without seeing her. she was a lot worse off when i finally went to see her again. i decided to keep seeing her, being very careful not to expose myself to covid. i had my first baby sept 3, 2020. before having my baby, my grandmother was still able to form sentences and knew who i was, even if she couldn’t remember my name. when i finally went back to see her after having my baby, she was sleeping most of the day, only getting up to eat.late november, my grandfather started to get highly agitated and one night it was so bad that my grandmother tried getting out the front door (like she has multiple times in the past). this time though, it got physical and both of them ended up on the floor. my grandfather broke his shoulder. he was sent to the hospital, and then rehab. when he got back home, he wasn’t the same. lots of dosing off, tremors, couldn’t walk. the rehab didn’t do anything and may have been neglecting him. he ended up back in the hospital after he was too weak to even get out of bed.during the time he was in the hospital, my grandmother was actually better. waking earlier, doing more, but couldn’t really form coherent sentences. a little while after my grandfather came home and started to regain his strength, my grandmother started to get highly agitated all the time. she finally got really weak and blood in urine and had to send her to the hospital about 3 weeks ago. diagnosed as uti. she didn’t eat for a while, but then finally did. she was going to be released to come home on hospice, but at the last minute wanted to send her to a hospice facility to try to get her agitation under control. she got there sept 31 and was still eating food that week until saturday feb 6th. on sunday, she was unresponsive. no one was able to visit her at the hospital, and we all thought she’d be back home that sunday the 6th, do no one went to see her at the hospice before she became unresponsive. my dad and aunt went that monday and she was given 72 hours. tuesday, no one went. wednesday morning, they still said she had 72 hours, but took a turn got the worse in late afternoon. i was finally able to visit her wednesday evening, as well as a lot of close family that she saw all the time. she passed away that night after we all left.my grandfather was heartbroken when he found out, but with his short term memory, he doesn’t remember and keeps asking where she is at. every time he is reminded, you can tell it hurts him by the look on his face. the funeral for my grandmother is set for tuesday morning. i don’t know how he will handle it. we all think he is going to go soon too.with all of this, my aunt blames herself. for not realizing my grandmother needed more help than my grandfather was able to give, how raking care of her for 2 years wore him down. blames herself for sending him to rehab. she thinks she killed my grandmother by sending her to hospice instead of bringing her home. for not seeing the signs of the uti sooner, etc. i am heartbroken too. one of the last couple times i saw her, something amazing happened. i was holding my daughter on my lap with my grandmother standing in front of us playing with the baby. out of nowhere, between mumbles, she clearly said “you love your great grandma don’t you?”  even on her late stage alzheimer’s, she was able to figure out that my daughter was her great granddaughter and form a complete coherent sentence. i will always remember that moment.", such a touching story. those moments of clarity are precious. unfortunately guilt can hinder a person's ability to go through the grieving process properly. hopefully everyone in the family can provide support to your aunt and let her know she did everything she could. hospice is a wonderful service and allows your loved one to pass with dignity.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ljfdab/my_grandmother_recently_died_from_alzheimers_and/,My grandmother recently died from Alzheimer’s and my grandfather has dementia.
"my mother in law has been showing signs of decline for the past few years but has been in good physical health and functional. when we point out that she is asking the same question 10 minutes apart she would laugh it off and would become angry when pressed on further issues. most recently she was upset and ready to call the police because she couldn’t find our daughters whom she was convinced were there. we live in another state and haven’t been since the summer. she has become a heavy drinker as well which we think is compounding the issue. we did convince her to bring up our concerns this past summer with her gp but she claimed he said she was fine. when we convinced her that our kids were not there she seemed to have awareness of there being an issue but went from agreeing to “what ever we thought was best” to it will be her decision on how much she will drink. she will need a referral for a neurologist and that looks like it’s months out so we can’t even get an official diagnosis.her husband is a kind, good man but he does not know how to proceed and if she is resistant his hands seem tied. this is extra hard because she went through this with her own mother and has been willful since the first sign. anyway i appreciate any advice on steps we can take to best get her care if she is unwilling.", refer to this post for suggestions!  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lj8xli/advice_parent_is_obviously_showing_signs_but/,Advice: parent is obviously showing signs but resists medical help
"i live with and care for my husbands grandmother along with my husband and our two very small children. i am becoming increasingly more frustrated with her and i feel like everyday my fuse shortens a little more. she is still capable of going to the bathroom (mostly), showering, and other iadl’s, but she needs to be prompted to do most everything and her noncompliance is driving me up the wall. i also get frustrated with her constantly commenting on my children the same things every day. in isolation what she says isn’t too irritating or thwarting of my parenting choices but the fact that it’s every single day that she comments on how cold my kids must be, or asking them why their crying while i try to gently soothe every tantrum makes me want to scream!financially we have no other choice than to do this and i feel like i am not getting the emotional support i need in order to get through this. my husband has an unending amount of patience and doesn’t understand why i get snappy, and my mother in law who is our employer seems to not comprehend that caring for her mother would be anything less than a joy. when i try to talk through my frustrations with my mother she tells me that i just need to be more patient and so i basically feel like all of the feedback i get for struggling is that i’m doing it wrong. also, as much as i hate to say it, she’s not my grandmother- i don’t feel that same unconditional love for her as she’s not someone i grew up with. i’m waaaay more patient with our kids because i do love them so much and i understand their learning process.an additional stressor to this mess is that my husband’s aunt lives here as well and i am also her caretaker, as she is deaf, has cerebral palsy, and is mentally probably about 8 years old. she’s much more capable of taking care of herself and actually helps with the laundry and keeps an eye on her mother when we go out on walks and such, but her favorite past time is staring at us and she has horrendous hygiene habits that i’ve been working on helping her fix. she’s a sweet woman, but her staring and unsavory noises and such just really add to my mounting frustration.so in short- i’m frustrated and upset much of the time and in order of having any chance of ever being able to afford a home in this awful economic climate i have to keep this up for another 9 or 10 months, even though it’s been 10 months already. covid has allowed for my husband to work from home so he’s able to help out every once in a while which is really nice, but covid also makes it so i feel i have no outlets. i feel frustrated, under appreciated, and like no one understands how difficult this is, and that’s not a really fun way to live life."," your husband and mil are acting like it is no big deal to be carer, housekeeker, mother and employee. i feel sorry for you and also angry. tis is just too much. 😱",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lj8e6e/im_becoming_too_frustrated/,I’m becoming too frustrated

"okay so my grandma married her husband who was a resident of canada and now he's a citizen here in the united states, he has dual citizenship. over the past year and a half my grandma has noticed that he's been getting confused and forgetful more and more and when they go to the doctor he won't allow her into the doctor's room with him and he won't tell her any information. she called his doctor's office on the sly and told them about some of his forgetfulness and confusion problems that he'd been having recently and they called my grandpa and scheduled an appointment for him to come in and take a cognitive test. he failed the cognitive test and they wanted to do a cat scan on him. he told my grandma this information and he had scheduled with them to have the scan done and then the next day he was telling her when she mentioned it that he didn't schedule that and he will never take it that he's just getting old. she sent me some recordings of him talking to his primary care doctor he was trying to cancel his scam permanently with her and she was trying to explain to him that he was confused and he just is not accepting of it. the next day he decided he was going to the cat scan and got ready to go and they went and he got the scan done so now the forgetfulness is happening within a very short time and yesterday she said that he didn't recognize her for a minute 😓. he is 84 years old and very stubborn and setting his ways he's always right he won't accept any help from anyone with anything and now that he's going through this it's very difficult for my grandma. so the issue we are having is that he won't allow her into the doctor's office and he won't allow the doctors to give her any information about what's going on with him is there anyone that's been through the same situation that knows how to go about making the doctors allow her to come in the room anyway even if he says no or at least giving her the information so that she can properly care for him or get him medication that he may need? i don't know how if someone passed a cognitive test they would still allow you to be able to drive a car and he's now talking about going and buying a car and sometimes he'll just go and take the car and drive himself somewhere and get lost it's not safe but he refuses to have any help we're telling anyone what's wrong. she is supposed to find out what happened with the brain scan on monday."," driving: since he failed his cognitive test, tell his physician he gets lost driving & ask the doc to report him to the state for a review. this will start the process to revoke his license (if he can’t get a physician to say he’s medically ok to drive within 45 days) that way, it’s not family taking away his driving.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/licz41/help_me_and_my_grandma/,Help me and my Grandma!
"hi, i'm just curious if anyone has any experience with their lo taking this medicine. my grandmother has ftd and just started it this week and has only taken 2 doses, and so far it seems to help her sleep at night which is a good thing. her doctor said it might help with her memory and anger/anxiety, it might not. i was just looking up the side effects though, and they seem pretty extensive. i just want to be prepared if she starts experiencing any of them. did your lo have any unpleasant side effects? did it help with their dementia at all?", i posted about it previously [here](,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/libtib/donepezil/,Donepezil
"what to do if your mom won't, literally cannot sit still for a second, but due to late stage of parkinson's and now dementia she either doesn't care, still believes 100% she can and will fall flat, or forgets.... background: my mother is 65 and has had parkinson's for the past 17+ years and now dementia. she took a heavy fall 3 months back and fractured her right arm &amp; shoulder ( which is also her dominant), but the heartbreaking part is that she seems to have both mentally and literally physically deteriorated down hill within a second. she kept hallucinating (almost like the term ""sundown"", only it was for 24/7).screaming at my brother and i as if we were little and fighting when we are both now adults ( memory from the past?) thinks her sisters from korea came down to visit her ,but than believe they also left to go have fun without her which makes her angry and scream. (when no one else is around)talking to a ""little girl"" with a full conversation when there is no one there!!! got angry and paranoid that everyone is trying to poison her or her son touched her inappropriately and threatens to call the police.... ( he helps give her a bath since she just dead weights on me and i injured my back.)i can keep going, but needless to say: obviously this is not going well and seemed to keep headed down hill. we recently ((finally)) were able to get her started on dementia meds and that seemed to kinda help? she still isn't her 100% self, but just a more aggressive and headstrong version? seems more willing to correspond, but still not herself.... she keeps believing that she is capable of cooking, cleaning, and everyday household chores and that nothing will stop her, only her body literally cannot support her own weight ( just a huge amount of weight loss..... i don't even understand how. we try our best to feed her protein rich meals, veggies &amp; grain. even got her ensure and protein shakes when she absolutely won't eat and will throw huge tantrums. she is at the point where she literally cannot be left home alone, my dad is 75 and tries his best, but it is allot.... from bodily fluids discharge, tantrums, hallucinations, confrontational aggression.....and will not stop trying to do chores when she falls even with the walker. i don't know, maybe we are just at our wits end and venting here, but has anyone else experience something like this with their loved ones?what did you do?we are currently figuring out how to find more help.... whether a nurse that stops by, or a full time care facility,  but for the immediate relief of all of our family..... anything to help with now? i don't even understand how a fall would change everything so drastically. the doctor's believe she is at early stage dementia, but ( i know i'm not a doctor, and possibly there was a miscommunication on my part),but how is this a early stage?!?! it's so intense and this is just the beginning??? i'm sorry if everything seemed to bounce all over. very exhausted and overwhelmed and any to all advice will be appreciated. thanks."," talk to her doctor, sometimes meds can be added or adjusted to help. injuries and anesthetics seem to accelerate dementia in some people. my mom went from somewhat capable of holding a conversation most of the time and working 500 piece puzzles with her aide to barely getting a 16 piece puzzle together and struggling to follow simple conversations after she fell and broke her hip and arm.also talk to your local alzheimer's association and see what resources they might have available.can you give her jobs she can sit and work on? i know a lady who keeps a stack of washcloths just for her mom to fold, when she's done, the daughter takes them to ""put them away"" and when she's out of sight she fluffs them up again in a laundry basket, ready for the next time her mom gets restless.you may not be ready for the possibility of placing her in a facility but it probably wouldn't hurt to start doing research on which ones are better, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/li69dk/advice_needed_please/,Advice needed please.
"i know people like to say that their elder is still in there deep down but i'm not so sure. just because you still maintain a relationship doesn't mean by understand who you are in relation to who they are. when does someone stop being who they spent their lifetime becoming?  my grandparents were together for over40 years and had seven children together. he bought her ross bushes so she would always have roses, even after he was gone. he died in 96 and she doesn't remember anything about him...  my grandmother hated valentines day with a passion because her mother died on that day... today i asked what she remembered about valentines day and she said nothing. hours later she came to me and mentioned her mother, incoherently. i asked what she remember about her mother and all she could tell me is that she ""is a wonderful lady"".  my heart breaks so badly to see the people who meant the most to her, get ripped away from her conscious memory. people who were taken from her years ago that all she had left of was their memory are now erased from her existence. she deserves so much better than this... i wish i could talk to her one last time..", *whom* they spent,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/li3jev/missing_my_grandma/,Missing My Grandma
"i'm caregiving for a family friend and recently moved in with her at her family's request to deal with med compliance and hygiene issues. when i first got here she was delighted to have the company but she constantly ask me ""how long are you staying?"" and asks it a lot. she asks it so many times i now have a well polished answer that she seems ok with but it's not the truth. my answer is that i'm only staying for a few weeks to help with her meds. it's this ok? i feel weird deceiving her but she loses her shit if i question her independence or capability to take care of herself.", maybe it would be better long term to look into caregiving for physically and or mentally handicapped people. they will appreciate what you are doing and you can build up report with them. what do you think ? i am not saying you're not cut out for what you're doing. it just seems a very difficult career path.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lhxcxk/how_long_are_you_staying/,How long are you staying?
"i haven't posted in a year, but thought i'd give a semi-positive update since there aren't a ton of those in this forum.see [here]( and [here]( for background.since his initial hospital stay in october 2019, my dad has been staying in alabama with family. however, at the end of last year, the neurologist that he sees gave the opinion that he is in stage 6 (of 7) of alzheimer's. i was pretty surprised by this because he still makes his own coffee, microwaves food, changes his clothes (when he's prompted), and goes to the bathroom by himself.the doctor told us that we needed to start thinking about putting him into care or getting full time help. there is no way my dad would go for full time care being in the guest house with him, so we started looking for memory care facilities.my sister and her family recently moved back to ga from ca, so we decided to get him into a place near where we both are in ga. this way, once covid restrictions aren't so tight, he can see both of us and his nephews regularly.we are moving him in on feb 26 of this month. there has been so much involved in this process. we had to get his pcp to fill out forms, get a chest x-ray, a tb test, and a pcr covid test (the last two still haven't happened yet). because he is in al, it was also just easier to buy him new clothes, toiletries, linens, etc., than try and figure out what of his is still usable (he will not shower for weeks or change his clothes so a lot of his clothes probably need to be set on fire). i had to get special labels printed to sew inside his clothes like he is going to camp (my fun project this weekend).the place we are putting him in is really nice, so i hope having socialization and help will help his mental health. he'll have people to cook his meals, do his laundry, monitor his hygiene, and just hang out with him. it's 4k a month for his semi-private room, which means he will eventually have a roommate (he doesn't have one yet) and they will share a kitchenette and bathroom. he has enough savings that we can pay for this for 4-5 years.as i've mentioned elsewhere, he is only 63 (too young for age-based medicare here) and he has too many assets (money &amp; real estate) to easily qualify for medicaid. i am hoping to get the house he owns sold later this year and then i will be looking into putting all the money into a trust so that he can qualify for medicaid.this stuff is so confusing, but we've got a decent handle on it right now and i am feeling optimistic for the first time in a while.tldr: finally getting dad into memory care later this month, hoping it will relieve some of my constant anxiety about his condition.", thanks for including positive stuff here <3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lhsun4/moving_dad_into_memory_care/,Moving Dad into Memory Care

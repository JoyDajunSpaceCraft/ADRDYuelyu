[removed]," i am so sorry you're being hit with a double whammy. big hugs. many people on this & related subs recommend the book *the 36-hour day* and youtube videos by teepa snow. these may not supply you a checklist for how to manage dementia from a distance, but will help you understand the disease and how to cope, what to expect. the alzheimer's association has a 24 hour hotline,  800.272.3900 where you can ask, vent, seek resources, like irl or online support groups.if your mom was associated with a hospital or hospice, they should also have information on support groups to which they can refer you.your ""area council on aging"" (search for that online + the name of your or your mil's city, county or state) may have additional resources, including practical (eg, not only about your own headspace) resources for care. your use of ""mum"" suggests you may not be in the us. my ideas are based on us experience, but i'm sure many other countries have similar resources. if that's the case, perhaps others checking in here may have other location-specific info.you might also consider joining some other subs: r/dementia, r/caregivers, r/caregiversupport , r/eldercare.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/u4ul6o/help_me_help_my_partner_please/,Help me help my partner.. please!

[removed]," try to keep her socially engaged and stimulated as long as possible. if she doesn’t know or remember something, just give her the answer in a way that lets her save face, and move on or change topic, don’t tell her she’s wrong. she may not know her neighbors today but i bet she can tell you stories from her childhood. she can still experience strong feelings in the moment both bad and good. she may not remember her favorite writers but may still enjoy hearing their work like new. if she doesn’t recognize you, she may still know her grandkids (who may be young in her mind) and you can ask her to tell you about them in third person. focus on what she can do. record her when she’s telling stories on her good days. try to enjoy the good moments, or at least what she is still able to do.try to do research to alleviate some burden on grandfather. research on social programs, adult day activities, government programs she might qualify for. it’s hard to do that long-term research while also actively managing a crisis. make sure all the ducks are in a row, legally speaking (power of attorney, will, medical directives, hipaa permissions etc) “in case she gets hit by a bus”. don’t tell her she has alzheimer’s or dementia unless she asks you why she can’t remember things etc. oftentimes patients do not remember forgetting stuff, so when people tell them they have dementia it validates the paranoia and they can believe they are being gaslighted.if she has hearing loss, she needs to get hearing aids and actually use them. unaddressed hearing loss accelerates dementia as it becomes hard to hold a conversation with details and nuances.  it is also important to try to prevent falling. remove stuff from the stuff, extra furniture that is difficult to navigate around. she might become mean and stubborn. especially in the late afternoon, evening, middle of the night. this is called sundowning. i always found it useless when people said “don’t argue and don’t try to reason with them”. imo more useful is to change topic, redirect their attention, or make up reasons to postpone the issue. if she gets dramatically worse or even crazy within a short time, get her screened for uti. get in-home help if she gets combative especially about hygiene. you and grandfather may find she is actually nicer to the aide helping her bathe instead of family. it is a neurodegenerative disease.  when she gets worse, it does not mean anyone did something wrong. if some strategy stops working, it’s not a failure; it did its job buying you some decent time. there is no cure. the goal here is her quality of life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/u4l7p6/need_a_little_help/,Need a little help

[removed]," are you set on the naming being an alliteration of sorts? i think sometimes that naming convention can be corny, so maybe something more straightforward and reflective of the act of creating? otherwise you could use a combination of: art/awareness/advocacy deed/donation/dementiaas for the theme, that’s a bit harder without it being too “on the nose” or cheesy. memory isn’t a bad one, but you can also think in other terms like color. purple is the official color for alzheimer’s, so you could suggest that artists incorporate that into their work. maybe something with elephants, as they are the unofficial mascot of of alzheimer’s too. some other ideas:- family- diagnosis- communitywhen i have a bit more time to think about it i’ll post again. this was just stuff off the top of my head, so maybe not the best of suggestions lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/u3maqj/need_advice_on_fundraising_event/,[deleted by user]

[removed]," not trying to imply support for or against, but if you wanted to get involved in trying to lower the cost of aduhelm, the alzheimer's association has been trying to get it accessible to all for a while: you could see if there is an alzheimer's association near you, especially their local advocacy activity. in my state they have us talking to lawmakers to push local and, if you want, national issues like aduhelm pricing, and using social media or whatever you're comfortable with. science moves slow...its the nature of science. ..and legislation can be slow too, but advocacy is one way us ordinary folks can speed some types of help along.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/tt0l7z/neurodegenerative_drug_development_summit_current/,Neurodegenerative drug development summit + current state of Alzheimer's research

[removed]," i second the top comment. get a power of attorney and a will. im in the uk and helping my nana with it now. it covers both finances and health. i know it sounds controlling and patronising right now - but down the line there will be a point when shes no longer in capacity to make decisions and that is where you as a family will need to step in. this is as a safeguard for her wellbeing and assets knowing its someone she trusts managing this when she cant in her best interest. she expresses the wishes and powers she wants, and who she appoints to act as her attorneys as though they were her. it doesn't have to come into effect until she's without capacity if thats a concern right now too! there are loads of options. i'm in scotland so if youre in another nation im not sure of the protocols, but speak to the memory clinic about all of this (they usually have handy info packs for both patient and family/carers). most importantly, look after yourself as well as mum! its so exhausting doing all of this at times, as much as you love them. reach out to carer and family support services for advice on how to proceed. theyre the experts at the end of the day. but ill also add that your own mum is an expert in herself; having a frank, open and empathetic conversation (while acknowledging there may be conflicts of opinions or difficulty in accepting diagnosis) is the best way forward to ensuring things are done the way your mum sees fit for herself. its still her and her life, youre just helping making things a bit easier. other little helpful things, you may or may not use them yet depending on how troublesome her memory can get at present:-leave notes for all important stuff like brushing teeth twice a day next to mirror in toilet, how long and what temp to cook food in micro or oven. keep a notepad by the phone for her to write things as soon as the call ends.- buy a big digital clock that says the time and full date and the time of day it is in full display in common area (nana loves this!)- have a weekly wall planner that has reminders to do things like go food shop or do a bit of dusting- speak to occupational therapy through social work to get adjustments to the home that make appliances and things more user friendly and safer to ensure shes independent at home as long as possible- continue with stable routines/habits e.g. leaving keys by table at the front door, going to see you for coffee at the same day and time- if she takes medications, get the gp to change them to blister packs that portion it into the day of week and time of day which js delivered to her home weekly. call to remind and wait until shes taken it, if this is a point of issue. good luck and stay well all of you xx",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/tn7v5m/helping_support_my_mum/,Helping support my mum

[removed]," i have not used either of these, but there was a period where i was looking into them as an option (mom decided to keep dad at home in the end).im not sure but i *think* a major deciding factor would be more about what kind of care the facility is qualified to give, and what kind you need. like some facilities have staff that are allowed to administer medicine, and some may not have staff thats allowed to (patient has to give medicine to themselves). some facilities aren't allowed to keep someone from wandering out, and some have a special status where they can. im not sure, but i think both of the types of residences you described may or may not have these features. you might want to see if your state and county have a dept on aging or elderly or dementia. they may have guides describing rules that may be specific for your state or maybe even a handy list of facilities identified by type of care. depending on the level of care, you could eliminate your options quickly. sorry, in case this wasnt helpful i know its not really what you asked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/tilv2e/looking_for_info_ralafc_home/,Looking for info RAL/AFC home

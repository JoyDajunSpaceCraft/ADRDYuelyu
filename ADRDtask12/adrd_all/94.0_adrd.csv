"hello everybody...my friend at 31 years old is completely sure he is getting dementia...now he have very decreased blinking...very decreased! is this a sign? he is so young, but i really dont know", this is not dementia.  your friend should see a doctor if they are concerned.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kpiw3c/decreased_blinking/,Decreased blinking
what's the youngest early onset dementia happens?," i mean, there are childhood dementias that happen as a result of extremely rare genetic disorders, but any dementia that has an onset of under around 40 is exceedingly rare, and even under around 65 is pretty uncommon (though frontaltemporal dementias and sometimes alzheimer's do onset in the 50's and early 60's sometimes)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kpi5ax/question_pls_answer/,Question pls Answer :)
"hello guys. i am 25 years old and i have been struggling with brain fog for four months. it was acute (symptoms came in fast). within about 2 hours i would say on august 18th around 11am. i would say that i have been struggling with depression for about 2 years, however i always had my mental clarity until august 18th. as you can see the picture is an mri of my brain and there is an hyperintensity in the right frontal. the radiologist said it was non-specific and could be the result of a “remote microangiopathic insult”. i also had an mra of the head and neck and everything was fine there. my symptoms really consist of a lack of clarity, trouble concentrating and an overall daze. it seems like i can’t fully wake up all the way. also i don’t know if my vision has gotten worse or my brain is struggling to process what i’m seeing as fast. everything just seems like a daze, like i’m drunk almost. i have seen 2 neurologist and they don’t think what they see on the scan is associated with how i’m feeling. it’s been 4 months and i feel the same way since august 18th. my fear is that it is vascular dementia, more specifically strategic vascular dementia. however i was knocked unconscious twice in my life about a decade ago. first when i was 14 and then when i was 15. the first neurologist i saw believes that it could very well explain the hyperintensity on the mri scan. i don’t really know how vascular dementia presents itself early on but all i know is that i very much feel like i’m in an altered state of consciousness. everything is just harder to do. planning, executing, being motivated. i hope it is a form of depression because i know that is reversible. i just never heard of depression messing with mental clarity so abruptly and fast. please, i really need help and advice on what to do next.", so sorry you feel like this. brain fog can be a tin of things like vitamin deficiency to something like pots. have you seen a hemotologost? maybe rule out any deficiencies first. brain fog is common with pots symptoms. good luck keep looking into all things meds side effects etc.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kp7dv6/25_year_old_male_acute_brain_fog/,25 year old male/ acute brain fog
"two years into the new year and already one of the best articles on the role of oxidation and alzheimer's disease has come out.  here are some of the highlights: neurogenesis *versus* neurodegeneration: the broken balance in alzheimer’s diseaseaccruing evidence indicates the role of systemic and brain metabolic aberrations, in addition to the canonical hallmarks, in ad pathogenesis (polis and samson, 2019). the up-to-date description of ad-associated pathology includes neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, instigated apoptosis, and chronic oxidative stress. of note, oxidative damage is one of the earliest events causing and following ad (nunomura et al., 2001). moreover, oxidative damage is strongly associated with neurodegenerative processes and it is a connecting factor between β-amyloidosis, τ-protein hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal loss. oxidative stress due to the disbalance between generation and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ros) plays a key role in β-amyloid-mediated cytotoxicity via a spectrum of molecular events that eventually lead to a substantial neuronal loss, which is a primary hallmark of ad, clinically manifesting in cognitive decline. in healthy individuals, excessive ros production is counteracted by physiological antioxidant mechanisms that incessantly maintain redox homeostasis. however, these mechanisms are inadequate in the ad brain tissue and do not provide the necessary protection against highly reactive species, which disrupt membrane function, impair enzymes, break polysaccharides, and damage nucleic acids...adult neurogenesis is extremely responsive to the brain pathology and correlates with its severity. neurogenesis counteracts neurodegeneration in the aging and ad brains by implicating neural progenitors in the repair mechanisms and replacement of nonfunctional brain tissue. however, the development of ad is followed by an increase in the imbalance between these two counterdirected processes. notably, oxidative stress due to numerous factors seems to be the main cause of this imbalance. the ad brain is under gradually growing oxidative stress, leading to progressive neuron degeneration and, eventually, death and atrophy of susceptible areas. on the other hand, chronic oxidative stress causes neurogenesis decline that further aggravates clinical dementia, which becomes irreversible. therefore, early diagnosis and preventive interventions targeted at neurovascular unit function and ros elimination are the most promising approaches to combat the disease. [** this can be paired with the following research: ## glutathione: a molecular whistleblower for alzheimer’s diseasethe hippocampi – the brain centres for learning and memory – are one of the earliest regions to be sabotaged by alzheimer’s pathology. our data revealed that gsh levels plummet in the hippocampi of patients with alzheimer’s as well as those with mci (fig.1). the frontal cortices – brain ceos responsible for a variety of executive functions – are chronologically affected later in alzheimer’s. gsh levels mimic this chronology with no changes in the cortices of mci patients, but significant reduction in those of alzheimer’s patients (fig.1). interestingly, gsh remains unaffected in the cerebellum – a brain region unaffected by alzheimer’s till late stages. it appears gsh decline is not ubiquitous but rather a region-specific phenomenon that appears to precisely map the progression of alzheimer’s in our brains.   [the loss of balance in the brain between increasing oxidative stress and decreasing antioxidant compounds (especially glutathione) leads to all sorts of problems such as dna damage, mitochondrial failure, neuroinflammation, misfolded amyloid and tau proteins (which further increase oxidative stress), declining levels of critical neurotransmitters, impairments in the regeneration of neurons and synapses, and neuronal cell death.  oxidation and nitration leads to the death of neurons and niitration inhibits the further regeneration of neurons and synapses.  when peroxynitrite--the main nitro-oxidant in alzheimer's disease--is scavengerd it produces water and water is a de-nitrating agent.     thus fewer neurons die and more neurons and synapses are regenerated.  so the whole key to treating alzheimer's disease is to try to restore the antioxidant capacity that the brain has lost.  this approach has been sucessefully employed  to treat alzheimer's disease: the use of a brown seaweed compound (gv-971), anavex 2-73 (blarcamesine), panax ginseng, aromatherapy, and chinese herbs combined with conventional alzheimer's medications.  see the forest through the trees and the pathway to successfully treating alzheimer's disease becomes much clearer.", i’m going to get dementia trying to understand this.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kp6ol6/oxidation_and_alzheimers_disesae/,Oxidation and Alzheimer's disesae
"hey there everyone. my name is mustafa and i'm 23. 6 months ago i was on the verge of ending my life .at a very young age where everyone is striving and working hard for a better life. unfortunately for me everything went on pause in 2018 i got diagnosed with osteoarthritis aka (disk degeneration)that's where i had to be friend chronic pain..my past 2.5 years was filled with so much pain that i lost everything in my life.my relationships went down hill , my finances were all spent on finding a cure , uni failed me since i was not able to study due to pain and so much more i sucked it all up cuz i was told there's nothing you can do about it just like alzheimer's. anyways 2020 march arrives and that's when sh*t hits the fan and got fired my job at a restaurant because i forget alot of orders and instructions that i've been given.i realized my brain is not working right. it's like i have conversation with someone in the next minute or two i realize i would forget 90% of what we talked about. let alone just that i couldn't perform normal calculations in my head . man that felt so weird coming from someone who has graduated from a levels 5 years ago with straight up a's and b's.long story short i went through different doctors trying to find what's going on and i would always make sure i'd have my phone recorder on cuz the next minute i'd step out i'd legit forget what they just told me.after weeks of visits i knew that there no hope for me man . literally every doctor said something .i got diagnosed with adhd , depression , anxiety.and the one i hated the most was ""oh i think it's all in your head"". yes sure...i tried all the meds from adderall to anti depressants you name it. they just threw pills week after week. hoping one day i come by and talk about how they helped me..unfortunately none did.i wanted to see how bad my brain was so  i found a test called moca.i think alot of you should know what this is . it's a test doctors put people on if they have cognitive decline. no doctor wanted to test me out or do a scan on my brain so i did the test on my own and my score was literally 5/30. man i knew life was over for me and my parents would have to go through this with me as well which was horrifying.time was passing by and things getting worse day by day for some reason i'd be staring at the window for no reason for minutes.days pass and weird words come out of my mouth and i'd stutter trying to put one sentence together. i think it's called aphasia.i know i'm talking so much about my symptoms but i'm trying to show you how bad my case is. but you might wonder how the hell am i typing this entire post if i had dementia..i'll gladly explain and it's why i'm putting this out.6 months ago that's when i was at rock bottom i discovered a book called ""the end of alzheimer's"" by dr dale bredesen.i was so desperate that if someone told me the cure is to eat a plate of shit . i would do it regardless if it's true or not. it's called desperation for a solution.anyways dr dale details everything a person needs to know about this disease but not just that. he's been able to reverse his clients cognitive decline with a protocol that he has extensively put out in his book .i was skeptical but i wanted something that gives me hope so i decided to follow.  jesus man 6 months in and i swear on my mom's life that it f*cking works.i have recently done the cognitive test and my moca score was 30/30.i'm able to remember conversations , my vocabulary increased , aphasia is vanishing , i can understand movies and so much more..i highly recommend anyone who's watching a loved one die day by day to give this book a shot or hell maybe you yourself are experiencing symptoms of memory loss too . there's hope for everyone no matter how far they are ...i'm not the first one who has come back to life but in the book he shares different stories of his clients who show obvious results and they have gone back to normal life..i feel sad at time i walk by a nursing home next to my house and i see a bunch of elderly probably with severe alzheimer's stuck where they are and never get to truely come back to life just like i did.anyways for me it's been 6 months and i can't say i'm fully back 100% to where i was but jesus i'm so happy things turned around when it seemed impossible..it's a journey and it takes times i can't imagine the how my next years will be. i'm looking forward to uni again 😊yeah and also i forgot to mention that my chronic pain has subsided . i finally live a pain free life. i swear the only reason i posted this is so that someone reads this and hopefully gives the book a shot . we all know how hopeless it is to hear someone go through dementia. if you got any question i'll gladly answer

"it has taken me a few days to collect my thoughts, but i think it's time i put something in writing. i hope this doesn't turn out to be too long.my wife suffers from ftd. in some ways it might be more accurate to say every one around her suffers from her ftd; it doesn't seem to bother her at all. it finally reached the point that we had to put her into full time nursing care (a nursing home). i had kept her at home hiring nurses to come in and watch her during the daytime while i was at work, but she clearly needed more attention. i won't go into all the details, but most dementia patients eventually get to that point.wednesday this past week, we admitted her into the nursing home. that was a bit of an ordeal, but it needed to happen.on my way home, i needed to stop by the grocery store and pick up a few items. while i was shopping i happened to walk down the aisle where the cookies were located. i stopped for a second and looked at them. and i had a thought:  ""i could buy cookies if i wanted to. i haven't bought cookies for years because if i did, my wife would simply eat the whole package as soon as we got back home.  i could buy a package and a few days later, i could open it and have one or two. and then i could put the package away and if i wanted another cookie later in the week, the package would still be there.""  ultimately, i didn't buy any cookies. i wasn't that tempted and i am trying to watch what i eat. but i could have if i wanted. and that's the point. that's the thought that struck me that day. i shared this moment of clarity via text message with my daughter and she said that i would probably experience a number of these moments over the coming weeks and months. things that i'm now free to do that i haven't been able to do for so long that i've almost forgotten that i'm able to do the. using a public restroom, for example. for the past few years, if it's just me and my wife out somewhere in public, i would avoid using a men's restroom because invariably she would follow me in. my daughter said, you'll probably find moments of ""freedom"" when you realize you can do things, but you'll also experience moments where something will remind you of what you've lost. be prepared to deal with those moments, as well.i'm certain she's right.later that day, she shares something on facebook that i thought i'd pass along here.  reflecting back on the decision to put my wife into the nursing home, my daughter said that there needs to be a word other than ""bittersweet"" for days like that day.  there was nothing sweet about it. it was bitter, yes. bitter because this horrible disease has taken the wife and mother away from us and she's no longer here. but there was also the knowledge that we were doing the right thing.  my daughter suggested that ""bittersavory"" might be a good word for those times.  the times when you must do something that is wholly unpleasant, but you know deep down it is the right thing to do.that's the word i'm leaving you with, today.  ""bittersavory.""  feel free to share your bittersavory moments and use the word to help you deal with those times.my heart goes out to all of you that post on this subreddit that are losing a loved one to some form of dementia or other degenerative disease.  hard decisions have to be made.  may god grant you the strength, the courage and the resolve to do the right thing, no matter how bitter and unpleasant that thing is.have a blessed new year and may you find peace and joy in the moments that avail themselves to those feelings.  tell those closest to you that you love them while they can still feel and experience that love. and don't just tell them; show them your love for them."," good word. my dad passed mid-december and one of the things i told my wife is i'd have freedom from my phone. i never felt like i could leave my phone, even in another room for fear of missing a call. i had it setup so i could be contacted 24/7 by his facility or my mom. now i can leave it behind for hours at a time if i want to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/koren6/a_bittersavory_day/,"A ""Bittersavory"" day"

(i said i wouldn't do it, gf said she would) then several days later we asked for help over a weekend in january. we we told we have been leaving too much on the weekends... that was my breaking point. my gf and i have now been apartment hunting and have 3 in mind and already have a deposit and several months put aside. we have let the family know but they still do not believe it unfortunately. we haven't told meme but we want to know exactly what will happen with her first. (she does have a good retirement fund and a few good ones in the fam that will make sure she's okay) i will honestly say that my last post and the clarity and perspective i have recieved from your comments helped me realize that i was allowing myself to be walked on and i will no longer be controlled by guilt and i will have control of every day. i am enrolled in school next semester and i am looking for a job atm. but i feel so so free and even though we are still here for a short time i feel a huge weight off of mine and my gf's shoulders. goodbye forever 2020 and feeling the guilt of others on our backs. caregivers deserve the world.. thank you all so soo much and i hope everyone enters a new year better than any other, truly.", inspirational.  i'm very glad for you.  thank you for standing up for yourself.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kluto2/update_helping_my_gf_with_her_grandmother_meme/,Update.

[here is an online depression screening you can give him.](if, however, it's not depression, or worse, it's depression and dementia, it's time to sit down with your family and start a plan. focus on what you have now, sharing time with your dad with the things that make him happy. and, hey, get support for yourself. i know some of what you're going through. my mom has moderate alzheimers, diagnosed two months ago. because of her age and risk factors, we are under tight lockdown. because of my depression and adhd, i haven't even looked for a job. you need emotional support. from your family, from your boyfriend, from your friends. i'm lucky enough that when i explicitly ask for it, my circle of loved ones comes through. you may have to be more proactive.one thing i've found is that i have drastically altered my expectations for what i need to be happy. i stay in the moment, i throw myself into my good emotions and try not to dwell on the bad ones. i hug my mom every chance i get (hugging releases all the neurotransmitters). i cook occasionally. i go outside and garden a bit. i watch favorite tv shows. if you need someone to talk at, just to vent, to make a connection, drop me a line. i am great by email, pretty good by text, and can even do the occasional phone call. this community is one of the most caring i've been in. we're here for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kllucs/i_lost_a_grandmother_and_grandfather_to_dementia/,I lost a grandmother and grandfather to dementia and now my dad’s showing signs

what do you do for nighttime incontinence? my mom’s been using diapers for a couple years now. i used to get up during the night to take her to the bathroom but she’s so out of it during  her sleep that i can’t do this anymore. i found some overnight diapers that were awesome for a few months but now those are soaked and leaking out. i realize the problem is her sleeping longer now plus just being so relaxed but i’m hoping there’s something i’m missing. thanks!," my mum always used to wet herself in the night so now she only has fluids up to 7pm and then i take her to the toilet a number of times before bedtime at 9.30pm. i also make her lunch more fluid, like pasta with sauces or soup to give her extra fluids during the day and her evening meal is drier like a sandwich or a potato omlette.  she doesn't wet herself now and she sleeps from 9.30pm to 9am.  she also has medication for incontinence which helps but took months to take effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/klgd0k/nighttime_incontinence/,Nighttime incontinence...

"so my mom and aunt have been talking about going about caring for my grandma when she reaches the point where she can no longer care for herself (she's still in early stages). since my grandma and aunt have always had a contentious relationship they decided it'd be best if she stayed with my mom and me. the problem is, i am trans male, so i'm no longer the granddaughter she used to know.she hasn't forgotten my trans status yet, she doesn't deadname or misgender me. and i know not to get angry at her when that happens because that's the dementia at work, not her.what i wanna ask is this: when she reaches the point where i'm back to being her granddaughter should i indulge that and go back to presenting femininely? or could i get away with taking on a role of, say, new guy who moved in next door, idk where your granddaughter is, she's probably out playing with friends? i've been on hormones for nearly two years, my voice is very different, and every few months my beard fills in more and more. i still look a bit like me, but that is only going to last so long.i'll be honest: i really do not want to go back to being a girl, especially for someone who's going to eventually forget that she had this ""girl"" in her life. (god, what if at some point she starts seeing me as her ex-husband? i look like a younger more effeminate version of my grandpa. that's gonna be fun.) but i also want to do a good job taking care of her and making her life as stress-free as i can. can i have both?"," you seem like a really kind person to even be considering this. that said, it is clear that presenting as female would be harmful to you. don’t do it. yes, she will be confused. this will happen regardless. my mom thinks her husband of 50 years is a new friend most of the time. don’t worry about making up a story for her, she will likely fill in the blanks however makes the most sense to her no matter what you say.i could be totally off base here, but i get the impression you are feeling guilty that something about you might make things more confusing for her. you have nothing to feel guilty for at all. she is going to be confused and while this is theoretically a little more confusing than typical, it really shouldn’t change much. at some point, she will likely expect you to be a much younger version of yourself. even if you weren’t trans, you couldn’t pass for a female child anymore and that would be just as confusing for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kkwml1/caring_for_a_dementia_patient_as_a_trans_person/,caring for a dementia patient as a trans person?
i'm moving away to concentrate on something i would like to achieve. my dad seems like he has high functioning dementia. today i told him i will cut the stolen and put it back and then when you want it you take it. he told me to put it back in the fridge. in my head i'm thinking i already told you that i am putting it back?? i can't tell for sure if there's something wrong with him personality wise or is it dementia? he has serious problems listening to other people. he also talks a lot nonsense and can't seem to make decisions. no one will believe me when i said he might have dementia.," see about having his hearing checked. a lot of places will do free hearing tests and will let the person demo them (at the appointment). since you mentioned that he’s high functioning.before my fathers memory was affected his hearing was going down a good 15-20 years before hand.  i found it annoying because i would ask him a question or tell him something and he would respond with something else. also decisions would be harder to make when it wasn’t something physical. hand queues and gesters help folks piece conversations together to get what you’re saying. reading lips a little too as your brain does a lot of things of figuring words out. so if you’re not facing each other when talking it’s purely on sound when trying to figure it out.and if the brain can’t figure it out at all you might get delays. delays as they’re trying to piece together what you’ve just said and random answers when they get it wrong.current times has made it harder on a lot of folks. masks! which also take the “tinny” tones in voices away. i found this out the when making phone calls where i had to talk to automated call centers. even the computers are having a hard time picking up the pitches. (not anti mask here, just making note that the sound waves are affected).also, some folks have voices that are just hard to hear in general. my voice is hard for my father to hear where others he can hear better. as a teen i took it more personally. :panywho... just a thought from personal experience and less doom and gloom. going to a professional for the mind may send him to get a hearing test anyways; but may be easier to have the heart to heart conversation involving “i feel like your ears are having a hard time hearing me” vs the dementia route.my father used to have a sound amplifier hearing aid but the real hearing aids are night and day difference (we went with miracle ear). it’s a crime they’re not covered with most insurances like glasses or other medical supplies.there is some thought that prolonged hearing loss can go toward dementia as your world gets more and more confusing because we depend on sounds for a lot of communications. good luck to you and your pops!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kkw506/i_cant_stand_this/,I can't stand this

(hence the crying.)you absolutely need support, but i do feel you may be relying on people for emotional support who cannot give it currently.  your mom as the caregiver, and your husband who recently lost a parent. you may need to look outside of them, or speak with a therapist to help you through.unless your mother has been a selfish unsupportive person her entire life with you (you say you want her to support you for once. if you mean in this lifetime, i have another sub that you might want to check out) but if she has only been unsupportive in the midst of your dad's decline, i hope my response may shed some light on why.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kktbmo/who_can_i_cry_to_im_too_busy_comforting_my_mom/,Who can *I* cry to?

"i realize this post may come off as self centered, but i'm trying to figure out where my head even is right now.my dad and i have just made the decision to put my mom in memory care.  this is at the end of several years of seeing her mental health deteriorate while she insists that nothing is wrong other than parkinson's disease (a questionable diagnosis).  dad took care of her as long as he could, but very few people are wired to handle seeing their spouse become a stranger who sees every good intention as ""trying to get rid of me"".mom's side of the family has a lot of mental illness, and i inherited it myself.  throughout the process of finding a place for her, i learned that elements of mom's current condition have been present almost since day 1 (dad mentioned this to a nurse on a three way call).  while i'd seen shades of it when analyzing my childhood, the fact that it was confirmed there for every last moment from my birth until now is one of the most jarring things i've ever experienced.  it very easily could have been me going down the road mom is now, and it likely would have if i hadn't gotten help back in 2011.  what i'm having the most trouble dealing with are the feelings of resentment every time i see a childhood picture, interact with the family on that side, or try to do something simple like pick out a birthday card for mom.  i hate the fact that i'm having these feelings.  i know this isn't my mom's fault, but if everyone but me knew it was always there, why didn't anyone say a word until her first time being admitted to inpatient care following a self harm attempt?  nobody said much since then once things appeared to be ""back to normal"" either.the resentment extends to that entire side of the family, which includes at least 7 doctors/nurses.  the bulk of them have no idea what is going on now, because dad and i didn't feel they needed to know and didn't want their input.  they didn't help us arrive at this point despite knowing of the worsening situation, and the only reaching out i ever experienced was when it looked like dad was just going to remove himself from the situation.  i haven't seen any of them in person for several years and am quite frankly fine with that.i've read some articles on this subject, but it doesn't make my new role as a son any more clear than it was when the decline started.  it's to where i'm honestly considering another stint in therapy, but i really don't want to considering all the costs of memory care that are about to be heaped on dad.  at the end of the day, i will help in any way that i can.i suppose my end question is, does it get any easier over time?  please delete this book if it's not allowed."," it's ok, you're allowed to ask whatever you like. i dont know why but maybe since mental illness still carries quite the stigma it was taboo to bring up. or they didn't want to face this difficult topic. or they see it as an individual's problem or they didnt want to handle the touchy subject if you didnt display symptoms. but the bottom line is that all of that is done and gone and keeping it an open wound will do no good, and find you no answers. have to find a way to move past that and focus on now.  if you cant change the circumstances then change yourself. as far as counselling a couple thoughts, perhaps a church counselling program? if there is a university close that has a counselling program they may offer really low cost services. or maybe an online group. take good care of yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kk7d91/just_have_to_talk_about_it_somewhere/,Just have to talk about it somewhere...

"obligatory apologies for format due to mobile and for the long post.  i do not wish to self diagnose and not suggesting i have dementia but i feel i have a real problem paying attention and staying focused and i was wondering if there is any advice out there from medical professionals, family members or others that suffer from similar issues.  i (45m) have noticed a marked decline in my memory, intelligence and concentration.  this is affecting my professional and personal life.  it's hard for me to articulate but here's a few examples: in the last few years i have become extremely forgetful and am finding it very difficult to concentrate even on the simplest of tasks.  i find myself wandering in circles in the house and my attention span is quite limited.  if i don't write things down or make a note in my phone then i forget.  my vocabulary is becoming simpler when talking and i find i have to edit emails and messages a lot more for them to make sense.   i am constantly losing things.  i've lost count of how many times i've lost my wallet in the past few years.  i've left money in the atm. left my car doors open and forever leave my car unlocked.  i am forever leaving the oven on and the fridge door open. i've left the hand brake off in my car and it rolled down the driveway and wrote off a neighbours car.  i used to have a phenomenal memory especially with numbers.  i could memorise phone numbers after using them once, same as job numbers at work.  there are thousands of combinations of 9 digit numbers that consist of  location, job type and activity performed. basically every section of a street in the city has an allocated number and before i would only need to have used it once and i remember it.  same as employee numbers and vehicle registration and plant numbers.  i was a bit of a rain man and my coworkers would refer to me as such.   unfortunately now i have to consult the books or i make errors that potentially cost a lot of money.   the tldr version is i used to have an excellent memory and vocabulary and now i don't.  i would now classify my memory as poor and my vocabulary when speaking is below average.  also i used to speak a couple of languages and now i even have trouble recalling basic english terms.  it's quite distressing and exceedingly frustrating.  what makes it worse is my wife is currently overseas indefinitely as she went to her home country last christmas for an extended visit and got caught up in the pandemic border closures and close community quarantine.  the consulate has been closed since april i think and there's no timeframe for it to be reopened. she usually takes care of me and while i'm no invalid and can take care of myself i am getting worse and it's a little scary that i don't have someone to double check things for me.  i am well aware that i need to consult a doctor in order to get a proper diagnosis and i am drawing  no conclusions as to what is the cause.  i'm posting here simply because the symptoms i suffer are eerily similar to dementia.  the thing is nobody in my family has suffered from it. my mother is elderly and a little senile but it's normal old lady senility and she's not forgetful anymore than someone of her age.  i need some advice, preferably from someone that works with people that exhibit cognitive decline.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kjlfra/experiencing_symptoms_of_cognitive/,Experiencing symptoms of cognitive decline/impairment.

"my grandmother, back in 2016 had a, what they said at the time was mild, stroke. later, i found out she died multiple times on the way to the hospital and they were able to revive her every time. it’s been four years, and unfortunately what little progress she was making was stifled back in 2017 by a pt that worked her too hard and essentially tore a bunch of ligaments in her arm and it has never worked properly since. she was rendered legally blind and her left side no longer functions properly. she lost the ability to fully control her bowels and bladder. the fortunate part is that she has her husband (mid-80’s) and my uncle and his wife living basically on the property.  however she has been such a wreck this whole time that they’ve been keeping her relatively sedated using things like xanax. unfortunately this year has finally taken it’s toll i guess. the amount of medication and the extreme decrease in interaction with anyone besides my aunt, uncle and grandfather has apparently begun her “sun-setting.”she no longer believes that she’s at home. she thinks they’re holding her at another property and she begs me to take her home every time i speak to her. she cries through our phone calls, occasionally stopping randomly and starts almost giggling, then goes back to incoherent sobs. by the time we begin winding down a phone call, she just begs me to kill her relentlessly. as her grand daughter, though i grew up more as her daughter, this is really hard to see and to make matters worse i love a thousand miles away. i think some members of my family resent me for this, for not coming back and being there for her. it weighs on my conscious. today, it must have really gotten bad because my aunt started reaching out to all of us individually to let us know that she seems to “exiting the building,” if you get my meaning. she’s physically healthy so it seems this is just going to be a long haul of dementia. i don’t know much about the affliction. is this something that she could possibly come back from if they were to change her meds and bring on more “outside” interaction? or is this going to be how it ends?i’m so sad for all of us, but especially my grampa and uncle. being privy to this, especially from someone who was so outgoing, such a pillar in the family, her community and her church, to be this shell of who she was... it’s just so much. sorry for the long rambling, but it seems something you’re all going through in some form or fashion and i needed to get it off my chest."," same story with my mom. she angrily stormed out several times, even breaking the little chain on the door because it was the key/lock type. she walked out on my dad when he was in the restroom, though luckily the police found her 2 miles from home. at that, we had to turn to meds. now she's mostly in a vegetative state. so sad. i hope your family finds the safest solution for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kj7i7u/just_need_to_vent_a_little/,Just need to vent a little...

"so the first i heard of my grandmother (who is 82 or 83) possibly going into cognitive decline was this summer when she said she'd been in contact with my cousin who got covid. my cousin said she never saw grandma since getting covid. my mom said then lately grandma hasn't been making much sense or getting stories straight. a little while later grandma called my aunt from church crying saying she didn't know how to get home.i saw her in october and braced myself for not the worst but something pretty bad. i'm trans so i figured dementia would have worked its way back, peeling my new name and pronouns from her memory. nope, she remembered me just fine. she seemed pretty with it in conversations, too. asked some of the same questions over and over, but that's always been par for the course with her. i don't think she's ever been the most caring, attentive conversationalist.my mom and aunt took her to see a neurologist. according to my mom, in the waiting room grandma asked a lot why they were there, but when it was their turn to sign in she walked right up to the desk and gave her name, the doctor she had an appointment with, and her reason for seeing him just fine. she also passed the memory test with flying colors. and her mri came up normal.basically, she doesn't seem consistent.is she faking? should we confront her? part of me thinks we shouldn't, because if she's faking it's for attention and even just yelling at her is giving her more attention than she deserves. that sounds cold, but my grandma is not a nice person, in her best moods she's cold and in her worst she's volatile and abusive. if she feels lonely because no one sees her, well you reap what you sow. you should have been nicer to your daughters, in-laws, and grandkids... or at least like not yell at us or make fun of us?but another part of me wants to confront her because my mom and aunt put a lot of thought into how they would go about caring for her. i put in a lot of research on dementia to prepare myself for the coming months or years. i also (and this sounds selfish) put in a lot of worry about how my mom, sisters, or even i might get dementia one day (my grandfather had parkinson's tho so it's not like we're 100% out of the woods).what does faking vs real dementia look like? should i confront my grandma or just ignore her?also sorry if this post doesn't belong. i'm sure it's very upsetting to caregivers whose loved ones actually have dementia. i also may not sound like the nicest person in regards to my grandma, but when i say she's not nice i mean it, she has never been nice. one year for xmas she gave me more money than my sisters and they got mad at me. that is not nice.", tests don't do a good job of assessing early stage dementia.  here's one article about this - [  the assessment failed to accurately diagnosis 45% of people with early-stage dementia.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kiyjuo/i_think_my_grandmother_might_be_faking_dementia/,i think my grandmother might be faking dementia?

my mum has alzhaimers and lives in a residential home. shes 70 next month and was diagnosed aged 64.because of covid i've not been able to visit properly since march. we've had window visits but they don't seem to work out well. theres staff there and there's a lot of confusion as to why im outside. its not enjoyable.i've spoke to my mum this morning on the phone and noticed a deterioration. she asked me which christmas was coming up and asked me how my mum was and then wouldnt accept she was my mum. this is all new for her and its upset me.how do i deal with noticing these changes in her condition? i know there's going to be more and eventually my mum will be a shell of the person she was. it really is the long goodbye and i'm struggling with how to deal with it. whats ironic is im a mental health nurse who looks after people with alzheimers. maybe i'm used to looking at this with a logical nurse head and i've not let myself emotionally react to it. any advice would be gratefulthank you," i work with alzheimer patients as well. i think there are two things making this ordeal harder. deterioration on her part is probably from stress on top of an already mentally deteriorating disease. a lot of my residents struggle with wanting to go home even if they do not realize what has happened or is happening. they merely fixate on leaving to go home. they still know they have ppl they love they just get jumbled. so the part in this i think we can find to be a positive is she is not rejecting wanting to be your mom - it is just covid has made her distant. for instance one of my residents refuses to accept her young pic as herself. i understand her life before alzheimers and i know what she loves to discuss which is aesthetics and design. so she has distanced herself from an image that no longer fits. so to help her remember her beauty i find ways to remind her she is beautiful by talking abt her smile and such. so i think it would help if you can circle the mother topic. also my grandfather has alzheimers and forgot i was his granddaughter bc i do not have a chance to visit. he remembers better with time when you keep circling. its a matter of great patience. in terms of how to cope - just like my residents love when i let them talk about what they want (some are still high functioning - but all can have articulation of thought) be sure to talk as well. alzheimers arises and worsens due to multiple issues - strokes (lack of oxygen), trauma (things we repress or head injuries), genetics (apoe), etc. so allow her to keep talking so you can continue to familiarize yourself with her still being your mother instead of a shell of her. memories are made by impression and they are retained by reinforcing and validation. so hang in there. it is very hard seeing our family in the predicament but you are in the right profession to help you cope with knowing the tools. remember she loves you, misses you its just harder for her to remember with distance. eventually i believe in spring they are discussing allowing visits. be strong!!! hugs and much love from afar",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ki3xh5/people_with_family_members_with_dementia/,People with family members with dementia

"i've been writing posts on my grandpa's failing health. it all started early on the 19th, grandpa collapsed in his home and went to the hospital with an elevated heart rate. early sunday morning, his heart gave out and doctors did shock him back. however, the doctors and my family decided to put a ""no resuscitate"" order on him if his heart were to give out, again. amazingly, he is still beating and such. i'll admit, his spirit is pretty stubborn, but his body is ready to go. i feel awful in saying such things, but with him being 93 and having suffered 20 odd years of dementia, i feel he should finally find some peace, even in death. today, my family thought it would be best to move him into hospice. i honestly feel it's better than dying in a dingy hospital room. in hospice, he would be in a warm bed and such. i think he would want to see the new year or see one more christmas before passing. i have developed this weird belief for those who lost their memories of wonderful times, for when we die, we gain them back and relive them. i did develop an appreciation for death as it provides comfort for both the deceased and living loved ones. it's really the one friend that we don't understand very much. i do hope grandpa lives to see one more christmas before he passes. it would be nice for him as he would want to live it.", thank you for sharing. hospice can be so helpful for you and your family.  best to you.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/khvgci/grandfather_and_hospice/,Grandfather and hospice

"... when you’re trying to see their point of view to figure out how to do what they want you to do.  their perspective has just become so confusing, so irrational.  trying to react to that in a way that “pleases” them becomes so difficult.  i suppose that has forced/allowed me to become less of a people-pleaser simply because there often is no right answer.  oof."," i feel the same. my mother accused me of stealing a few weeks ago (a board game) and called the police on me. the police came to my house and handed me a contact card for a family distress centre. she couldn’t shake the idea that i took it. i told her if she didn’t get evaluated as the police had recommended to not come to my home again. now she’s told me that she doesn’t want to spend christmas with thieves. she’s at my sister’s home for christmas, which is a mixed household. this is against  restrictions and i’m worried sick. i spent the year taking care of her and keeping her safe. now she’s ignoring me. first time in my life that i have no family with me for christmas. i’m pretty upset but trying to hide it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/khrnjt/being_a_peoplepleaser_becomes_even_more_difficult/,Being a people-pleaser becomes even more difficult when the other person gets dementia...

"long story made short; my gf and her uncle were taking care of her but when her uncle could no longer stay i decided to move in to help. i was over a lot of the time anyways and my gf couldn't do it all herself. it has been great in many ways, we have saved up quite a bit and haven't had to worry about bills. and meme (the grandmother) has a very cozy home and is a wonderful lady. however, she has dementia and it can be very difficult. i stay with her all day because i lost my job due to covid and her family pays me (a small amount) to just feed her and visit and make sure she isn't alone too much. it has been pretty difficult lately however. we have had family get covid and had to stay away for over a month so i have had no break and i am noticing my patience getting smaller. i am trying to learn more about dementia, and how to talk to meme when she creates things in her mind and just going along with things. but she just needs sooo much attention recently and i just can't do it all. after visiting for an hour or two i really reaaally need to have equal time alone, but she has been following me and claiming that she is so lonely and gets really sad. i am afraid she forgets that i just sat with her for an hour. i feel like it is getting in the way of my relationship too. when my gf gets off i always hope she can kind of cover me with meme, but it just doesn't work that way because she is tired from just getting off of work and doesn't really want to jump in with meme immediately or sometimes at all because of how stressful her day was. so i am sort of left to continue at night and the weekend when i am just so burned out with her. we have talked about moving out at some point, because us moving is inevitable. but her family just throws their hands up when ever we talk about moving like they don't know what to do with her and basically she is gonna have to go to a home when we leave. it puts an enormous weight on mine and her shoulders because we feel like its our fault if she goes in a home. i feel like my gf's family doesn't care as much as we do and isn't willing to give up any time or amount of money for meme, even though she literally helped them their whole lives... it just really sucks and i am so exhausted and impatient at this point. i don't know what to do."," she will feed off your energy. meditate, take small breaks like little walks, etc. you can do this but you need to be able to give more than you are giving which means give yourself time to rejuvenate and rest. you are choosing to be impatient so you can also choose to be patient. also make sure you are eating well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/khlpr8/i_am_struggling_with_helping_my_gf_take_care_of/,I am struggling with helping my gf take care of her 90 year old grandmother with dementia
"i don't really know what i can do at this point, i have moved to the uk from aus 10 years ago and have slowly watched my grandmother deteriorate every time i go back to see them.she completely lost grip on reality when my grandfather passed 3 years ago, in the last 2 years since my last visit she has gone from someone who couldn't cook but would remember to eat snacks, remember who we are, walk around the shops - to someone who refuses food, is physically violent, and spends most of her time rewashing the same pile of laundry.this side of my family have never gotten along well but they have spent the last 5 years yelling at each other, winding my grandmother up to see who's side she will take and basically acting like children - and doing the worst things you can do around someone suffering from the disease. they yell at her when she forgets things, they tell her she's losing it and that they will put her in a home (as punishment), they have massive arguments in front of her, and now they wonder why she has started to be violent.i have spent the last 12 months pleading with my mother to call a help line and start to learn more about the disease but even a few months ago she admitted to me that she didn't want to accept this was happening and the help line would make it too real.the worst part is that the stress of this is clearly causing my mum to deteriorate in the same way, she has always had a bad memory but now she has complete blanks, she struggles to use small devices like her phone, she gets completely disorientated and stressed in new surroundings. i am really worried but no one will listen to me when i say they need more professional support.they have now decided to put my nan in a home but one of the siblings is telling her that the other two are out to get her and don't care about her so they're putting her in a home. i can't see this ending well. she was in hospital a few weeks ago and attacked 3 nurses to the point they had to put security on her door. i feel like there is nothing i can do.."," your grandmothers emotional state seems very tied to her environment. though aggression is a normal symptom of sundowning/dementia, i definitely think she can get more emotionally stable. when my mom first had to go to a short term rehab facility after being in the hospital and getting diagnosed with dementia, she was very violent, screaming every night for hours and thinking everyone was going to kill her. she was more out of control because she was scared and alone and confused and with covid we couldn't see her enough. she has taken a 180 turn with the proper environmental changes and medicine/vitamins/nutrition. i 100% think your grandma can get more stable. there are also medications to consider if it is very very bad to calm delusions/psychotic episodes.the thing is it would get worse either way, dementia is a progressive disease. your mom isn't guilty of anything. this is very hard to go through. if your mom calls any helpline they will console her. try conference calling one with her so you are on the phone too. she needs to get through the denial and the guilt - no knows how to handle this perfectly. going home for a while to help your mom and standing up to her siblings for her will go a long way. this is a lot for a woman her age to handle. if your mom is the guardian, she is the decision maker at the end of the day. the court deemed it so. so people can share input but its not their legal decision or liability. empower your mom and gatekeep talking to her siblings for her if you can - that something you can do from where you are. does she live with your mom?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/khfzv4/our_family_is_split_over_how_to_handle_my/,"Our family is split over how to handle my grandmother's dementia, no one will listen to each other and the fighting is making things 100% worse."
my grandma is developing dementia and she’s starting to forget things quickly. (she would congratulate my sister for her new son then immediately ask about the kid again what’s his name i.e over and over again) they would tell her that she already asked already and i feel like that’s wrong. because it makes her aware of her condition. basically i’m asking how do you deal with those reoccurring questions correctly without making my grandma feel bad about her condition," yeah, you have to act like she’s never received that information before.  my mother’s go-to phrase is “i didn’t know that”, even though i know she’s been told something pretty recently.  i just say “i know, that’s why i’m letting you know now”.  it takes a goodly amount of patience to keep saying that, but she doesn’t get agitated this way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/khenuq/dealing_with_dementia/,Dealing with dementia

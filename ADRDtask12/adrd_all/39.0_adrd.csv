"hey evreryone. i just moved my mom with alzheimer's to my house in another country with my husband and my 18 months baby and i feellike i've bitten off more than i can chew. she was living alone with my uncle helping when she'd have technical problems like cpu or tv or taxes. but i realize she was not going out  other than for a few horrible things to eat. stopped bathing would only watvh tv and surf as best she could. would never clean (shes blind in one eye) etc... at first when we mentioned  her moving he was wishy washy then she was all for it (so much so she confused months and left countless angry voicemails thinking i was in her city and not coming to get her). we rented a new house to have room for her with a garden, only cause she has  very  comfortable retirement money andshe can save on rent while pitching in with us(1000euros in paris for her ine bedroom/500 euros for the house with us). it was a very tiring 2 months  to move to the new house then travel 10.5 hours to move her things organize everything and come home with her. but the whole  time we were moving her she was either confused what we were doing not noticing her things gone in the appartment or leaving more angry messages why we werent coming to get her. in the plane it was 50/50 she slept some. at some point didn't recognize me. didnt realise she was in a plane ... now we're home and first night she has a panic attack cries she wants to go home calls for her parents etc.. i had to sleep next to her with the baby i'm still night nursing not beeing able to sleep. the nextmorning she was perfect. knew she had moved by choice talked about having to change her routine etc. we got a prescription for sleeping pills and anti anxiety medication. then it was sundowning. she took her pill it knocked her out but she still wanted us to drive her home to sleep in her own bed. it was a struggle and this morning she still wants to go home. does it get better?  i have a new baby i feel like i can't go to my obgyn appointment or take my driving lessons or take care of my family's papers like usual because i feel liek i have 2 babies to take care of. if we put her in a home we have to move again because  we can't afford the place. im exhausted. so is she. my husband is annoyed but super supportive. what do i do? it's horrible. the lying to keep her calm is exhausting and she can't do anything on her own."," honestly, it doesn't get better. i live with my grandfather (who has alzheimer's) and two other people, and even then it's frustrating. my grandfather has those moments where he thinks he's just visiting in the house he's lived in since he was married. other times he will get dressed becuase he thinks he has somewhere to go. when we gently tell him he doesn't have to go anywhere, which is the truth, he will say that he will find someplace to go, even if he has to walk there. it's frustrating because it's not like we can restrain him physically (that could be considered abuse), but we don't want him to go out alone. plus, who's to say that, while we're getting dressed, he goes out on his own. thankfully that hasn't happened yet, but it could.it's awful when they get hostile. my grandfather has called me an idiot once or twice when i told him i am in my pajamas because i don't have anything to do that day. this was when he got dressed and was going to find someplace to go, even if he had to walk there.he also has poured orange juice, water, coffee, and even his vitamins in his cereal on different occasions. we have to watch him like a hawk basically whenever he eats.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/70eirc/does_it_get_better/,Does it get better?

"hi, i'm wondering if anyone has any experiences or stories they could share about inpatient care with the purpose of finding different medications to help with my father. for a little background my dad was diagnosed with early onset alzheimers about 5 years ago. he is 58 now and recently things started to take a bit of a turn for the worse. his mood has changed from pretty happy go lucky to getting upset or frustrated more often. me, my mother and younger brother have been trying to deal with this the best we can but obviously it isn't easy.he's been on a few different medications to try and calm him down and keep his mood stable. a week ago this past saturday there was an opening for inpatient care at the hospital where they would try different medications and see how it effects his mood so that we can better take care of him at home. without going too much into the different medications his mood has changed it seems since being in there to a more manic state. he doesn't seem to want to sit in one place and wants to keep moving around but there really isn't much space there other than walking up and down the hallway. at the beginning of the week we were set to bring him home thursday but last night he had hallucinations and now they want to change his medication yet again and keep him there over the weekend. this is going to put his stay there at over 2 weeks.between all of us we have visited every day for a while. sometimes as a whole group, individually, but he has at least had someone come each day. the conditions don't really seem to be great to me. he can't leave the tiny wing he is in and there is no chance to get outside at all or anything while he is there. it doesn't seem like they have much for these patients to do and i'm starting to feel like his condition is deteriorating due to being locked in there consistently. i'm not a doctor and i'm not looking for someone to tell me one way or the other what to do. i have a bit of a distrust of doctors which i know is somewhat irrational and we don't want to make any rash decisions here but our family is starting to lean towards going against their advice and bringing my father home. outside of us visiting the nurses don't seem to try and engage the patients much and all the doctor is look over their notes to decide what mediations to try. learning today that they want to keep in him there so long was devastating since we were all really looking forward to him being home tomorrow. i'm in tears and going through just about every emotion in the book. our family isn't going to decide anything until tomorrow but i can't help but feel that this environment is having an effect on his mood too and not in a good way.does anyone have any experiences or stories they could share?"," are [memory problems](  affecting  you or your  loved ones?we need to find better medicines for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease. you can make a difference. your blood donation can help develop break through research today.  the parexel early phase unit located in glendale, ca is looking for people who meet the following criteria: * be age 50 to 80 * diagnosed with alzheimer’s disease **if you qualify and complete participation by providing  a small blood donation, you may receive up to $100  in compensation.** the project involves one screening visit and if you qualify the procedures will be done  on the same day. for more information, please visit ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6vkyl9/any_experiences_with_inpatient_care_to_test/,Any experiences with inpatient care to test different medications?

"please somebody help me as i need some sound advice. over the past couple of years, i have noticed that my mom's (age 47) memory has been slowly declining. it started off as a few minor things (such as forgetting where she placed her keys, her phone, etc.), but in these past couple of months, i've noticed that she's becoming even more forgetful (forgot my brother's birthday, a doctor's appointment, put some chicken in the oven for lunch but forgot to turn the oven on and noticed it 8 hours later at night). in the beginning, i didn't think these things were a big deal because everybody starts forgetting stuff as they get older, but i'm getting more and more nervous as the days go by. and nervous is an understatement because i am scared...my parents divorced 5 years ago, and i've been living with my mom ever since. as part of my parents divorce settlement, my mom hasn't been allowed to go to work anymore (or else she would lose the alimony checks), so i feel like part of her memory decline also comes from sitting at home 24/7 and not doing anything that stimulates the mind (i bought her a kindle with my own money and she literally plays candy crush on it all the time). and now, i'm scared that i'm losing my mom, and i've told her to go to the doctor multiple times to get it checked out but she always brushes it off and says she's fine, but i have this gut feeling that she is not. i love her so much and she means the world to me, and i want to do anything/everything to help her. does anybody have some advice on how i could try and convince her to go to the doctor and get checked out? also, for the mean time, are there any fun memory based games which she could start playing to improve her memory? i just want my mom to be like she used to be before my parents divorced. i don't like seeing her this vulnerable."," please, don't pressure your mum to go to see a doctor because she'll only get more stressed.please do pressure your mum to join some local clubs, volunteer for some charity or other, do anything at all to get her out of the house regularly. age 47 is not 'old by any means, and she is far too young to be stuck indoors 24/7.maybe also question the alimony settlement. is it right that somebody is prevented from going to work because they've been divorced?good for you for asking, and good for you for being concerned about your mum. you've been raised as ""a good 'un""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6ufitv/please_help_me/,Please help me
"this is kind of urgent. my grandmother is in a memory care facility and the staff has told my mother that she needs to be more heavily medicated because she yells ""help!"" all of the time and it is causing a disruption i her facility. the staff has said that if she does not stop then she needs to go to a psych ward again for evaluation and she can only return to their facility if she stops the yelling.this is the second facility she has been at because of this issue. my mother is at her wits end because there is nowhere else for her to go. how can we get her to stop the yelling? as far as i know there is nothing physically wrong with her. they walk a fine line between under medicating and over medicating. she gets visited every day by my mother and my grandfather, who is battling cancer at the moment. my father had the observation last night that she was yelling while in the middle of dinner, when everyone was there with her. it's completely involuntary and i know it will go away in time but we are afraid that the facility won't wait very long.someone, please help us help her."," so, there has been a major update to this situation.  my grandmother fell the evening after my post and hit her head on the ground.  she is known to try and get out of bed on her own and even though she was wearing an alarm, the staff could not reach her in time to stop her fall.  it has happened before and it truly no fault of the facility.this meant that she was in the hospital for a few days.  while there, the nursing home had a staff meeting and they decided as a group that they could deal with any situation regarding my grandmother until the end of her life.  long story short, she gets to stay.another thing to happen is hospice has now been called.  the hospital believes that she is nearing the end of life while the nursing home thinks that she was on mass amounts of pain meds in the hospital and they view her as just the same as she had been.  no matter, the nursing home was very excited about the prospect of hospice as it allows them to provide another lever of care for my grandmother that they wouldn't otherwise be able to provide.since she returned to the nursing home yesterday, her meds have been reevaluated and her yelling is still there, but much much more subdued.  we can only hope that all of this continues for the better in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6u51ec/grandmother_wont_stop_yelling/,Grandmother Won't Stop Yelling

"i love my wife to distraction.she's in her mid-50's, and has early onset alzheimers.up until 2 weeks ago or so, her symptoms turned her into a kind of goofy, good-natured bimbo. i guiltily admit to appreciating those symptoms. it was kind of fun, in a dark kind of way. at least, we could joke together about stupid stuff, listen to our old favorite music, and watch stoner movies (*dude, where's my car*) and laugh together, knowing that each understood what was going on.about 2 weeks ago, her behavior changed. she would wake up in a foul mood, accusing me of trying to kill her, physically striking me. this mood would typically last an hour or so, and then she would calm down. but for the past week, it's been an ongoing saga throughout the day, and indeed, she's begun waking up at 3am and begging me to call her father, or the ambulance. and of course physically assaulting me.her behavior is also such that she has become incredibly obsessive. touching things and naming them: ""eso is mi camisa"", ""this is from my daughter (when it isn't)"", etc. hitting her teeth and saying ""these are my teeth"". pulling her hair and saying ""agua, agua"". if i weren't actually living this nightmare, i would swear it was a bad impression of actual insanity.i've had to cancel her emergency appointment with her neurologist because i couldn't dare let her out of the house into a taxi in her state. he suggested i call emergency psychiatric services, but i dare not, because i don't know if here in south america what the hell they will do with her.tonight, it was the worst, i think. i put her to bed, and after i tucked her in, she looked at me with a most earnest gaze, and asked ""sos real?""**are you real?**my heart has been broken a score of times before. but with that question, it feels well and truly beyond repair."," try asking about antidepressants in place of the klonopin.my main basis for that suggestion is how things went with my mother.her dr. wanted to rule out atypical, undiagnosed depression as the cause of her memory problems, so she was started on prozac.her condition progressed, she went to live with my sister, eventually my sister and i thought it made sense to quit the prozac, since it was clear by then that her symptoms were not caused by depression.within a couple or so weeks, my mom's temperament had taken quite a turn for the nasty, just completely, hostile and angry, radically opposed to everything.so we had the prozac added back in, and life got nicer again, for my sister, but also for mom.if you want to prepare for such a conversation with drs., wikipedia has a pretty good breakdown on the different types of antidepressants.  prescribing antidepressants is way more art than science, all they can do (to the best of my knowledge) is pick one to try (usually, of course, one that has been observed to be useful for the majority of people), and then see if it does any good.but if it doesn't, the thing to do is try a different one.so if you read up on them, you'll have a better idea of when you might want to press to keep trying, as opposed to throwing in the towel and heading back to klonopin...hope this helps...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6ruqds/so_this_is_what_slipping_down_a_level_looks_like/,So this is what slipping down a level looks like to me.

"this is gonna be a long post but i have been worried and freaking out for the past few months and i needed to ask somewhere about this...i am worried my dad might be developing eoa. i have been thinking about this since around the fall of 2016.my dad just turned 78. he had me when he was 59 so i grew up with an old father compared to the average kids my age. but i never had an issue with him. he was very healthy and active, and while his fitness and strength have declined over the years, he lives happily every day and has had very few health issues since i was born. he is an everyday smoker by the way.he is the youngest of five brothers (actually, six, one of them passed away very young). of the other four, two have alzheimer's and two are healthy. also, one of his cousins, who also had alzheimer's, just passed away.i have never felt any issues with my dad's mental health until very recently, when i saw somethings that disturbed me. however, upon looking on the internet signs of early onset ad, it seems like many different pages have the very same text which lists ten symptoms and describes them in a rather ambiguous and extreme way. let me explain this: one of the ""early signs to look for"" often found in these articles is ""misplacing objects"", and it uses the example of a person placing a watch in the freezer. well, my dad does not do such things, but he sure has been losing a lot of stuff recently or forgetting where he left it around the house (we are talking normal places to put those things here).anyway, since these articles seem pretty vague to me, i wanted the opinion of others based on what i've recently observed:this year my dad divorced my mom after a lot of fights, but honestly, mainly due to his fault. he had just been very careless about his family and often insulting, and despite there is a lot to talk about this, he simply took his things in anger and left the house rather than talking about it. also: when trying to talk to him about an issue or a disagreement, once he faces facts or opinions that he dislikes, he just gets very annoyed and refuses to talk, or leaves very angry.these last months, he seems to forget he says some things. for example, i am with him and he tells me about how he saw a friend of ours recently. later that day, say five or six hours later on another conversation he tells me the same thing. this only happens once or twice until he eventually moves on, but it happens almost on a daily basis.my dad has always had a ""unique"" temper. he is proactive and happy but can always turn very angry quickly because of a fight or things that bother him. it's always been that way. but recently, it happens way way more often. if i disagree with him on something and he argue about it he usually gets mad about it (i have bad nerves and get very heated up when i argue with people). so we just stop talking to each other. but what surprises me the most is that a couple of hours later he will just call me in a friendly way and almost ignore the fact that we just had a very bad fight, he just says ""forget it"" and moves on way quicker than he would in the past.he also tends to forget where he leaves his things more often.due to this divorce i mentioned, he's grown more suspicious of my mother (although he's always been a bit like that). in consequence, he often changes all of his passwords, pins...etc only to forget them later in a month or two. he changes them so often he has a mess of passwords in his head now.we usually talk about the past, when i was a kid, when he was single and stuff. he remembers every single detail, and we talk about that without a problem. but it´s the short term things he forgets. he also confuses the date, say it's wednesday, but he will ask me: is it tuesday or wednseday today? this happens to me too, but not as often as to him.i am just scared and afraid this might be the beginning of the worst times of my life. i love my dad. both of my uncles that have alzheimers are in a very bad state and i would hate to see my dad like that someday. please be totally honest and tell me if you think this is normal aging or ad.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6rg5s9/is_my_father_gonna_be_okay/,Is my father gonna be okay?

"sorry if this isn't allowed. i just need to rant for a minute. i apologize for how long this post is going to be.okay, a little bit of background info. i'm 18 years old and i currently live at home with my parents, and will do so until i move to a different city for college in a matter of weeks. my grandparents on my father's side of the family live in the same city as us, in a house that is a very short drive from ours. neither of my grandparents from my mother's side of the family are still alive (both died from lung cancer and i was too young to remember them that well). my aunt (father's sister) lives in a different state, so it's difficult for her to help out when she has to get on a plane just to see her parents. we tragically lost my uncle this past october, so my father is carrying a lot of the responsibility on his shoulders.as of yesterday morning, my grandmother was diagnosed with severe alzheimer's. i, personally, had seen it coming for a while; her health has been declining very rapidly since may of last year and my uncle's tragic and untimely death in october only made things worse. when i say her health has been declining rapidly, i mean so rapidly that she has transformed from a completely mobile, lucid, self-sufficient woman who acted half her age (she is currently 85 years old) to a shell of the grandmother i once knew. she has no concept of time, gets confused very easily, is prone to violent outbursts, and can barely remember who her own children and grandchildren are. my grandfather is an 88-year-old war veteran and an embodiment of the greatest generation. he is both physically and mentally stable and someone i have looked up to for my entire life (he's the only grandfather i've ever known), yet he could not possibly be sugar coating this entire ordeal more. oh, she tends to get confused during the mid to late afternoon? it's okay, she doesn't need to take the correct dosage of her meds, let's only give her half so she's not as stimulated! she fell down a set of stairs in their house because she was confused and scared? we don't need to take precautions with that to avoid it in the future, it won't happen again! i wish he would open his eyes and see how bad it's gotten.my father has been taking this whole ordeal particularly badly. since he is the only child of theirs who lives in the same city and state, it has been up to him a lot of the time to find good, reputable nurses to provide 24-hour care to my grandmother and take care of business regarding matters with them. i can only imagine how hard it must be for him and i can't imagine what he's going through, but he's only doing the bare minimum of what could be done to help. he talks about how hard it is, how he can't stand to be over at their house and see his mother in the state she's in, etc. i totally understand why he thinks that way; it freaks me out to see my grandmother in this state too.however, at the end of the day, i feel as if since it's his mother and she needs his help, he needs to step up. does that make me a bad person for thinking that way, knowing what my father's going through? i know the only thing i can do is provide love and support for him. i just wish he would step up more, and i wish my grandfather would open his eyes and see how bad my grandmother's condition has truly gotten, rather than turning a blind eye. i love my grandmother, she's basically the only grandmotherly figure i've known my whole life and i want her to continue to get the help she needs and deserves. thank you for listening, reddit. i needed to blow off some steam. if this isn't allowed, i'm sorry and i'll remove the post."," just a couple of questions:how much have you communicated with your father and grandfather about the situation? and with your mother and any brothers or sisters?it's obviously a tough situation but if you can all come to a consensus about your grandmother's condition and what to do about it, it'll make things a lot easier.even if you don't all agree at first, it's important to keep talking and emailing and texting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6obmxq/need_to_let_off_some_steam/,Need to let off some steam.

"some background: my grandfather was diagnosed with alzheimer's a few years ago. he still remembers family, and he tells stories often, but forgets things like when he last ate, where his room is, etc. basically, he doesn't retain short-term memories. one interesting result of this was that a few months ago, he took a butterfly decoration from my mother's garden and put it on our mantel. when my mother later asked what it was doing there, he said he had bought it sometime ago, and had put it up for decoration. arguing is often pointless, and this was harmless, so none of us tried to tell him any different. since then, it's become a story he's told me a good few times - about how he bought it, even though it was expensive. it was the last one there, and a lady tried to buy it off of him, but he refused and brought it home. that's the story he tells me, and i listened every time, because the way he spoke of it and looked at it made it sound like it was precious to him. nothing had ever really come of it, except a few laughs among the rest of my family when i would recite what he told me. today, however, he told me something that through me for a loop - he said he was giving it to me. he explained it to me like one would a child - he told me that when he left, he might forget to take it with him, and that if he did, that i should have it, and not let anyone take it from me. at first, i was caught off guard and a bit concerned - where was he planning on going? but as the night continued, he told me that same thing a few times until once he made a motion with he hands when was talking about leaving - up, towards the sky. it was then that i realized that he was telling me that he wanted me to keep it when he passed away. he said he had had that butterfly there for a long time, and he would be satisfied knowing it was in my care, and that i shouldn't let anyone take it from me. i had to excuse myself after this, because i was on the brink of tears. i was so touched, even though i knew it was something from the backyard, because i had known that he had come to think of it as something important to him. when i had collected myself, i came back, and when he told me again that he wanted me to have it, i properly thanked him. he told me to take it to my room, so now it's sitting on my nightstand as a reminder of this moment. i know he might forget what he did tonight, but i never will. i wanted to share this on here because i know it can be hard, very hard, to watch and care for someone with alzheimer's, but this reminded me of why we were doing it. it was a moment that touched my heart. he was not perfect, but he was a good man, and even despite this disease, he still is.tl;dr - my grandfather took a butterfly decoration from the backyard, said he bought it a long time ago, and as time went by, he became emotionally attached to it. tonight he told me that he wanted me to have it, so that when he passed away he knew it would be in good hands. it brought me to tears.", so sweet! how nice that you received the beauty. seems like a great family. could you tell me how you know it's alzheimers and not just plain dementia? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6nyn2z/a_gift_from_my_grandfather/,A Gift from My Grandfather

"i've been having some arguments with my mom the last year or so (she's 62 &amp; 1/2), but we've always had a difficult relationship. there's been little things like she'll insist ""i never said that"" to things she's definitely told me about an issue she's apparently flip flopped on. i've chalked it up to her normal bullshit. yeah, okay, ""you never said that"" /s. then when we were rehashing an often retold family story of when i broke my leg as a child, she was suddenly shocked and said ""your dad was there?! i never knew!"" but the thing is my dad was abusive and that memory was pivotal in my development. he wasn't the focus of the story, and it's possible i glossed over the details over the years.. but it's odd. in the story i was calling out for his help before i fell onto cement from 15 feet, and he actually immediately left because he didn't want to get into trouble for being there in the first place. there have been other stories i've told her about my dad and she just shakes her head saying if she knew any of it she would have done more... but the thing is i was a vocal child. i'm pretty certain i told her then, and have told her repeatedly since of what went on. but i was thinking maybe it's a deflection tactic, or maybe she's flipped into denial. who knows.on our skype calls she rehashes the same things again and again. bullshit gossip about her sister and extended family that there's been no update on in at least 6 months (she believes her sister has early onset alzheimer's or done brain damage from an accident), the garden, and whatever poison fox news is feeding her now. i get that she doesn't have much going for her and doesn't have a lot to talk about, so i just humor it all.then this last week my brother and sister in law were planning on going over to dinner at her house, but due to the recent heat wave and her having no ac they decided to do it at their house where their infant would b be most comfortable. all of this was discussed over text. an hour after she was supposed to come over they finally called her and she kept insisting they were supposed to go over to her house. my sil kept giving her an easy out, saying there must have been a miscommunication. instead of taking the out my mom kept circling it, insisting somehow it was my brothers fault, citing that he was supposed to come last week but didn't because they were out of town (which is irrelevant)? my brother got so mad he ended up not going over at all, but my sister in law went with my nephew. as they were leaving my mom told her ""oh! you forgot your purse!"" and my sil replied, ""no i didn't?"" and my mother insisted she did and went back in to get it. see, the thing is, my sister hasn't carried a purse since having the baby. she just socks her wallet in the diaper bag. my mom came out of the house holding *her own purse that she's owned for 10 years, filled with her wallet and everything* in front of her by the handles gingerly, you know, as you would hold someone else's purse, and she tried to put it in my sister's trunk. sil was kind of stunned and said, uh, that's actually your purse? then my mom looked stunned and said ""oh! it must have looked doesn't because you moved it."" my sister did not move my mom's purse, they weren't anywhere near it for the 30 minute dinner. my sister in law said as much and then my mom said the baby must have knocked it over at least... except he didn't. baby was no where near the purse. the other thing is this purse is black, my mom is very particular about purses and shopped for it for four years. my sister in law has opposite taste, her purses are designer, bright colors like coral or teal, white with multicolor print soho bags. my sister in law was telling me how everything is someone else's fault with my mom, which is honestly how she's always been, but this feels different.i can't get over the purse thing, that's freaking weird. i've thought maybe it was dehydration? but i called my mom who says she drinks three of these water bottles my husband got her for christmas every day, but only before 3pm ""otherwise she's going to the bathroom all night"" (her words). i've thought maybe it was blood sugar related, she was waiting to eat for my brother to get there and was doing yard work outside in the meanwhile. she hate, hate, hates doctors. proudly proclaims how she hasn't been to a doctor in 10 years, she thinks they're just money sucking vacuums that don't actually do anything and will tell you whatever to get a profit on getting you medicated. she thinks counselors are only for ""crazy people"". she's so stubborn, will not budge an inch if you begged &amp; pleaded, screamed at her, cut contact, bribed her, even for the most simple benign requests. she will make every excise in the book not to exercise (it rains too much, it's dangerous, she has allergies, it gets dark too early and she wears glasses and could trip!!). i have never once gotten her to do something she doesn't want to do, doesn't matter what it is.i don't know. thoughts?

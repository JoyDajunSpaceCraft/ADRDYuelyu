my dads been living in a nursing home for almost 2 years. i did a window visit on january 9th. he is bedridden and can barely sit himself up or move. he looked like death. he was confused by my visit and when presented with an ipad to do facetime he told me to go away...i had my second child on 2/4 and want to tell him via a card but don’t want to make him cry which i’m told he did last time i sent pictures.," im so sorry you’re going through this. i really get it, you should not force yourself to do something that makes you uncomfortable, everyone deals differently with this situation and you should not feel guilty for the way you decide to handle it. if you decide to go when visits start again, if showing him pictures of your kids makes him sad, maybe instead of talking about the present and what is going on right now, you could share some older memories you have with him. dementia patients tend to react better with long term memories.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m3hi2e/i_feel_guilty_that_once_the_nursing_home_opens_up/,"I feel guilty that once the nursing home opens up in-person visitation, I will still not want to visit him..."
"my mom is 73. she has always said things to my sisters and i like “i know your dad is cheating” or “your aunt is trying to get money from us” we have heard these things over and over for so many years. the last couple of years things have slowly started getting worse. last year around september she called me and said “your dad told me he wants a divorce, he has another woman and he is leaving me” i asked questions and then it came out that he never actually said those things. i didn’t ask my dad because he’s a jerk and i knew he would yell at my mom if he knew she called. at this time i had no idea that my mom was having back pain and i’m still unclear as to wether she was on pain meds at this time. my sister went and said she was taking medicine and acting “bat shit crazy” so they went to a different doctor, got different meds that my sister decided my mom couldn’t take. my mom ended up getting a spinal block and we thought she would be better (she had a panic attack about a week after she called and told me my dad wanted a divorce). my mom has been having crying spells since at least september where she is just sitting there and starts crying and asking my dad if he wants a divorce and bringing up that she hates his family and different people in his family did this or that to her 50 years ago. she had a very traumatic experience when she was 19 or 20 and she’s bringing that up but the story she’s always told is now a little different. she passed out about a month ago and she had blocked arteries and had surgery. one was cleared but they couldn’t get the other one. these arteries run up her back the surgeon said that could be the cause of the emotions and memory loss (she only has memory loss like my dad will say something to her and 5 minutes later she doesn’t remember what he said). the surgery hasn’t helped her as far as emotions or anything so now we are trying to figure out how to help her. she’s almost having panic attacks because she’s so upset. she’s lost 30lbs also. she’s been to a neurologist and he said she has no dementia and seems fine but they scheduled her a memory test. she also had an mri. i’m really desperate to help her and i posted on fb and they think it’s dementia and said i need to get a second opinion. she doesn’t go into an episode of thinking she is in her past at all. she just talks about her past as if she just can’t let these things go.she doesn’t seem to forget her past or even who anyone is. she doesn’t forget where she is. she does not remember what the doctors say at her appointments or where she put her glasses. she is on a cholesterol medication and klonopin. she also takes vitamins. i know this is a lot of info but i’m trying to be thorough.does this sound like dementia? depression and anxiety? could it be that she’s just afraid she is getting closer to death and she scared? i just don’t know what to do to help her.", yes we have known about the utis but she has been tested and doesn’t have one. i will say a couple of years ago she kept getting them and they would give her antibiotics but it never seemed to go away. or possibly it just kept coming back. doctors weren’t a lot of help though about it. they did say it has nothing to do with what she is experiencing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m3gl99/trying_to_figure_out_if_my_mom_has_dementia/,Trying to figure out if my mom has dementia
"my mom is near the end stages of dementia and lately she has seemed to be in distress. the past few years as she has declined she's seemed to have gotten happier and a bit cheerful. it's like suddenly it all changed. lately when i've seen her, over zoom or in person, she just turns her head back and forth while looking concerned and makes noises trying to speak. it is really just awful to watch and i hope she isn't suffering but it sure looks like it.she is on all pureed food, hasn't been able to speak for over 2 years and has been confined to a wheelchair for even longer. i think she's going to die soon but she's only 57 and otherwise healthy and has lived with dementia for over 15 years already so i'm worried this may be dragged out for a while longer.has anyone else witnessed this in someone late stage?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m33oht/end_stages_looking_distressed_while_repeating/,"end stages, looking distressed while repeating movements and trying to speak?"
"glad i found this group in addition to my regular virtual support group and occasional therapist telehealth visit. for about four years my adult kids and i have been dealing with my wife’s (their mother) clear cognitive issues, combines with an overwhelming denial and anger when trying to talk about it. refusing to see a doctor, even for other issues such as renewing a statin rx, or an unknown skin lesion. just a horrible situation that we’re all so sad (and of course frustrated and angry) about. don’t see any way out until the inevitable train wreck. our daughter even did an instagram live with a podcaster friend, that with her permission i shared with my wife. last night during a particularly stressed conversation, i did that, with poor results. a few friends have talked to me, but mostly to each other that i eventually hear about. new suggestions would be great, but mostly just to share. thanks"," i am dealing with a very difficult situation with my wife also. she was diagnosed 4 years ago with onset dementia and it has progressed quite a bit. now there are occasional bouts of extreme anger and frustration (to include attempts at pinching, biting, hitting, kicking me). when that began, i would get angry and defensive, but i grew quickly to realize it was not “her” reacting, but her disease. i had to figure it out on the fly, as i’m now doing all cooking, cleaning, laundry,  appointments, yard work,  etc.  for my sanity, i learned to remain calm and peaceful and be repetitive with phrases like “i understand“, “i’m sorry that bothers you”, “ what can i do to help”.  even though she may not completely understand my part of the conversation, a calm reaction helps soothe her.  her thoughts and responses are not translating into correct replies many times, which is even more frustrating for her.  best of luck to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m32ob3/wifes_denial_and_anger/,Wife’s denial and anger

"!i'm not anti vax! this is a serious question!my grandma has dementia/alzheimer since almost a year. it was quite stable. missing words, not keeping track of dates and time, repeating the same stories a few times in the same day. she's receiving some medication from geriatric (going to have a next visit soon). the thing is, after first doze of the vaccine her memory seemed to be getting worse (and for ex. she started phoning her daughters at 2am).  now she's after the second dose and her cognitive functions are declining rapidly - she's becoming aggressive, very stubborn (will not let us explain her when she's doing something wrong, she knows better), forgets to take her meds, forgets and mixes up things. generally i can notice way more symptoms of alzheimer (i know how they look like, my grandpa had it).all those symptoms started appearing after she received the covid vaccine. i know with alzheimer it can get worse suddenly but i dont know what to think about it. is it just a coincidence?does someone have experience with people with dementia/alzheimer that received the vaccine? did you notice the symptoms getting worse? or maybe you don't think there are any differences?i appreciate all the replies."," yes, my mom has alzheimers. shes only 65. since the 2nd dose, we noticed a steady decline. it was like night and day. she also randomly fell in the middle of the night the same night she got her 2nd dose. shes a good walker so not sure what happened there. im not an anti vaxer either. not at all. but its very coincidental that she was fine and then right after getting the vaccine she was never the same again. that was a month ago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m2wa7h/did_someone_noticed_a_decline_in_cognitive/,Did someone noticed a decline in cognitive functions after covid vaccine?
"i'm so beyond my breaking point it's not even okay. so sunday my sister was watching my dad and there was a show on about cookies, my father's a diabetic and unfortunately forgets he eats and will continue to engorge himself and end up with blood sugar scores of like 400. so we had to lock up the sweets, well my sister went to the bathroom and he somehow found some old cookies, chocolate cookies made with blueberry kush distillate, 90% thc. they weren't eaten because the terpenes in the distillate were so overwhelming, and please i really don't need to hear that i need to just keep this stuff locked up. my whole damn house is under lock and key, sometimes things just fall thru the cracks and these things were hella old. well sunday we think around 7 or 8pm is when he got ahold of them, around 9pm he reported feeling dizzy so we checked his sugar but it was normal but still have him a snack and he went to sleep.monday was just scary hell. he woke up and he couldn't even walk. before i go any further and have to fight off all these weed snobs trying to tell me there's no way it lasted as long as it did, my father's health problems include having a shunt in his brain and not getting enough oxygen to his brain as he should, he has heart problems, kidney problems, and numerous mental problems other than the dementia. he was mumbling and hallucinating sort of, like pointing at stuff that wasn't there etc and wasn't enunciating his words as well so i figured maybe it was his shunt failing or a seizure. we gave him his pills but that just made him worse, now remember we had no idea he gotten ahold of some edibles. i called 911 and they took him to the hospital, they did the standard tests and whatnot. few hours later they had me pick him up and i expected to see him back to normal. nope. he started screaming like a bay he had to shit so i had the nurses take him to do that while i read his discharge paperwork. first page i saw was ""cannabis use disorder"" and thought it was a mistake. but there was ""reasons being seen today: dehydration &amp; marijuana smoking"" then his labs every drug tested negative except for cannabis and it dawned on me what happened. he was still unable to walk and we put him to bed right at what we think the 24 hour mark would've been of him ingesting it. finally the next day he was back to normal except for feeling a little groggy, and he did lose his balance and fell once. he's been fine since, and yes i did have another post explaining this for those wondering. i had to delete it and rewrite it because some idiots wanted to try and tell me it wasn't possible for my dad to be high after 3 days. then i wasted precious time trying to explain it was technically over a period of two days but only 24 hours, and he still felt weird on the third day.  i get this is reddit, but don't try an invalidate the hell i just went thru or take my post as the opportunity to brag about your cannabis knowledge because i'm no noob myself.", oof. there are several drugs that have lasting effects on the elderly and should be used with caution and rarely. benadryl and opiates for example. i suppose it is possible that- since the older population has a slower system and edibles are absorbed through the digestive system - it could be in his system far longer.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m2upjd/my_dad_with_dementia_got_ahold_of_an_edible_it/,"My dad with dementia got ahold of an edible, it wasn't good!"

"what an ordeal that was, 3 days of things being abnormal. i love with my father, 72, who despite what he says has pretty extensive dementia. so sunday night he was watching a show about cookies with my sister (she also caregiver for him, we all live together so we can always watch him/keep an eye on him). now he's one of those dementia patients who gets violent when you tell them they're not allowed to do something or can't do it; such as he has an obsession about wandering and leaving the house and he obsesses about eating food. the medication that controls his violent fits is what's making him hungry, but he's a type 2 diabetic and he can't just eat junk all the time. my sister and i locked up the sweets. anyways my sis went to the bathroom, my dad did some digging around the kitchen, and found a potent marijuana edible. he took it not realizing it was medicated. around 7pm that evening he mentioned feeling lightheaded so we checked his blood sugar and gave him some food. after a few hours no improvement so he wanted to go to bed, we had to push him in a wheelchair to his bed which is very abnormal as he can still walk. i figured by morning he will be better. wrong! my sis and i had no clue he had an edible the entire time too.he couldn't walk, he was giggling, talking or rather mumbling nonsensical stuff, and was hallucinating so i sent him to the emergency room. i figured ok they'll get him fixed up and they'll figure out what's wrong so when i went to pick him up i was shocked to see him still so fucked up. he started screaming he had to shit so i had the nurses go handle that while i went thru his discharge paperwork like results of his labs and stuff. i notice a page that says cannabis use disorder and i thought maybe the doctor stuck it in there by accident...well his labs even said he tested positive for thc, then it all began to make sense. there were these really old nasty cookie edibles that have been burried under some cabinets for a long time and everyone had forgotten about them. my dad just probably thought oooo something sweet not realizing they were medicated.i can laugh about it now that he's back to normal and there was no harm done, but man was he a major pain in the butt for two days. even the day after the hospital he fell once because he was still tipsy. the edible was made with marijuana distillate which was like 90% thc instead of just making it with  marijuana bud which is usually only like 20% thc so he was bakes for days. i threw the cookies out and went on a mission for finding hidden treasures in the cabinets, that way i can know what we have in all our cabinets and know with certainty he won't get into anything like that again.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m2rsdm/my_dad_with_dementia_somehow_found_an_edible/,My dad with dementia somehow found an edible

"when mom is having a day when she is friendly and kind to me and her caregiver, she also grunts and moans constantly. it is rough to hear that 24 hours a day. even at night and when eating, she kind of moans. it's difficult to describe this noise (i sleep with ear plugs to block how bad it gets at night). you can try to redirect, etc., but she will always go back to the groaning.but one weird thing is that when mom is aggressive, she doesn't make these noises. on days when she is threatening people, calling people names, etc., there is no grunting and moaning. no clue why this is, but it's a weird phenomenon to observe. today is one of those days where even her medicine is ""poison"" and we're ""trying to kill her"" and all of that. but the moans and grunts? completely silent around here. anybody else ever witness a phenomenon like this?"," a few weeks ago my grandfather and i was sitting down having a pleasant conversation. during the conversation his ability to speak completely disappeared and all he could do was grunt and moan. i ended up calling the ambulance because it but he got so upset with me for because he hates going to the hospital that by the time the ambulance arrived he was talking clearly again. i never connected it to his emotional state  but you could be on to something. also for sleeping i bought some sleep headphones on amazon and play white noise on them to drown out all sorts of sounds, might be something that could help you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m1di07/grunting_noises_and_behavior/,Grunting noises and Behavior

"the situation:my paternal grandmother is 87 years old, she has her own little house in our backyard. my mother and i are her care takers eventhough my dad is retired and sits at home all day. her 4 sisters died from alzheimers and she's been getting worse since her husband died in 2019.recently she's been having issues taking her medication. my mother used to fill up her pill box for an entire week and hand it to her sunday night, then she'd either tell us she's out of pills in the middle of the week or she'd have pills left at the end of the week, causing a lot of arguing on whether or not she took her meds/took more than she should.recently we decided to give her the pills everyday so she at least can't take doubles and we have a better eye on it. she still sometimes claims we didn't give her the pills etc but its manageable.now about 3 weeks ago my brother said he noticed our grandma has a bunch of pills in her kitchen cabinet. my dad went to look for them and didn't find anything, grandma was insulted that we think she would hide pills. it was worrying cause ever since her husband died she'd make remarks saying she wishes she was dead too and that she would ""just take some pills and be gone"".but since my dad didn't see the pills, we figured my brother must've seen something else and moved on.now last night at dinner my mother went to the kitchen to get a glass and when she returned she whispered to me that my brother is right, theres a bunch of pills in the cabinet.now we don't know what to do. should i confront my grandma and possibly cause a lot of drama? or should i just take the pills out of the cabinet without saying anything."," yup. exactly what we went through with my mom. she'd hide pills everywhere, but with her it was because she didn't trust us to do her pills. my brother kept the week's worth locked away in a lockbox. he'd put out the daily box every morning. that worked well until the day she decided she'd save time and take all of her pills at breakfast. it didn't seem to hurt her but from then on every dose was handed to her individually, no more allowing access at all. whoever handed them to her made sure she took them all. after she was gone, even though we'd already gone through the house while she was still living and thought we had all of her pill stashes located and emptied, we found pills in lunch bags in her winter coats she hadn't worn in years, in the fabric drawers by her sewing machine, in bottles in the utility room stashed under other items. they were everywhere!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m134eb/grandmother_hoarding_pills/,Grandmother hoarding pills

my (41f) mom (71f) was diagnosed with dementia about 2.5 years ago. my dad is overwhelmed and trying to take care of her. i am military and get home when i can and i am visiting for the week. i can tell she has not bathed in quite some time and has some body odor. how do i politely suggest she take a bath? she will be hurt if i tell her she smells because she does not accept she has dementia and is super sensitive about everything. she thinks everything is an personal attack against her. should i just run a bath and set up a comfortable setting and say it is for her to relax? or do i just be honest and tell her that it has been a while and it is starting to show? my dad has smoked for over 50 years so i can believe he just doesn’t notice.," i’ve taken to telling her it is time to wash her hair rather than take a shower, for some reason she is more receptive to that. i tried calling it spa day, but since she was never one to go get manicures or facials and would only let the stylist trim, not wash or set even in predementia mind that one didn’t help me.i also found that keeping a schedule works, every saturday morning is the time to wash her hair (sponge bath on other days). if she gets a little resistant i ask if she wants clean hair for church tomorrow and that usually gets her right in.  this one is kind of funny right now since church is still by zoom and no one sees her, but lesson here is work any angle you can take.i’ve also resorted to telling her we will have a visitor, i have a small handful of nearby friends and family who can stop by for a few minutes if we ask. she usually forgets this before she is out of the shower.  if she remembers and i didn’t set something up i tell her they had to cancel and they will come later.you have my sympathies, bathing and changing are our biggest challenges!oh and almost forgot, she is more compliant when we are the only two home.  i think the quieter house helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m0vwt5/getting_mom_to_bath/,Getting Mom to bath

(she is married to an extremely successful lawyer with all kinds of connections, and loves to see me miserable - but i was floored to hear that.)the policeman, who believed everything he was told, angrily informed me that in my state, that is theft by deception and is in the ""domestic abuse"" category and  i could be arrested based solely on the accusation if my father decided to file a complaint.  spoke to lawyer who told me it was unlikely, but yes, it was absolutely possible.  my company was, simultaneously, letting people in my age bracket with my years of experience go. if i got arrested and lost my job, how on earth would i find another job to support my family (wife and 3 kids, all with learning disabilities)?  i was terrified.  it's two against one, plus (possibly) my brother-in-law lawyer, and there is no formal diagnosis because any doctor who said anything remotely undesired was a moron and &lt;expletives&gt; and he would never let me take him back for a follow up.  there are no other relatives who speak to him much anymore (he was very difficult to get along with, even before these accusations started, and the closest is about 3 hours away).  the only constant has been a psychiatrist, who will not discuss anything about any of it with me.there have since been a few more calls to the police (they even came to my house and questioned me in front of my children), and a few directly to me - during which horrible accusations, threats, and brutal insults were made.  just painful in every way.the first policeman, the lawyer, and the psychiatrist i started seeing all told me the same thing - stay as far away from both of them as possible.  after years of running errands, getting groceries, and just sitting with him on hard days, despite having a wife and young kids at home ... that has been extremely difficult, especially during those first weeks and months.   i have not changed my number because i want to leave that avenue open.  if he were to call me and say ""look i've been diagnosed with &lt;whatever&gt;"" i would 100% resume helping him in every way i could.   but until that happens, i still walk around feeling like i could be arrested for something i didn't do, even after the enormous efforts i made, for  years, to be helpful.      okay, i got most of it out, thank you for having a place here were i can do that."," i'm so sorry. those people gave you good advice & i'm glad you're taking it. it's a painful truth that the caretaker child is often the one who takes the most relationship damage with the parent - it happened to my brother too, mom hasn't called the police on him, but openly resents him for caring for her. it's a thankless job in that way.depending on your dad's other symptoms, you might want to find out the steps in your state to assume guardianship, especially if you can't rely on your sister to step in and fill the care gap. if he's reached the point where he is unsafe or can't care for himself on his own and needs to be remanded to care, you can get people to come in and do home assessments when they refuse to go to the doctor. it's an ugly step to have to take, but it's better than having him injure himself or others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lxk0nu/undiagnosed_parent_angry_cop_constant_fear_just/,Undiagnosed parent - angry cop - constant fear.

"about 6 or 7 years ago, i discovered what dementia is when my aunt started asking repetitive questions about her where her daughter and granddaughter was.  later on i discovered that i have several uncles who had dementia and my grandfather had it.  so it runs in the family and i expected my father to be next in line to have it.  my father showed signs of dementia and later was diagnosed with it.  my father didn't believe he had dementia, which made his care extremely hard.out of all my father's 10+ children only a half brother and myself tried to help him (not even a daughter who's a nurse practioner).  along with his mother, my stepmother.  throughout this ordeal, many mistakes was made, in my father's care and regulating his affairs. however, a lot of bad decisions were made before my father showed evidence of dementia. he bought a house that he couldn't afford.  paying almost $10k in property taxes. retired before the house was paid off.  rarely did any renovations on the house.  pretty soon after he retired and was diagnosed with dementia, that's many things in the house started falling apart.  we did some repairs and the house is still not finished with repairs. getting the ct scan and the memory tests was the easy part.  many mistakes were made was when my stepmother chose to get power of attorney, instead of my brother and i.  my stepmother had poa, but refused to do anything, and relied on me to the footwork.  however, handling my father's affairs required a poa or legal guardian, so i needed my stepmother's authorization, and if she wasn't around its slowed everything down.  my father refused to take his meds, because he couldn't remember to and didn't believe he had anything. his primary care doctor referred us to a psychiatric nurse because of his resistance to taking his meds.  the psychiatric nurse wanted to place him in special care so he could get his blood pressure down and be given the right meds.my half brother believed it was to place our dad in a nursing home.  so my half brother switched his primary care physician to another general practioner physician who lived in another county. because of the distance we rarely went for check ups.  then when covid-19 hit, we didn't go at all. this physician never referred us to a specialist like a geriatric doctor or neurologist to work on the dementia.  all they prescribed him was things to make him sleep which had no affect on him after awhile. out of my stepmother and half brother, i have the most pacifist personality. so i just go along. any suggestions that i had were usually disregarded. or explained why it wasn't plausible. now i'm sorry that i didn't speak up earlier on.  now i'm sorry that i didn't speak up.  now i'm sorry i didn't fight for my beliefs.  i often advocated for medicaid years ago so we could get a home aide and other things. my stepmother was against it.  she said he made too much.  even though, some of my aunts &amp; uncles were able to receive medicaid who made more then my father.  everyone knows there are ways getting around it.  she believed that she care for him till we could sell the house and pay for an aide out of pocket.  my stepmother is partially deaf, bad eye sight, circulation problems, obese, pre-diabetic, waddles like penguin and in her 70's, no condition to handle a man with dementia who's extremely resistant and still strong.  she waited till her job's union gave her a deal were my dad would be covered in her insurance. it wasn't till this year, she couldn't take it and wanted a home aide.  she had a representative from their health insurance come over and said they would be help, we got no help.  we had to get the general practioner to prescribed all these things for a hospital bed and things for toilets.  my half brother is very smart, definitely smarter then i am.  however, despite his intelligence. he likes to wait let other people handle shit and then come out and say they made a mistake and that he would have never done that.  i'm like ""if you know better then us, then take the lead on this issue."" but then makes it sound like he is doing all the work and everyone else is incompetent.   my stepmother and half brother aren't the only fuck ups.  i been so focused on fixing up the house and getting ready for sale.  never thought to see another doctor besides a general practioner.  i been getting advice from an uninformed cousin on what he does to help, rather then speaking to his older brother who had more information. such seeing a specialist, medicaid, home aide, day programs.  his mother (my father's younger sister) got dementia before my dad and is doing a lot better.it wasn't until the last few days ago, i been able to get a appointment with a neurologist.  i been able to contact a medical supply to get a medical bed and other things.  however, today during a face time with my father's general physician.  he says in my father's current state (bed bound, several bed sores, emaciated, not really eating, not talking), its seem like it's only a matter of days, weeks, or months.  that we will be lucky to get a few more years.  since my father has had dementia, there have been a few scares that his days were numbered but he bounced back.  tomorrow, we face time neurologist.  hoping for better news, but i don't want to get my hopes up. it's like my aunts and uncles got to live 10 to 12 years with the disease and then passed with the best care possible.  like i said before, one of my father's sisters had it several years before he did.  she is still walking and talking, lost a lot of weight, but not emaciated.  i'm saddened because looking back there was so many missed opportunities.  i want to blame my stepmother and half brother because of their egos and ignorance.  i want to blame myself.  i have made a lot of fuck ups in my life, but not getting a loved one the best essential care, is on another level.  but as everyone says, it's no use blaming anyone, what's done is done.i knew when he got dementia, that this is the inevitable end. but that there are ways to extend and make life comfortable while they are still with us.  i really wish that there were instruction manuals for caregivers of loved ones with dementia.  for anyone who has recently has a loved one with dementia this is my advice.1.  put your loved ones care first. 2. get your ego out of the way.  any family member who's doesn't want to pull their weight. any family member who's arrogance level exceeds their intelligence levels. check them, it's not about them, it's about your loved ones3. get a power of attorney &amp; healthcare proxy for someone or some people who are capable and wiling to do the work. only get a legal guardianship when the dementia patient is really out of it.  or they aren't being cared for properly.4. make sure they consistently see a doctor who lives a reasonable distance.5. make sure they also see a specialist for the disease of dementia itself (neurologist, gerontologist, geriatric psychiatrists). 6. don't wait to get a home health aide when they're are urinating and defecating on themselves.  get one pretty early on.  7. speak to an expert about getting their affairs in order such insurance coverage, debts, housing, social security, pension, 401k, and everything else is taken care of. so you just can focus on the care of your loved one.  8. don't let them live in silence and solitude.  give them stimulation.  have a tv so they can watch.  have family and friends over.  put them in a day program.  a dementia patient in a room alone staring at the walls will hasten their demise.to anyone reading this, who just had someone diagnosed with dementia.  i sincerely hope and pray that you do a better job then my stepmother, half brother, and i did. eta: my father passed a couple hours after i wrote this, early in the morning, a couple hours past midnight.  i was the one to discover him.", great advice.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lxcqpk/no_instruction_manual_for_caregivers_of_family/,No Instruction Manual For Caregivers of family with Dementia.

"today was supposed to be an exciting day. nov 1st we had a water leak from the upstairs bathroom to my moms floor. the floors had to be ripped out and the walls dried. sadly, all of my moms stuff including her furniture were put in storage. so she ended up moving  upstairs to the toddler room, liked it, and forgot  she even lived downstairs. i’d ask her over and over if she remembered living downstairs and she didn’t get it. well today was the day when all of her stuff was brought back, my husband and i after 4 months would share a room again. no more mom in the kids room! she was excited and we really got a lot of stuff done. however by 4:00pm her attitude changed drastically and she was very angry at me because she had to move downstairs. fine. i get it. it’s the dementia i told myself. however she went into this catatonic state. basically paralyzed on her bed. she wouldn’t make eye contact. staring off into space. she was unable to talk. at first i thought she was just ignoring me but then i realized something was wrong. i started shaking her gently to snap her out of it and gave her water and orange juice which she had a hard time swallowing at points. this was scary. she moaned very slowly that she wanted to die. not the first time she has said this. she’s made comments like this for many years under stress and anger but the way she said it was worrisome. very slow and slurred. now i’m left reading and wondering if she had a small stroke or something?!!!!! i’ve never head of tias. i’m going to call the doctor tomorrow. i’m wondering if all of today’s activity, stress, and anxiety of moving to a “new room” did something to her?!! it lasted about 10 minutes. when i asked she said she felt very bad and strange like she was drowning. what the heck?"," the first thing that occurs to me is a tia, but i am not a doctor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lxcjv0/something_weird_happened_today/,Something weird happened today..

"hello, my mother is 58 and she was in a care home but because of the dementia getting worse they transferred her to the hospital. she’s been there for a month now and because of covid i’m not even allowed to visit her. i just feel really bad right now because i never talk about this with anyone, none of my friends even know what’s going on. and recently it’s been hitting me pretty hard. when i saw her the first time she was hospitalized last year, she said she felt bad that she was sick because i would never have a normal young adult life and she wouldn’t be there to help me and give me advice. and it’s like everyday i wake up and i remember this, i’m never gonna have my mom again. and i feel awful that she’s going through this and there’s absolutely nothing i can do about it. something i never told anyone, when i was in high school my grandmother on my dad’s side had dementia and i went to visit her with my mom, and she told me that one of her biggest fears was to get dementia and she made me promise i would never let her live like my grandmother did if she did have it. and now i can’t even visit her... anyways i just needed a place to talk about all this :("," i am so sorry for what you and your mother are going through.  since the history is there you need to make some good decisions for you.  live your life,  do not wait.  life is to short.  sending big hugs",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lxaw43/hospital/,Hospital
"my (22m) family is in desperate need of some help. my dad's (69m) dementia has gotten much worse over the past few months. it pains me to say this but my sister (40f), mother (67) and i are no longer able to look after him on our own. every day there's a bigger upset than the last. my sister and i have been trying to convince my mother to look into available support for my dad (in-home care or even looking into a home) but the same sticking point keeps coming up (finances). we live in ontario, what resources can i look into to show my mom?"," call your local lhin as mentioned by another commentator. your lhin will provide free in-home care based on your father’s needs.  the free care is the same as care you pay for - so don’t worry that it is substandard.  also, you should ask your lhin coordinator about adding your father to the long term care (ltc) home registry immediately.  depending on what city you live in, the wait can be anywhere from 3 months to 2yrs for a spot.  these are profit and non-profit facilities that are subsidized by the provincial government.  the monthly fees are very reasonable and much cheaper than what you would pay at a private retirement home.  think of the ltc homes as ontario universities/colleges (subsidized) and retirement homes as private colleges/trade schools that charge whatever they want.  the fees for ltc homes might be covered by what your father receives in cpp and old age benefits, there are also additional subsidies if that is still beyond your budget.  the sooner you connect with your local lhin the better you will feel, they can also  facilitate day programs for your dad to give him a change of scenery and your family a break during the day (these are on hold due to covid, but will hopefully return soon).  there is free/subsidized help out there, you just need to advocate for it.  good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lx6pm1/in_search_of_resources_in_ontario/,In search of resources in Ontario

"i (26f) know i just posted here recently and try to space out my posts, but i really need a safe, understanding space today. today has been absolute hell. it started out like most other days, with me bringing my dad (66m) his meds and cigs (which i use as motivation so he continues taking his meds, that and if i don’t moderate his smoking he will relentlessly chain smoke). it was a relatively normal interaction, i was trying to leave for work, as per usual he was bugging me for random things (today it was plates). my fiancé (27m) heard and woke up to this and it really upset him. he got all worked up and impossible to de escalate and ran downstairs to yell at him. i have told him so. many. times. that reacting like that doesn’t help, my father is incapable of understanding reason or responding with anything other than anger and fear due to being provoked. everything would have gone smoothly had he just left us alone.this has happened before, my fiancé hearing my dad yelling at me and getting upset. however, it’s never been this bad. they both threatened violence against each other and sounded sincere. i don’t think my fiancé would follow through with that, but i wouldn’t put anything past my dad at this point. now i am scared to leave them alone with each other but don’t have much of a choice at this point, unless i bring one of them with me every time i go anywhere. after he finally de escalated, i begged my fiancé to work harder at managing his emotions, check out dementia resources with me, etc. he said he is willing to, but i don’t know how committed he really is, and there are limited resources out there that actually relate to our unique experience of caring for someone younger, relatively high functioning in a lot of ways, but incapable of managing his own life and affairs. everyone always says teepa snow but something about her approach really rubs me the wrong way. it seems like her advice is more tailored to older people that are further along in the disease, and more likely to work if you’re older/a figure of authority. if anyone has advice on how to work on a relationship so dementia caretaking doesn’t totally destroy it, that’d be great. i know in theory i shouldn’t be in a relationship with someone who’s reacting like this, i can’t explain why, but us breaking up would literally kill him. that and i love him, and without this additional strain on our relationship, we’ve grown a lot and have a lot of dreams being put on hold by this. i’m basically stuck taking care of my fiancé and my dad and i’m getting close to my breaking point.", you and your friend must read this book!!it is on kindle for $3.  only 200 pages with the most helpful part in the first 50 pages.it was so helpful i can't find the words.thoughtful dementia care: understanding the dementia experiencejennifer ghent-fulle,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lx4joh/i_keep_thinking_the_worst_day_ever_already/,I keep thinking the worst day ever already happened and it happens again
i recently moved my family member into a independent living facility. they have a diagnosis of cognitive impairment and we’re fully independent and living on their own before this move. the move however has taken a toll with the unfamiliar surroundings etc and thing have been very challenging. the problems have been augmented with the community banning family members from entering the facilities including the apartments. i have some services coming to their apartment but i know that if i was able to go in and help organize and orient them to the apartment this would all go or have gone much smoother. i’ve spoken to the community administration and leadership and to my dismay they have been less than helpful.  their best suggestion is that “these things just take time”. it is very hard to just sit by and watch and wait while i can see a decline right before my eyes.is anybody else in this situation or have any suggestions? i think this would’ve been easier without all the covid restrictions and at this point i really regret moving during this time (but it was inevitable and i thought the earlier the better).," first, i’m so sorry you and your family are going through this challenging time. not knowing for sure if the new changes are the absolute best thing for your loved one is both frustrating and heart wrenching at times. my story isn’t entirely relevant since it has a lot of different circumstances but i thought i’d share anyway. i dealt with a deteriorating independent living situation this time last year (as the pandemic first started to unfold). my family member has been in the moderate cognitive impairment range for a few years now and was still enjoying life in this particular independent living facility. she was able to eat, bathe, and medicate herself without any direct supervision (all medications were pre-packaged into the correct doses so she only had to remember to take them).  pre-pandemic, our family was able to support her in the areas she needed extra help (weekly social visits, laundry, doctor visits, housekeeping, other random daily tasks) and thus she was able to still live “on her own,” in a community instead of cooped up in a home by herself. once visitors were banned from the premises he to covid, we could only check in with her daily via phone. everything seemed to remain the same and she was content despite the changes going on. what i eventually discovered is that her dementia was severely exacerbated by the complete disorientation from the shutdown of all activities and socialization. at the time, there was intermittently zero interaction with anyone because management would restrict the residents’ movements so much. she lost 30 pounds in four months because they kept changing the dining services. (they were responsible for serving three hot meals a day.) for example, the dining times and method of service would change – sometimes they’d open up the communal dining room for socially-distanced eating; other times the residents were restricted to eating in their rooms (but had to “sign up for meals,” or else they’d be skipped). she just couldn’t keep track of what was happening and i think ended up missing many, many meals. all the while, no one at this facility had any oversight as to whether she was actually eating. she never gave us any indication that she was having any issue with getting to her meals. she also stopped bathing properly; no one noticed or said anything to us. of course she is telling us that she’s fine and that everything is the same and fine. she’s normally a super easygoing, nice lady with a penchant for harmless confabulation, but we figured she was still capable of complaining or alerting us to any issues she might have. we were wrong. we pulled her out of her facility as soon as we were able to have an in-person but distanced visit with her and could visually see (and unfortunately, smell) that there was a huge problem. her conversational skills had just plummeted and she had also lost interest in reading (because she couldn’t keep track of the story), her previous favorite hobby. the staff was overworked and spread too thin due to quarantining, actual illness, or burnouts. i hope that these facilities are in a better position these days and i’m sure having a vaccinated elderly population makes a big difference. independent living is markedly different care at most facilities than assisted living or higher care. the staff fully expects the independent living resident to be just that – independent. we had dealt with a previous independent living facility in another state that treated her like family; kept in touch with us whenever any issue came up , however minor (one time they emailed us that she had had a tiff with another resident over the rules of a card game); and just had a warm, cozy feeling in all the common areas because there was always a staff member checking in on or interacting with the residents. her last place was just so cold, corporate, and sterile; but sadly, the one that best fit the budget when we moved her to be closer to family. none of the staff (save one receptionist) ever had the time or inclination to make any significant connection with our relative. the turnover was high and the motivation to say more than hello to the residents seemed really low. i just want to reassure you that you can never do “too much” in the interest of your loved one.  i understand that you can’t see or hear a lot of what’s going on in your relative’s life right now. but remember, even though they may be going through some mental changes, you and your family still know them better than the staff at their new place. if you sense something is off, don’t brush it off. you are also essentially their voice. do your due diligence to give yourself peace of mind. take advantage of any opportunities to (safely) keep the person-to-person connection with them, whether it’s video chats, or escorting them to their doctor’s offices, or having outdoor visits at their facility. could our relative have naturally declined just due to the progression of her dementia? sure. but i think her de-socialization and the lack of a person who legitimately cared about her day-to-day well-being in her life was a huge factor. i’d also like to think if we had had any interaction options last year, our relative would’ve mentally and physically fared a lot better, most likely because we would’ve changed her care level environment sooner. i just don’t know. in the end, there’s always going to be a limit to your capabilities for this kind of out-of-home care. it’s going to be difficult and stressful and imperfect. hang in there and take care of yourself so you can continue to take care of them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lwxjl3/suggestions_for_a_move_into_independent_living/,Suggestions for a move into independent living
"(cross posted at r/agingparents)has anyone had any luck getting their parents into a continuing care retirement community after a diagnosis of alzheimer’s? my dad is 65, in the very early stages of dementia (technically at “mild cognitive impairment”) but his neurologist is thinking that it’s alzheimer’s. he is currently fully independent, living with my healthy mom (66), continuing to work, and doing all normal things, just with some memory lapses here and there. no other health issues at all. they luckily will have the money to pay for all the associated fees and are interested in moving asap to one of these if possible. they are already on one waitlist and will get on a few more with a 1-2 year waitlist. basically even if he stays at this level when it’s time to enter, i’m wondering if he’s automatically “banned” because of the diagnosis. thanks for any experiences!", might be worthwhile to look at communities that have an integrated assisted living with the independent living. that will allow your dad to stay in the same community should his symptoms worsen.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lwwytm/early_alzheimers_and_continuing_care_retirement/,Early Alzheimer’s and Continuing Care Retirement Community

"hi all, i am hoping that someone from the medical community will see my post and is able to shed some light on the information i have discovered last week. long story short, my husband  who was adopted as a child recently found his birth mother. through her he found out that his maternal grandfather died of ftd at a rather young age. ftd is a inherited disease and my husband is scared that he might have it. his birth mother chose not to get tested, but he just really wants to know if he has the gene or not. we both did some ancestral research a few years back and still have our dna raw data. i requested a promethease report and looked for grn in his dna data. this is what showed up: **rs6966915(c;c) and tmem106b genes as well as  rs9897526(g;g) grn genes and rs112039851(g;g) agrn genes.** i am mostly worried about rs6966915(cc) and tmem106b genes since everything i read about says it is strongly linked to ftd. i do not fully understand all this information and i would greatly appreciate it if someone could explain it to me. we will certainly get a professional dna evaluation in the near future, but this could still take weeks or months. &amp;#x200b;thank you so much in advance for taking your time to respond."," you and he should go see a genetic counselor.  they are specialists who know how to read the genetic data but more importantly, how to interpret it in a way that helps your family.[following up on succesful cat's very helpful info.  i run a parkinson's disease (hereafter called pd) support group, so my info isn't ftd specific, but still probably helpful.researchers are doing genetic studies where they ask people with pd to submit their dna.  when they get a huge amount of dna submissions, then they combed through the dna to find out what genes that group of people has in common.   certain genes showed up (i don't know their names off-hand, sorry).  so then they started testing their family members.  some of them have those same genes but don't develop pd.  they don't know exactly why, but they believe that those people have other genes that cancel out the ""bad"" pd associated gene.  for example, we know that people with pd and alzheimers get a malformed protein that starts to clog up the brain.  it used to be thought that if you have one of the ""bad"" genes, you would get pd.  but we all have proteins that get malformed, or other dead cells, etc--stuff that your body routinely sweeps away.  so maybe people who have genes that are better at sweeping away waste material don't get pd. identical twin studies are another way they researchers try to figure out what causes of pd (or any illess) are genetic or not.  there is a set of identical twins in the us somewhere who are probably in their 70s now.  one twin has severe pd, the other is fine.  both of them grew up in the same area, work the same job, etc. [so this brings up environmental factors.  one hypothesis about pd right now is to explain why certain people with a family history of pd get it and others don't.   the theory is that people are born with ""bad"" pd genes, but it takes something environmental to actually start the disease progression going.   it's like a gun---certain genes cock the trigger, but an environmental event is what pulls the trigger.   for pd, suspected triggers are exposure to solvents and pesticides.  lately, (as the gersheimer twins case points out) stressful events and how someone responds to them might be a trigger as well.you said you were going to a specialist next week who can describe things better.   you can ask what things are  suspected risk factors and your husband can try to avoid those.  maybe think about getting long term care insurance now while it's still affordable.  set up power of attorney now so just in case you ever need it it's already set up. your husband can also sign up for research studies on familial ftd and really help researchers a lot.  when studying familial diseases, it's really hard to tease out what is genetic and what is environmental, since most everyone in a family shares the same environment until kids grow up and leave the house.   your husband has always grown up in a different environment than his biological family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ltdf8g/familial_ftd_genetics/,Familial FTD - Genetics

"forgive me if this is me rambling but i need advice. my grandmother is 89 years old. she was 1 of 7 kids, but now she and her brother are the only 2 left. my grandfather (her husband) died 7 years ago so she was living on her own. she doesn't drive and was dependent on her brother, son (my father) and daughter (my aunt) to care for her, picking her up, go grocery shopping etc. as she got older and more forgetful she was too stubborn to go into assisted living, and we couldn't afford an aid. subsequently, my parents sold their house to move into hers and take care of her. they've been living there for 5 months. my father and mother are still working full time and do the best they can. my grandmother was not happy about the situation but there was no other alternative available. my parents were forced to invade her space and its cause a lot of turmoil. my grandmother's short term memory is shot, she forgets what she has eaten for lunch, lies that she has eaten when she hasn't. she refuses to drink water and only drinks instant coffee. if it's not us forcing and fighting her to eat she is eating sweets. she can't allow anyone to take care of her except my aunt and my sister (the angels in the family). she fabricates and makes up stories that my father is yelling at her or hurting her, and it creates this aura that is just depressing and negative in the house. living in the house she is always making sure to watch over my mother like a hawk. she does not trust my mom to do laundry, to cook. to clean (my mom is in her 60's). mt grandmother constantly wears the same clothing, which is 4 sizes too big, it doesn't fit her so she rolls the waist up and the cuffs up on her pants to fit. she constantly says ""i'm next"" as if she is going to die next. her memory loss results in her being hypersensitive to situations. she cries and is depressed and doesn't really try anymore.  it came to a head today when we were together. in the past we bought her 4 pairs of pants that fit her that would replace the jeans that are too big on her. we constantly say ""where are the pants we bought you to wear that fit why are you wearing pants that don't fit you."" she was eating cookies and refusing to eat dinner. i said to her that she always complains that she's tired or doesnt feel good but why do you think that is, because you don't eat right and refuse to eat things that are good for you and your not wearing clothes that fit you. she goes ""well it doesn't matter because im giving up"" and then i said why are you saying that why are you giving up, she goes because all you do is say i'm not dressing the right way and i don't eat the right things and i can't do anything and she stormed to her room and stayed there. i understand that i can seem as if i am berating her and to just leaver her alone and let her do her thing but when she is left alone to do her own thing she starts fires in the house on the stove, eats melted microwaved plastic etc. my parents are tired emotionally dealing with her stubbornness, we cant hire an aid and i she said she will never let an aid into her house, she wont leave her house, she wont accept help. she makes me feel like shit because i feel badly that she's upset making me feel like i did something wrong because shes not taking care of herself. the only happy medium is when her daughter comes or my sister comes for a visit but thats only for a few hours. can anyone give me advice on what we can do because there's no logical reasoning going on for to have valid conversations anymore."," i do think you should let go the things that don't matter like the clothes.  the food, i don't agree with others here that say just give her cookies.  yes, let her eat cookies but i wonder if you border on senior abuse if she doesn't eat anything else.  maybe say she can have her cookie if she eats this one other thing too.  as a last resort, you can tell her the government won't let you feed her just cookies alone.  that she has a choice, either she eats something in combination with the cookies or she'll have to go to a carehome cause you guys aren't allowed to just give her sweets.i would speak as though you respect her wish to die too.  the less angry with you she is, the more compliany she'll be.if you guys are suffering terrible, id seriously get guardianship and just put her in an assisted living facility.  you can't sacrifice your own happiness for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lstovh/my_grandma_is_giving_upbut_i_cant_understand_and/,my grandma is giving up...but I cant understand and don't accept it
"i’m venting, this is long but i need advice and someone to tell. i’m 20 and my grandma has had dementia for the last couple years, she’s slowly deteriorating but this year has been the hardest for me. mainly because of how aware i became of the issues and her situation. she lives in the midwest and i live and grew up on the east coast so i didn’t get to see her a lot when i was growing up. i didn’t love going to her house as a kid because i just always felt a homesick and there wasn’t a lot going on over there and i could never sleep. as i became a teenager it definitely became more manageable but i still didn’t see her a lot because i was in sports and school and whatever the excuses. she lives with my grandpa still who is just a old fart and used to order her around the house all the time and her son (my uncle) has lived there his whole life and he’s just a lost soul who drinks, he means well. the dynamic of that house is the last bit ideal for someone with dementia too. it’s just low vibes and my uncle doesn’t really get along with my grandpa and it’s just a mess. there’s not enough interaction or high energy to keep her wheels turning. i’m also 1/2 grandchildren and the only girl in my family since my grandma had all boys, and the other grandkid is a boy. anyways i feel an immense guilt and responsibility to go and help her and take care of her. from never seeing her a kid and knowing she always wanted a daughter and i was the closets thing to a daughter and i never even got to see her. and i didn’t like calling her when i was kid and i wish i would’ve just called her. i feel like i missed out on years of love and stories from her and she missed them from me. i didn’t even give her a chance. or so it feels. my only problem is that i would have to pick up my whole life and move to missouri, i’m in arizona. and it just feels like i could be doing so much to help her and make these last years really amazing for her. and if i don’t go i’m going to live with the guilt of not being the best granddaughter i could’ve been, i don’t even feel like i was a good one at all. it took me 20 years to realize how much i truly love and care about her, i just wish i would’ve called her more growing up and seen her more. it was just because i didn’t want to or feel like it or just because it was awkward sometimes. i call her as much as i can now but it’s hard and draining. i always cry and spiral and she always mentions to me that i should come visit her. she deserves the world and i just wish i could give it to her. i hope this all made sense, i just got off the phone with her so i’m emotional and all over the place and conflicted. i just need some advice or a sweet message lol"," you feel guilty because you feel that you don’t do enough.. and it is probably coming from some belief that you formed through your life which puts all of this pressure on you. what you can check in with yourself is:-am i doing the best that i can given all the circumstances?-what more can i do without harming my well being and mental health?it ia great that you have this awareness and the feelings you have after your calls show that you are caring and emphatetic, but care has its own limits. always check in with yourself.take care",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/lskmfe/feeling_guilty_and_responsible_towards_my_grandma/,Feeling guilty and responsible towards my grandma

"summary: after +17 years of battling parkinson's disease for many years, things have taken a turn for the worse. she has been admitted to the hospital since sat and we have been informed she is not going to make it. question: should we tell our mother that she is dying? is that fair or unfair? especially since she has dementia and is not able to retain new memories. from doing my own online research, seems like it's 50 /50. 1 part is that if i try to time it and tell her when she is ""present"" would that give her time to grieve and maybe accept the situation so if she needs time to resolve anything? her ""present"" time varies from 2mins to 20 mins? (all estimating.... honestly it's getting harder to tell).or second part to that is: is that mean? especially since she might not even remember or when she does will just be sad and shouldn't we be trying to keep her comfortable and happy instead?*additional information:she is not able to swallow or if she manages to somehow swallow a little bit, she will either throw it back up or it'll negatively effect her lungs. we have tried feeding tubes and other measures, she doesn't like it and yanks everything out even with straps in place. *we have tried everything...... with the many doctors at the hospital. we have accepted and come to terms with what's happening to her. just really really really don't know whether to let her know or just act like everything is fine and that she will be okay. she's currently mostly fiesty and angry because she thinks she's being left at the hospital or a nursing home (feeling abandoned) even though our whole family is taking shifts to try to be with her as much as we can while she is here. tried to explain over and over again that we can't discharge her and leave just because she's ""over it"". not sure how long she will last, but expected anything from 3 days to 3 weeks. god, i hope she goes quickly....... sounds so messed up, but i don't want her to suffer more and this is such a large traumatic experience for the whole family. what's sad is seeing her fight and be angry all the time. i understand her condition and she is not herself, which is why i wonder if we should just be honest with her? or am i wanting to tell her so she knows it's okay to let go? - and why does that feel like i'm being selfish and copping out?any advice, tips or recommendations are very appreciated. parkinson's, dementia and everything else up and down the list just sucks. i know there's allot of us out there with a loved one who is literally deteriorating in front of us, i get that we're not alone and understand that it's the disease that's affecting her, but it still sucks. thank you."," ***op- original post update:hey everyone, just wanted to thank each and every one of you that have liked, commented or just like to creep around ( lol, i know i did for the longest time). honestly, really grateful for reddit and this sub group, the experiences and examples really helped me understand our situation with my mother better and help us know and almost plan for what might happen even if it meant that it might not be exact, but you don't feel so alone? i don't know how to explain it, but just wanted to thank everyone. my brother made the executive decision to tell her, at first we were not planning to do so, but my mother's sisters also ( from a large family of 13 siblings, and her practically raising them ) also thought she deserved to know. my brother was able to time it out, she trusted him more medically and was able to just explain (( she isn't going home. the doctors have been trying their best and they have done all they could and he is very very sorry.)) she was able to cry for a bit and mourn her life ending, but than things changed.i like to think because he told her and even if she wasn't ""there"" because of her dementia, it kinda gave her a sense of acceptance and peace. so, rather than trying to fight the nurses and everyone around her she was able to relax and be more calm and get to say goodbye to everyone. due to covid, my relatives in korea was not able to fly down, but they were able to send a video or facetime with her. we also were able to say goodbye and tell her how much we love her and just grateful for her that she was our mother. after 7 days she passed away in a safe loving environment with hospice in a hospital. i was truly grateful to the staff that included not just the doctor and nurses, but including admittance up front and every person from the hospice nurse and social worker. the last few months were really really really tough, we saw allot of things that can be very traumatic and just hard. however, now that she has passed..... you miss her and almost want her to still be here,  but you know she can't and especially because she was in pain. at least her final days we made sure she was not in pain and took shifts to watch over her. point being, i know your going through a hard time. it's especially terrible and terrifying watching a loved one who was so proud and strong just literally deteriorating in front of you.....i can't say i know what is best, even with just going through all of that, but when i reflect back i try to be nice to myself. it was hard. point blank. it was just overall very difficult, scary and hard.but i get the closer of knowing i did my best for her and myself. it may not have been perfect, or i might have also lost my cool at times and wished ( i know, terrible) for things to end.... all i can say, is we are human. we're not perfect and my mother knew how much i loved her and how hard i tried, how hard we all tried. i am still mourning, but will try to follow up on this post from time to time if anyone has any questions or just would like to vent or have support here. giving you all a very big bear hug from here. take a moment and imagine just being held for awhile and breathe. remember your doing your best. accidents,  and mistakes do happen. it's okay, your trying your best and that's all that matters. sending love to you all. and thank you again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ls3214/should_we_tell_our_mom_that_she_is_dying/,Should we tell our mom that she is dying?

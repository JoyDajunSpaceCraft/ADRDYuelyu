"up until 2017, we had three dogs. vinnie, duke and mitzy  in july of 2017, duke, 13, part german shepherd and part irish wolf hound, suddenly lost his ability to stand or walk. with the help of the vet, cold laser therapy (sometimes daily) and steroid shots, we kept him going until november when he let me know he was tired and ready to go so we sent him to rainbow ridge. it was hard because we’d adopted him when he was 14 weeks old. in june of 2018, we had to put mitzy down. she was 15, had dog dementia, was incontinent, blind in one and a half eyes and deaf. i inherited her when my mil past away and had her since 2011. i can't tell you how much we went through with that dog, but it was a lot. now vinnie is 14-1/2, has fecal incontinence, macular degeneration, and a bad leg from being run over by a car before we found him on the streets. his rear left leg just drags, otherwise he's pretty healthy and happy. he gets stuck standing up at times and when he struggles the poop comes out when i'm lifting him up. the fecal incontinence is killing me. i've always had a week stomach and tend to gag smelling poop. i've gotten better and can pick it up when i hold my nose unless it's runny and that is very difficult. my husband travels so he isn't here a lot of times so it's up to me.today, i feel like crap with allergies and a headache and he just left me a big pile of runny. i just started crying, then cleaned it because what else can i do? i'mi'm ashamed to say i'm ready for him to be ready to go. this makes me feel horrible because what type of person wants their dog to die? he's already lasted longer than i expected to because he and duke were inseparable. i'm just so tired."," i don't think it makes you a horrible person at all. it's clearly very difficult and you don't have the right mindset to deal with the dog at this time, and it's not healthy to force yourself to either. however, the dog does deserve love and attention (which i have no doubt you give generally) but this will all come to a head soon enough and just leave you frustrated with the poor dog. have you considered trying to rehome the dog? i understand it can be incredibly difficult with the dogs age and conditions, but it may be worth looking into regardless. wishing the dog dead isnt fair on it and dealing with a dog you don't want isnt fair on you. either way, stay strong op - whatever the outcome, just try your best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ay4fii/im_tired_of_caring_for_my_geriatric_dog_and_it/,,I’m tired of caring for my geriatric dog and it makes me feel horrible
"my great grandaunt lost one of her daughters when her daughter was in her late 20's. she and her husband never got over it and whenever her name was heard they get teary eyed and silent.her daughter always liked me and treated me as her own kid since i spent a lot of time with her when i was a little kid because my mom couldn't take care of me. she was an artist, a really good painter but she was also morbidly obese. that was the reason of her early departure. she died when i was 3 years old but my earliest happy memories are of her. how she loved me and took care of my while my mom didn't.i'm now almost as old as her and i somewhat look like her(hair and fat). my great grand aunt has dementia and whenever i come to visit her every  week she calls me the name of her daughter and she gives me these really big hugs that i'm not used to because i was brought up in a not so happy family. we talk for hours about 'my art' and 'little hinenineni'. it feels so weird to lie but to see her so happy i just can't bring myself to stop doing it. she keeps giving me cash for art supplies and i feel so guilty accepting it knowing it won't go to art supplies. i just love her too damn much but i also can't keep up this charade or should i just do it for her?", keep being her daughter....its comforting her. why do you even take her money? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/axwnpw/i_lie_to_my_great_grandaunt_and_get_money_out_of/,,I lie to my great grandaunt and get money out of it
"(english is not my first language, i apologize for any mistakes)okay so, i have a mother, a father, 2 half-brothers and 2-half sisters.  here’s the issue: all of my brothers and sisters are much older than me (i’m in my mid-teens and they’re about 32-35). none of them live with me. my mom spends all day on her computer and my dad basically sleeps most of the time. my family is fine, however, it makes me incredibly sad that none of my siblings talk to me or spend time with me. it’s almost as if they only thought it was nice to hang out with me until i was 11 years old and stopped being a kid. my parents and have an ok relationship but we aren’t close. my grandparents from my moms side (the only ones i met) were nice. my grandma used to make me cute gifts and invite me to her house all the time (my family rarely visited her though), she’s now sick with alzheimer’s and can’t speak or do anything. my relationship with my grandfather was fine until he molested me a few times and made me hide it from everyone (including his wife) when i was 7-8, after that i tried to avoid him completely. i know i’m not unlucky, but whenever i see someone have a relationship with their family or have grandparents that take care of them i seriously feel terrible. i feel guilty for not feeling okay with my situation, as i know “other people have it worse”. my boyfriend told me that what i should do is to simply understand that that’s just the way my family works, and i get that, but i feel so weak for not having anyone. i hate getting home and knowing that i probably won’t speak to anyone until the next day. i honestly wish i could feel better about it and move forward, but i feel guilty for not being able to or for not knowing what to do."," don't feel guilty about wanting a family! you sound like you're not getting what you need--and that's a problem. sure, having gratitude for what you have is important, but when what you have is a grandfather who molested you and other family members that aren't there for you, you are legitimately lacking in the familial department. unfortunately, there's not much you can do, but wishing for things to be better is not something to feel guilty about. find good friends, maybe get in touch with a mental health professional, and enjoy your passions (and especially keep your health up); these things will help you stay happier. you could also try reaching out to your siblings again! they may want to talk to you even if you think they don't. good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/axvs87/i_want_a_family_specifically_grandparents_and/,,I want a family (specifically grandparents) and feel guilty for it
"my grammy was a shrew of a woman, make no mistake about that. she was spiteful, petty, she had munchausen's (not by proxy), and seeing other people happy made her miserable. but that has nothing to do with why i regret saving her.    my grammy was born in 1931. she was the youngest of 5, well 6 if you include the still borne before her. she grew up in the hills of tennessee. her father played the banjo, and would play until his fingers bled. my grammy rarely talked about her father. they were either fond memories of of watching her father play the banjo or him getting hit by a truck by a ""young negro"". it was an accident that couldn't be avoided, my great grandfather was walking back after dropping his 4th child off at the theater. it was at night, and the 1940s. the driver of the truck didn't see my great grandfather, and the driver didn't see him until it was too late. my great grandfather didn't suffer and his death was instant. the driver was terrified. when my great grandmother was notified, she told them to ""let the negro boy go, it was an accident"". to my knowledge that was the only act of mercy my great grandmother bestowed onto another human being.    my great grandmother was an abusive cunt, but no one was allowed to criticize her. well tough shit, she died before i was born so i feel i'm expect from that rule. even from the stories from the people who loved her, all i heard was how abusive this woman was. she was quite frankly, an ungrateful bitch who was the spawn of satan. the only thing i heard my grammy say about her own grandmother was that ""she was the coldest woman i've ever known"" or ""she was a wicked woman"". but the stories my grammy told me about her own mother, made me understand why she was the way she was. my great grandmother once told my great grandfather to beat their oldest daughter for coming home late from a school basketball game. she didn't watch the beating. no, she sat in another room and listened. she only told her husband to stop when she was satisfied. when my grammy was an infant my great grandmother told her husband to ""get that thing out of my house"". by all accounts my great grandmother never wanted or showed any kindness to my grammy. this cycle existed before my granny, and she continued it.    my grammy was wed and had her first child by the time she was 16. she had her second at 17, and fifth at 36. my mom was her 5th child. the stories my grammy would tell about her husbands made it very clear that she wasn't attracted to them, or men. i'm fairly certain my grammy was a lesbian, not that she would ever admit it. either that or she was asexual. one thing was certain, and that was she did not enjoy relations with my grandfather or her first husband. my grammy was a prude, but would get upset when she wasn't included in conversations about sex. she didn't understand that it was because she acted like a prude, people didn't want her near their conversation.    in addition to hating her husbands, she hated her children. she told me flat out that her ""biggest mistake was have those children"". she didn't hide it from them either. my grammy was very hands off with her children. she refused to barest feed. she only did the bare minimum that was required to raise children, aside from giving each a strong work ethic and how to become wealthy. my grammy came from a family that was so poor, her family wasn't affected by the great depression, until the boys came back from war, and had stories. she told me they had a wood stove, and a chicken coop under the house. the floor boards were spaced enough apart to where you could see the chickens. people in town would regularly leave food on their doorstep, prior to the depression. my family came from nothing. 4 of her 5 children are affluent. 3 of the five own their own business. 1 married a a multimillionaire, and one was my mother. my mother was tasked with continuing the cycle. perhaps it's just the duty of the last born child.    my mother would tell me stories about how her mother sent her to a ""fat farm"", a ""home for pregnant teens"", and was for some reason pissed she had to go to summer camps every year. my grandmother was almost non-existent when my mom was growing up. my mom lived across the street from her elementary school, and would be allowed to leave early to turn a crock pot and, and go back to class. my grammy spent most of her nights in bars and night clubs in the 70s and 80s. she was a single mother with only 2 kids left in the house. my mother and her her nearly adult brother. my grammy drank and danced her life away untill my mom answered the phone, in the middle of the night. my great grandmother died, and my grammy never went out again.because of how she raised her children, she didn't have a relationship with them, except for my mother. of her grandchildren, i was the only one she knew, and she only met one of her great grandchildren. she would complain about how her family doesn't call her, the get upset when i asked if she had called them recently. she never understood that relationships are a two way street, they just aren't thrusted onto you.i was the second and last child my mother had. she gave her first up for adoption. when she became pregnant with me, she felt guilty for giving the first one away, so she kept me. i grew up watching my grammy and mom verbally and emotionally abuse each other. i don't remember any age where all three of us weren't abusive to each other. it's just how mother/daughter relationships were.    my grammy helped raise me, and i essentially had split custody between my grammy and my mom. my mom was going to school, and working and didn't have much time for me. much like she was, i was expected to be able to care for myself alone while most kids had baby sitters. my grammy hated her children, her husbands, her mother and grandmother, but she loved me. she did the best she could, and she put everything into trying to be a good grandmother to me. it was too late, but she made an honest effort to break the cycle. maybe if i had said yes when she asked me if i wanted to live with her permanently, i wouldn't regret the choices i made.     but i said no, i was too young to realize the gravity of what i was being asked. my mother was as, if not more, abusive than her mother. in all likelihood, she has a personality disorder. i developed my own personality disorder. while i was at my lowest, and not quite able to care for myself, my mother decided i would be best off with my grammy. after all, an elderly woman recovering from cancer and a mental patient don't need supervision.i had been living with my grammy for about 2 years when she got really sick. she refused to go to the doctor, she was peeing on the floor and in trash cans. i thought she was just being petty, but her words stopped making sense. i forced her into the car, and took her to the hospital. she was rushed into surgery. the surgeon came out and told me she was roughly 30 minutes from death when i brought her in.and now comes my regret. i didn't know it at the time but i should have let her die. no good deed goes unpunished. she would go on to live just 2 more years. 2 years of pure hell for her. she developed dementia but i realized that far too late. i thought she was just being her normal mean and petty self. so i would dish it right back at her. if i had known it was dementia i wouldn't have been so mean to her. she was always a mean woman, it wasn't until she confused me with my sibling that was adopted out that i knew what was going on.because she was old, and i was barely functioning, our house became a hoarder's nightmare. we both have the curse of hoarding, she couldn't throw anything away, and i hoard bags of garbage. we both knew it was fucked up but we couldn't seem to do anything about it. we'd ask my mom for help, and get told we're on our own.the last christmas my grammy had, i left her alone. i got her a ruby necklace and left to spend christmas with my friends. it snowed, but i'm not even sure it my grammy was awake for it. when i got back her and i had a fight, and she made a comment about the necklace, so i returned it. that was the only thing my grammy got on her last christmas, and i returned it.a few months later we would have our last fight. she had dementia, but in her lucid moments she would say she's not going to be treated for it. i was beyond frustrated and i went nuclear on her. every cruel thing that was said about her behind her back, every fear she had i confirmed it, i even told her it's not her fault, and that she didn't have a choice other than be who she is. i ended it by telling her if things weren't going to get better than she was better off dead.a few days later, she ate a bottle of pills. it didn't kill her. instead she fell out of bed and broke her hip. because of the hoarding paramedics had to carry her out in a blanket, making her pain worse. she would have her hip replaced. she seemed to be recovering well, but then she pulled a 180 back into death's arms. it took her two weeks to die. two weeks. when she was coherent i would tell her it's ok, she can let go  but she wouldn't. she suffered because she just wouldn't let go. i had stayed by her side until the end. i hated that woman, but i cared for her. she had a shitty life, and she just wanted to be loved. i couldn't give her that.i fortunately ran into an angel of death. one of her treating nurses killed her, and put her out of her misery. i know she did it, and i thank her for it  i shouldn't have saved my grammy's life, because all i did was extend her suffering. she was a horrible person, but she didn't deserve most of the shit she got. maybe the silver lining is that she was able to die in comfort and not in her piss soaked bed. i miss my grammy sometimes, and this time is one of them. and then i feel worse knowing how shitty her life was.", damn op removed the story. i guess he felt so bad about it that he regrets telling reddit about regretting saving his grammy's

"some context, i was raised by my grandma, both of my parents were drug addicts, i never really knew them. i am 41 now, and have never had kids. my grandma has always been upset about this, not angry upset, but sad upset. i suppose she wanted her family line to continue, and i have no siblings, and my mom also has no siblings. even at a young age she always talked about me finding a girlfriend to get married and stuff. but i was a fat loser, i never had many friends outside of my coworkers, let alone a girlfriend. she has seen her memory decline pretty dramatically recently, but even worse, she had stage 4 lung cancer, and very suddenly, she didn't have long to live. i had been living kind of far away when i found out, so i hadn't seen her in a while. i went to her apartment to say hi to her, i was with a friend from the city. i had to drive my grandma to a chess game she was supposed to go, and i had to drop my friend off too, so might as well do both (why is it that nobody knows how to drive in new york??). they talked for a bit and got along in the car, then i dropped grandma off, then my friend. i remember my grandma was kind of rambling about something, but again, she had some form of dementia by that point apparently. months later, when my grandma was getting more sick and in the hospital, she asked me who that girl was. i don't even know why i said this, but i just said ""i am getting married, that is my fiance, and she is pregnant with my kid"". and my grandma said basically ""oh i am so sorry, i must have forgotten, thats wonderful"" and just was overcome with joy. she kept on telling the nurses that i was gonna be a dad, and she just looked really happy. but i feel bad. it was a lie. its been 4 months since she died, and i never told the friend that i told my grandma we were getting married. i don't even really know that friend that well, we only met up because we were with a bunch of other friends beforehand for lunch and she asked for a ride home in the same direction i was driving my grandma. but it also made my grandma very happy before she died. it was pretty much the only thing she wished from me.", i see that as a kindness. she will too i bet.,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/axfye3/i_lied_to_my_grandma_and_told_her_that_my_friend/,,"I lied to my grandma and told her that my friend was actually my pregnant fiance.

"so it was a heavily rainy night, and i was on my way home after a gathering with friends, and i was beat. all i had on my mind was to get home soon, and considering that it was after midnight, i decided fuck it, and sped off on the road. i also cut off a car and ran a red light in the process, it was so much recklessness in the duration of two minutes, it was honestly a bad judgement call on my end.and of course, on the one night i decided to drive recklessly, i came across cops. i saw red and blue lights flashing behind me, and i knew i really fucked up that time. my heart was thumping, and my hands were shaking when the cop knocked on my window and asked me for my driver’s license and insurance card. he asked if i had any drinks or drugs, and honest to god i didn’t dui, i really just wanted to drive home asap, and i said, with my trembling voice no, i just wanted to get home. he gave me a lecture on safe driving so i can actually get home, and went off to his car with my insurance policy and driver’s license, and i thought i was fucked. i had just paid off my tuition for the semester, and paid for college applications, i was basically broke. and so when he returned, i bet my face was looking as pale as possible, and my eyes were swelling with capillaries showing (i haven’t slept for two days at that point) that he asked me if everything was alright. i don’t know how i managed to pull that stunt off, but i started crying on spot, without needing any stimulation, and told him about how my grandfather had just recently got diagnosed with dementia, and i really needed to head home so i can facetime with him because it would be saturday morning over at my hometown, and my family would be visiting him. and he tried his best to calm me down before going back to his car to fetch my license and insurance card. honestly, i really didn’t think that would’ve worked, but i must have struck a chord with him with that story, because he told me about how he could’ve arrested me on spot for reckless driving, but he just really wanted me to get home safe. he then proceeded to ask me if he could help me with anything, or if i needed him to stay with me for a little bit, and i was frankly quite touched about that, but of course, to continue my act, i said yes while crying even harder. i was full-on sobbing, and if i was wearing any mascara, it would’ve been melting off. he asked me if i needed to call anyone to pick me up, and of course i wouldn’t want my family to find out, so i said no, i just really needed to hear my grandfather’s voice, and i’ll just call him there while parked on roadside. he then gave me some time alone, during which i faked holding the phone to my face as if i was calling and sobbing hard, burying my face in the steering wheel.he came back shortly and asked if i felt better, and i nodded. he then asked if there is anything else he could help me with, and of course i would want to know if he had written me a ticket so i could at least expect to pay a large sum of money for a bad judgment call. but he told me that no, he hadn’t written me a ticket, and instead had just wanted to warn me about driving recklessly. i was thanking god when he said that, and i thanked him, this time genuinely crying, because that was the kindest thing he could’ve done for me. and honestly, that worked far better than any ticket or arrest, as i would never forget how kind that cop was, to an international college student that he had no reason to be so nice to. thank you so very much, random good cop, i felt really guilty for using your kindness to get out of a potentially serious punishment, but you made me trust cops a little more.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/awft8j/i_lied_my_ass_out_of_a_reckless_driving_arrest/,,I lied my ass out of a reckless driving arrest and ticket
"first of all, sorry if my grammar is wrong or too simple cause english isn’t my mother-tongue. my grandma, 80, was once a lovely, cheerful person. she used to live with grandpa in a house next to us, but ever since he’s gone, i felt a part of her left that day too, which might have contributed to her depression and dementia.  we recently moved away, so she got disconnected with her old “gang”. now, pretty much all the time granny have to stay inside, knowing nobody but us around. in the old time, she would run errants in the neighborhood, visit friends and relatives. around a year and a half ago, we discovered about her dementia. thought it was only depression,  but it appears that she’s having alzheimer. her actions just got weirder, sometimes even annoying. we tried to calm her down, gave her supplements, but it just gotten worse and worse. pretty fucking clueless on how to go about it.i usually scream at her for taking stuff from my room and toilet, taking my stuff back with an attitude that no one should ever have to face. i know she’s still my grandma even with that fucking thing going on in her mind, and i love her dearly. back when i was a kid, she was the one whom i trusted and love most, sometimes even more than my mom (sorry mom!!). occasionally i’m still calm, telling myself that it’s okay, but there are times that i just can’t help but fear and panic, and of course, scream at her.i’m not here to defend myself, just wanted to get it off my chest. i know deep inside i’m an asshole for behaving that way to my grandmother, and there is absolutely no reason or explanations for my behavior at her. y’all with parents/grandparents going through the same thing, could i ask for some advices?thanks for reading guys, have a great day."," you probably did the same shit to her when you were young; annoying her, misplacing her stuff, creating trouble. just ask yourself, did she ever give up on you? did she ever stop trying? no, because it wasn’t your fault for acting like a kid. remember, just because shes ill, doesn’t mean that she isn’t the same loving grandma who raised you.its okay to feel frustrated, i myself have felt this way before. i just understood that it was just as hard for her, if not harder. right now, she’s probably scared and confused because demential is a crazy illness. she needs her family to be patient and kind and understanding. she will not be around forever, please be good to her. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/asdgp1/how_to_stop_hating_my_grandmother/,,How to stop hating my grandmother
"today is the day. papers will be signed just before 10am and i’ve been sitting here in my almost empty living room for the last hour wondering what i could’ve done differently to make this whole thing less ugly. things went from great to awful almost literally overnight. my wife and i had been together for 8 years. we’d been married for 5 of those years. i come from a very large, definitely more traditional midwestern family. i have always been very clear and upfront with the fact that i wanted a large family, and wanted to find a spouse who shared the same aspirations as i in life. i have spent the majority of my career working with children across various age ranges (elementary teacher) and this had only solidified my desire to have children of my own. this was always just something i wanted to share with my spouse, she knew i wanted a family with her and she always seemed to share my enthusiasm. she always told me she wanted to have 4 children, stay at home until they’re all in school, the works. she never indicated that she *didnt* want this, nor did she ever communicate to me that she’d changed her mind. honestly, i loved my wife dearly. but i always knew having children was a non negotiable for me. last october, i found out my wife had herself sterilized when i was out of the country helping care for my mother while my father went through rehabilitation treatment after an accident. my mother suffers from dementia so it wasn’t exactly optional for me to leave. i was only gone for 5 months, so this wasn’t just a spur of the moment decision. when i confronted her she confessed that she’d been having second thoughts about parenthood and had some conflicting feelings on reproduction as a whole for awhile at that point. she had already been making plans with a doctor she found in a nearby city and she told me she planned on telling me and being up front initially, but took advantage of the opportunity to keep it a secret from me when she knew i was planning on leaving. it was so calculated i felt like i could never trust her again. she intended on just telling me she was infertile because she “knew i’d never leave her over something like that”. she went through a major surgery and purposefully altered our futures without even talking to me. without even bothering to let me know or give me any sort of say in my part in the matter. she said she knew i’d leave, and she was right. i just find it incredibly selfish that she would do something like that behind my back and take away my choice to have children and never tell me. i can’t say for absolute certain the outcome would’ve been different, but i know i wouldn’t feel so deeply hurt and betrayed. i at least would’ve felt like i married someone who respected me enough to give me a choice. so today i’m sitting here alone and feeling like i have to completely restart my life in the same home i built with her. i loved her dearly, but i could never forgive that level of betrayal nor could i give up on my desire to build a family with the woman i love. i luckily was proactive about protecting my assets pre marriage, and that has led to a less than amicable situation between us. i don’t know exactly know why i feel so guilty for leaving her, but i knew that ultimately i had to make the choice that’s going to lead to happiness, rather than resentment. i hate when people ask me about the divorce because everyone that she has told about the situation thinks i’m a monster for leaving. i question myself about the whole thing, and i have such a pit in my stomach right now, but i can’t see how leaving a marriage with a spouse who doesn’t respect you, lies to you and premeditates ways to abuse your trust and love.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/aqx01k/today_im_signing_divorce_papers_because_my_wife/,,Today I’m signing divorce papers because my wife got sterilized behind my back.
"so i've started preparing everything for her death, it sounds fucked up when i write it out but i can see her mind is starting to go. she shares certain details with me that no one else knows, stuff like where she would like to be buried, what kind of funeral. she has lost everyone in her life and the last ones left are causing tremendous stress onto her. the culture of ""taking care of your elders"" has allowed my grandmother to be in a bad situation where there is essentially no escape. this plus living in a western country my family only sees retirement homes as evil, there isn't any money for her to live in one either and for the longest time my grandmother held together our family. she tries too hard to prove her mind is sharp as well as refuses any and all help. either shes gonna push herself to death in an accident or her mind will degenerate until about 100, but everyone not close to her can already tell whats happening. my family refuses to see the plain truth and instead fight me on everything; such as getting her treatment or taking her to a doctor just for a basic test... she makes a promise and forgets about it, than accuses me of thinking shes crazy making me out as the bad guy. i love her so much and we have a special connection, but my family seems too busy with their personal lives and they dont care enough to listen until it'll be too late. anyway last night she started telling me about memories that never happened, it could've been a dream or something maybe im over reacting. but when my family took her back home for a month she was devastated by how much things changed, this plus the fact that most of our family members have passed early or developed alzheimer's very quickly has got her in a bad mindset. after our trip she looked me dead in the eye and told me how she wouldn't want to struggle with alzheimer's and dementia. how she would prefer to leave only good memories behind and not memories of her failing in health. i'm not god to decide when someone lives or dies, but i feel obligated to do something. i'm only 20 so anything i say is ignored as ""being irrational"". tl;dr : my grandma knows her time on this earth is coming to an end, and she asked me to help her rest easy, i feel guilty as fuck because i dont want her to suffer but the way things are going nobody wants to help and i feel overwhelmed. i 100% wont do anything rash or stupid for the time being however something must be done."," my dad has dementia. when he could still talk, he used to beg me to kill him.  but then the next day he'd think he was my kid and it was his birthday, and i'd bake cupcakes and sing happy birthday and he'd be so happy that his mom gave him a birthday party. the day after that, he'd be telling everyone that he and my mom were about to have another baby and move to california, and he'd be happy and excited then too.  i realized that the days when he was really sad were part of the disease and that i couldn't make any decisions based on things he said. it was too late to discuss his wishes as far as medical intervention if he reached a crisis point. we had to do what my mom wanted in those instances, even though it's prolonged my dad's life when he's got no quality of life left.it sounds like your grandmother may be at the point where she can't really make any decisions like that for herself. she wouldn't be asking you to do anything that could get you in trouble or weigh heavily on your conscience, if she were still herself.  it's important that she see a doctor, because there are meds that can slow the progression of alzheimer's if they're started soon enough. your family seems to be in denial, but getting her some help now could give her a few more good years than she'll have otherwise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/aqv9e6/my_grandmother_told_me_she_doesnt_want_to_suffer/,,My grandmother told me she doesn't want to suffer in her last moments
"i can't remember the first time my mother told me i could have been a late term abortion. i remember being barely 16 and finding out i had a brain disease. i remember lying in bed with my then boyfriend. my pillow soaked with tears and the only thing i can remember thinking is the story my mother told me. the story of how i was almost a late term abortion. at that time, i had my first seizure that my mother could tell was a seizure. i forgot who i was and where i was when all my seizures previously had been space out kinds.  all my late blooming tactics that every teacher thought from pre k up was me being unfocused and disinterested was a brain disease.  i had cysts on my brain, ovaries and than a  tumor taking over my entire stomach. not to mention i was suppose to be severally retarded. they put my mother in emergency birth on christmas eve or i was to die, a month after my mother said she wanted me and had decided to keep me. i was born 2 weeks early and nothing was there. they never did check ups and i was left ostracized from not only my classmates, but my teachers for being weird. i'm 19 now. i have dementia, seizures, my cognitive ability sucks, (even if it wasnt for the seizures cant drive a car) chronic pain,  hallucinations, ocd, depression, , numbness, deaf in one ear, partial blindness, migraines, dizziness, and all kinds of symptoms you wouldn't even think to think of. i've had brain surgery. yeah the thing you literally could not live without, was touched and cut up. i was on over 10 pills a day at one point. i'm 7 times more likely than the average 40yr old to have a stroke.  i can't get too upset without having a seizure. i can't remember a time where something wasn't looming over me and making life hard in every aspect. what i can remember is all the times wishing my mother had aborted me. wishing i was normal. wishing all of my symptoms and my brain to just go away. my mother now and i have spoke about the situation, about how she could have aborted me. she says knowing what she knew now, all the doctors and ignoring all my issues and my life being extremely hard for no other reasons than being disabled and the people around me not listening, she would abort me. she would abort me because of all of my pain and suffering that could have been prevented even with just watching my head from an early age!you know what though? i agree with her 100% of the way.  i was almost another statistic of abortion and i wish i had been.", (remorse) ,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/aqcmfh/i_was_almost_a_late_term_abortion_i_wish_i_had/,,I was almost a late term abortion; I wish I had been.
"first off throw away account. i felt that i should post this after liam neeson said something. i myself was bullied both physically and verbally and have i think a similar story.  i cant understand how it must have felt for liam to have something like that happen to an important person, but i do know what it was like to be bullied.   tldr at bottoma bit of backstory into who i am. i am on the spectrum, dyslexic, adhd, and have a mild case of ocd to say the least i wasn't really normal. i tested dyslexic as a child and all the others where proved when i was in high school or college those and depression. i was a terror to be around bouncing off the walls and couldn't understand why fart jokes where funny and couldn't read social cues at all. my parents tried their best to raise us as color blind kids i have (younger) cousins that are black that i absolutely adore. my family isn't perfect and has some issues, but we aren't racist save for like grandpa steve and well hes got dementia and before that he wasn't.  in 4th grade hurricane katriana happened in new orleans. my school district ended up receiving something like 20,000 new students my own class went up by about 5-8 students from about 23-25 to around 26-33. the teacher who was also black was experienced had a really hard time getting all the kids to integrate and they ended up forming a click. at this time i was already a bit of a social outcast, but not really actively bullied just kinda tolerated.   from this point on until the end of the year i was ruthlessly bullied. it started out as stuff like making up a mean nickname and calling me it repeatedly or breaking/stealing my school supplies. then it slowly escalated into actually physical abuse with things like indian burns, and wet willies (which aren't that big of a deal but still hurts. the physical abuse escalated into being sent to the nurses office and finally the hospital with i think a broken nose and broken arm. i would tell the teacher about this stuff, but she didn't believe me. when i got sent to the nurses office i was playing wall ball me and one of the guys in the click ran forward cause we both got touched by the ball. when i got up to the wall the guy ends up slamming my face into the brick wall and grinding it across it. my teacher who was outside at the time of the incident would go on to say that it was an accident that she knew the other boy was a good guy. the second and last time was on my way in from recess one day while out drawing things in the dirt out of sight from the teachers the kids followed me and beat me up. from that confrontation i ended up with a broken nose, a chipped tooth, and i think they broke something in my arm all i remember was having a cast on my arm. i went from a fairly outgoing kid to sitting inside during recess to read. my parents after the broken bones threatened to sue the school. they did get my medical bills paid for through i think a lawsuit settled through our insurance company. i ended up transferring out to another elementary school in my area and my mom having to drive me to school. my parents did try contacting the school before the heavy physical abuse started but most of it was out of sight from teachers.    to say the least i really hated black people after 4th grade and had a massive distrust towards adults especially black ones. this would follow me most of the way up through high school and making 2 black friend in high school damion and leon. i never really acted on the anger just kinda had really mean thoughts about black people and would think of them as beasts.    the final part to this is that i don't hate black people or distrust them, but at the same time its hard for me to say i am sorry for how i thought and felt at that time. i was deeply hurt physically and emotionally and its hard for me to look back and say yeah confessionsi17 you where totally wrong and should feel bad about how you felt. the me back then i think was justifiably upset and distrusting towards them. the distrust i think is especially warranted when, the teacher, the person who was supposed to be protecting me kinda just let it happen and was also black. i can say now that yeah i know that all black people aren't like that and that there are terrible people of every race. its just that i cant apologies for how i felt at a different time in my life it was who i was at that time. i have changed and am different now, but i cant blame the younger version of myself or really condemn him. i'm not him anymore, but that time was hard and i was still bullied at my new school just not as bad.  that was something that i had to grow through and change through it shaped much of my childhood into adult life. i am who i am because of those guys and there are the occasional day that goes by when i ask what if that stuff never happened.  those kids robbed my innocence as a 4th grader and that was something that shouldn't be done to any child for as long as possible.  tldr: myself being a high functioning autistic kid, adhd, and ocd nightmare of a student ends up being ruthlessly bullied for 2 months by black students while having a black teacher in the 4th grade. i ended up suffering physical and verbal abuse and holding a grudge/distrust for black people up until about 9th grade.", you shouldn't hold an entire race responsible for

"hi all,  i’m josh, i’m 17 and yesterday i finally gave up... i’m tired of fighting, i’m tired of the pain, i’m even tired of the loneliness, i really don’t know what to do. this is my final call for help.my life for the last 10 years has been nothing but a downward spiral into nothingness. i’ve shut off all of my emotions to my small family at home that claim to “love” me. it’s a coping mechanism.  as a child, i was abused and raped by an older cousin multiple times upon other humiliating things, i was seven. last year, my mum pryed it out of me as i slipped up while listening to her and my stepdad talking about something that happened separately in my childhood when it came to this same cousin ( i was too young to remember) , i thought they knew, and that’s how it all came out. after a long two year trial and investigation, he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment, which he will only serve half. i never wanted to go to court, i never wanted anyone to know, but even after all of it, i feel failed by our justice system. i was blamed by him and blamed myself for years and still do, threatened that if i told anyone i’d be killed, and as a small child i believed it. it’s still humiliating to this day. other than that, there are other things that are minor, but still have had an impact. growing up with a white family and a single mother while looking like your arab father who you had never met, always feeling out of place. like i never fit in with my own family. not having a father figure, having a young dumb mother. i was close to my grandma, she’s the only one i ever really felt comfortable with, but i watched her pass away in 2012, due to dementia and other health problems. since then, i’ve been empty, and it doesn’t get better. i dated a girl for a year and a half, i went through incredible mental pain with her too. the mother and her family were very racist (openly) i’m brown, and they are polish. yes, me and her daughter were fucking, and i took her virginity, but we thought we “loved” eachother. the mother would often take her phone from her randomly, invade her privacy, physically abuse her and mentally, but most of all this girl was very easily manipulated into hating me by the mother... she was sent back to poland multiple times, as she never wanted to stand up to hermother. she even fell pregnant, i said i would be there for her, support her decision and the kid as she wanted to keep it, but because the mother told her to abort it, she did. she is a very weak minded individual but that hurt. she was my only friend. i just want to hurt her now, but i know i can’t. i don’t have any gcse’s and spent very little time in secondary school due to health problems, i’ve got an autoimmune disease called chrons disease, which is where your own bacteria in your gut / intestines attacks itself. i was referred to a hospital finally and got a diagnosis after countless years last year. i’ve got bad stomach ulcers, and my birth dad alsohas this condition, he’s on oxycodone, an opiate, has had 80% of his intestines removed and is basically the equivalent to a crackhead. due to no prospects or qualifications, i decided that i would go into full time work after two years of doing nothing because of my stomach. i went in as a kitchen porter but quickly progressed onto being a kitchen assistant, then leaving that job after 3 months, i was employed as a commis chef alongside my head chef who was michelin starred. it was a good experience, i wasn’t on the same wage as people on the floor or bar but i kind of enjoyed being a chef. i left that job, i’ve given up on everything and i’m just tired of everything. i once again, have nothing. or anyone i feel like i can talk to, not to mention, that i don’t have any friends whatsoever, not one. i’ve thought about and still do like the idea of not being here anymore, but i’m too much of an idiot to do it as i don’t want it to be painful. but i don’t want to be here anymore. this is my final call for help, just one friend, in london that i can just talk to, who won’t betray me. that’s all i ask. thanks for taking time to read this.kind regards,josh", good fucking luck.,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/aiztw7/self_destruction_and_loneliness/,,Self destruction and loneliness

"\[extremely long\] \[conflicted\]&amp;#x200b;tldr: i had a panic attack when trying to call an ambulance for my mom (suffering from organ failure) and horribly forced her to call an hour later instead out of anger towards her and the things she put our family through. never told anyone.&amp;#x200b;this happened a few years ago, when i was 15.&amp;#x200b;my mom was an extreme alcoholic for three years and that's really all it took for her body to fall apart. by this point, she had been going to the er weekly to get detoxed and have her liver cirrhosis treated. &amp;#x200b;two weeks ago, her mother died of complications from her alzheimer's. her mother's diagnosis three years ago was a large part of why she was drinking, but she was abused--sexually, emotionally and physically--her whole entire life.&amp;#x200b;i came downstairs at around 12pm that day because i wanted to quiet down my mom, who was shouting in pain. this was relatively common, hence why i was just going to calm her down. &amp;#x200b;she was laid on her back on the couch with her shirt raised and her hands on her large, inflated stomach. her face was red, and her whole body was shaking, covered in sweat. &amp;#x200b;this was a fairly common sight to me as well. it just meant that it was time to wait for someone to show up and drive her to the er again. but this time was different; she was sobbing, tears running down her face as she begged for god. my mom was never one to cry in front of me, despite of all that happened to her. so i was shocked. this was probably the first time i'd seen her cry in 7 years. i looked over to the coffee table and saw my grandmother's box of ashes pried open and the bag inside torn. &amp;#x200b;i asked her if she was upset about her mother. she sobbed for another minute without saying anything, but eventually replied that she wasn't. ""it hurts so bad \[me\], i just wanna die.""&amp;#x200b;i asked her if she would be okay, unable to think of anything else. she said no. this time was real. she had never been in this much pain before in her life.&amp;#x200b;i laughed and asked, ""not even when you gave birth to \[my brother\]?"" and she continued sobbing. &amp;#x200b;""no, \[me\], i need to go to the hospital, i'm gonna die.""&amp;#x200b;i remembered, at that time, studying about an ""impending sense of doom"". how some people just know when they're in their final moments. i suddenly felt uncomfortably close to reality.&amp;#x200b;i told her that we would have to wait until my uncle got home to drive her. she said okay, at first, but after around only five minutes she began panicking between her cries. &amp;#x200b;""i'm really gonna die, \[me\]. you need to call an ambulance.""&amp;#x200b;influenced by her panic, i told her i would, but i would need to use her phone, since my bill wasn't paid. her phone was under her of course, and when she rolled over to get it she ripped out the most chilling scream i'd heard in my young life. i shushed her quickly, (like how people did in movies to calm others down) and told her she would be okay while taking the phone out of her hand.&amp;#x200b;as i dialed those three numbers, numbers i never had to dial before, i listened to the sound of my mother breathing loudly in the background. sort of like the way a pregnant woman breathes in labor. i froze before i could start the call, and my whole life was laid out in front of me at once.&amp;#x200b;i grew up silent. introverted and anxious, but not anxious enough to warrant help, according to my mother. i hated phone calls more than anything else. being unable to see a person's face when i talk to them tears into me to this very day. back in that moment, it was enough to completely halt me in my tracks and begin a small crisis within me.&amp;#x200b;single and with an abhorrence towards all men (because of all of the abuse she took from them in her life), my mother struggled to support us. because of this, she treated us like our lives belonged to her only. she took out her anger and stress on my older brother by abusing him physically and emotionally. she used him as an example for what would happen to me if i didn't listen to her.&amp;#x200b;he tried to leave the house at 16. my mom picked up the metal bat he used to play baseball with and tried to beat him with it. he stayed, and attempted suicide maybe a week later. this was the first of the three that i know of. &amp;#x200b;but my mom loved me so much. she provided me with what she could using all of her time. with this in mind, i started the 911 call.&amp;#x200b;they answered, asked where my emergency was. i couldn't say anything. my mom shouted in the distance. i shook so hard the phone nearly fell out of my hand. my heart in my throat, i ended the call.&amp;#x200b;my mom lost everything to alcoholism. she lost a lot of my ignorant respect. she lost most of the kind treatment she had for me, or anyone around her. her mother was diagnosed with alzheimer's and my mother beat and shouted at her daily. i had to move in with my grandmother to protect her and force my mother out of her room. i cared for her until she died.&amp;#x200b;911.. called back. i didn't know they could do that. it was terrifying, and i let it ring for what felt like forever. my mom yelled at me to answer it, and i was already flooding with anger and anxiety. i told her i couldn't do it. she cried, more hopeless-sounding.&amp;#x200b;i knew she would die if she didn't go soon. but i spent so much of my life being furious with this woman. she was abused, and abused as a result of it. everything combined, i came to the resolution that i would not call the ambulance for her. i gave the phone to her and told her to do it herself.&amp;#x200b;i watched as she failed to dial the right number 3 times, and struggle to get our address out once she got it. she was babbling and unable to get a full sentence out without a frantic breath between each word. it took forever.&amp;#x200b;

"my roommate has a 15 or 16 year old cat that's very annoying. she's extremely loud at all hours of the day. she just won't stop meowing.  on top of that she does this really weird deep meow that's louder than normal. she does this everytime she's done eating, drinking, or traveling from the kitchen to the living room. want to watch tv? nope, meowing. want to play online with friends? nope the meowing keeps me from using a headset. the vet says this is probably the result of cat dementia. idkthere are nights when i can't sleep at all because of it. if the door to the room is closed she will scratch at it to get in. if it's open she will come in the bed and meow all night. the cat stopped grooming itself and will drop patches of fur everywhere she walks. the dining room table, kitchen counter, bed, restroom, everywhere. the cat vomits up food everyday often in places where human good is prepared aka the kitchen counter and sink area. it's gross!! she also smell so bad. yesterday we had to clean vomit in the fur around her mouth. the roommate just says, ""well she's old"" as if that excuses the cat. i feel like the roommate doesn't care much. nothing the cat does bothers her. i hate pets walking across furniture or near where human food is prepared.the cat has long hair so a lot of it on the feet and butt area is covered in poop. i hate the fact that the cat tracks poop everywhere it walks. we try to keep her brushed and wipe the cat down, but i feel that the cat should be cleaning itself. isn't that what cats are known for? again probably the cat dementia. this cat will jump on the table and eat your food. i hate this animal! i feel that it lived long enough and should be put down peacefully. i've always had cats and dogs and never felt this way before towards an animal before. it's 6:30am and i haven't slept for 7 hours because this cat won't shut up. another roommate left last year because of the cat. they couldn't put with it after working 14 hour days. despite the way i feel towards her i gave her a piece of turkey from yesterday's dinner to be nice. she purred and liked it. am i a bad person for having such feeling towards a pet?", cats are the devil,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/a9p3ew/i_hate_my_roommates_cat_and_wish_it_would_die/,,I hate my roommate's cat and wish it would die

"for years, my mom and her bestie joked about not wanting to be old or a burden. they said they would drive my stepdather's old truck over the edge of a cliff when the time came.my mom has never stopped making jokes about this, and for a long time it bothered me and i would tell her to cut that shit out.in the last 5ish years, she has become completely fixated on death of all sorts. for a while it seemed she was going to every tom, dick, and harry's funeral that she had even a remote social connection to, such as a relative of an acquaintance in a social club, when she had never met them. i understand supporting a friend, but these are just acquaintances.prior to setting up their trust, she wanted to ""sit down and talk"" about it and would bring it up literally every time i would talk with her. and yet, she would never have the talk when she was here because she is always getting shitface drunk. frankly, it's none of my business anyway. just do what you are going to do and when the time comes, your shit will get distributed how you mandate. that is the whole point of a trust and a will, isn't it?lately she has been quickly spiraling into dementia and at the same time, trying to deal with health issues of hers and her husband. she needs surgery on her joints and has had some as well as is scheduling some more, so i don't think she is going to harm herself immediately. likewise, they are still seeing doctors for his issues and planning more surgeries. but, while at his latest visits, it came up that he might have some rare cancer. when he had prostate cancer, they were pretty upbeat and he had it removed, recovering back to business as usual shortly after with a few manageable side effects. this time she told me as a secret and sounded very grim about it.yesterday she told me about the sudden death of a close family friend/permanent fixture in our lives at one point when i was a kid. she told me again later because she was drunk. when my husband got home from work, she tried telling him and i had to remind her that he had no fucking idea who this person was, never met him, and had never so much as heard a story about him since he was no longer a part of my families lives much after we moved to another state when i was 12. why would my husband even care, and also why bring this up over dinner? wtf?today my husband told me that she told him at least two times that we would be taking their dogs in because she and her husband were not going to be there ""at the end"" and the dogs would need somewhere to go. the dogs are at least 6 or 7 years old, so not that much time left in them. does she think she will be gone before the dogs' 10-12 year expected lifespan?i understand that the still a maybe diagnosis of a form of cancer could, if accurate, take her husband in that 5-ish year window of time, but she doesn't have any life ending issues.this is why i think she is going to commit suicide one day. if he dies, i am certain she will just kill herself, and it sounds like she thinks he is now dying. (and yet i am still not supposed to know he might be getting diagnosed with this cancer.)he has always taken care of everything around the house and she has become entirely dependent upon him. she still drives around the small town they moved to about 10 years ago, but no long hauls (like the hours it takes to get back into town to see us or for their various appointments, and never ever at night).she knows she is ""forgetting things"" a lot, but has not used the term dementia. as someone who knows her, it is serious, but to an outsider or even a doctor seeing her in short visits, it is subtle. you realize it more when she sits down and really starts talking and repeating stories you wouldn't be chatting about with a doctor. like within 15 minutes - same story again as if it was new. or constantly losing things and thinking someone is breaking into their home taking them -- and returning them (!!!!!) when she happens to find them again. (as if!)so, yeah, she feels like she's losing it a little, but is also in denial. i feel like if her husband dies, she will give up and commit suicide.as is customary in our family, i am not bringing it up to her so not doing anything to try to stop her. wow this got long! and there is still so much more to it, but i will step away from this here.", try to talk to her about it now as your older and more mature so will be able to talk about and understand it from a new perspective.,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/a9iwxe/pretty_sure_my_mom_71_is_going_to_commit_suicide/,,Pretty sure my mom (71) is going to commit suicide and I am not doing anything to stop her.

"so, a little thought process behind my feelings. a few months ago, my great grandmother (mom's grandmother) passed. i don't know my extended family very well, only a couple cousins, grandparents and aunts and uncles. so for my mother to be talking to me about it, how my great grandfather is having a hard time dealing because he's now got early stages of dementia and keeps forgetting she's died, and the drama of her uncle being selfish and not wanting to take care of him,  i just felt disconnected. i didn't/don't know any of them very well, only ever saw them maybe 3 times my whole life, and so it didn't seem like someone in my family had died, just someone my mother and grandparents knew. i felt horrible after a week about how i spoke about her to my parents, how i understood if my mom wanted to go see her one last time, but that i didn't really care because i didn't know her at all. even saying that sounds harsh now, and it hit a lot harder in the moment. it was a shitty way of saying it, but it was true. now, just yesterday, we got news that my grandfather (dad's father), who had been in and out the hospital for a few minor health concerns lately, had some intestinal blockage that the first doctor diagnosed as a possible incurable cancer. the second doctor said that was too extreme and disagreed with the diagnosis and wanted more tests done, and for him to go into surgery in attempt to remove the blockage before it gets bad. however, if it is cancer, they still think it would be curable. the problem is, my grandparents are pretty strict health nuts who disagree with a bit of modern medicine practices and such, and we're concerned he may refuse to go through kemo. now, to the point of the post. i am a lot closer with these (and the other pair) of grandparents than my great grandparents. in fact, i have memories of meeting them first more so than my mom's parents, so i'd say i'm closer with them specifically compared to my other grandparents. and i'm worried, sure, and i feel for my dad and what he could be going through right now, but i don't feel any preemptive sadness that he may die. in fact, i just feel like i'd go through the motions; call my grandmother, hug my dad, hell if it comes to it i would probably go to the funeral. but i don't know if i'd be sad then either. i feel so selfish for thinking that way. i'm closer with my grandparents, but yet again, i only ever see them once a year if that, and i don't really feel like they're a part of our close family, even though i know they are. i guess what i'm trying to say is that if they aren't constantly in our lives, i don't really think of them all that much. now take my mom's parents for instance. they recently moved up here to be closer to us, are getting a house built, and can visit any time they want. hell, they're celebrating thanksgiving with us today. so if they were to be gone, it would have a greater impact i think. but because of the distance, even though i'm emotionally closer to them, i don't feel the same way for my dad's parents. i guess at this point i'm ranting. so i'm gonna stop. feel free to tell me how shitty of a person i am, i can take it. but it's all the truth."," ""that's what old people do. they die!"" -vince vaughn",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9zep2z/my_grandfather_may_die_soon_and_i_dont_feel_sad/,,My grandfather may die soon and I don't feel sad
"i don’t like to complain. i honestly can’t remember having complained about anything in my life other than jokingly. but one thing that has always been hard for me is the fact that i’ve never had anyone i could truly talk to, and i still don’t. in some ways, it can be a good thing, and in some ways, it can be a bad thing. on the bad side, everything that happens to me stays bottled up in my head and this is the first time in my life that i’ve ever tried to write any of it. and on the good side, no one knows anything about me other than what i let them see, including the very small amount of people that i consider to be my friends.i had some free time yesterday and i read a couple of people’s posts here and i thought i would give an attempt at creating my own, i really don’t expect anyone to read it, but i have some spare time at the moment and it feels nice to fantasize that someone might actually take the time to do so. so here it goes, as truthful and accurate as i can be. (names changed)my mother, ann, got divorced a few years before i was born. she ended up sleeping with her previous husbands’ boss, my father, who was also married, and here i am. we moved around a few times when i was at a young age and spent a lot more time in hotels than i would have liked, but regardless, things seemed to be okay. when i was four years old, i was in school and i remember being called into the principal’s office and she sat me down and gave me a cookie and asked me what my favorite show on television was. i didn’t have a television but i did recall seeing an episode of mr. rodger’s neighborhood at some point or another, so i asked her if that was available. not too long after, my mother came and got me out of school and we ended up going to the beach with my uncle and aunt so that i would be in a peaceful place when they tried to explain to me at age four that my father had decided he couldn’t deal with having 2 families so he drove out to a river somewhere and killed himself.around a year or two later my mother started interacting with a man who we’ll call cody whom i didn’t care for in the least and before i knew it, i was being adopted, my name changed, and there was a new man living in the house. i distinctly remember around age six, walking into the kitchen and seeing him placing all of his coffee cups in our cabinet and not being able to understand the concept of having a new person move in who i was supposed to be comfortable with calling dad. unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, things didn’t turn out as i had hoped and i ended up spending the next eight years of my childhood with the most abusive, condescending person i have yet to have the pleasure of meeting. when i turned thirteen, due to my intense living environment and my inability to handle extremely stressful situations on a daily basis at that age, i developed severe acne. at age fourteen i had finally saved enough money cutting grass to visit a dermatologist who told me that there really wasn’t anything they could do because of it being such a bad case. they gave me an option to go on accutane at a discounted rate, although i wasn’t able to continue the treatment due to side effects that the drug was having on me.at age fifteen my acne was at its worst point and i was halfway through high school with not a single friend or so much as an acquaintance other than the seldom teacher who felt bad for me asking me how my day was going. around this time, my mother and cody had a daughter and cody caught her cheating on him with a local businessman. after that, they got divorced and they had split custody of their daughter, and i stayed with my mother full time.at age sixteen, with the rise of technology, i began to start learning just about everything that there is to know about computers, it was my first side hobby and i was surprisingly good at it considering my age, and i could always figure things out very easily despite always being much more interested in books than technology (and still am). as soon as i started 11th grade in high school, i learned i had a problem. there was an ever-growing number of gangs in my school and i was getting bullied daily due to my severe acne. this was one of the lowest points in my life, one day, i was in class, sitting next to one of the lead gang members when i noticed he was having trouble on a test. i saw an opportunity and from then on, he received a passing grade on every test he took in the classes that we had together, in exchange for my not being bothered by any of the gang members and to some extent, having their protection. i felt like i was in prison, but it worked.at age seventeen, i began to notice the first signs of my acne getting slightly better, it was a slow process, but it was better than nothing. things had been going well for almost a month since my mother got divorced and my happiness level was slowly rising now that i rarely saw cody and my mother stopped associating with the man she was cheating on him with. she had her daughter every other week and although i never formed a relationship with her, it didn’t bother me.it was at this time that i learned that one of my cousins, daniel, who i had only seen once prior to this incident, was getting out of jail again. he had been locked up most of his adult life and he was around age twenty-eight when he got out. what i didn’t know is that due to his mother (my aunt), not being able to go and get him, that me, along with my mother, ann, we're going to have to. i had just gotten my driver’s license and decided to drive my new (to me) car separately on the eight-hour trip to the worst maximum-security penitentiary in the state. a couple of days later, we were there, and stayed at a hotel nearby. what i didn’t know, however, was that my mother and her fresh-out-of-jail nephew (my cousin daniel), we're going to be sleeping in the same room and going at it for the next couple of days. upon learning this, i decided to head back home early.i was home for a couple of days before i was given the news that daniel would be moving in with us. over the course of the next few weeks, i was given the pleasure of the hearing my mother ride her nephew more times than anyone should ever have to. it was at this point that i became agitated and decided to visit my aunt cordelia (daniel’s mother), and explain to her what was happening. upon doing so, she replied that she had already previously assumed it and that her, along with my uncle adam (her husband), would be having a talk with them the following day. adam was the closest thing that i had to a father, it was rare that we saw each other, but when we did, we always seemed to get along alright.after adam and cordelia visited my mother and daniel, my mother decided to express to them that she didn’t care what they thought and that she was perfectly fine with being disowned from her entire family as long as it meant that she was still able to be together, and have sexual relations with, her nephew. at this point, the only family that i had left (adam and cordelia), began to worry about me staying with my mother due to her mental state and what she had done.i didn’t want them to think that i supported my mother in any way with what she was doing, and with her son being involved, i couldn’t be a part of what was going on out of sheer respect for cordelia and my uncle adam. so, i decided that 4 months before my eighteenth birthday, i was going to beg my grandmother eva to stay at her house for a while. eva was adam and ann’s mother and she assisted in raising me while my mother was working, and after my mother got fired for making out (amongst other things) with someone in the parking lot at her workplace, she didn’t have to help out anymore. eva accepted in exchange for me helping out around the house, and that is where i currently reside.i am eighteen years old, i have my high school diploma, and i’m living with my grandmother, a seventy-year-old woman with severe dementia. she is heavily religious and it took me 2 months to get her to trust me enough to believe me if i said i was going to run to the store to get groceries or something. she questioned everything i did (and somewhat still does), i imagine in her mind she pictures me going out and meeting someone or partying or something, when in reality, i haven’t touched alcohol since the one time my mother gave it to me. i hate drinking and i don’t want any part of it, nor have i ever done any kind of drug, i’ve never been to a party in my entire life, and the only friends that i have are adam, cordelia, and my neighbor jack who’s house i occasionally eat at. that’s it. i have no social media, i don’t talk to anyone, and i’m not where i belong in life. i’m trying to get my bachelor’s degree, i’ve signed up for several colleges (and some online), although i don’t know how far i’ll be able to get if i don’t get some form of financial aid. i just know that i’m not where i belong in life, i didn’t have the best grades in school, i maintained a c average and somehow, with all i was going through and not having any support, i got out with a 3.0gpa.just recently i got an interview at a big company in charlotte, nc where my aunt cordelia works, and not having a college degree i thought i did pretty good. i remember her calling me afterward, she told me that her boss talked about me for 2 hours and that he was completely blown away by me. he said he didn’t care about my experience and that his only concern with hiring me was that he wasn’t sure if i would be motivated down the road. i remember cordelia telling me that she was proud of me, and i’d never had anybody tell me that before like that. i knew that she meant it and i cried like crazy after the conversation. i think that’s one of the best memories i have of this life.her boss couldn’t hire me because of a company policy being put into place about having two people that were related working under the same roof. i applied at my local city hall for an administration position and they said that they’d like to have me and are working on putting the position together. that was a month and a half ago. they keep telling me that they're working on it when i ask, but i don’t know whether or not to believe it anymore. i know i have talent, i know despite all that i have been through i am excellent with people. i know that i have a gift of being able to see everyone’s point of view and everyone’s side of the story. i can read people easily and people always understand me. but there’s an issue with that, the few people that i do have left to rely on don’t support me. they have told me that i’ll do great and that i’m so much better than my competition, but they said it with an attitude such as if i don’t then they will disown me. i don’t know what i’m doing, i know i don’t belong here. i know that i’m destined for so much more than the workforce.i have always been able to see things, and i do not see myself at a regular job. something told me to write this letter, so i did. it is one of the hardest things that i have had to do in my life, not because of its complexity, but because it is about me. i hate talking about myself, i don’t like bragging, i don’t like making myself seem a certain way, i don’t like people knowing my history or anything about me for that matter, i dress as nicely as i can, and i have been told that looking at me you aren’t able to tell a thing. but deep inside me, i’m dying, i need change. i don’t have anything tying me here, i don't have anyone and the only form of social media that i have is an email.if i were to disappear, no one would bat an eye. i'm eighteen years old (although i feel like i'm sixty) i have no mother, i have no father, my grandmother is seventy and has dementia, as mean as it sounds, she wouldn’t understand what was going on. my aunt and uncle would report me missing, but what are they going to show anyone? i don’t have any kind of account for them to look at, neither one of them could describe me because they hardly know anything about me other than what i look like. in five minutes, i could gather the 3 pictures that they have of me and be on my way, the only thing that they would be able to say is my hair color, the fact that i have acne scars, and i'm tall and skinny. even if my neighbor jack tried to pursue anything, he would be in the same boat as my aunt and uncle, there isn’t anything for them to follow. the few times that they have asked me what my goals are, i have always joked at moving away, in the end, they would probably just accept that i did just that.this letter is the first time that i have made myself known, albeit anonymously. there isn’t anyone reading this that could connect this to me, no one knows me.if there is anyone out there that would like an assistant and has enough money to fly me wherever they are located, and maybe give me a nice retirement account, i’d like to meet you. i don’t care what you look like, i don’t care who you are, and i don’t care what you are. i am open to all. in 5 minutes, i can drop everything and be on a plane out of here, and i guarantee you, without a doubt in my mind, that i will be the absolute best assistant you have ever had. i’m dying for a chance at a new life, i do believe that for the first eighteen years of mine i have gotten the short end of the stick, although i do know that people have had worse, i also know that i am willing to do anything necessary to prove myself to anyone that would like a reliable, dependable, assistant.if there is anyone out there who has the ability to help someone start at nothing and become something, i am available for the taking, whether it is someone who wants someone to teach all that they know or someone who wants someone to live this life with, i will be your best choice, and i will do what is necessary, without hesitation. throughout everything that i have been through, i have always remained calm and collective, the only thing that i lack is emotion.if anyone would like me, send me a message and i will respond promptly, i can be ready in 5, and i guarantee i will blow my competition out of the water.for anyone that took the time to read this in its entirety, thank you.thursday, november 15, 2018","

"i work in a group home for low functioning adults. one of them is an old man with aggressive alzheimers that's almost ready to move to hospice care. the old man is a willowbrook survivor which endears him to a lot of people, even though he was violent in his cognizant days, sucker punching staff and fellow consumers alike (never me though, although he tried to bite me when i took an empty plate from him once). now his faculties have degenerated to the point that he is non-verbal, nearly blind, unable to walk, and spends most of his time in a wheelchair, which wouldn't be a problem, but the house is small with lots of tight corners and tight spaces (except for the living room).he is worth a lot of work.trying to help him is impossible. there is always some kind of resistance. you try to clean him and his instincts kick in and you get shoved or a thumb in the eye. you try to help him walk and his legs shoot out. try to lead him somewhere, get him to sit down, move and he becomes stiff like a board. get him walking and he's as loose as can be. even lifting him if he falls down is difficult, he fights me off as i try to help him to safety.bottom line is that he's either un-naturally tense at all times, arms drawn inward, or so loose and groggy that he needs to be carried everywhere.and i just hate him. to me, he's a stone around my neck that i have to begrudgingly carry. i'm spending my life taking care of what's left of his for near to no reward or thanks. do i know he can't help how he is? yeah. do i care anymore? no.i'm at my job 56 to 64 hours a week, and i have very little personal life or family life. i'm stretched so thin that all my relationships are suffering. when i get asked to work overtime my wife guilt trips me and it kills me inside. if he wasn't there, i would still be here but be much less overworked.make no mistake, i don't want harm to befall him, i don't want him to die. i wish they'd move him into hospice care or a nice nursing home with all the ice cream he could eat and his favorite shows (old westerns in his case). i really want the best for him. i just want him far away from me and i want to never see him ever again."," sounds like you had a bad day, or you're in the wrong line of work for yourself. i always assumed everything you just described was par for the course in that line of work.edit typo ",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9x6gki/i_hate_the_old_man_im_paid_to_take_care_of/,,I hate the old man I'm paid to take care of.
"i work in a home for elderly people on the station for demented people (alzheimer's and friends: people that 'forget' most basic things, including eating, walking, talking). we help them go through the day, play easy games, watch movies, sing songs. mostly, i'm helping them to eat. we have one guest (we don't call them patients) who can't speak anymore, but they play nine men's morris very well. demented people sometimes retain very specific things extremely well, but forget other things that you would assume are less basic. so they play nine men's morris like a demi~~gorgon~~god (i.e. beating all the other nurses.)yesterday it was my turn playing against them for the first time. i am a very competitive person. it just so happened that another nurse talked to me in the early game and i messed up placing two or so pieces. i lost the game subsequently with everybody watching (nurses and guests) and telling me that i had it coming, they are just too good. everybody left and i destroyed them in all 9 following games without considering letting them win. i didn't tell them when they made an obviously dementia-related misplay (e.g. not closing mills.) i wasn't mad; more like frustrated that i lost in front of everyone because i was distracted. to my defense, \_they\_ restarted the game every time. i didn't force them. i feel bad about it. i don't know what is inside their head or how much they actually processed but i hope it's not a bad feeling of having lost in a game that they were good at in a previous life.", don’t worry they won’t remember this,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9vx376/i_beat_a_demented_person_91_in_nine_mens_morris/,,I beat a demented person 9:1 in nine men's morris (mill)

"i was driving home from work and had been drinking. i don’t think i was drunk, but i had been drinking (this will be important later.) i had just worked a double and was up the night before i went in with my kid having strep. so i was pretty depressed and disoriented at this point in my life and stopping off for a couple beers was a relatively new thing. i stayed longer than i‘d planned and i was driving pretty fast (15-20 over the limit) to try and get home on time to take over the kids before my boyfriend had to leave for work. it was still dark so i took a sharp turn and didn’t see this woman in the crosswalk. i hit her. i panicked. i saw she wasn’t moving and i looked around but the only businesses weren’t open yet and i wasn’t more than three miles from my house so i just gunned it home (pre cellphone era). i didn’t stop to think about the body lying in the street. i was not making the most rational decisions at this point. i swerved around it and drove home as fast as i could. ran inside. threw up violently. and picked up my phone to call 911. then my son woke up. he wanted cereal. i made him cereal. 30 minutes had elapsed at this point from when i hit the person and there was something in me that kept saying i had to get other things done before i made the call. i also thought to myself “as soon as they get here they’re gonna breathalyzer me. i should drink some water and make sure i’m completely sober when that happens before i call.” i know it doesn’t make sense now, but it sounded perfectly rational at the time. the rationale i kept telling myself also being “somebody’s probably already found her and called 911. no need to tye up their resources with multiple calls” the whole morning was kind of a blur. i was supposed to drop my mom off at her rec center. i couldn’t leave the house, i couldn’t get in my car. she was pestering me and pestering me and i was just so focused on how much time has elapsed since i hit the person i couldn’t really focus on anything anyone was saying to me. “45 minutes. she must be in the er by now. an hour fifteen minutes she’s probably been admitted to the hospital.” etc. eventually my brother got woke up and saw my mother was still home and asked her what was up and she said i wouldn’t take her and she didn’t know why. so my brother said he’d take her. so he went outside to get the car and he saw i’d obviously hit something. so he came inside and he said basically “is there something we need to talk about?” and the whole story came pouring out and as i described it to him it was the first time since it happened that it started to feel real and i’d realized i’d missed my window for it to be at all ok when i left the scene and i didn’t call police. as i began to grasp the severity of the situation i just started to think about my kids. it was like someone had tied cinder blocks to my hands and feet. it was a familiar feeling. i have a record already for a nonviolent offense and my boyfriend tries really hard to be a good father but i would die before i let him have soul custody. the feeling of your actions removing your autonomy from you is a horrible one, one i had hoped was in my past. my parents are old and falling apart. i started having anxiety attack thinking about who would take care of them and my kids if i went back to prison. my brother was saying “we have to call the insurance company. we have to call a lawyer. we have to call 911. this is so serious. you shouldn’t have tried and handle this on your own.” i just kept saying “what lawyer? with what money?” and crying and crying and the more he thought about it the more he realized i was right about that one part. i told him my plan was to try and hope there wasn’t enough evidence to catch me and he said basically “bad plan” my head was still whirling. i was starting to realize the severity of what i’d done. the crushing guilt of the position id put my kids in, my parents in losing my income that’s critical to the house, and most importantly the woman i hit. at this point i still didn’t know if she was dead or alive. i started wondering if she had a family. if she was dead *because* i didn’t call 911 and could’ve lived if i’d done something. if she had parents that were going to lose their house without her income. if her kids were waiting for her to come home. so my brother sat with me and we waited and he tried to get me calm so we could figure out a plan. basically he was just trying to keep me in the house and from doing anything else stupid. we kept periodically checking the local news. it took about four hours for the full report to be on tv. they had no idea about the driver. they had one person who claimed to have saw the incident from far away but described a car that looked nothing like mine. police were looking for the driver. when i heard “police” and “scene of the crime” i was so broken up. the reality was just getting heavier and heavier. that’s when my brother suggested it. he said ”hey maybe i turn myself in in place of you so you can stay with your kids” he was never the biggest fan of my boyfriend spending a lot of time with the kids and he already had some prior charges as well, he didn’t have kids or much of a meaningful job. but i still didn’t want to hear anything like that. we talked about it for a couple hours more. he said keeping his nephews with their mother would give his life a meaning it wouldn’t otherwise have, he wasn’t going anywhere with his life outside that mattered, etc. i knew it was all bullshit to make me feel better about the impossible position i’d put us all in. i considered writing a detailed confession then just killing myself. but i didn’t want to leave my kids and family with that mental burden. we constructed a story that made perfect sense. the car i was driving was owned by my father and my brother and i trade off driving it all the time. because i’d been out drinking the time i was driving is a time he could have also easily been driving.he took a few hours to sort out some personal business. he made a frantic phone call confession to a friend, but not too close a friend, (so he was pretty sure would testify against him, he was right) to lend credibility to the story “i hit someone earlier today. i don’t know what to do. i’m thinking of leaving town. could you loan me some money.” etc. he called out sick from his other job. i almost changed my mind right before he went to turn himself in. because he didn’t tell our mom what he was going to do. she’s got some dementia. she’s still pretty lucid but not entirely there. and she wouldn’t understand what he was trying to tell her. so he just told her he had to go on a trip and wouldn’t be back for a while. she was so sweet she tried to pack him a bag and make him a sandwich and kept asking him to write down the address where he was staying and a number where she could reach him. he tried really hard to hold back tears. my father was irate at him for putting her through this after everything she’d put up with. my father bought our story. he didn’t know my brother was home that morning. it was seeing how hurt my brother was seeing my father’s disappointment in him. my brother had worked so hard so so so hard to turn his life around since his actual conviction. he’d made my parents really proud and rebuilt their trust over a long period of time. it broke him to have to confess to this to my father. (he stuck to our story with them because he knew they wouldn’t let him cop to something he didn’t do. he didn’t want to risk it. especially with my mom not having a great understanding of secrets anymore.) so that was the only time i almost broke. i wanted to do anything to take that pain from him. i’d been suicidal in the past, but never so strongly as seeing just the beginning of the pain i had inflicted on one of the most important people in my life. the woman wasn’t dead. concussion, broken bones, but a motorcyclist found her, carried her to safety, and got help. this really helped my brother’s case. the fact that she was going to make a full recovery. he had a terrible public defender, but the case luckily didn’t get much media attention and the victim was a poor immigrant so there weren’t protest rallies calling for my brother to get the death penalty or anything. the judicial process was quick, and all things considered, painless. since he was pleading guilty and is the kind to be typcast as a criminal, nobody looked too closely at his guilty plea. i had so much in common with this woman. she also had kids, close in age to mine. i hate myself for what i did to her as much as for what i did to my brother. she must have been so scared and in so much pain. and i just left her there. my brother is a little more than halfway through his sentence. i just can’t bear the thought that not only did i tear the family apart and ruin my brothers life, but that he’s shouldering the blame for the entire thing. i visit him every time i have enough for the bus out there. they’re keeping him out of state. i bring my mom sometimes too, though my dad doesn’t want me to. he refuses to see him. that might be the worst part of all of this. i talk to him about it, as best i can knowing someone is always listening. the last time i saw him about three months ago i couldn’t believe it was only halfway. my last son is all grown up. i told him “if you’ve changed your mind, just say so.” and he cut me off and said “no. never. then it would all be for nothing.” and said he never wants to hear that kind of talk again. but it’s my dream. and my nightmare. to come clean. i’ll never do it, because i’m a coward, and because my kids still need me, my parents need someone bringing in money and my son wants to go back to school and my other son has moved away. but the cinder block feeling never went away. i thought once i knew i wouldn’t have to go to prison it would go away. i thought once i knew the woman was alive and recovering it would go away. i thought once my last son was able to support himself and didn’t need me like he did when he was a child it would go away.  but it’s never going away. i have to carry the woman’s pain, my brother’s pain, my father’s pain, and the pain of everyone who doesn’t have my brother in their life because of me. and that’s the least i deserve. so, that’s it."," even if it was his idea, i still can’t believe you let this happen to your own sibling. i hope that one day the truth comes out so you can go to prison, where you belong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9uwuh2/i_committed_a_hit_and_run_then_let_my_brother_go/,,I committed a hit and run then let my brother go to prison for it

"rant from a pregnant lady, incoming.my fiance, his sister, and i are all 22 years old. when i met my fiance and we started dating, it was very obvious that he was being abused by his family. i looked over his shoulder and saw a text from his sister saying ""theres a tv at the store only $99 come buy it for me or give me the money."" i was blown away by how blunt she was with her demand. i asked him what the text was about and he kind of mumbled through an explanation. it was obvious he didn't want to buy her the tv, so i told him he needed to tell her ""no"". he did.it must've been the first time he'd done so because she flipped shit. sent him a bunch of texts, one of which said ""its your new bitch, isn't it?"" i was his first girlfriend, and i hadn't met her yet at this point. he blocked her and that was that. he later unblocked her after their mother died and things had settled again, but she continued to make demands. in fact, that's the only reason she ever talked to my fiance.he later admitted to me that when his mother fell ill, he quit his job to take care of her. he had $800 saved to use during this time. his sister stole his debit card and spent all of this within his first month of being home. she never paid him back.i also learned from a relative in another state that she would take their sick mother (alzheimer's) to the bank and make her draw out money for her. this same relative sent us gifts which were intercepted by my fiance's sister and most of the contents were stolen. she suffered no repercussions for her actions.her boyfriend is younger than all of us (i think he got her pregnant when he was 15/16 and she was 17/18). he was just involved in the murder of a 15 year old who he and his friend mistook for a gang member because he was wearing a specific color of shirt. he's now out on bail with an ankle monitor, sitting at home and yelling/cussing at their 4 year old son any time he does anything. his truck got towed, we're assuming because it was the getaway vehicle. we're also assuming his sister was the getaway driver, which means their son may have possibly been at the crime scene. if anything, this history of violence/crime is enough for me to not want to be around her and her partner.i have a 1 year old daughter and i'm 24 weeks pregnant with a second. i don't want these people anywhere near us. i don't want them to know where we live, what we drive... i don't want them to be able to contact us and ask to pay their bail next time they commit a crime. i don't want them to know how much money i make, or how much my parents make. i work fucking hard for this family and she hasn't worked a day in her life.shes the only family my fiance has in-state now. shes still contacting him regularly asking for stuff (and he shuts her down every time, which makes him uncomfortable/sad). i want to tell him to block her and forget about her, but that's not fair to him or his nephew. it's not like we visit them very often, maybe once every couple months. but when we do, it's obvious his nephew isnt getting what he needs in terms of attention and love. it's such a complicated situation all around and i'm frustrated. we're only 22 years old. why are we dealing with this bs?i just want to tell her that i fucking hate the way she is. want to shake some sense into her, make her get a job, make her get off her a$$ and actually take care of her son. stop asking us for money, you're not gonna get any.i want her gone. and i want her son to get to a better place than where he is now before he starts getting into this gang business too. i know this will never happen, and it's not fair.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9q118y/i_really_really_hate_my_fiances_sister_and_i_wish/,,"I really, really hate my fiance's sister and I wish I could tell her to her face (while simultaneously adopting her son).

"this is my first time ever posting anything. i am on mobile. tl;dr at bottom.ill start off by saying that i am a cna and have been in this line of work for about 4 years now. i had just recently started a new job in an assisted living facility. its the nicest place i've ever worked, and i am very fond of the elders who live there that i help take care of. i work both 1st and 3rd shifts but only have part time hours because full time positions are filled.there are 2 sections of the building, dementia and non-dementia. the dementia side is the only part of the building that needs to have an aide there at all times. on 3rd shift we have 2 aids and we are required to do mandatory every hour rounds on the dementia side that we spilt between the 2 halls. during these rounds we are basically checking to make sure our residents are not incontinent, and if they are, we change them real quick and let them get back to sleep. in between these rounds we basically sit around and wait for our next rounds. simple.theres a full time aide on 3rd shift with me. we'll call her l. every time we do our rounds l never comes back down the hallway with any trash bags and claims all her residents are dry. very hard to believe but who am i to question, i'm still the new girl. but then 5 or 6am rolls around and all of a sudden l has anywhere between 1-3 full bed changes. that means she has to wake these poor old people up because they completely soaked through thier adult briefs, drag them out of bed and into the bathroom, change and wash them up, and then make them wait around for their bedding to be changed so that they can lay back down and sleep before 1st shift comes in to start their day. this is completely uncalled for and 100% preventable if she had only done her job in the first place and changed them throughout the night. also i think l always forgets that these people have dementia. she is constantly talking at them rather then to them. night time is usually a hard time for people with dementia and they become more confused at this time. not always, but sometimes we'll have 1 or 2 residents start wandering the halls not realizing that it's 2am. l will immediately go up to them and tell them they need to get back in bed, they are not allowed to be up. wrong, they live here, this is their home. and if they can't sleep and want to come out and sit with us or have a snack, they most certainly have every right to do so. they are not children.  these elderly people and their families pay very good money out of pocket to be assisted and taken care of and l is completely neglecting to do that because she's too lazy. but if you really think about it, in the long run shes only creating more work for herself. what a moron.so anyways, this is extremely upsetting to me. it's even more upsetting when i realize that l is scheduled to work 5-6 days a week while i'm only working 3-4 because she took up all the hours. i perform my job very well, and i have a passion for it. i want her hours. i feel i deserve it more, new girl or not.i went to my boss. i ratted her right out and told my boss about every last observation i had made. by the time i walked out of her office, not only did i get l's hours, but i got her fired, and i got offered a higher up position as a med tech with a $4 raise.  i got exactly what i wanted plus somenow, at first i was so happy and excited, but as the last two days passed, i'm starting to feel really guilty about it cause i know l has kids with no support and i know i probably caused a whole world of problems for her financially. should i really feel guilty though? she was not a nice person to the people she was supposed to be caring for. tl;dr: went to my boss and complained about my coworker not doing what she's being paid to do, got her fired and then offered a promotion/ raise.", you did the right thing. it’s too bad that she has kids; she’s a detriment to those people’s health and to the organization you work for. cutting corners in one place is bad enough but who knows what other corners she’s cutting. if it were my elderly relative i’d be pissed if i found out someone wasn’t taking care of them. she just learned a hard lesson. smh,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9po9mu/i_reported_my_coworker_because_she_doesnt_do_her/,,"I reported my co-worker because she doesnt do her job, and she got fired."
"i don’t bring my children with me those few times i do go. my father who is 71 has been in a nursing home for about 17-18 years since i was about 11 or 12. he was always a heavy drinker would go through a large bottle of vodka or whiskey within two days. he was never physically abusive but would sometimes say hurtful things , stuff i would just brush off as i knew the alcohol effected him. when my mother was finally fed up and they split i would stay with him on the weekends , he would always try and hide his drinking from my mother and ask me not to tell her in fear of losing his visits. well my mother knowing his history eventually caught on and told him i was not going to be coming the next weekend. he then tried to commit suicide and was admitted. once released he was going to a mental health doctor for therapy once a week. my mother eventually would allow my visits to resume and i remember he would have numerous drug samples that his doctor was giving him to take. his friend would often come over and discuss the meds and would trade meds which he would take with alcohol. after about a year of him doing this he basically went crazy, he was living in a boarding house  with a communal pay phone on the second floor that i would call and talk to him on, one day i called and his neighbor answered and i asked to speak to him , he answers and i start to talk about visiting this weekend and he tells me he doesn’t have a car and doesn’t know where his is. his neighbor says to put my mother on the phone as he would like to talk to her, they talk for a while about him in detail and several days later my mother and i go to see him , we show up unannounced and my father does not want us to come in as he does t want me to see him “ like this “ eventually we go in and he is basically a skeleton at this point . my father had always been around 200lbs and well kept . he looked like a homeless man with a beard , long fingernails and very malnourished, he would only drink cola and would not eat anything nor shower as he didn’t want to leave his room, extremely bizarre behavior and his memory was greatly affected as well. he was then admitted to the hospital for about a year where he would still refused to eat , it got to the point where he was on a feeding tube for some amount of time. eventually he transitioned into a nursing home as he has never fully recovered from what happened and has since been diagnosed with dementia which over the years has gotten worse. i would go see him every week and sit with him , play games etc. this would go on until i was about 15 which at that point the visits have gotten less and less frequent and continued to do so into adulthood and now currently as with time his condition has gotten worse making visits uncomfortable. for the past 10 years he makes very crude and sexual comments towards my mother, and myself along with the staff. it creates a very uncomfortable environment to be in and can often times be difficult to sit there and remember that my father though he had his flaws was once rather enjoyable to be around. even when trying to converse with him he always makes rude and degrading comments, again in a sexual manner. i have two daughters ages 6 and 2. my oldest has met him several times but has not seen him in about 3 years. the last time i brought her he began to say inappropriate things in front of her so we left. it’s hard enough for me to bring myself to go and see him and have always felt really bad at about especially since i’m his only child who has kept any sort of contact with him over the years. he has two daughters from a previous marriage whom have not contacted him in roughly 20 or so years, the same can be said for his sister. is it wrong for me to not visit him more and to keep my kids from getting to see him?"," i think its right that you keep your children from him. but also remember with dementia he probably doesnt know who you are anymore (at least some of the time). my nan was the same, she thought her son was her brother and her husband was her uncle or dad. i can understand not wanting to see him anymore because of the comments he keeps making. id say the main thing to ask yourself is will you have regrets about not seeing him any more once he passes? it sounds bad but that would be my main concern. your dad sounds quite ill and who can say if hed notice if you stopped visiting. im not trying to be horrid, i hope you dont think i am",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9ophhw/my_father_lives_in_a_nursing_home_5_minutes_from/,,My father lives in a nursing home 5 minutes from my house and I only see him about 4 times a year.
"i hate my mother-in-law.  *sigh of relief. * i finally put the words out there. i didn't realize how strong this feeling of hatred was for her until the past year. no matter how hard i try to make our relationship civil i cannot. i feel like this woman and our negative feelings towards each other are ruining my marriage because my husband is a ""mama's boy"" through and through.  he has more or less begged me to fix my relationship with her for his sake because it is causing him so much stress. i feel terrible about it but this woman irks me to no end. i've been in a relationship with my husband since september 2012, married in 2015 and became a mother to his children in 2016 and again earlier this year. i didn't always hate her though. i used to think she was really cool. she seemed really kind and sweet for the first few years. at points, i used to even feel bad for her because my husband and i were caught in active addiction and she was often a victim of our money schemes to acquire more substances to fuel our addiction.  she enabled us so badly but had no clue what she was doing because she was just trying to help us financially. i was sober during my first pregnancy but had severe postpartum depression after our daughter's birth while fueled my relapse. my husband went to state prison when she was 2 months old. i asked my mother-in-law to take my daughter when i went to rehab in june 2016 and then to a recovery house until december 2016 because i knew i needed to get my life back on track to become the mother that my daughter deserved. unfortunately, my attempts to do what i thought was the best thing for my daughter ended up revealing her true colors. she became a monster-in-law!due to a series of unfortunate events, cps was involved and she decided to legally become my daughter's foster parent instead of a temporary guardian because she is money hungry and wanted paid to care for my daughter. she took full advantage of medical assistance health coverage for my baby and wic even though her and my husband's stepfather are very wealthy. she attended all these banquets for foster parents and ran my name through the mud about what a terrible person i was even though i was sober at this point and working very hard on my recovery.  she became very two faced and destroyed my relationships with my extended family.  to this day, only my mother and father talk to me. she made herself out to be this victim and everyone thought i was worthless and they still do.my husband begged his mother to let me come live with them in january 2017 because he thought it would help me develop a stronger bond with my daughter. reluctantly, i moved in with them because i was not making enough money to afford my own apartment. most of my paychecks went to rent at the recovery house, my car payment and child support. there was nothing left for me to save for a security deposit and first months rent. my husband was still in jail and the court system did not want to give me custody of my daughter back until i had a ""stable living environment"". my mother-in-law and i got along very well at first until we went to a custody hearing at court. the judge was very proud of my progress in my recovery and me completing all requirements that were ordered. she suggested i get full custody and my case be closed. then cps called my mother-in-law to the stand as a witness to my parenting abilities.  she said, ""i feel that she requires more assistance than most would require when it comes to raising a child. she is very mentally ill. "" please keep in mind that i worked as a charge nurse in a dementia unit of a nursing home for 10 years prior to going to rehab. basically, somehow i was able to take care of 32 residents while going in and out of active addiction but was not able to take care of my own child while i was sober?!? the hearing concluded with me acquiring 50% custody and her keeping the other 50%. the case was closed that day also so the order stands as is.i started hating this woman that day in court and cannot shake it. she oversteps boundaries with my daughter quite often. she also oversteps boundaries with my marriage. she involves herself in things that do not concern her. she makes snarky and inappropriate remarks daily. she likes to say my daughter ""has two mommies."" i no longer bother to respond to her texts nor do i answer her phone calls. we moved out of her house in june this year and i was thrilled because in my mind avoiding her altogether would create less problems for my husband. this has not been the case. she texts my husband often to tell him to divorce me or to complain that i need to get a job so she can babysit my daughters. my husband and i made the decision for me to be a stay-at-home mom but she tells him that i'm lazy and that's why i don't work.she insists on taking my oldest daughter every wednesday for a ""grammy day"". she does not respect my request to have her back at 7pm so she can have a bath and unwind before her 8pm bedtime. sometimes she doesn't return her until 9pm! but she has no problem texting me to tell me my daughter ""will need a bath tonight."" also, my daughter returns with a terrible attitude. i feel like i will have a stroke anyday from the stress she causes in our lives. despite all of these obvious issues and the strain she causes on my marriage, my husband insists that i am the one to blame for the negative feelings i have for his mother. she can do no wrong in his eyes. she is a goddess. today, he told me that she had really high blood pressure at her last doctor's appointment and the stress i am causing her is the reason. i will never be friends with this woman. it is all i can do to remain civil. in conclusion, my confession is that i hate my mother-in-law more than i have ever hated anyone and there is nothing i can do about it!", stay sober and at least you'll outlive her. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9olcir/i_hate_my_motherinlaw/,,I Hate My Mother-in-law
"in reality i am sat in my car in the car park at mcdonald's, alone. i spent an hour walking round tesco before trying to fend off a panic attack which has been biting at my heels for almost a week now. i spent longer sat in the car park after. i try to put things in perspective by telling myself that other people are going through much worse, but i guess it's all relative and honestly i'm struggling to keep my head above the water. it doesn't help that i recently took myself off my antidepressants, and haven't had any beta blockers for a while. see until a few months ago everything was going ok. but then i had my heart well and truly broken, and my temporary contract at work finished a month or so after - i've been out of a job since, living at home with my parents. i'm no stranger to this exact situation because i went though it just over 2 years ago, and it almost crushed me then. only now i have the addition of watching helplessly the steady decline of my nan's mental faculties (she was diagnosed with dementia earlier this year).the atmosphere at home is tense and i have to escape regularly in order to get breathing space. i have some amazing friends - not many, but they're each of them brilliant. but they're all busy with their lives these days, and i can't just turn up at their doors unannounced like i used to years ago. in fact i have to organise stuff well in advance. so when i need to get away i tell my parents i'm going out with friends from a bar i used to work at. if anyone knew i was just sitting in car parks it would break their hearts. i used to go to the pub alone a few nights a week. i tried making friends there but it didn't work. people see a young woman alone and assume something is wrong with her and stay clear.... i've stopped going as much because now it makes me feel awkward. i tend to drink at home now, i have a stash of rum in my bathroom for when i want to take the edge off another empty weekend.sometimes i do go to the cinema alone, it's not that bad. but with each day that passes another piece of my self-confidence dissipates, and now i can't bear to walk in there and ask for one ticket. my self esteem is at rock bottom. i feel worthless and pathetic and ugly and i'm finding it harder and harder to talk myself up. i'm just scraping by financially and i hate not being able to contribute. i hate being so dependent. although i can text my friends whenever, i am the kind of cripplingly lonely that friends and family or books and netflix can't help with, and struggle to sleep at night and concentrate in the day because of it. i miss everything about him and there's no denying it. everything good feels as though it's been dulled and it's like the colour has gone from everything. i don't even enjoy my hobbies as much any more.i don't know what to do or which way to turn. i could go back on the medicine and maybe it would alleviate things a little, but i was hoping to apply to the army reserve and that would mean immediate rejection. the thought of any more rejections almost brings me to my knees. i've applied for loads of jobs and been for plenty of interviews but always seem to just miss out.it brings me to tears to think how happy and together i was not even that long ago. since then everything just keeps going to shit. i can feel the depression and anxiety on the periphery of my mind almost like it's waiting for the chance to swoop back in. only people who have recovered from it will know what a terrifying and sickening prospect that is and how much mental willpower it takes to keep it at bay. i know it's not a sign of weakness to take medication, but i was just so so close to finally being back on top i can't bring myself to do it. i cannot believe i have ended up in this situation twice, in as many years. it's like some kind of cruel joke.i'm so fucking unhappy.so now i am here in the car, trying not to let this panic attack get me. i'm cold and lonely and if anyone i know knew, i'd be absolutely mortified. i don't deserve pity or respect for any of this i am fucking ashamed of myself. but at least now it's kind of off my chest.....well done if you read this far and i'm sorry for the swears, and if i've put a dampener on your day :("," okay buttercup: chin up! you have to keep your chin up or else you will drown. that might sound impossible at this moment.  i know it. damn i have had suicidal thoughts for 20years. give your grieving room. you suffer and it's unimportant whether others have it worse. it's about you and you hurt.my first advice is to get yourself to take those meds again. i know it's not cool. it's annoying. but they are a crutch you seem to need right now.i got a cat - he's my boy and he was a real therapy cat for me. i had someone to take care of, to leave the house for. kitty chores needed to be done. since you're living with your parents getting a pet is probably not an option. maybe you can help out in an animal shelter? is there a way you could get your own place? a cheap flat? or maybe a room in a living community?  super big hugs. don't give up on yourself. and do reach out to your friends don't decide on behalf of them.  if they can i'm sure they'll help.  i know all is shit right now and you feel like drowning but i promise it does get better. chin up,  buttercup!  you're here to stay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9muh8c/my_family_think_i_am_at_the_cinema_with_friends/,,My family think I am at the cinema with friends
"my father suffers from vascular dementia due to 30+ surgeries stemming from a mis diagnosis 40 years ago. the average vascular dementia patient has about 4 years from point of diagnosis to live. he's i'm the early-mid stages. due to all the surgeries and the subsequent pain, he's been on opioids for my entire life (i'm nearly 40). he has been over medicating so we locked up his meds, but he's just been driving around to rv parks buying up what he can. he's pretty normal sometimes, but others he's belligerent and violent. i got a call from one of his friends yesterday letting me know that he was so screwed up that he couldn't even speak, so he took his keys and had me come get him. i tried taking him to the emergency department yesterday, but he ""jumped"" out of my car at a red light when he realized where he was going. that turned into me trying to restrain him on the side of the road in one of the busiest intersections in town. five cop cars, and two ambulances later, and they let him go claiming that at the moment he wasn't a danger to himself or others. bullshit. they didn't even fill out a report. when we got him home, he went inside and barricaded the door. that brings us to this morning. went to the local magistrate to file ivc papers, and was warned that it probably won't stick because we live in a very wealthy retirement community, and extra leeway is given to the elderly. we've called law enforcement 4 times this year. all 4 times they arrived 2 hours later, let him go, and didn't file a report. the sheriff department picked him up this morning. he was belligerent and had a loaded .45. they handcuffed him and took him to the hospital for a psych eval. the poor man has precious little time left. we weren't close when i was a kid because he was always angry &amp; violent. now we've become closer, and i finally had the father that i always wanted. i met him in the er 5 minutes ago with his escort. i'll never forget the look on his face. the betrayal, the hurt, it will always stick with me. now, no matter what happens, my own father will hate me until the day he dies.sorry for the format. i'm using mobile, and can't think straight at the moment."," you did the right thing. sometimes, the kindest thing you can do is to figure out what needs to be done, and then, do it. from the outside, it may even be indistinguishable from cruelty. but this was not cruelty. you did what needed doing. thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9mr6w6/i_had_my_father_involuntarily_committed/,,I had my father involuntarily committed

"when i was younger, maybe about 11, my family was helping my great aunt move into her new nursing home from the old one she had lived in. the door was one of those doors that could not be opened from one side, the patient’s side, presumably so they couldn’t just walk out. well, my job was to stand by the door and open it when my family came through with their hands full of boxes and stuff. i was slightly bored and slightly afraid that the door would accidentally lock no matter what side i was on, so i just held it slightly open and sorta swung back and forth. while i was waiting for them to come through with the next load, an old man from the patients side came up to me and said “hello, can you hold that door open for me?” me, thinking he was just a feeble old man who had issues with doors and not assuming that the door locked on the inside for a reason, held the door open for him as he hobbled out. he turned around and thanked me profusely before heading down the hallway. later that day, i asked my mom why the door locked like that. she told me it was to keep all the patients with alzheimer’s in because they tend to be forgetful and not know where they are or where they’re going so they have to stay inside or something terrible could happen. i didn’t say anything to her, and i don’t think i told anyone about it after that, because i was worried that man was gonna get hit by a car and everyone was gonna blame me."," a very similar scenario also happened to me when i was around your age. my family was visiting my grandmother in a nursing home and i was walking into the building from the outside. an elderly man in a wheelchair asked me to hold the door open for him and i naively did, then he wheeled outside. he was not out there long and just stayed on the sidewalk before an aide saw him and wheeled him back inside. later my mom told me that the patients are not supposed to be let outside unsupervised. i felt really stupid and embarassed at the time, but hey, i was a kid and did not know any better.but anyways, you were just a kid and were naive, and if it makes you feel any better, you are not the only person who has done what you did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9h5eci/i_may_have_possibly_aided_an_alzheimer_patients/,,I may have possibly aided an Alzheimer patient’s escape

"hey, i‘m new to reddit and i apologize for my english, i‘m still in highschool and learning it, english isn‘t my first language tho. and sorry for this long post..so first of all, i write this post because i reached a point in my life where i realized that i‘m not like the others.., i can‘t even tell if i‘m depressed rn.. but i can tell that i‘m afraid to even go out with my best friends.. it‘s the first time i talk about it and yea i feel safe if it‘s with people i don‘t know personally..the story behind my loss of memory goes back in time, i only remember what happened that day but i can‘t remember the following days, how i dealt with the pain, how my family reacted (to this point, i still don‘t know if they know about my memory loss, i never talked with anyone about it because i‘m afraid how they will react..) it sounds stupid but i only realized it last year when in science class we had the „brain“ as a topic and people were talking about amnesia and alzheimer. that‘s where i noticed it. the whole time i thought that i was normal but i was so wrong. so back in the days, i can‘t remember the date but i guess i was 8-10yo (2006-2008), living in my old neighborhood. we were playing a game called „police vs gangsters“, as the name already says it, the police had to capture the gangster. i was on the team of the gangster, chased by a dude living in my neighborhood, he was older than me, 3-4 years. so he managed to capture me down our street and decided to carry me on his shoulders, like ya know he lifted me up, so that my head faced the floor and he held me with his arms on my hips (like someone who would carry a sack rice or sack potatoes on his shoulders). ok so, there was a small wall (1meter high) which separated the side of a small shop and the pavement (basically the side of the pavement was higher) and the dude stood on the side of the pavement, with me still on his shoulders. somehow he lost his balance, maybe cuz i was too heavy for him (even tho i‘m a skinny guy and was it always), and struggle to hold me tight and decided to let off because if he would hold me tight we would also fall on the other side of the wall. so there it starts, he let off, i fell on my backhead on the floor and blacked out for a moment before i „woke up“, cried the whole time and started to caress and to feel my head where i landed on, i had to do a reality check if this really happened (there was a diffraction, that’s where i knew that it really happened, it was soft on that spot). while crying and constantly feeling the place i landed on, i walked fast home to inform my mom about it but as soon as i hit home, i wasn‘t able to express myself, i stuttered while crying, i only told her „i fell“ in the language we are talking @home, i‘m not good at talking that language, so i couldn’t tell much. she said that i should go to sleep and it will be gone tomorrow and from there on i went to my bedroom and lay down and fell asleep (not knowing that i could die that night from inner bleeding or something else). so yea that was the story of it. i still have a dent from that day.. you don‘t notice it because of my hairs covering it, but you can feel it tho. as i already said, idk what happened the following days and i also lost the memory of the years before the accident and to form new memories is also hard.. cuz i only remember the very good moments or bad moments in my life. 10-12 years later, which is now, i‘m 20yo and it‘s starts to bother me much cuz i wasn‘t really aware of it til last year.. i lost many friends which i thought were my best friends but either they don‘t want to see me anymore cuz i‘m no that talkative (they started to stop texting me, etc.) or it‘s just me, being afraid to go out cuz i can‘t tell many stories or stuffs from my past.. i also think that i lost my identity, cuz i don‘t know who i was and how i was, this affects many relationships also in my family. i know that they are my friends and family but i can‘t remember many moments with them, which makes them stranger for me.. that‘s one thing or the main thing that bothers me heavily😢i don‘t know where to start to search for help because i‘m afraid to talk to someone about it.. that‘s why i came here to make this confession and maybe to get help from the community..thanks for all answers in advance (if it even bothers someone) and to read this long ass novel, i‘m very grateful for everyone who tries to help."," on the one side you‘re right, i agree with you but on the other hand, people nowadays judge too much, that‘s what our society became.. if u ain‘t like all the others, you are seen otherwise and also treated differently, that‘s what i had to experience („some“ people know a little bit about my secret). not everyone has that much sympathy and empathy😕 i try to convince myself somehow to break this barrier to make peace with myself but idk

"i wana start by saying this doesn't come from a place of pure hatred but rather a combination of emotions.  my mom is a special education teacher in mississippi, which means she's in one of the lowest paying professions in the poorest state in america.  she wants to retire  (which she could have done 15 years ago) and move to texas with my sister. the only thing keeping here in mississippi is her shitty trailer, its been run into the ground from all the cats she used to have and she still owes 30 thousand which is gonna take ten years to pay off. bringing it back to my aunt, i want her to croak because she's rich and has a life insurance policy that would help my mom pay her trailer off and support her while she sets up a life in texas.  i don't hate my aunt but i do dislike her, when my grandma got dementia she was the only one of three sisters who refused to put her in a nursing home.  instead she decided they would divide taking care of my grandma between them.  i hated this because my mom lived an hour and thirty minutes away while my aunt lived right next door. the stress from work and driving back and forth caused her to ignore the pain in her appendix.  eventually it ruptured and almost killed her ( she's diabetic and it sent her blood sugar up to deadly levels).     this all happened around a year ago, at the time they were worried about brain damage but she showed no signs of anything up until yesterday.  i found out she's been losing her short term memory and now i'm worried she might be going down a path that ends with her being severely disabled.  i just want her to have enough to where she doesn't have to kill herself working for the rest of her life.tldr: my aunt's a cunt and my mom needs money so it'd be nice if she died so my mom can collect the insurance.", i feel you x,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/99cnog/i_kinda_want_my_aunt_to_die/,,I kinda want my aunt to die
"my grandparents have a serious hoarding addiction. we’ve never been up to their house until about a year ago so we never realized how bad it was. since then, we’ve been coming up at least once a week to clean, but my grandfather was undoing our progress faster than we were actually making progress. recently i moved in since coming up every week just wasn’t enough. it’s been three weeks and i have completely given up. my grandmother (grace) is away at work all week and is usually out of town, my grandfather (jack) has alzheimer's, and their very autistic 30-year-old son (john) still leaves with them. jack is supposed to give john his meds every day twice a day. last week, i went through his room to discover he had hidden almost a gallon worth of said pills within the last year or two. if john has a good day, jack will intentionally sabotage it (i.e. giving him a medication that makes him physically violent, keeping him up until well past one in the morning, etc). for the past 4 years, their idea of “cleaning” is just shoving anything and everything into giant clear trash bags. there are at least a dozen clear bags in every single room of the house (yes, even the bathrooms). we just got rid of the mice problem, so now that they’re gone, jack says that they weren’t even there to begin with. for some reason they have two fridges in their kitchen, there were ants in both of them, even though we just bought one them less than six months ago. i finished clearing out the garage last night and found a dead bird underneath the piles of garbage (i’m supposed to be sleeping in the little room they made in there since i am currently sleeping on their loveseat). there were squirrels and mice in the attic as well as in the actual walls of the house since there are giant holes in the side of the house that go into the attic. the mice scoured every inch of the kitchen, the counters, stove, and the microwave. there are ants all over the kitchen including the kitchen sink and it doesn’t matter how many times i bleach everything, they’re always back within 10 minutes. there are even ants in the upstairs bathrooms. they have a food shopping addiction. they’ll buy 5 or 6 half gallons of almond milk in one trip and get 5 or 6 more two days later. and that’s just almond milk. they both also have a regular shopping addiction, they have more than a hundred toothbrushes, twenty packs of pens, 14 flashlights, 20 bottles of sunscreen, 50 tubes of chapstick, 15 packs of batteries, 10 boxes of bandaids, 6 boxes of tinfoil, 4 microwaves, and god knows how many tiny jigsaw blades (they do not own a jigsaw). there is mold in every single drain catcher and drain, on the kitchen table, in one of their cars, and black mold in the showers. jack cannot fathom why in the world i would ever want to clean a single thing in the house, even just washing the dishes. he’s extremely sexist and doesn’t think i can plug in a damn tv. i was trying to sort out the tubs of random things in the dining room from paper and just everything else and both jack and grace immediately freaked out and got pissed because they just assumed that i was throwing every single thing away and wouldn’t even listen when i tried to explain i was literally just moving everything around to make more room. there evidence jack is being abusive towards john and has admitted it on multiple occasions. they both are in severe credit card debt even though grace makes well over 200k a year. in three weeks, all i’ve managed is to clear a path in the living room. they have undone every other single thing i have down even though i work on this house more than 10 hours a day, every day of the week. i can’t get a job because jack and john can’t be left alone together or by themselves. i can barely leave the house. one second of anybody with any authoritative power being in this house, they would seize it in a heartbeat and jack would be arrested. more than ¾ of the house is against basic health codes.i can not tell the difference between bug bites, poison ivy, and stress rashes that completely cover both of my legs. i am terrified to shower her. i’ve probably eaten a total of 6 meals since moving in. i wish someone would force them out of the house so they have to move and the state can just deal with it.", you are a pathological liar and need to be medicated,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/98y5oa/i_am_considering_calling_someone_to_seaize_my/,,I am considering calling someone to seaize my grandparents' house (crossposted).

"lol my title is total clickbait, but related to the story. i am a caregiver for a guy who is 108. he is usually very pleasant to me except when he has episodes. now i’ve noticed his kids, all 3, all about 60 years old, do not know their father very well. i’ve learned he was an absentee father and a pretty genuinely shitty person. he would come a few times a year to beat his wife n kids then go back to his business abroad. anyways yesterday he slapped his daughter for telling him to wear underwear before he goes out, he is incontinent so he shits and pee’s himself hourly. i saw her get so fuckin angry and she “restrained” him but it was more of a grappling beat down. she was crying and praying while she grabbed his arms with literally all her might. the client, the old guy, begged her to stop and cried out for me. i came and told him he made things physical by hitting his daughter first. now i did a lot of wrestling and jiu jitsu back in the day and i do physical therapy with this guy so i know how a human his age bends and how they don’t. i let her manhandle him while he screamed for help for about 20 minutes, only once or twice did i intervene when i could see she was about to break his arm. i could see the emotion in her eyes and body language and i essentially decided he deserved this. i could have stopped it. maybe i should have. but i didn’t. well i’ve been thinking if he really deserved that or not. he is incapable of forming new memories and has already forgotten it. his hormones are out of his control and alzheimer’s is literally eating his brain away. wow....as i was writing this he called me over. he remembers getting manhandled but he has no idea why. he is asking how he can fix it and asking about alzheimer’s. i am explaining that he cannot form new memories and his short term memory is fucked. that why he remembers his parents but not anything from a couple hours ago. he acknowledged that he is no longer reliable at making a self appraisal in his own abilities. too bad he will forget this all in an hour.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/96smng/beat_down_on_the_elderly/,,Beat down on the elderly
"it was a few years ago, i had nothing against him to avoid visiting him. he was always quiet but a very loving and supportive guy. i never got to really know my other grandfather so he was really my only one and i loved him. i saw him probably 6 months before he died, before the dementia really set in and it was pretty quick after that. he didn't remember anyone younger than his kids so he likely wouldn't have remembered me but that's not the point. i don't even remember what i was doing that i said i couldn't go visit with everyone but it definitely was not important, honestly i was probably just getting stoned by myself and playing video games. the drive to where they live is under 2 hours, there was no reason i couldn't have gone to visit.at his funeral they asked if any of the grandchildren would read a passage so i volunteered, i felt like it was a small way to try to make up for my mistake. im not even religious but for a moment i wished i was so he could see how much he meant to me and understand that his grandson isn't a piece of shit that didn't care about him, more of a lazy piece of shit that took everything for granted. i told my father how i felt, it was his father that passed. he told me my grandfather was not really my grandfather at the last visit and that i might be better off not having seen him like that but my dad would never want me to have that guilt, that's exactly what he'd be expected to say there, i understand that. i just can't stand the thought of him thinking i'll do the same thing to him when the time comes. this is something that keeps me up at night and wakes me up from sleep. it randomly pops into my head during the day and instantly makes me feel like the lowest garbage that's ever lived. i know how dramatic that is but that's really how it feels in the moment. ive only briefly spoken with my father about this, i've never told my girlfriend of 8 years about how guilty i feel. im hoping that getting it off my chest like this helps a little, maybe helps put things in perspective. maybe even someone will go visit someone after reading this and not be posting anything similar on r/confessions because they went.sorry for taking so long, thanks for listening.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/93asbz/i_didnt_visit_my_grandfather_before_he_died/,,I didn't visit my grandfather before he died
"this was commented somewhere else and was downvoted. not sure if because wrong place or because i am in the wrong. if u r going to comment then tell me the truth. im not looking for comfort though if you would like to provide that thats fine.this happened to me while working in the summer at my uncles manufacturing company. my employer which was also my uncle created a false story/conspiracy that the government (the people we get most of our work/contracts from) was trying to sabotage the company and that the government had a person working on the inside (a mole) helping them. that mole he falsely labeled as me. im not sure if he was trying to fire me (i was family so he probably didn’t have the balls to out right fire me) or he actually believed this. he managed to get a lot of the higher ups to believe it to the point where they were monitoring everything i do and lying to me. for some context the company is constantly late on contracts (in one case 7 years late) so it could very well be that the government is essentially trying to point out every flaw they see so that the parts that we are providing them need to be made again probably in an attempt to bankrupt or deter the company from bidding on future contracts. i dont think the sabotage was real but instead one coincidence that my uncle went with for whatever reason.this was a small part of what happened to me. everyday he would come to where i was working, when no one else was around, and tell me i was doing my job wrong (just to put me down) or that i didn’t know how to do my job (aka “your stupid”). if he saw me walking by he would stop the closest person next to him and tell them out loud “good job”... once the guy responded with “what are you talking about? i didn’t do anything.” which he then stood there a few seconds clearly trying to think about what to say. he also would ignore me and only communicated with me only to discredit my work such as “you weren’t here last year (again this was a summer job while going to school and i was there every summer) i dont remember you doing anything” or “what do u do here?”.he once orchestrated a party for me at the company only to some how get everyone against me at this ‘going away party’ (because i was only working for the summer... but now if i think about it it was most likely a go fuck yourself party) when i came in. a party where no one talks to u and is actively mad at you... sign me up! /salso in the party, a conversation started up about a dear friend that was dying of terminal cancer (rip fransisco) (a known fact throughout his friends, family, and the whole small town he lived in.) i interjected into the conversation saying “he had terminal cancer” where he responded “he doesnt have terminal cancer. this kid doesnt know what terminal cancer is...”. it was said out loud in a way like, or how i received it as “your an idiot and im going to say this out loud with confidence to make it seem like i know what im talking about to discredit your intelligence in front of everyone in this break room.”he would sometimes tell me to do a task on the other side of the factory just to walk by with my boss (the guy above me) and say out loud “why are you hiding? your supposed to be doing your job! i haven’t seen you all day!”for that month i put my head down and worked as hard as i could. as far as i know i worked as hard as i could always. maybe not the best employee but a hard worker. i once worked 70 hours one week and averaged about 50. worst month of my life... ever. and i mean that. i cant think of a worse time in my life then that month. i should have left but i needed the money. i found out later that this man is a monster. my family is known to not talk about serious things among us. once i started listening and others started talking it seemed to come out what type of person he is.hitting his kids. telling his father/my grandfather that no one loves him and that he will die like a dog, alone. all while his fathers best friend and lifetime lover , my grandmother, is suffering from alzheimers. my uncle then proceeded to throw away most of the stuff in my grandfathers house (including items that belonged to other people in the family and without my grandfathers permission). my uncle did major construction to the house where he specifically told the construction workers to “work when im not here. i dont want to be bothered with the noise” which meant that my grandfather had to supervise the construction and my sick grandmother as well as pay for the construction that he did not want.his wife left him... probably because she was the first to see “it”. his brother/my dad told me “i will never talk to him again for what he did to me”. and his own daughter hasn’t talked to him in... i think 3 years now. he didn’t go to my brothers wedding either because he hates my brothers wife and/or because my brother didn’t listen to him and invited our aunt/his ex wife to the wedding. he once tried to convince me to tell my brother to leave his gf at the time (but now his wife)... there are more things but these are some of the worst in my mind.as for the company... it is a failing company. he almost lost everything at one point. i figure its because of how he treats employees. we had multiple people have panic attacks at the company. the retention rate is 0... as in hes the only original employee because he either fired them or they quit. all the employees are overworked and yet in his eyes are not working hard enough.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/921k61/my_uncle_is_a_bad_person/,,My uncle is a bad person.
"[remorse] my family is filled with terrible and very traditional people. they are all homophobic/transphobic/racist bastards, and my parents have both abused me since i was a child. my siblings are no better, they were abused too but each one of them is their own type of evil. anything bad that has happened to me, like physical harm or health related, they raised me to believe that it was happening to me because i did something wrong to deserve it. my dad liked to play the blame game on me because any time someone in our family died or ended up in the hospital, it they coincidentally happen during the month of my birthday and he says my birth is the reason why it happens. cps has visited multiple times, but the system failed us and i've been stuck here for almost 20 years with no freedom, no help, and no social life. i'm practically imprisoned here while they monitor me and only they decide when i can leave the house or what i eat or who i talk to. i'm not allowed to think for myself.a year ago, my grandma, who was like a true mother to me, suffered a major stroke that almost paralyzed her, and an aneurysm that nearly killed her. she is still alive but requires round the clock care. she's been in and out of nursing homes, but after the aneurysm, the doctors told us that it would be best to start giving her end of life care, to take her off all of her medicines except for a few, and to give her the best life while we can. i am one of those people who take care of her during the weekdays, and each day she's been improving and regressing, back and forth. of course, my dad uses her as a scapegoat to get me to do everything for both him and her, because it was *my fault* that she ended up this way, and if i don't help she will die and it will be my fault. this is the same person that jokes about letting her starve when she doesn't want to eat and spends the least amount of time actually helping. my mother is out of the picture and wants her to die, and my siblings refuse to help because they think it's a woman's role to be a nurse.i've made it my goal to leave this family behind me and never look back. i want to escape from them and live my life free of their judgement and to live safely with my so and our identities, but i could never bring myself to abandon my grandma. i love her so much it hurts. she taught me everything i needed to know, more than my parents ever did to me. and she showed me what love is supposed to feel like.i'm not a very religious person, i've given up my faith a long time ago. but, each day, i've been praying to god to end my grandma's suffering. she has heart problems, dementia, she has moments where she can walk and talk and moments where she refuses to eat because she doesn't recognize what's in front of her as food. the doctors all told us that her next stroke or aneurysm could happen any moment, so we had to prepare and treat every day like it was her last. but that was well over a year ago. i feel really fucked up for praying for my grandma's death. i wait and i wait for one day she passes in her sleep, the funeral happens, and i get out of there. i would never think about hurting her, i just hope that she goes peacefully to meet my grandpa. i'm a selfish, horrible grand daughter."," i can say i've ever been in a similar situation. but if you are genuinely afraid for your safety, you should just leave. judging by your parents past behavior they probably know that you'll leave when your grandma dies. i think that they would try something when she does unfortunately pass away. your grandma loves you and will understand. whatever happens, i hope you'll be okay. good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/901wcm/i_want_my_freedom_but_i_refuse_to_leave_while_my/,,"I want my freedom, but I refuse to leave while my grandma is still alive."

"first, i'm not american and my english it's not perfect.i'm a 21 years old male, brother of four legtimate childs and 2 bastards that i've never seen and probably won't ever see. my mother has her flaws but she is pretty good at being a mother. the biggest problem in my life is my father. my father has 72 years old. he went through really shitty times in his life: he lost his parents when he was really young, he came to the capital of my state around 20 without having no one, then went from working and living in brothels to becoming a good, but not amazing, athlete (this is detail is important) all of this dealing with the racism from the sixties, the dictatorship that happened in my country around the seventies and stuff so yes, his life was hard. the thing is, my father is a really shitty person. he thinks he's better then everything and everyone because he was the top student of his city (his city had like, 10000 people), being the third best runner in the contry for one year, having some kind of money (his retirement money yearns him about 4000 dollars a month. here in brazil this is way beyond the average for a professor) among other good but not amazing feats. he thinks he's on a level above everything and everyone else, my mom left college to take care of me so she heavily depends of my father's money. she hates living with him and having to deal with his ridiculous actions like buying every piece of junk and forcing us to use it, or picking rotten food straight from the trash (because ""it's cheaper"" its litteraly rotten food ffs) and wanting us to ea or checkin if we are using way too much toilet paper by checkin how much tp we wasted to wipe or ass by looking on the trash bin (this happens quite often actually) but the fact is that she's accomodated to this life of having huge fights every week because at the end of the day she doesnt have to deal with the drama of not having what to eat or where to live or paying bills and stuff. i'm not. i hate this shit. i hate my life. i thought about suicide a lot of times. i have been dealing with depression ever since adolescence. i really hate my father. not only because he hates my mother and keep her around because she's the only one who never goes away. but because i can't live a decent  life even though i could. the rest of my family is very aware of my father's bullshit and we don't participate to family events because my father has the gift of ruining people's moments. i hate him because he doesn't let me be happy or live my life. i lost all contact with people who could've become everlasting friend with me, because i'm trapped in this cage and he doesn't let me hang out with people like normal kids without having a huge fight. i lost almost all my time as an teenager because of this crap. my father thinks he can control me, subjugate me, humiliate me, threaten me and say what he wants to me because i'm on his house and i depend on his money. my father is racist (and we're black!!!), machist, full of envy, hate, regret, fear, and ultimatly sadness and i can't deal with his bullshit anymore. yes i tried talking with him but he says ""he won't listen to someone who's not at least better then him"". my father is developing alzheimer too and this just makes things worse because we fight, i open my heart, i tell him why we in this house ain't a family, i get hurt, i get sad and on the other day only i am hurt. this sucks hard. and well, fuck his health. i just want him to die so my mother ane my younger brother can be free. before last sunday where he said to me ""if you don't wanna be bothered by me, you better get your shit and find a way to live without me"", i was acomodated to the fact that soon he's going to die, but after this, i came to realization that it's not worth the wait. i'm fucking up my progress on the college because this is the first time in my life where i have freedom. i don't go to classes, i don't study, i use this time to just be at peace and find some shelter with my amazing friends, including my girlfriend. btw, i broke up with my first girlfriend because of my father, and i can't risk losing this girl because of him too. i can't even get out the house to visit my older brother because he  gets jealous and i end up staying trapped in this house dealing with this joke of life. i could go on forever talking about all the moments that made me lose my image of ""father"" that i had with him as i was growing up but nah, fuck this guy. last week i talked with my older brother wich de facto acts as a father to me and knows the bullshit i go through living in this house because he dealt with the same shit, and the thing is: he's going to help me with the upcomig financial problems, i'm going to live with a friend and i'm already planning on how to fix all the mistaked i made through my graduation and graduate on production engeneering. i'm happy that this shit of a life is coming to an end but at the same time i'm scared of facing him this week. he might try to phsically stop this to happen because he knows that without me he doesnt have nobody to talk. the shit part about this is that the next focus of all this bullshit it's going to be my youngest brother. he's up to date with the situation and is fine with me living but it sucks to know that i'm running away from this instead of ending this cycle of misery that my father spread to those around him. i hate him and i sweat to god, if there wasn't consequences and i had people wich i wanna enjoy life together, i would've done something drastic already. but yea, i'm finally gonna pursue my dream of peace and i'm happy and scared of the storm that is about to come. i haven't told my mother yet because she might get scared that i'm ruining my life and tell my dad and tben everything will be much more worse. i'm leaving a little bit of my things with my friends everyday and in three days i'll tell em that i'm leaving for real. this is probably a mess, so i'm sorry but i just started writing and couldn't stop. tl;dr i hate my father because he ruins my life and the life of thosr aroud him in every single way and i cant

try to hurt you or your mother when he finds out you're leaving. i might suggest getting some strong friends or some people to help you in case things get out of hand. your mother is at risk even after you leave, he might blame it on her and hurt her. apart from that, if you have everything well planned then go ahead, save your future, you will thank yourself later.remember, dont do this alone, if you are planning on telling your father then get some friends to help you in case things get heated.i wish you the best of luck, you are a very brave person, you are improving your

"a little bit of background is required, i guess. my mom and i have been very close since she divorced my abusive father back in junior high. my brother is mentally handicapped, he has william's syndrome, kind of the opposite of down's. it's mental instead of physical. the easiest way to describe it is that my brother essentially has the mental age of a five to seven year old. i've always had to be the one to kind of hold things together. it's been kind of a cascading set of bad luck in our lives. anyway, my mom always told me that i would be the one to take care of my brother if anything happened to her. and i came to terms with that and didn't really have a problem with it. he never really gets along with me, he can't get over the fact that i'm technically 10 years younger than him, yet ""i'm the boss."" it's something i've always taken in stride. anyway, as a result of this, i've always tried to stay close to home. i went to college close to home. i kept trying to look for a job close to home. i rejected some really good offers that would require me to leave the state, thinking that there would be others. but they never came. so i was working retail, buried under my student loans from grad school, trying to make ends meet with my family. mom got laid off, so i was able to leave the house for all of 2 months before coming back home to try to help out. some good things happened. i met my girlfriend. i love her very much. she understands and has stood by me through everything. but she's not in the best place either. her small-business is struggling. or at least stagnating. so she had to move away to new york to try to start improving that. it was easier for her to be there. but we're making it work. it's been almost three years like that. we've been together for four. things just kind of dragged on forever. and then things started to go bad. about four and a half years ago, my brother started deteriorating. it started really, very slowly. he started falling. then he started losing weight. then came the incontinence. and finally his ability to understand speech. he wasn't quite a vegetable, but he went from being more or less independent to completely dependent on the care of others. i ended up having to quit my job. we all thought he was going to die. he never really got used to calling for help when he needed to get up though. so on new years day, when i was supposed to fly back with my girlfriend for a week, my brother got up off the toilet and fell into the bathtub. his head was pretty bad so we took him to the er. they did a ct scan, didn't find anything, and sent him on his way. now during this time, my mom's health takes a really bad turn. she ended up in the hospital for over two months. i took care of my brother, the house, visited her daily. it took a real toll on me. my brother was incontinent. i couldn't leave him home alone. one time, driving home from the hospital he just says, ""i just went to the bathroom."" peed all over the car. i was changing his sheets daily, he would pull off the adult diapers at night and just pee in the bed. he would say he was done on the toilet, stand up, and piss all over me. i didn't yell, didn't scream, just cleaned up and then took a shower. we took him to doctors, of course. after dealing with insurance for the better part of six months, we finally got him into a neurologist that said it was probably arthritis in the spine mixed in with dementia. in june, he fell. in the bathroom. again. because he didn't bother to say he was done. this time he really badly cut his eyebrow. we took him back to the same er. they did another ct. i noticed that it said that the hydrocephalus seemed to be getting worse. this was the first time anyone said anything about that. i looked it up and realized that that could be causing almost all of his symptoms. cut to another five months of arguing with drs and insurance and we got him an appointment to see a neurosurgeon to see if there were options to operate on his neck. this was still all anybody had ever said was wrong. the surgeon walks in and sits down and says, ""he has a brain tumor."" it turns out the tumor was so large it was blocking the flow of fluid around the brain and ""strangling"" it.  he gets put immediately in the icu to monitor him because the pressure was so severe. surgery goes as well as to be expected. and then he starts over a year and a half of rehab. i was spending my entire day driving or with him since my mom still hasn't fully recovered. again, during this whole time, i've been out of a job. we kept being told that i was eligible for illinois to ""employ"" me as his caregiver. but his social worker kept saying no. they even said he didn't qualify for home health either.  it turns out we are, and hopefully on tuesday i'll find out more about it and maybe finally get some income. this has been going on for over four years that i could have been getting paid at least something to take care of my family. anyway, my brother i starting to walk again a bit. he's going to have some of his life back. but he's not back to where he was and he might not be. they didn't get all the tumor, so he still has to go through radiation therapy. and i have to be there because my mom can't handle him if he falls or loses his balance. my mom is understandably depressed and angry and sad. and she yells so much and i just can't take hearing it anymore. it's been bad enough where i've thought of suicide, though, i would never end up doing anything like that. but i can't take the yelling. i've resigned to having a shitty life. i have no 401k, no savings anymore (those were wiped out helping with medical bills), and my retirement plan is a bullet to the brain. and i'm so tired of my brother. i really am starting to resent both of them. but i can't just leave them. they're my family. feeling that resentment is really fucking hurting now.", you're

"it's just like when grandpa died two years ago. where does the source of this apathy lie? was it their dementia poisoning our relationships with each other, the way they lashed out at anything and everyone when they felt their end was near? was it the years of them not caring that much about us other than sending money in their final years? the fact that they rarely asked about us, but instead repeated the same old stories about themselves they've been telling us in the last 10 years?were we at fault for not reaching out to them enough?even when i think about how scared and alone they must've felt when their time came, how much pain they were in due to their sickness, or how they told me that grandpa's screams of pain kept up half the floor at night in the hospital, i can't feel a lot more than a minor case of sadness.was it me distancing myself from them emotionally? was it us getting numb? could i just be a cold, heartless person? why is it that a good film or a video game can move me to the edge of tearing up, but not the death of my own grandparents? is this just how things are? if i ever get married, and have children, will they cry when i pass away?", most of it is because you've seen their health decline and youve prepared for the inevitable. i didnt feel anything for months. and i thought i was a moster. but its actually quite normal.,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8qxu2s/grandma_died_and_i_feel_nothing_at_all/,,"Grandma died, and I feel nothing at all."

"i’ve had it. tonight, my father called me the devil. more specifically, someone who would put the devil to shame. i have no one to confide with about what i am feeling. i am compelled to write down my thoughts in print rather than continue getting misunderstood by opening my mouth and sharing my mind with my family only to get hated as a result. context: i’m the oldest of 4 siblings and the first generation born and raised in america, first to go to college, first to go to med school. i have been recovering from severe depression that i believe was worsened in medical school and had to take a voluntary leave of absence from my 4th year because i had reached a full-blown burnout. to the point i couldn’t even make a sandwich. i warned people last year i was having suicidal thoughts and my family recommended i came home. fast forward to now, i’ve gotten myself back on track after a severe financial and academic blow. i plan to return to school this month to graduate, until my parents dropped this bomb on me. i can’t begin to explain how sad i feel that this is how my parents feel about me.my father and mother have asked me if i hate them and even gone as far as to tell me that they do in fact believe i hate them. both within this last month. which is not true. how did this happen? was i too distracted with my own recovery that i forgot about the loved ones around me? i wonder.was it my lack of “humbleness that educated people like myself should always portray,” as my dad put it tonight. insinuating i am unappreciative. was it because i advocated for the last 30 years of my life that he discontinue chain smoking 20-30 cigarettes per day (which used to be 40-60). living in fear for his health to the point that his pvd has led to nightmares with visions of my fathers disregard for medical advice causing him to amputate his own vascularly dead right leg, below the knee, and hen proceeded to cover his anatomically fresh and correct wound with a kfc friend chicken bucket. i woke up sweating and crying from that nightmare and i can’t stop thinking about it, i think it’s scarred me. i will never forget the way i flopped onto the ground crying in my dream as my knees gave out for the first time in my conscionable life with the heaviest weight of sadness anything had ever conjured up within me.was it my “constant attacks that condescend and demean,” as my mom put it? after her second copd exacerbation in two months scared me so much i felt compelled me to reinforce how her copd could be prevented, what it is caused by, what it can lead to and how it is being treated, i feel like she doesn’t pay attention when she listens to me. i worry my mother is showing early signs of vascular dementia and i cry each time i pass by her thinking about how if i am wrong, and she develops alzheimer’s like her many aunts before her, then she will need to relearn how to swallow like i’ve seen with some of the patients with advanced disease. i also cry because i can’t, for reasons of therapeutic privilege, just simply discuss the possibility of my mother developing alzheimer’s or else she would completely wall up and leave the room to avoid talking about it because she doesn’t want to believe she could have it. was it the multiple times both my parents told me to “shave my beard because i looked like an isis terrorist?” after they know frequent shaving causes me to develop folliculitis and that i personally feel more comfortable with a freer form of myself with a hygienic and regularly clean cut look. this particularly cut deep considering my past as a young lebanese man in america. i had a gun pointed to my head in boston for being muslim and defending two younger arab boys who were being picked on by a group of older white teens. i had an old rusty ford f-150 full of rednecks stop their truck while driving past me in downtown tampa because they had a problem with the arabic i was speaking with my sister outdoors and was threatened to “keep it down with that terrorist language” as they drove off with their confederate flag waving from the back of their truck. i’ve been arrested in miami for ‘disorderly conduct’ and ‘trespassing after warning’ due to two club bouncers who decided to exert their racist authority and find a horrible reason to push me up against the wall and told “they weren’t going to let a fucking arab get away with cutting the bathroom line” (to puke, mind you). but after all that, i can genuinely say my parents words hurt more than those strangers’ actions.i have already accepted the deaths of both my parents, before they have died. i feel nothing anymore, why would i? all of my empathy tank was spent in the first couple months of 3rd year medical school. every time i hear my dads violent coughs that are so frequent they produce blood, i imagine the pulsating tumor within his lungs, or his pulmonary edema filling up his lungs from right heart failure, or a side effect from the 14 medications my dad is prescribed to take daily (which he thinks of as a tool to facilitate eating sweets with his diabetic diet and salt with his hypertensive diet).i feel like an ultimate failure and the ultimate oxymoron, the barefoot shoemaker, the starving chef, the *suicidal doctor*, *the doctor who couldn’t even help his parents’ health*.before medical school i used to be secure, happy and mostly unafraid. now, i live in perpetual fear, cry on a weekly basis with 3 failed long-term relationships under my belt, and i don’t have a dollar to my name with $320,000 in debt. i have witnessed grief and suffering on a scale greater than i thought could be sustainable. our minuscule extension of life offered to privileged people for the financial gain of a corporate few discourages me from being complicit with the charade anymore. my blood pressure got so high i couldn’t talk with my father anymore after what he said and my eyes were so red and watery i couldn’t face my him either, i had to retreat and tell him “thank you,” that “i knew when i was not welcome” and left him to finish his cigarette.there are many futures i still want to play out, i no longer feel like as empty as i did last year. tonight did not help but it did hurt and i am strong enough to weather this and change their minds about me one day. thanks for reading.my rant is now over."," i encourage you to take the advice of the other commenters thus far.here's my takeaway though, and please know i'm not trying to be overtly rude or negative:your communication skills leave much to be desired, from what you said your oral skills are lack luster, and your written skills, while yes technically accurate, are not a pleasure to read.  you're overly florid in your style, and i can totally see why your parents are reacting the way they do.your language indicates that you think very highly of yourself, your education and your intelligence.  you come off as completely condescending.have you stopped to think that your parents are actually adults who may actually have opinions and minds of their own and that it's not their child's place to tell them how to live their lives?  many parents (my own included) do not need to hear that they're doing things wrong from their children and that's why they're coming at you in the manner they are.you need to take a step back from them.  understand that in the end of it all, you are their child, not the other way around.  you might be close to having a md, but you're not a doctor yet and more  importantly you're not their doctor.  you really have no business being so condescending about their health. bottom line, you're acting like a spoiled brat child.  instead of a mature adult.you need to have a conversation with them that starts off with ""i understand you're upset with the way i speak to you, and i""m sorry about that, i'll try to be more understanding.  it's not my place to tell you how to live your life, as much as i worry about your health, i understand i cannot tell you how to behave""as for the rest of your post about your school and finishing and what not, get it over with.  money is not the end-all-be-all of life.  being that much in debt is not that unusual in the united states, and if you do get your md you will be able to pay off the debt more quickly than most college graduates.  stop considering yourself as privileged as well, you may very well be, but a little humbleness will go a long way with how other people perceive you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8ootbo/i_developed_suicidal_ideation_from_an/,,I developed suicidal ideation from an occupational hazard and overcame it while living in a household that enabled destructive behavior.

"i think i’ve ruined my chances of having kids and have brain damage [nsfw] [remorse]tbh, i’m not sure where to post this. i guess the best place is here in /confession, although a lot of the shit i’m about to tell you is...very disturbing. certainly not for kids, not safe for work. it’s disgusting, let’s just be honest. so this is probably the most embarrassing and maybe the worst thing i’ve ever done, since it may effect me for the rest of my life. it’s certainly the hardest confession to talk about. bottom line: over the years, “destructive masturbating” (to put it mildly) mixed with “erotic asphyxiation” have left me in a bad spot. yeah, i wasn’t joking...this is not safe for work.bit of back story: so i’d always been a f*cking weird kid. i’d always been deathly afraid of getting shots, needles, i used to get sick in school when we had to take apart like a frog or watch someone having surgery, etc. (more so than should have been for my age). this combined with my having been bullied and shunned, made to felt like i was worthless, stupid, disgusting, a creep, made me start to believe that i actually was all those things after so long. finally, combined with a very submissive persona coupled with the fact that i used to write disturbing stories/fantasies as a kid, and come puberty, you can guess what happened.so my dad was never there for me. i was 12 or 13 and had never had “the talk” or really any kind of talk. since i was so out of the loop i had next to zero knowledge of sex, masturbation, general adult or taboo things. in late 2009, i got a laptop for the first time. i was going through a lot of difficult sh*t at school, so i sort of turned to the internet to suppress my feelings of sadness, anger, and misery. i’m not sure it really suppressed those feelings or just channeled them in a different manner. most of my time on the internet was dedicated to posting a lot of comments posing as a girl on a fan forum, and the other half was “looking at porn”. for some reason i just remember like looking at/downloading thousands of images of women wearing kinky stuff (leather, rubber, latex). for the first few years, that’s all it was...looking at images. i was so clueless i didn’t even know how to masturbate, i sh*t you not. after a while, my submissive nature fully came into play, and i started searching for more bdsm stuff...related to “femdom”. i started fantasizing a lot and wanted to meet someone into the same crap, although i never made any serious attempt to do so (was like 13-16, no phone, not good for meetup) so eventually i did discover how to start masturbating; i’m going to try to refrain from posting too many “graphic details”, as i don’t want this to read like a porno. so as an older teenager the masturbating turned more violent. i started trying to like copy what i was looking at on screen, more violent bdsm/sadomasochistic acts. i became more comfortable with hurting myself as time went on. this progressed to the point of sounding and penetrating cbt (don’t know what those things are, look them up...it’s not a pretty sight.) most of the damage i did was to my balls though. so i’ve never had “big” or even normal sized balls...so that made the cbt all the more destructive. needles and electricity. 9v batteries. blood. i’m sorry if i’m making any of you sick, i just need to get this all out there. so the most dangerous part of this occurred maybe from about age 16 to 21. i noticed after a while of electroplay that my balls seemed smaller than before. i started to realize that what i was doing was effectively killing cells and shrinking my balls, one ball more so than the other. but i kept doing it, albeit more sporatically. i eventually stopped the worst of the cbt; i had more sense than to completely destroy my balls. alright, so that cat’s out of the bag. now for the potentially more destructive longterm part. so from about age 12 or 13 i also started to practice suffocating in plastic bags. eventually i incorporated this into masturbating. like with the cbt and porn i was looking at, this too eventuallly progressed to being more dangerous and risky. fast forward to age 21, late last year or early this year. i started doing variations on erotic hanging. at first it was something more i could control; i.e. the belt or rope was not hung too highly, and it was like above the bed on a nail or something in the wall. this left visible redness around my neck, sometimes even some flesh wounds or something. so i’d have to wear a sweatshirt and zip it all the way up to prevent my family from seeing. usually the wounds would heal within a few days to a week’s time, then i would do it again. around february of this year is when it got the most dangerous and life-risking. the turning point was when i used this belt in the shower room. i turned on the shower so nobody could hear what i was doing (fam was home.) i also put a thick towel around my neck and put the noose-like belt around the towel; this was to prevent more serious redness/scarring. so i hung the top part of the belt over the roughly 8 foot bathroom door and closed the door; this would prevent the belt from slipping and me falling hard on the tile floor. so, still able to control my actions, i slid my feet out farther and farther from the door and eventually couldn’t breathe. i also started feeling really weird (it’s hard to describe the feeling seconds before you lose consciousness) and then i blacked out. so this is where the miraculous part came in. what probably should have happened is i should have died there, not be discovered by mom for about 30 minutes to an hour or so. but that’s obviously not what happened. so i’m not sure how much time passed, but i assume it was only roughly a few seconds that i was out; next thing i knew feeling came back, my eyes opened, and, while mentally confused and disoriented, i was able to eventually remove the noose/belt and towel. i don’t remember cu**ing but apparently i did, as it was all over my pants/floor; i assumed this happened as i was blacking out. i couldn’t believe that i had survived. i mean, i was completely helpless and unconscious; no way i should have survived. i’ve got a few theories as to what happened. when i fully lost consciousness, my body’s and mind’s resistance to completely “hanging” ceased, and it’s possible that with my full weight on the belt, that it slipped a little bit and i was able to land on the floor again and regain consciousness. however, i think it was a mixture of slippage and divine intervention. i truly believe it was not my time to die. i was on the brink, but something pulled me back. now this “near death experience” should have been a wake up call, but i did continue hanging; although i made sure to never completely put myself in a situation that i’d lose all control like before, because i knew if it happened a second time, i might not be as lucky. so tl;dr - for most of my teenaged and adult years, i’ve basically mutilated my balls and got off on asphyxiation, both hanging and from a bag. i think i know why i’ve done it, too. i’ve never been truly suicidal, but i have been very depressed and unmotivated; i’ve come to call what i did to my junk as “sexual self-harming”. so like self-harming, cutting, or what not, except what i did had a sexual element/was to get off. i also think i self-consciously wanted to punish myself for sh*t i’d done, and that i resorted to this self-harm as a way to stem the mental pain i was feeling. this, in addition to all of the porn i’ve looked at obsessively over the years, may be like self-medicating; i mean, think about it. the only reason i’m probably not shot up with heroin under a bridge somewhere right now is because i’ve had no connections, had so much social anxiety. yet, with all of the erotic asphyixiation, i may not have escaped permanent brain damage. some might call it karma. idk. all i know is i’m paranoid at what the future might hold now. and i haven’t fully stopped this destructive behavior, and probably won’t until i get in a healthy relationship.tl;dr again; i’m afraid i won’t be able to naturally have children, and that i may already have some noticeable brain damage. i’m afraid i’ll develop early-onset dementia at like 25 or 30 years old. i’m terrified of the future, yet it’s hard to really get help. what am i supposed to tell a medical doctor? shit’s so embarrassing, they’d probably try to get me locked up somewhere. i guess the only good thing that’s come out of all this is i’ve found out that my heart is not weak or i’d be dead right now. i’ll confess more going forward that will help y’all to fully see or hypothesize what drove me to do all this. i’m so paranoid and have got so many fears right now, and i’m not sure how to quell them.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8hg95v/ive_ruined_my_chances_of_having_kids_and_have/,,I've ruined my chances of having kids and have brain damage* [nsfw] [Remorse]
"i was 19 at that time and so much in my life was changing. i’d just started living with my grandma who had severe dementia and alzheimer’s after my grandpa had died shortly before, my friend group was strained due to a crazy friend, i’d just started college months ago, and my mom who was my emotional support had just gone to japan on a 3 month trip. lala, my dog was 13 yrs old and cried all the time in the middle of the night because she was old and my mom was gone, she’d also gotten surgery for cancer a year before so her health wasn’t what it used to be. i tried to console her, but her crying would also wake up my grandma who would go into one of her delusional fits sometimes. i couldn’t handle it anymore. i was so stressed out and i couldn’t sleep because of her, so i kicked her. i felt terrible about it and never kicked her again no matter how much she cried in the middle of the night. but during my mom’s absence, my dog’s condition got worse and she died a few years later in 2015.last night i had an awful dream that i kicked a dog which brought up a lot of past guilt that i still feel today. i know it’s no excuse, but that was an incredibly dark time for me, and i began to go to counseling for my anxiety shortly thereafter. i wish i could apologize to my dog :(", shit happens. that’s tough but just let it go. the fact that you feel so bad about it now shows your hearts in the right place.,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8gjt2v/i_kicked_my_dog_when_he_was_old/,,I kicked my dog when he was old
"tl;dr. i’ve been abused, isolated, made terrible choices that have filled me with overwhelming shame and guilt, and am a very lonely person as a result.  i seem to be incapable of getting/maintaining any kind of relationship.  am i my own worst enemy or have i been mistreated enough to justify my depression/anxiety/isolation.not one person knows everything about me.  not even any of the 30 or do therapists i’ve seen.  i am not close to anyone.  i am stuck in life and want to get all of this off my chest hoping it will help me,  if anyone can get through this post, first, thank you, and second, please give me your honest feedback.  my mom was 18 when she had me, her first child.  she married my father 10 months prior.  we lived in a trailer park, they fought, screamed, and threw stuff at each other a lot.  apparently, my dad drank too much.  they had a second child 3 years later, my little brother.  my dad didn’t want him.  i was a daddy’s girl.  my dad started sexually abusing me at some point. i was too young to remember when it began, but i do remember it later on around 7.  they divorced at that time, but my mom didn’t know about it.  they asked me who i wanted to live with.  i felt like my mom wanted me to say my dad, and i felt like my dad would be very hurt if i didn’t say him.  so i said my dad.  i was always worried about hurting his feelings.  after the divorce, my brother and i would go stay with him.  sometimes my brother didn’t go.  i remember laying on the floor with my dad, and i’d start crying bc he was watching the football game and not giving me his “attention”.  disgusting.  my cousins on my dad’s side would visit, and i would try to get my male cousin who was my age to touch me inappropriately.  he wouldn’t.  one night in bed with my brother, i tried to get my brother to touch me inappropriately, and he wouldn’t,  either.  i tried with another cousin and some other boy and failed.  i remember feeling so embarrassed with myself.  i was only 7.  my grandparents, my mom, my brother and i moved back to their hometown.  my dad moved out of state back to his hometown.  my family introduced me to a girl “misty” my age.  they knew her family from way back.  first night i stayed with misty, she asked if she could touch me inappropriately.  this was summer before 3rd grade.  i couldn’t believe it...someone else like me. from around 3rd grade through 5th grade, she did all kinds of sexual things to me.  i was embarrassed but couldn’t stop.  she was also the popular girl, and i was the shy, awkward girl.  she wouldn’t let me have friends all the way through 8th grade.  she eventually got kicked out of school for other things, so i spent high school trying to find friends, quite unsuccessfully.  i’m 4th grade, these girls in the bathroom were talking about sexual abuse. i came out of the bathroom stall and said, “oh me too!”.  it was the first time i’d heard of sexual abuse and talked about negatively. they asked me who, i said my dad.  they reported it without my knowledge. i got called to the principals office where i saw my mom and stepdad.  my mom asked what happened, i told her my dad did stuff to me, and she asked if i was sure, was it not my stepdad? i said it was my dad.  she didn’t believe me.  my grandma and i were walking outside, and she only said i wished you had told me.  my mom never said anything else about it.  i wasn’t seeing my dad anymore after we had all moved, and when i was asked if i wanted to press charges (4th grade!), i asked what would happen, they said your dad will go to jail, so i said no.  i felt bad for him.  one year later, my mom divorced my stepfather (caught him cheating), and my dad moved back in with us at my grandparents.  everyone knew what i had said about the abuse at that point, and no one did anything.  he didn’t stay long, though.  he left a note that i saw first when i got home from school.  it said he was leaving, he couldn’t deal with the kids.  i left the note where it was and never told i’d read it.  my mom and brother were devastated.  6th and 7th grade were kinda normal for me,  we lived with my grandparents.  summer before 8th grade, my mom married my 2nd stepdad without me knowing (i was staying at my aunt’s for a week).  i continued to live with my grandparents, though.  my grandma actually fixed up a room just for me before i was told of the marriage.  my new stepdad was very strict and taught me to care too much about what others thought of me, to dress conservatively bc i was prettt and would give off the wrong impression, and to not trust boys bc “he used to be one and they were all bad”.  he and my mom would say that i was naive, had no common sense, and couldn’t be trusted.  however, through all of this, i had straight a’s and ahead of my age group.  they both thought i was sexually actively although i wasn’t.  they just didn’t trust me, which felt like they didn’t love me.  there was never any affection in my family.  i couldn’t ask for advice bc i was made to feel stupid.  i never felt like my mom loved me.  she said she wished she hadn’t had kids, she wanted to run away from us, and she said she couldn’t see how i had any friends.  i didn’t have friends, though.  she would say i had it so good bc i was pretty and popular.  i don’t know where she got that from,  i should stop being a spoiled brat.  however, i had to get lunch money from my grandma every week.  my mom would give my brother lunch money.  she always gave me dirty looks, and if i asked why, she’d act like she wasn’t and tell me to stop being so sensitive.  crying was a weakness.  high school graduation was lonely... all those kids and their friends taking pics.  i didn’t have friends.  everyone assumed i did bc i was “so pretty and smart”.  no one noticed.  i should add that my brother got leukemia my senior year, so he and my mom were in another city for 9 monthsgetting treatment for him. thankfully, he survived.  i spent my senior year living alone in our trailer.in college, i dated a guy, got pregnant, had an abortion.  i was raised baptist and felt extreme shame and guilt.  i broke up with that guy right after my stepbrother died in a car wreck.  the guy stalked me for 9 months until he got caught, arrested.  he terrorized me and my college roommate.  so i lost even more trust in guys.  i assume that if i break up with them, they’re going to kill themselves (he threatened it constantly), kill me, hurt me, or just hate me and be destroyed emotionally.  when the stalker ruined everything i owned, no one in my family cane down to comfort or help me.  my mom visited me at college twice.  the first time, she left me at the bar and partied with guys younger than me all night.  the second time was my graduation, which she was late to.  side note: although she made me feel like she hated me, she would put on appearances and brag about me in front of others.  try to hug me when others were around.  so uncomfortable.  i had another abortion in college, then a few more throughout the 5 years after graduation :(.  i’ve always felt like a horrible, horrible person that should pay a pennance and not allowed to be happy.  i got married for a year in which i got pregnant yet again.  i wanted the baby once i found out but ended up having a very painful/traumatic “missed miscarriage” for 3 weeks that ended up requiring surgery.  after the divorce, i just went wild dating different guys, having sex, etc.  i feel somewhat like a sex addict bc i can’t ever stop myself when i meet someone i like.  it’s interesting bc every guy would say they had no idea as i come across as do sweet and innocent.  i don’t get it.  i do feel like a child, though.  very emotionally immature.  i’ve had heartbreak after heartbreak. dating the wrong guys...selfish, emotionally cut off guys.  never close to a serious relationship since the marriage.  i’ve isolated myself more and more and can say i only have one friend but lives in another state.  she befriended me at work and stays in contact with me without fail.  my life has been very lonely.  i’m in my early 40’s now, no kids, single, very little family.  my brother is married and lived several hours away.  my mom died last year from cancer (i sadly watched her take her last breaths - just me). my grandma has alzheimer’s.  that’s it.  no support system.  the only thing i have is a successful career...somehow.  i’ve seen around 30 therapists and i’m on antidepressants.  i just don’t know what to do with myself but hoping spilling my guts like this will help.  i’m so filled with shame and guilt.  i crave affection, sex, stability, a relationship, but don’t know how to get it.  if i can’t get it, why live???", sounds like it can only get

"my grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimer’s about 6 years ago. she recently passed away after the disease had severely progressed. she was bedridden with no motor skills or cognitive abilities whatsoever. through it all my parents were by her side trying to give her the best care and the one thing that really kept them going was that my grandma would give them kisses. this continued until the last few days and it made them, and me, feel like she was still there somehow. about a week after she passed i was in class learning about reflexes and demyelination and learned something that has completely destroyed me. the kisses my grandma gave us were actually caused by a reflex called snouting. it happens when something is pushed up against the lips and resembles someone blowing a kiss. every “kiss” she gave us made us feel connected to her and even though i know it wasn’t truly a kiss, i can’t tell my parents because i know it’ll destroy them and take away that one connection we had towards the end.", [example](,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8eqasn/i_dont_want_to_ruin_my_parents_last_memories_with/,,I don’t want to ruin my parents last memories with my grandma.

(not really a believer, if that matters)  in this building, i saw an empty wall in the corner.  i had always considered it a fire hazard since the emergency exit door was on the other side of the building.  what if there was a fire or a shooter?  i sit near the back...so in the event of disaster, i would be sitting against an empty wall with no escape.  i had numerous conversations with people about that empty wall.  i thought about it a little obsessively for the longest time.  then, one day i suddenly noticed that there was a huge fire exit door with a fire extinguisher.  it had been there the whole time, but i never saw before it until that day. most people i talked to about it said, ""i doubt anything would ever happen"" or ""if that happens, just work your way back towards the library room and lay low.""

"i have been neglected by doctors for 10+ years, they refused me proper testing, told me it was all in my my head, all this wild stuff. telling me i just have “chronic fatigue syndrome” and refused to do more testing, even when i was crying, begging for help. i trusted them and didn’t know the harm they were doing until recently when i finally found a good doctor. my life has been stolen from me since i was 16.spent so much of my 20s bedridden. can’t work more than 15 hours a week. i want to work and be able to have my own place, away from my abusive family. want to travel and run around with my dog on the beach all the time. want to put my vet tech degree to use. want to help people and do my part to make the world a better place. but my passions and wonder are so horribly stopped from happening.but i can barely walk sometimes &amp; my cognitive problems are atrocious. the things that could help are not covered by insurance because lyme disease is this big coverup thing so s lot of doctors won’t help.i can’t afford the things i need to do but i am dying. it will eventually kill me, but it is a long, agonizing death. full body extreme pain. and most people don’t understand lyme at all &amp; think it’s some quick thing to cure which is not the case a lot of the time. some people are diagnosed with ms and alzheimer’s and lupus but actually end up having lyme. the quality of life in bad cases is that of aids patients. people are dying from it.so the way “friends” and fam have treated me is so horrible. many of them didn’t believe a woman in their 20s could possibly be so sick. i wish i was lying!!!! this disease is so isolating. i’ve stopped talking to friends and family because of how horrible they treated me regarding this. but i can’t do so much and i am beyond heartbroken.i feel so trapped. need procedures done, cant work enough to cover it, no insurance help. i can’t live another 10 years like this, not even 5. it will kill me or i will kill myself, the pain is unbearable.and i don’t want to die without experiencing the world. but this is not something i can handle anymore. i’ve been unbelievably strong for 10 years. i don’t have much more in me."," i have a very close friend who is diagnosed as well. he recently got a port put in to help with his meds. i know this is meant to be anonymous, but he recently had to quit doing a lot of the things he enjoys (like dancing) and i would love to somehow get the two of you communicating somehow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/87kkek/my_chronic_lyme_disease_makes_me_want_to/,,My chronic Lyme disease makes me want to genuinely kill myself.

"[remorse] my mum was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when i was very young, and her and my dad divorced about the same time. her, my brothers and i went to live with her parents. she was in a wheelchair like this for about a year, and then she was bedridden.eventually, we had to move to a different place when i was 11 because we couldn't afford to stay where we were. my brothers and i started living with our dad and stepmum, and mum had to be put in a care home about an hour away. her mum and her only brother had died by then and her dad stayed in the old place (he didn't want to move and i think he didn't want to watch her die). my brothers and i would take the bus to see her for a few hours every weekend. sometimes we took turns so it would only be every other weekend. for the rest of the week, she would be totally alone in a care home, other than occasional visits from dad/stepmum/other people. my brothers and i started to lose interest or didn't want to pay attention to the situation or something i don't know, and we would barely talk to her and sit on our gameboys pretty much the whole time. we didn't know what to talk about. for the only good few hours she had a week where she saw us, we would pretty much sit and ignore her. she would sometimes try to talk, but other than that she was either too weak to talk or didn't want to bother us. and then sometimes when it would come to our turn to go to see her, we wouldn't want to go. we still did, but only because our dad/stepmum told us to go.for her last couple years at the care home she began to get dementia amongst other things i don't remember. occasionally she would say something inappropriate that no mother would say to her child, which i won't repeat. they weren't mean or malicious anything, just not what you say to your child. she also would say some heartbreaking things like she wished she could be our mum again and do things like wash our clothes. this was her worst time. she asked my stepmum to suffocate her with a pillow (i didn't find this out until years after she died). she wanted to die, and then she did when i was 14. i can't even imagine how fucking awful and torturous it must have been for her, stuck paralysed in a bed alone for 7 days a week except for a few hours where her children would come and ignore her in the same room. and there are so many other little things that just add up to make everything worse, not to mention her physical pain and disease, bed sores, paralysis etc., having strangers wash and feed you. i could never portray the hell she lived through as much as i tried. i don't know why we neglected her, i really don't. my dad and stepmum always told us to go see her when we didn't want to and spend more time with her and interacting with her, and that we'll kick ourselves when she died, and fuck am i kicking myself now. i'm 20 now. after she died i dealt with it ok for a while, and now not long ago her dad/my granddad died. he'd been in the bed miserable and unable to move for the last year or two of his life as well, and seeing him like that was hard. then when he died, it brought back so many emotions and even new ones about my mum's death.now i can't go a single day without thinking about it and i cry most nights, the pain is unbearable. i loved her so so much, she was the perfect most loving mum and amazing person, everyone who knew her always said the same as well. she didn't deserve this life. i feel so much guilt and shame, but mostly it just hurts knowing how so deeply miserable she was. that's what really gets to me.i can live with it, i'm not depressed or suicidal or anything but it is getting harder to bare and there's nothing i can do to make it right or just make it easier to live with. i can't change the past and i have to live with this for the rest of my life, and to be fair i deserve it. i hate what i did. she was in the worst position already and i didn't make any effort to make her last few years any easier. i know people will probably say i was just a kid, maybe subconsciously i didn't want to acknowledge the situation or something like that but i was very aware of the situation. i knew she wouldn't live much longer and everything else. and there wasn't even a good reason for neglecting her. i don't know why i did.thanks for taking the time to read thisedit: got rid of repitition", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/82grqe/i_neglected_and_abandoned_my_dying_mother_when_i/,,I neglected and abandoned my dying mother when I was a kid

"i feel like shit for saying that. he was a veteran, survived the gurilla death march, pow, and had 10 kids. he was almost 99 but honestly his quality of life diminished years ago. he’s been bed ridden, can’t see, can’t hear, has sever dementia so that’s a big reason why i’m glad he’s gone. he can finally be in peace. but.....i used to love him, used to look up to him. but later in life found out what a crappy person he actually was. he would beat on my great grandma, was abusive to the kids, and may have even been sexually abusive to the girls. all my great aunts are so upset that he’s gone and i’m just over here like good riddance that his negativity can finally be free from our family. i can never tell this to my family, especially now, and i have to go up there and basically fake sadness.edit: i’ve also been using his death as an excuse to get out stuff that i didn’t want to do in the first place. i know i’m horrible but it is what it is at this point edit 2: i’m guess i’m not really using his death as an excuse to get out of stuff since i will be up out of town with my family attending the funeral and supporting them.", 👏👏,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/80m22h/my_great_grandpa_died_and_im_glad/,,My great grandpa died and I’m glad
"i felt and still feel nothing. all of my grandparents, with the exception of her, died before i was born because they were all terrible alcoholics and all smoked like a chimney. i don’t recall any childhood memories with my sole surviving grandma. honestly, i can’t understand or relate to my friends who have had fond memories and strong relationships with their grandparents. by the time i was 8 years old, she was in her mid 70s and was already in a retirement home. in other words: i never had a relationship with my grandmother.eventually she started suffering from some form of dementia (i still don’t even know what disorder she had, that is how disconnected i was to her) which would prompt my dad and his brothers to visit her at the retirement home every couple months. my dad lives in a seperate state and is not part of my family or life so he would only call me up on occasion and tell me to go visit her in my spare time since my grandma was located in my state. i always told him i would, but i never did and i never had any intentions of doing so.when she finally passed, i still didn’t even visit her. obviously my dad realized that because he was at her side as she passed and i wasn’t there. i felt nothing, no sadness, no remorse, no regrets. he was very upset at me for not being there and he expressed that to me explicitly, but i still didn’t really care. this was a woman that i never knew personally and this was a man who was only considered my father by blood. at the funeral, all of my family members were in tears but i sat in the back feeling bored, frankly.that night, when i got home, i used the funeral pamphlet that was handed out to us, which had a portrait of my grandmother on the cover, as a rolling tray and rolled a blunt for myself. then, i threw the pamphlet away because there were weed crumbs stuck all on it. i smoked my blunt and never thought twice about these events until now, having discovered this subreddit. i did not do this to intentionally disrespect or desecrate the memory of this woman, it’s just i use random objects and papers to roll weed on all the time. i won’t lie and try to say i feel regret for all of my actions and thoughts leading up to this point because i really don’t feel anything. however, i do feel remorse for this particular part. it’s not so much an issue of honoring my dead grandma, but more about respect for the dead in general, regardless who it is. i might be disconnected from my family but i still have a moral code. i guess that night, i was just trying to disassociate myself from everything that i wasn’t really thinking about what i was doing. if i could go back and only change one thing, i’d definitely stop myself from rolling weed up on a portrait of my dead grandmother.not gonna lie here, it feels somewhat good to write this all out. anyway... bring on the hate!"," i mean its fair to not care about someone you barely know, however if you care about your other family, it's pretty disrespectful not to show up to a funeral and even worse to use the the pamphlet as a rolling tray.

"edit: this ended up longer than i intended. my apologies. so for some context, i got married just over a year ago. my nana (dad's mum) was diagnosed with dementia and other medical issues several years ago.when i was little i used to spend summer in london with my nana. her husband (my dad's father) had died too early for me to remember him. my uncle still lived as home with her. he's 50ish now and mainly stayed at home to look after my nana. every summer we would travel from scotland to london to stay for about a week. we would always pick blackberries from her garden and she'd always buy me and my sister a comic and sweet from the local shop (where the owner knew our faces too). it was all very perfect family film stuff now that i look back on it. about 8 years ago i stopped going on holiday with my parents. you know how it is, i was 18, just wanted to do my own thing and i had work as well taking up my time. so i rarely saw both my sets of grandparents between that time and my wedding. my dad always kept my sister and i up to date with her health, which was getting very bad. she was housebound and her beloved cat passed away. then her memory got worse and worse. we would still call her every christmas but she gradually forgot our birthdays until sometimes we couldn't even speak to her on the phone because she didn't even recognise my dad.fast forward a few more years and i was going to conventions in london every year with my partner and my dad suggested going to see his mum before she died. he wasn't guilt tripping me but he knew she wasn't going to last long and i hadn't seen her in years. plus she had never met my partner. i was honestly terrified.one of my own fears is memory loss and the thought of her not remembering our summers picking berries, or just her asking who i was, made me scared. i ended up making excuses on two separate occasions i could have met her again.the following year was my wedding and obviously all our family were invited. there was some talk from my dad as to whether my nana could even make it up to scotland as she was nowhere near as strong as she was. internally i was relieved and hated myself for it. i wanted to see her bit didn't know how i would handle it if she didn't recognise me on my wedding day.in the end she was able to come with the help of my uncle and it went fine. she was lucid enough to know what was happening and meet my partner. she's still alive today but i can't imagine she will be for much longer. i'm thankful that i was able to see her again but at the same time i hate myself for making excuses and if i hadn't gotten married, i'd probably never have seen her again.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7uajlu/i_was_thankful_that_my_sick_nana_almost_didnt/,,I was thankful that my sick Nana almost didn't make it to my own wedding.

"don’t know where to begin! dad broke his ankle, so he’s in rehab. mom can’t really be by herself. she’s not officially diagnosed, so we can’t talk in front of her about it. (her mom had alzheimer’s and dad thought she’d be too upset to know she has it. now too late.) i live 5hrs away. i hadn’t seen her since november and didn’t know she’d progressed to the point she’s at. i’m both very frustrated and sad. the first week and a half, i’m not entirely sure she completely knew me. she referred to me to 2 people -one of them my daughter- that i was her sister. god’s definitely teaching me patience since i’ve been here. my younger brother is their health advocate. i pray he hires a person to come in and care for them at least a few days a week, because i have to go home to my family in 2 weeks when dad comes home. talked to him (brother), but i feel he never tells me what he’s planning. worried about my parents, but i have to go home too. i pray constantly."," definitely planning on that. at least i hope my brother is planning it too. i am going to go back to my home and (husband and daughters) in 2 weeks. i can't come back for a month at a time again, only occasional weeks and weekends. i think some of mom's progression has surprised even my brother(s) too. my dad couldn't/wouldn't talk about her problem with us because he didn't/doesn't want her to know, and she's always around. i think my being here is possibly opening eyes to see some things they didn't know about before. however, i am seeing i'm going to have to visit more often ... instead of visits months apart.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uzynti/home_with_dementia_mom_for_a_few_weeks/,Home with dementia mom for a few weeks

"i wasn’t sure if this belongs here but when my mom has to take care of my grandma she can be an ass. at first it had to do with housework—so i stepped that up but now she’s attacking my appearance(she laughed at a dress i picked out and called it cheap)and now it’s finances. this morning she was on me about my finances in front of my grandma. and it’s not even like bill paying, it’s vacation savings!!!! my theory is that she does this sort of thing in front of my grandma to show she’s in control since sometimes my grandma can be a handful. i have suggested she needs to journal or something because attacking me ain’t it. any suggestions as to what i can do? ps. my grandma when she’s in her right mind has gotten onto her about this."," sounds like your mom is beyond just being stressed out but is experiencing caregiver burnout. it probably won’t get better until she has regular help and significant breaks from caregiving. she may seem like she is being an ass to you but if there are capable family members and they are not helping, in her mind, they are being giant assholes putting all the caregiving burden on her. her uncalled for comments to you are her experiencing no other outlet for her feelings of anger and feeling like she is trapped. this is just speculation in my part, but i totally understand the depths of caregiver burnout. you are right she probably doesn’t have the time or mental strength to sit down and journal. if she is burned out her time would be probably spent staring at a blank page without being able to organize a single thought. if there is no family willing to help then you may need to help your mom strategize things to open up some time for herself. are there funds to hire light housekeeping? have groceries delivered? send out her laundry? if your grandma has medicare maybe there are ways to provide your mom breaks with grandma receiving respite care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uznyd6/grandmas_dementia_affecting_my_mom/,Grandma’s dementia affecting my mom

"can anyone help me understand the difference between power of attorney and guardianship?a bit of context, my father is diagnosed with mild dementia and appears to be progressing rapidly.  he has other mental and physical illnesses, and is homeless (living in a hotel paid by the state for the time being).  we were estranged for 20 years but i have been providing weekly care with meds, food shopping etc. since last august.  his social worker is pushing for me to apply for guardianship since “it’s easier for family to get it than the state”.  i suspect she just wants me to take responsibility for his care, something i am not equipped or willing to take on by myself.i keep hearing that a poa is vital.  i don’t know what to do.  constructive advice appreciated!"," not a lawyeri think poa grants you the power to do things on their behalf, in their interest. they must grant it while they are of sound mind. you are not personally or financially obligated to them. it makes it easier and easier to handle paperwork, forms etc for them. but you can’t use it to override their wishes. if you’re all sitting at a table with a bank etc and dad says “no i don’t want to” you can’t use poa to sign for him anyway. if he refuses to sign/let you sign various papers and becomes homeless etc as a result, that’s not your “fault”nor your financial obligation. he can also take the poa away from you and give it to someone else.i think guardianship gives you the power to override their wishes but also the obligation to look after their well-being much like a child. they need a history of being incompetent and self-destructive basically, for a judge to grant it to you. but if they run into traffic it’s your responsibility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uyj5cm/need_advice_please/,Need advice please

"i've seen comments from others with this problem . . . i'm  frustrated, hurt, and aggravated rn, so forgive me if this is all over the place.my mil (mid-70s) is in the beginning-ish stages of dementia. we have a neuro &amp; neuro-psych that she sees regularly. summer of 2020 after a car accident, her driving ability was medically evaluated (she's cleared to drive). though, fortunately, she doesn't drive much. she lives on her own. husband goes over at least once a week to hang out, do things around the house, and -important- to fill her pill box for the week (heart, bp, blood thinners, etc etc). home health aide comes once a week. she and i speak  once or twice a week for over an hour at a time. mil and her widowed neighbor speak every day on the phone and keep tabs on each other. she also texts dh every night when she's upstairs in her bedroom. she's physically frail. a hip replacement a few years ago (retirement happened at the same time), a knee replacement is in the works, and other joint/ arthritis issues. mil also doesn't have many friends &amp; the only real hobby she's ever had she can't do bc of arthritis in her hands. her gp - who sucks and i've nicknamed ""dr. feelgood"" - keeps giving her oxycodone for the pain (i know). she's become obsessed with it to the point she ends up misplacing it by putting it in ""safe"" places and forgetting etc. now, we get to the problem. she's always been someone who gets into her head and becomes anxious when she has too much time on her hands. this has obviously worsened.  she picked up her meds including oxycodone early this week. all the meds in their own paper bags etc. monday, dh went to do the thing, including dealing with getting all the meds our of their paper bags and putting them in her weekly am/pm pillbox. note: the oxy doesn't go in this pillbox. the next day, she and dh were texting all morning about missing oxy pills from the bottle. i didn't know this, so when he left for his daily walk, i called her to chat. we chatted for a while, i mentioned how the past 2 days had been terrible for migraine. next thing i know, she says ""this is going to sound accusatory."" explains how she's missing 21 pills and the only ""reasonable"" explanations could be that either the drug store screwed up or dh took them for me. i was pissed. but, calmly &amp; firmly told her that her son would never do that. i then hear her say ""oh, hi"" then to me ""he's here."" ok, not knowing this has been ongoing, i shoot dh a quick text about it.when he got home, he explained that he remembered there was a pill bottle lid that was on cock-eyed, so he went out to the garage garbage and found the bag that had all the paper bags from her scripts in it. he found about 15 loose oxy in one of the white paper bags. he brought them in, explained how he'd found them. she says (and the story changes) essentially she opened the oxy bag and bottle in the car ""to check it."" for what, who knows. whatever. he also bought a monthly pill box specifically for the oxy and split them all up. we think all is well. yesterday evening she calls. apparently, she'd been perseverating on this since tues afternoon and still thinks he took pills as there are still a few missing. he calmly tells her again what he'd done, how he'd found the missing pills &amp; that some may have made their way out of the paper bag into the actual garbage, and no, he didn't dig thru all that. nope, he took them. dh has the patience of a saint. he has to be extremely frustrated or hurt, to raise his voice. she knows this. he finally lost his cool and raised his voice to her/ yelled. it kind of snapped her back. he ended up telling her how he's very careful not to bring up the dementia often as reasons for things as he doesn't want to make her feel bad, but she needs to entertain the possibility that it's that. she seemed to take this to heart, it made sense, sincere apologies all around. 10 min later she texts about how she's going to go look in the garbage. fine. she didn't text last night before bed as she does every night. home health aid is there today, so we know she's fine otherwise the aid would have called. i know we've got to figure out something re: oxy and her behavior surrounding it. we're trying, but all the cajoling from us and her neuro changes nothing. her gp is old, seemingly doesn't care, and loves the sound of his own voice. she sees her neuro every 6 mths (all doc appts are with dh). fortunately, i also see this neuro and have a long established relationship. my next appt is soon &amp; i plan to talk to him too. all that to say, what do we do with all this? do we need to bring up the dementia sooner when she gets like this? she's not to the point where redirecting works. she's also a very intelligent woman who will not be ""handled.""  ack. apologies for the length of this  post."," report that doctor, he has zero idea of how to manage pain. she is obsessed because she's addicted. the addicted brain, after a while, has a hard time measuring g pain vs dependence.this is hard, i went thru the same w my mother. got my eyes opened to a lot of my own preconceived notions of how early dementia presents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uyfp6t/mil_what_is_her_vs_dementia_perseverating_about/,"MIL: what is ""her"" vs dementia & perseverating about pain meds."

"back story:i'm really a daddy's girl, always had a lesser connection with my mom (although still not bad). i had the most lovely childhood, so good that growing up was hard for me. i always dreamt of creating a future that was just like my childhood, easy, happy and with so much love. my dad loved me, his only child, to the moon and back. he was always there for me, believed in me, proud of me.moving out at 23 (i'm 30) was very hard for the both of us. my mom sometimes thinks that was the time it started. i still came over a lot for dinner and also every weekend, later when i moved further away sometimes every other weekend. i always stayed three days.my dad has been slowly slipping away from me the last five years. he was still quite good actually. although he stayed in bed all day lately, when he was downstairs you could often have sort of normal conversations with him. only once in a while he was looking for his parents f.e. my mom was his caretaker, but had help from a lot of instances  (just fyi we're not americans). i still visited a lot and always came running when they needed extra help. even took a month off to take care of my dad when my mom had to undergo a surgery.this winter my parents had to temporarily move (for a renovation), they just moved down the street. it went downhill from there. dad was now quite often confused of where he was, of course, but could also not grasp that the former house was still there and didnt recognize the name of the village anymore. even though they lived there for 40 years. i didn't agree with the necessity of the renovation, because i knew it would be hard for my dad, but also because i loved my childhood house. it was my safe place. in a way this made me slowly let my past go and finally become an adult on my own. i started visiting less (every two weeks the weekend), because the situation in the temporary house was not a place for me to recharge anymore. the temporary house was not a home, but more because i missed dad and our old way of living.fast forward 3 months, renovation still going on. when my mom was out picking colours for the walls, dad fell. this sunday he had to go to the hospital. he is now extra confused of where he is and keeps trying to leave and unplug himself. he has to stay there for five more days.my mom finally said it yesterday, she doesn't think she can handle it to take him home anymore. he needs to go to a house after this.my brain understands it, she sacrifices her life to be a caretaker and when she's out of energy, it's time to stop.but my heart breaks.", you’ve helped me again remember that our adult kids (in their 30’s) have been losing their mother these past 5-6 years. i treasure how we communicate and stay on the same page. try to connect with any other relatives you have so as not to be alone in all this. take care.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uy0i0x/looping_for_comfort_finally_putting_my_dad_in_a/,Looping for comfort: finally putting my dad in a house

"hello all. this may have asked or discussed multiple times so bear with me. my grandmother has dementia with onset about 2 years ago. she’s progressively getting worse as expected and getting harder to manage but thankfully family is all pitching in to help in whatever way. she was started on donepezil and memantine combo therapy a few days ago after no improvement with rivastigimine. i know these meds aren’t great at changing outcomes and at best will only slow down progress to some extent. and results will vary from person to person. i really just wanted to hear anyone else’s perspective on these meds. was there a even slight noticeable improvement? or a noticeable slowing to progression? my family wants to decide if it’s worth putting her on more meds + dealing with the side effects mainly with donepezil, or should they just focus on comfort care, making her happy and riding the wave. apparently she didn’t respond well to the first few doses which i think is expected with a new medication like that and personally think to give her time on it."," so very wonderful (and rare) that the family is all pitching in.yes; i am personal friends with more than 200 persons living with dementia (because i led ""dementia mentors"" for over 5 years).  some with alz-type have delayed onset of more severe symptoms with the combo therapy.  some with lewy body type do well with combo.  my friends with ftd-type usually have problems with intensified symptoms from these.  if her symptoms are already mid-to-late stage, then i suspect these medications might not be worth the problems of trying to integrate them.personally very very glad i persisted with attempts on donepezil.  here are my experiences with it, and what i did in order to get past the horrid horrid side effects.  >> [ .",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uws4f1/worth_the_meds_vs_comfort_care/,Worth the meds vs comfort care?

"hello so i have never posted here i'm not a huge fan of posting things about family stuff online but i'm really trying to find some kind of advice for me and my family at this time.. my grandmother has recently been seeing a doctor and has taken test and doctors seem to be pretty sure its mid stage alzheimer's and dementia.(waiting on test so it not officially diagnosed.) but all the regular things i'm sure everyone knows have been happening. forgetting conversations immediately after having them me and my mom are here and my mom takes care of bills for the last couple years (before things got to the point of us realizing something isn't right) and basically having to help with hygiene things like that. she still knows all of us and things like that but her memory is especially affected and different behaviors were not used to. so anyway my grandfather has been sick a long time and passed away 2 nights ago of heart failure she was in the hospital with him actually for her own issues but it was sudden he was talkin about comin home in a couple day and doctors were talking positive and something jut happened at night and he never recovered.. so the morning after things went downhill my grandmother was released my mother and her seen my gpa (unable to really talk at this point but things had been stabilized and doctors still were trying to be positive) so after they seen him and i seen him he did end up passing away suddenly that night luckily my other family who flew in happened to be visiting. anyways we have always been a firm believer in we think its best to be truthful and honest so proper grieving and things like that are allowed to happen.. the first night we told her it was just how we expected... she sobbed we held each other she wondered why but ultimately my grandmother later on knew he was sick and accepted the fact and towards the end of the night (early morning by now like 4 am or so) was able to think positive and about the good times and one thing to us we noticed, remembered. now me and my mother (who are main caregivers for both of them) are not doing well ourselves but we understand that care needs to be taken with her and the way her mind is. so she remembered the whole night and most of the next day and then we were getting ready to go make arrangements at the funeral home and out of no hwere she asked ""so after this we can go see grandpa.."" and me personally just had to leave the room i want to be strong for my grandmother cuz that's what my grandfather would have wanted cuz i am the man of the house at this point.. that's the kind of man he was.. but its hard.... so my mom talks to her we have a really good time at least for us mentally piking out a gravesite for her and my grandfather to be buried together and taking care of all them things and again for most the day we would cry and talk about it and laugh and just grieve.. but she remembered.. so early this morning cuz i wanted my mom to get some rest so my gram slept in her favorite chair in the living room i slept on the couch out there and she woke up and the first thing she says is you ill tell ya i really wish grandpa was still here and we held each other and cried and stopped and laughed and talked about how this is how life is and hes was sick and finally resting. and literally mid conversation i brought up goin to say goodbye monday for the viewing she starts asking ""grandpas alive right??!?? and she seems very shocked and kind of look at her and i tell her gram that's what we were talking about he passed remember? and what i notice is she cried for a few seconds but then started remembering bits and pieces... and then she would say your right hes gone hes at the funeral home and remembering kind of what we talked about... now this mid conversation thing has happened twice since then the 2nd time she remembered what we were talking about right away and it didn't seem as bad but the time after it was like the first day it happened and we told her all over again.. but eventually it was the same she accepted it (obliviously not fully but moved to that stage) and i assured her everything was taken care of for i don't even know how many times its been cuz she forgets and ask the same things. and then i took her to see the new computer my grandfather bought for her about a month ago even though she has seen it and played on it she was excited i thought it would be good for her to play her game for awhile and just relax... idk if she even remembers what we talked about its been a bit now shes playin her game i got her coffee and breakfast and she is just happy hasn't mentioned seeing my gpa so i want so bad to think she remembers cuz him and her used to always tell me cuz ive always been bad with death that that's just the way life worked and that its sad its hard and different but life will go on and to remember the times you had.. im afraid for her to ask again and i want to tell her the truth and i wonder if she does start to remember after i tell her and it just takes a minute but i hate seeing her so sad and then it makes it harder for me and my mom to grieve also because its like having to talk about it over and over but for her i cant imagine cuz its like shes finding out for the first time all over again...... i wish so badly i could make her remember or just bring him back but i just cant and dont know what to do ive asked my mom and family and they kind of think like i always have the truth is ultimately the best for her to be able to grieve and will help her mentally in the long run but at the same time even tho some times she was able to remember and it wasnt as bad the times it is is it worth it?

"i’m 21f and my dad has been losing his memory rapidly the past few months.all my life, my dad has struggled with depression and his mental health. i believe these mental health struggles caused him to be extremely violent and have constant angry outbursts. these episodes were only heightened with his drug and alcohol abuse. i’ve always been terrified by him, and walk on eggshells constantly to not upset him.over the past couple months he has been acting very strange (stranger than usual). he’s constantly losing valuable items such as his credit cards, keys, and his phone. he forgets the time that he should pick up my sisters from school. he will knock on my door telling me that my car is missing from the driveway just for me to check and see that it’s there. he will call my mom from the house phone to ask her if she can call his cellphone because he can’t find it (he has the house phone so i’m not sure why he needs her to call). he will repeat the same story over and over again. he will have to change his own underwear constantly because he can’t make it to the restroom. his room is dirty and he’s began hoarding. he also has developed a tremor and shuffling gait.two days ago, i called 911 because my mom started screaming that he was having a stroke. he was rushed to this hospital where they did a ct scan showing narrowing of the blood vessels in the neck and head. the mri showed that he had an ischemic stroke. other abnormalities they found were issues with his liver and heart. the doctors only suggested that he would need a medication change and to follow up with his primary care provider and neurologist. since he’s been back from the hospital, his anger has only continued to grow. he will scream for hours on end. shouting profanity and slurs. he will throw objects and punch walls. he violently threatens my mom and the rest of my family. when it gets really bad i will lock myself in my room or try to leave the house without him noticing. my mom has been married to him for 30+ years. she is afraid to leave him because he’s violent. i don’t know what my options are. he will probably need a caregiver soon because he can’t make it to the restroom. my mom has thought about a long-term care facility but i doubt my dad would consent to that. please don’t suggest leaving him or reporting him to the police. he is scary and will most likely seek revenge if that happens. i’m stuck and i don’t know what the next move should be. any suggestions would be helpful."," r/abusiverelationshipsi know that this is old but i did a search because i'm trying to help a friend. i don't care if he has dementia, what is going on is abuse. this makes me think he's always been this way because you said leaving or reporting him to the police will make him seek revenge because he is scary. what is happening to you and your mother is domestic violence. it doesn't matter that he has mental problems. you need to get him placed as soon as you can. you can take him to the er and explain to them that there is no one at home to take care of him and it will force them to place him. you can even just call the police and they will do a 72-hour hold on him for a psych evaluation. do not let this continue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/usr79h/violent_dad_with_suspected_dementia/,Violent Dad with suspected Dementia

"i'm working as a care taker for a senior while her family is away at work/doing errands/out of town/etc. i don't have prior experience, or formal training so i've sorta been learning as i go, and reaching out to other caretakers/experts when i have questions.i've heard a lot of people say not to argue or try and correct a dementia patients reality, and to just go along with it. but occasionally she'll come to the conclusion that her daughter and son in law are out to get her, that they're just random people trapping her in their home and stealing from her (she rearranges her things a lot, so she often misplaces items and blames em). she gets very upset at times about it, and i'm not sure how to handle it/make her feel better. i did try and correct her originally but it really did make things worse, she didn't seem to get it and was getting more upset so i stopped there.i know that it makes things really hard for her loved ones when they're caring for her, because she firmly believes they're out to get her."," is there any wisdom or unpopular opinion about the misdiagnoses of dementia in a patient?let me elaborate on what i mean by that.  my father who's 89 and has had at least 1 mild stroke has been in cognitive decline in the past year.   we've noticed his communication is very sparse if at all with me and my sister who are his sole caregivers.   i would categorize his behavior as retreating. however, the caveat here that i would add is it's more verbal and passive?  rather than active.  he's cognizant of his surroundings like before and still maintains a lot of eye contact and seeks companionship from his us like getting out of his room to sit at the living room couch if we're in that area just so he has that visual connection.  while he isn't as vocal as before and to a level that is concerning us as sometimes trying to ask how he is, if he's hungry, cold, act.  doesn't always get reciprocated, he does respond very sternly when agitated.  for example, when we need to give him water because he's dehydrated or his medication.   i understand this is common among elderly.   any other times, he seems rather vacant when you ask him questions and his struggle to find the right words is demonstrable.so on to my point about misdiagnosing his condition.  while i agree he has some form of dementia given all the signs we've observed, he's currently in hospital care having kidney stones removed which is a byproduct of his fear of consuming water.    during his stay, they performed some cognitive tests on him and determined he has advanced dementia (unresponsive, non verbal, etc.)  but it's in my anecdotal but well supported opinion that it's due to his dehydration and unfamiliar surrounding as well as his hard of hearing.   anyone attempting to speak with him for 5 minutes will justifiably rule that he has severe dementia for the reasons i listed, however, they aren't accounting for the nuances that we as his care givers can observe on a day to day basis which paints him in an entirely different personality.all that being said, they've pretty much given up on any medical intervention to help him mitigate his condition and have written him off.   we don't agree with this assessment, obviously.   our plan of action is to speak with his gp and have him put on some regiment to stave off his decline.   one supporting argument we have is the attending doctor has no knowledge of his history except for the brief stay he's had and whatever is in the file to base their conclusion on.   we were even given the talk about whether or not we'd prefer to have do not resuscitate in the event something bad happened during the standard procedure of removing kidney stones, because of his ""condition and age"".   that alone is very disconcerting to hear and makes you think some doctors' aren't as committed to their patients equally and allowing their biases dictate their decisions.&#x200b;i've said a lot but i hope i was lucid enough to get my point across and appreciate any feedback others may have to share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uro6vb/how_should_i_handle_this/,How should I handle this?

"my mother has dementia and can’t work the television.  usually my dad is around and can help her find something to watch, but he does all of the errands so he is sometimes out.  she panics when he is out and it would help her a lot if she could watch tv and relax a bit.  she doesn’t watch tv often and she’s quite old-fashioned, so she doesn’t like much of what’s on.  my husband is incredibly patient and has created a very detailed sheet of instructions for her.  at this point she should be able to turn it off and on, check specific channels that he wrote down the number for, and sometimes channel surf.  this is a real struggle, but as long as we review it with her often, she can do it.  however, most of the time she can’t find something to watch.  she can’t use the guide.  because the shows she likes aren’t usually on when she tries, she thinks the tv is broken and quickly gives up.  i can’t believe there is nothing to help with this.  we have them on our netflix account and my dad uses it to watch shows with her when he’s around (she loves hallmark christmas movies and he watches one with her every single night), but she definitely can’t use it herself.  i would love for her to be able to use it because then there would always be something she could watch at any time of day.  is there any way to set it up to just play a list of shows we program in for her?  or get an alexa or something to help her find something to watch?  i just feel like there has to be a way to do this.tldr: is there any program that can be used to help a senior with pretty severe dementia watch tv?", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f8dw4u/help_her_watch_tv/,Help her watch tv

"it is time to pick up the throw rugs. mom has broken bones twice in the past three years from falls in the garden, but now she barely picks her feet up (and uses a cane).  i've talked to her before about picking up the throw rugs (and she knows, or used to know, it was a recommended step for elders) but she thinks the ones inside the doors really need to be there to clean off shoes (despite the outdoor mats).the big problem i anticipate, though, is that she hand-made all of them by knotting/crochet-ing rag strips. she's been doing it for years and has even taught classes on the technique. if i just pick them up and put them on the stack in the garage, she'll probably get them out and put them back down.  if i put them up high, she'll grab a step stool or ladder (she does this often) and get them.have any of y'all had success with finding a respectful way of getting rid of dangerous prized possessions?

"so i should start this with my grandfather is 80 years old, but he has lived alone since he and my grandma divorced in 1974. he is an aggressive hoarder and i would say “bachelor”. he has lived a state away (ca) from my mom (az), his daughter(47), since then but we have visited periodically over her/my life. he has not always been an easy man to be around, he can be very vulgar, sexist, and self centered. that being said, my mom came out to take him to a neurologist because he has been forgetting things in the middle of their phone conversations as of recently (last 3 months). the neurologist says he has moderate dementia and neuropathy in the lower half of his legs and arms. at the time of the appointment last wednesday, he knew what year it was, who the president is, who i am and my mom was, and that he had a job. on friday after the appointment, he fell walking to get a coffee and hit his head on the concrete. he was left unconscious for an unknown amount of time until someone found him and called an ambulance. now, he thinks it’s 1979 but he still recognizes my mom and i. he thinks he works at the nightclub he worked at in 1979 though, and keeps thinking he checked himself into the hospital on his own. he has become aggressive since the fall, and very agitated with most things. i guess my question is, is the crazy memory loss just because of his fall or could the fall have progressed his already diagnosed dementia to be worse? also, he needs an mri for his neurologist, but the hospital just keeps saying they can’t get him sedated enough for it. how are my mom and i supposed to get him an mri if the doctors at the hospital can’t seem to get him in to get one? i don’t know. i’m just feeling very stressed and confused and the doctors don’t seem to care that he now randomly thinks it’s 40 years ago. they keep saying well he has been diagnosed with dementia even though we keep telling them that the whole week before the fall he knew what year it was, how old i was, my moms birth year, all of this life information. how can i help her and him?", any hospitalization can really mess with dementia patients. my mom went from being a fairly sweet (to everyone else but her kids) type of person to hitting and biting nurses and ending up in restraints in the hospital. it completely disorients them and seems to make the dementia worse. usually it at least partially subsides when they're released.  his head injury might be why they're reluctant to sedate him enough to do the mri.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f77dfe/i_need_help_or_just_information_or_opinions/,I need help or just information or opinions

"i’ve been racking my brains (no pun intended) where to start. the lovely reddit community always seem to have helpful suggestions or stories about experiences that helps others so, my first time reaching out, i hope i can find some kindred help. my mum 77 yoa, has started to display some out of character behaviour which has come on quite acutely. all of a sudden she seems to have trouble recalling things, from short term memory. her behaviour also seems to be quite emotionally distressed, not aggressive, more anxiety based and seems to be feeling vulnerable. she had a very distressed episode this weekend past, where she needed a visit from both myself and my sister to help calm her down and allay fears she has over medical advice given to her recently for an unlikely condition to develop from a recently diagnosed lesser condition. it was quite a remarkable event and i’ve never experienced this behaviour from her before. when taking her to see her physio today which is being done in relation to the lesser condition (i had forewarned the physio of what had happened with my mothers consent), the physio asked her what had happened on saturday. my mum looked at me, quite blankly, and asked me what happened. she could only recall what happened after i started to recount each of the events from saturday. i took her home and gave her a job to do tomorrow (call her gp). she called me a little while ago, a little upset, to thank me for my help today but said that she was having trouble remembering the new exercises the physio gave her today. i told her i would go to her tomorrow after work and help her with it. before i rang off, i asked her what job i had asked her to do tomorrow. she couldn’t remember. i now have a fear that i will arrive at hers tomorrow and she will wonder why i am there, not having a recollection of the conversation today. i don’t know if this is just old age (she’s not that old in the grand scheme of things) or if we are at the precipice of something else entirely. for her, i pray and hope with every fibre of my being, that this is not something like dementia. it would be devastating to watch my loving mother succumb to a condition that robs you of your life and dignity. whilst in the uk we are blessed to have a service like the nhs, it can be like trying to get blood out of a stone to navigate the services and sometimes to have your words heard. reddit, if there is anyone who can relate to this and can give words from experience, i would be grateful."," in addition to screening her for an infection, i would discuss the possibility of thyroid issues and transient ischemic attacks with her doctor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f5f0t9/hoping_there_is_some_words_of_help_out_there/,"Hoping there is some words of help out there, Reddit......"

"hi all. i've posted here from old accounts, even walking those with family in home hospice through what to expect. my grandmother passed last year. she had dementia (likely vascular) but i think the stroke that triggered it is what ended up taking her. her end stage symptoms were very much like my great aunt who passed months after a massive stroke. nonetheless, i miss her (no shit). it feels surreal that she developed dementia. i feel so guilty not spending more time with her though i was one of 4 main caregivers for her. i felt so much anxiety, nervousness and apprehension around her. i was so scared of how others would treat her. i was so wrapped up in my anxieties that i didn't think to just...be there. i wish i could've seen if she remembered my grandfather. i wish i hadn't waited until she was nearly in hospice to say i loved her every time i left her room. i try to tell myself that it's just normal to feel this way but i don't know. i feel wrong for feeling angry and sad because my grandmother didn't forget us. she knew me, my sister, my mom, most, if not all her siblings, etc. she had her off days (and man, sometimes there were stretches of them) but overall, she was so...motherly and just easy going. she knew she had dementia (at least about 2 years into a 4 year diagnosis) and knew she needed care and i can't help but wonder how that was for her. i guess i'm only writing this here because you all know what it feels like to lose someone twice. my family and i have answers many don't with this disease-what triggered the dementia likely, what likely triggered the thing that triggered the dementia, etc. we weren't strangers to my grandmother on her passing. i'd move heaven and earth for just one more moment to feel her hands, tell her i love her and hear her call our names a million times just to say ""i don't need anything; i was wondering what you were doing?""for those going down this path: if i can answer any questions, please let me know; absorb the pain, the pleasure, the sad and funny parts. this was my first big familial loss and i know i'll get to a better point eventually but fuck this disease and i pray a cure comes before my parents get too much older.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f503th/possible_trigger_warning_for_death_its_been/,[Possible trigger warning for death] It's been nearly 9 months and I'm more full of regret and sadness

behavior on top of her rivastigmine since no reputable memory care wanted her due to her aggression history. my husband believed that love and patience can overcome antipsychotics; he basically denied mil her prescribed seroquel with the fear that it will cause her an early death. without antipsychotic to dampen her impulses, paranoia, and delusions, my mil operates on adrenaline rush that gave her almost superhuman strength enough to gravely injure others.over the course of the months of us being caregiver, mil aggression went out of control and sexually assaulted my husband, my oldest son, and one male home care nurse. my mil has also physically assaulted any females that dared to get close to any of the males she deem hers. she has pushed me down the stairs for saying good morning in my husband presence, resulting in broken ankle. she assaulted the social worker because my husband talked to them. she bashed a female home care nurse head for trying to wipe her with warm towel. she gouged meter maid one eye for no reasons resulting in permanent vision loss.with mil leaving behind strings of victims, the court and aps had to remove her from our home to be permanently cared for at state mental hospital secured wing. my husband was livid and started binge drinking since he got the call from aps and the police last week. i have scheduled for my husband to see therapist which he said he will but i wont know until he actually goes on the date of the appointment. while waiting for the appointment, he fell into this wild thought pattern that its the state's bureaucratic fault for his mother's predicament. he simply wanted his mother to live longer by not letting her take antipsychotics disregarding the fact that his mother unmanaged dementia aggression has left 2 innocents with permanent disability.my oldest son (13) has been in state of trauma from being sexually assaulted by mil (her doctor told us some bvftd patients often act sexually inappropriate) plus witnessing all of her violent episodes. i've been taking him to see child psychiatrist and hoping he can come out of it. meanwhile, my youngest (10) became detached and seeming lost in his own mind which i'm also scheduling therapist for to see what can be done to help both of them.as for me, i'm shell shocked as i watched my family sink into the grim vortex of hopelessness. i, too am talking to therapist because i feel guilty for being a part of my husband decision making not to medicate which end up hurting other people. before mil pushed me down the stairs and threaten to stab me, i supported my husband with his decisions not to medicate. after mil sexually assaulted our oldest, i suggested my husband to give her the prescribed antipsychotics before more people get hurt which he rebuffed. i kept my head down when he told me that i am free to leave, take our kids and go far away because he will never ever let his mother touch antipsychotics. i do not want to ruin my marriage so i kept my head down and quietly took my children and myself to therapy and finding a safe place in the house where mil wont be able to hurt us.when my mil gave the first home care nurse a black eye, i tried calling social services and infuriated my husband who has guardianship of mil that he started calling our mutual friends asking for recommendations of divorce lawyers that will let him keep our house (we share mortgage) so my mil is free and clear to stay in his care. i backed down once more, kept quiet and reassure myself things will be just fine and that my husband acted the way he is because of the immense pressure caring for lo with dementia. as the violence escalated, my husband begin turning blind eye by saying the nurses probably wasn't qualified enough, just out for the money, and deserved it.everything came crashing down when mil gouged the eye of a meter maid. my husband at this point has run out of strikes and the judge wont have anymore of it. aps brought the police to pick up mil anticipating violence which came true. my mil had to be physically restrained for safety.my mil is institutionalized and no longer made us (my children and i) fear for our safety on daily basis anymore but the anguish, fear, guilt, uneasiness still linger like thick and choking corrosive fumes. are there dementia caregiver survivors here that can help with advice on what i can do to put my family mental health back to baseline again? i know we will never be the same and time will eventually diminish the feeling, but for now, we need suggestions for relief in between therapy appointments.thank you!""my husband and i recently visited my mother-in-law in the state psych ward and my husband was not happy with his mother condition. in my eyes, my mother in law looks calmed and responsive to our conversations but in my husband opinion, they (the state psych hospital) over medicate her to a point where he thinks she's not the same lively lady that was his mother.prior to my mil becoming state ward and institutionalized, her frontotemporal dementia manifests serious aggression and violent behavior which my husband refuse to medicate because he's under false belief that antipsychotics causes early death. he doesn't want her to die.because of my husband's decisions, mil sexually assaulted our oldest son (14) which 5 months later, still in intensive therapy and isn't doing well. both our children was so traumatized by mil unmedicated dementia aggression they refused their dad request to visit their grandma. my husband tried tricking them behind my back once into seeing their grandma, but my youngest (11) threaten to call the police on him if he made both him and his older brother (who went into shock and simply froze inside the car) go inside the institution building to see grandma that has assaulted them.now here's the problem. my husband decided to file to remove the state ward with claims of abuse by the state hospital through overmedicating. from where i see it, the state appointed guardian managed my mil care well. she was responsive, alert, and calm compared to where she was prior to being permanently institutionalized by court order.i honestly fear that if my husband is successful in getting mil out of the state psychiatric hospital, my children and i will be back fearing for our safety by him not medicating his mother because my husband has warped beliefs that antipsychotics causes an early death in dementia patients. he is not ready to lose his mom yet did not consider how his traumatized family felt about this.my question is to you guys: how do i convince my husband to trust the guardian judgement and not file false claim of abuse that will also likely incur in hefty lawyers fees due to my mil well documented history of violence and documented testimony that my husband not medicating her the medicine that her doctors prescribed to her to help temper the paranoia, violent outbursts, and delusions.thank you!"," i think you might have to take the kids and leave. if he brings his mom home, it will just be a repeat of those horrible events. he seems willfully blind to just how bad things wete allowed to get.

"i got up last night because i’d forgotten to give the dog his medication and found some soup burning on the stove. my dad wasn’t in the room and it was burnt an inch thick on the bottom and boiling what remained a liquid. i just turned it off, called, “dad, your soup is done.” i knew if i pointed out he’d left soup boiling for who knows how long, it’d just spark his defensiveness. according to his doctor, he’s fine to be home alone, but there’s going to come a point where he burns my house down and then we handle it. in the mean time, i bought a security camera to point at the kitchen and i’m saving for a smoke alarm that alerts to my phone. how do you cut someone off from that type of danger?"," turn the gas off when not in use. switch to induction plates. don't let him use the stove, or only with supervision. i'm sorry i don't have better ideas, that's what i went through and my dad was a great cook. eventually, he stopped wanting to cook once we had established a nice set of meals for him in the care home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f311p7/stove_dangers/,Stove dangers

"i will preface this with a very important note:  i am not at all looking for advice on how to fix my own problems, but rather to ensure in the future they will not affect my parents, or at least sympathy for my situation as i don't want to burden my friends and family with these thoughts. i have tried therapy and medication both extensively, but all the real progress i've ever made has been on my own and with the help of friends, and the progress thankfully continues to be made, albeit slowly, which is why i still find myself unable to be independent yet despite a deep desire to be. as a result, i decided years ago that i will no longer throw money into a system that has proven unable to help me, especially since that money would have to mostly be my parents' for a while still and i refuse to do that to them any longer.time for some background. i am 25, still living with my parents, and my parents are rather abnormally old; they're both in their sixties. my mom was diagnosed with early onset dementia three years ago or so, i can't quite remember. the long of the short of it is, she's still living with us and my retired dad pretty much takes care of her full time. whilst we live comfortably on his social security and his savings and likely can continue to, we can't really afford to move her into a home on his social security, and even if we could i think he'd rather not force her to stay in a place like that. so, that really isn't an option.that brings us to the dilemma i'm having.  i feel really bad that i do this, but the long and the short of it is that i have an extremely short anger fuse when it comes to people and my triggers are many, and all extremely acute; literally one little thing sets me off, very easily, and at that point i have lost all control until i've acted out my anger. my mother, i've realized, is the original source of many of those triggers, and whilst i know she loves me (or at least the person she was loved me), the ways she hurt me in the past due to her very right-wing parental mindset and her own anger issues seem to surface in her more and more often the worse she gets, and if i start hearing anything akin to the sorts of things she told me as a kid that destroyed me inside, i just start yelling, hitting things, and very occasionally even hitting her. i know that's bad, and i know she may be in danger of me really hurting her, but thankfully it hasn't happened yet, and again, i promise, it literally gets entirely out of my control, very quickly, or i'd never do it. preventing the outbursts by avoidance is the only thing that i've so far been able to do that has helped much with those in particular (including many years of different therapists and psychiatrists as i mentioned before), but i don't want to avoid her, i want to be able to help my dad take care of her since i can tell it's hard for him and he's under constant stress because of it. also, avoidance simply won't work with her as she often comes to my room. also, i have decided that moving out will not be in the equation at all until i can move out on my own due to the work i am already doing to earn money doing things i love; for many reasons, mostly mental health, ""real"" jobs simply are not for me, at all. it'd be a whole other post to explain why and why i'll never budge on this again, so i'll just skip over that.        i have done and am continuing to do all i can to stop this, and thankfully i have made some progress and it's not as bad, but i still act out against her. my dad gets angry and yells at her at times too, so i'm trying to not contribute to that but it's very difficult. it also doesn't help that, despite that he loves me and is generally a wonderful person just like my mother was, does not at all understand my outbrusts and tends to act out at me for acting out and telling me to ""just stop it"". i would if i could, dad, i would if i could. i only tell you a billion times a fucking day. i don't know if this is just learned helplessness, but it sure doesn't feel like it; it feels like, again, i simply have no modicum of control when it happens, at all, and may never. all i've been able to do is help it happen less frequently and for less time, and, hopefully, eventually, never again, and thankfully, it's slowly more and more effective, but in the meantime i still am mean to her at times and i'd very much rather never be, starting right this second, though that sadly doesn't seem possible for me yet.&amp;#x200b;advice? suggestions? anything is welcome, and thank you all for reading."," i am sorry you are facing this so early in life.  i am sorry your mother and father are facing this so early as well.   give yourself credit where it is due. you are 25. this is a difficult thing to go through for people who have had twice as many years under their belt.   the human brain doesn't even fully develop until around the age of 25, and here you sit, facing this. contrary to what some people may believe, we don't really exit our impulsive adolescent years until around the time we reach your current age. so, it might help you a little to try and go into this with the realization that as difficult as this is for any of us, you are experiencing this at an age half that of most of us who face this situation.   that being said, here are some tricks that i find help me a great deal when i find myself getting to feel frustrated.   the thing that helps me personally, when i feel that anger and frustration building up is this: smile, kiss your mom on the forehead, and tell her that you love her, especially when you don't feel like it.  for me, the whole ""fake it til you make it"" bit actually helps to curb some of those feelings that can begin to get out of control. once you begin focusing on the negative stuff, it can begin to compound.  breaking that cycle of focusing on the negative by forcing yourself to acknowledge that this is someone you love, and then showing them a bit of compassion is often enough to simply snap you out of whatever it is that is wanting to turn into anger. the last thing you need in your life is guilt over having hurt yourself or anyone you love. allow yourself to take that moment to just stop and breathe, and recognize that as much as it seems like she is acting in a manner to intentionally frustrate you, or doing something that seems totally ridiculous, you really don't know this to be true. do some research on line about the stages of dementia, and what to expect with each stage. this can be really hard, because it can be a bit depressing, but as your mother's condition progresses, you are going to need this knowledge to understand what to expect. there is going to be so much more that you might have to deal with than you could even begin to imagine. she is eventually going to forget everything she knows. her balance will go, she will forget how to walk, feed herself, swallow properly, and she may eventually even simply forget how to breathe.  keep in mind that our brains have around 86 billion neurons, and there will not be any two dementia cases that will be exactly alike. so, understanding what to expect often times means also understanding that you might have no idea what to expect, and when.   one of the things that stands out for me as my own mother has progressed through her trials has been the psychological stress of coming to terms with the changes in our relationship dynamics. as much as i wanted to try and admit that i completely understood that mom was reverting back to becoming a child, and my role was to change to one of becoming more parental in nature, i never initially understood comprehensively what that might entail. it is not as easy to all of a sudden reverse roles, for either party involved. your mother has been an adult, and has cared for you your entire life, and you currently do not have parental experience in your resume'. this ins't meant to offend you by any means. it just appears to be your truth in this scenario. sheltering our children from life's hardships is something most parents just kind of do. add denial, anger, depression, and a slew of other emotions your mother may be feeling about what she is facing into the mix, and the situation can be incredibly unpredictable. try your best to understand what she may going be be going through as well with regards to changes in your relationship dynamics. she is going to have a hard time letting go of the level of control she has had over her own life, and you likely are going to be a bit conflicted about needing to step and play the role of protector when it feels so natural for you to respond as her child. depending upon how fast her condition progresses, this may change suddenly, or very slowly. just know that it will change, and as difficult as it is for you to accept that it is going to change, it will also be difficult for her to lose most of the freedoms we learn to appreciate as adults.  this can be incredibly frustrating for her. try to do your best to understand the stuff that you might do that can cause her to become agitated and stressed as well, because the less agitated she is, the more likely it will be that she is difficult to work with.  here is an example of what i mean by this. i know that what feels natural is to try and get her to try and remember everything she can while she still can, but truthfully, asking her if she remembers when certain things occurred or about specifics of certain past events, people's names, or other detailed information may really be setting her up to fail, and become a bit frustrating for her. none of us like to experience ourselves fail, and failing while attempting to do things we have taken for granted for years can be debilitating. focusing on the moment, and doing activities that she enjoys, and stimulate her mind can be rewarding for both of you. put on some of her favorite music, and dance with her while you can. find activities that are rewarding for both of you, but not overly challenging. learn to hold her hand while she still can appreciate your doing so. simple things. all that stuff simple stuff that really costs nothing, but can give her comfort or just a little happiness can be a beautiful thing for both of you. if she still has enough cognitive ability to tell you about stuff that you have always wondered. now is the time to talk about those things. it is funny, but there are things that i think of now that i really wish i would have asked my own mother, but i simply accept that i am likely not going to know, because she can no longer tell me.  accepting that dementia greatly affects our ability to easily learn new information will help you to realize that perhaps trying to teach her new information and routines is not going to happen, and will more than likely just add to her stress. if you can find it within yourself to try and focus on alleviating her stress, you may find this actually helps your own as well. routines and regular schedules can help. instead of finding yourself feeling as though you should treat her as she has treated you, and doing so realizing that she has hurt you in your past, try to focus on being the protector, and loving caregiver that you would want for yourself in her situation. focusing on the hardships you two have faced, and those judgments that you feel she has placed upon you, can really only bring about feelings of resentment and anger. do your best to put hurt in the past, and focus on being the best that you can be for both your parents, because what is in the past is just that, in the past, and deserves to stay there, but also understand that you are not infallible. we all struggle. you are doing incredible good in reaching out to others with your frustrations, and seeking advice, instead of taking them out on your loved ones. your father is going to need your help, and love through all of this. &#x200b;one last thing, make sure you take care of yourself and give yourself the space and love you deserve as well. this includes knowing your limits. you are 25. there is life still ahead of you, and you deserve good things. there is nothing to be ashamed of in recognizing what is too much for you. we are all different, and we all have our limits. recognizing what those are can prevent a lot of grief and pain for all parties. what you are able to do today, you may not be able to do in years to come, and what you find difficult now, may become easier in time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f2nwg0/ive_realized_im_in_no_position_to_help_my/,I've realized I'm in no position to help my Early-Onset mother and it hurts

have you experienced something similar? if so, what the hell did you do?"," ask around for a doctor that works with older patients.  then call their office and ask if they have any assistance programs, since your mom doesn’t have insurance.  you could also ask her boss to cover the expense.  you should also see about signing her up for medicaid.  if she is low income, she should qualify, even though she works part time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f2fegb/any_thoughts_on_what_might_be_going_on_with_my_mom/,Any thoughts on what might be going on with my mom?

"hey guys,i wanted to thank you all for being here. i have posted from this account and another, and all night i remembered i’m not alone, that others have gone through this. i’m living at home with an overconfident father and a mother who defers to him in all things. she has no will, no poa, no plans, no waiting lists, no activities, no house modifications for safety, no geriatrician even. i had been planning to move out, to stop enabling them to ignore everything. i was going to call elder abuse/neglect before i left to make sure social workers got involved. contrary to popular belief, they don’t care if a caregiver calls and asks for help, the patient has to call. it’s been very frustrating.yesterday i discussed at work and with my gaming group that i was thinking about calling them tomorrow instead of waiting because i really was afraid she’d get hurt before any changes were made. she has balance and movement issues. last night she fell somehow, and couldn’t get up. she didn’t get hurt, but trying to get up hurt her. i was so furious the whole time dad was telling her to do things she didn’t understand to get off the floor. i kept seeing all the things i knew about from nursing school that would have made it easier to help her up that we didn’t have. things that should have prevented falls in the first place. we had nobody to call, no assistive devices. she kept saying she’d discussed it with dad and would not be going to the hospital ever. woman! right now you have no choice in the matter if dad isn’t there! cause she has no paperwork! i managed to mostly keep my mouth shut, waited 7 min past the deadline i’d set in my head and i finally called 911. four awesome firemen showed up. they easily got her up and into a chair, not listening to her protests. i wished i’d called earlier, but i was still afraid of authorities stepping in. i am still afraid of authorities stepping in. i want her wishes to be honored, but they refuse to take any action at all. firemen actually didn’t do any cognitive assessment, so i needn’t have worried they’d take her away. guess they pick old people up off the floor a lot!dad later stopped by my office to say goodnight and said thank you. i once again swallowed all the things i wanted to yell at him and said make changes. he nodded. he’s promised everything before. even when i admitted i was suicidal living here with no security and no plans with all these towers waiting to collapse around us, nothing changed. we’ll see if anything happens now, but i’m not afraid to call now. anyway, i wanted to write and thank you all for being the ghosts in my corner last night &lt;3"," it's hard for families to make changes.  one thing i'd suggest - getting some help and support for yourself.  even super temporary can make all the difference.  when i was driving in, knowing i was taking my father to the er one way or the other, i called a crisis line to find out exactly what the steps would be.  hearing them say i was doing the right thing regardless of the resistance from my father really bolstered me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f1tkmx/thanks_for_being_there_even_though_you_didnt_know/,thanks for being there even though you didn't know :D

"my dad is 58 years old and was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (ftd) a few months ago, a rare, genetic form of dementia that attacks the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, but has been showing symptoms for years now at this point. his personality has obviously been changing, from one of mostly anger and irritability, to now one of almost no personality at all. he refuses to talk or socialize in any social settings now, even with his closest friends and family members. if you ask him questions or try to have a conversation with him, he will give you short answers and shortly become irritated with you. if you try to joke with him, he will take whatever you say super seriously. i don’t know what to do at this point because i feel like even though he is alive, he is already gone because he’s just not present anymore. there’s just so little that he can do. any thoughts/comments/advice for a 22-year-old who’s just trying to bond with his dad in the late stages of his life?"," forgive me if i ramble here are - caregiving is exhausting as i know you can attest.  ideas for how to spend meaningful time with your dad are difficult to nail down without knowing a bit about who he was earlier in his life (& admittedly even armed with such knowledge there are no guarantees of success).  you can try to tailor activities around his prior interests - did he love fishing, woodworking , photography or maybe golfing?  whatever he enjoyed in the past may be worth considering, with modifications for safety’s sake if necessary.  my wife was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia’s four years ago at the age of 56.  in hindsight we have attributed some earlier peculiar behaviour to this condition, and i imagine that your experience is similar.  helplessly watching her inevitable decline has been devastating to me and to our four children.  communication with her has become quite superficial as she loses the ability to express herself effectively, while at the same time becoming hypersensitive to genuine inquiries seeking clarity.  our girls are 18 & 20 and are both still living at home.  for christmas they put together a family photo album, and going through this together, and showing it to friends and other family members has been nice for us.  you might consider a similar project.  speak with your mom or with your dad’s siblings if he has any to get some info on some significant family events that you could ask your dad about.  he may recall them or not, but even more likely he’ll combine events or add elements which didn’t exist in fact, and that’s alright.  just roll with it and acknowledge that his feelings and having positive interactions now are paramount.  lean on your friends and other family members, and continue to post here.  this evil condition leads to a sense of isolation for those whom it affects, so let’s mitigate that by being here for each other.  an earlier comment mentioned theaftd.org , and there are other resources depending on where you are.  here in canada the alzheimer society is a good one.  as a parent to young people in your exact situation i found the documentary “much too young” very interesting (link:  ).best of luck.  you are in my thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f1mefu/how_to_deal_with_loss_of_personality/,How to deal with loss of personality

"hi there, i need some advice, badly.my uncle (early 70s) has alzheimer’s, i’m pretty sure stage 4. i am his dpoa financial and medical. he has no other relatives. he lives out of state for half the year with a companion who is taking advantage of him financially because of drug issues that i just got proof of recently. he is oblivious to these problems. i currently have him in the same state as me for an appointment, although he is not staying with me because there isn’t enough room at my apartment. he owns a house that he is staying at, about 15 min away from mine, and i am dropping by as much as possible. the original plan was to take him back home this weekend, after his appointment. we already have plane tickets purchased. my dilemma is — with his companion’s drug issues come to light, i feel unsafe letting him return home. he keeps asking me about flying back. i know i can technically keep him here, and since he is the owner of the home out of state, with dpoa i have the ability to evict his companion. i know this will anger him because he doesn’t have the capacity to understand the situation. if i do let him go back home this weekend, he will be returning to my state in a few months anyway because he splits his time. pros of keeping him here right now: i am here. the financial abuse can stop immediately. i can get him started in a day program. i can organize in-home care for him. i know he will be safe. cons of keeping him here: he doesn’t really have any friends here anymore. he will feel isolated. he will be angry with me. he will be reluctant to do a day program. he will resent in-home care. i will be overworked. pros of letting him go home: he won’t feel like i’m taking away his independence. we can both put off the inevitable.cons of letting him go home: his companion will continue to take the cash he withdrawals from the bank. he will be isolated anyway because this person is not planning activities for him. i don’t trust his companion to have his best interests at heart. i know the decision seems obvious, but it’s so hard when you’re in the trenches. i’m thinking about what an alz hotline person said to me yesterday, that the goal with this is that he is content, safe, and well cared for. and that “content” sometimes comes in last place. has anyone else had an experience like this?"," can you find an assisted living facility near you for him?  that would be the ideal answer.for money, if he does go home, assuming you are already joint on the first account, open a second account at his bank.  transfer all but a very nominal amount into the second account—don’t leave more than he needs for small purchases (say, $100).  pay his bills online, transferring the bill amount for each bill just before it gets paid from the second account.  put a notification for any withdrawals over a set amount so you know when bills are paid.  evict the roommate.  hire an elder care company (most have a 3-day/week, 4 hour minimum) to come in and clean and make sure he’s got food and nothing terrible has happened to him.these are all stop-gap measures.  you really need him to move to your town, with supportive care.  having him live in your apartment is going to be very difficult.  at this point, he is unable to make good judgements or decisions, including appropriate clothing for the weather, most likely.  it’s all a function of how much money he has for his own care, and how much you are willing and able to spend on it.best of luck, it’s a terrible situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/f0bx9f/should_i_let_my_uncle_return_home/,Should I let my uncle return home

"my grandpa passed away today at home. i wasn’t there, but my mother and grandma were by his side the entire day.in a way, i feel slightly relieved that he passed. not out of malice or hate, but i am glad that he doesn’t have to suffer anymore. it was tough seeing the strain he put on my family and his regression from a caring and happy man to a person who needed to be spoon-fed and couldn’t form sentences. dementia is an awful and terrifying disease.it feels wrong to be going about my daily life after the death of someone who i was close to. he used to walk me to and from school when i was younger, and i vividly remember he always used to draw with me. he was incredibly kind to me. i haven’t had a conversation with him for the past few years because of his dementia. i feel guilty that i didn’t talk to or appreciate him more while he was still truly him. it feels wrong for me to cry, as if i have no right to be upset about someone who i didn’t even talk to for the last years of his life. i feel as though i have to be strong, or else everything else around me will crash and burn.it breaks my heart to see my mother falling apart. she’s always been a very driven, strong, and bright woman— this is the first time i’ve seen her like this. i want to support her and the rest of my family however i can. i’m currently in high school, so i’m at school or studying for most of the day, which doesn’t leave me a lot of time. my first thought was to help by just tidying up the house when i have the time to. is there anything else that i could do to support my mother as she’s grieving?i understand this sub is more about caring for people with dementia, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. i guess i just also needed a community to share my thoughts with, as i wouldn’t want to burden my family or friends with something like this. thank you for reading."," it sounds like you're on the right track. helping around the house, helping with the thank you cards after the funeral, that sort of thing is a huge help. walk-by random huggings for your mom are also probably a good idea to remind her she's not alone.as for feeling relieved, i think that's normal. i lost my mom just over a month ago to this disease. i'm just now feeling the loss, the first day or two were literally just relief for her sake and ours because it was over, then getting through the funeral, then it was just falling back into life. it's only hit me in the past week or so that mom's not there to call or visit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ezk4yh/grandpa_passed_away_how_do_i_support_my_family/,Grandpa passed away.

"my mom has had early onset dementia for around 20 years and is now in the late stages. she also has ms which was diagnosed closer to 30 years ago so at first the memory issues were attributed to ms but eventually it was found that she has dementia as well. she's benn officially diagnosed with dementia for over 10 years. anyway, growing up my dad always had me help her and i guess it just stuck. he ended up filing for divorce when i was about 14 because of how she was acting and treating us all. now i know it's because of the dementia and she couldn't help it but i guess he didn't care. from then on i did everything for her. as soon as i turned 15 and got my permit to drive i was taking her to doctor appointments. when she moved out i would check on her daily and stay with her. when she moved into an assisted living i would visit her and check on her during my lunch break to clean up soiled underwear and pants on her floor as it became a regular thing. a few years later, two days after my 22nd birthday, i was there with her when she was moved into a nursing home. i comforted her while she cried. i continued to take her to doctor appointments, getting her in and out of her wheelchair and into my car all by myself, changing her dirty diapers. i visit now and if i bring her a special food or drink i have to hand feed her every bite and pour every sip directly into her mouth. during all this my brother has briefly visited her about 7 times. that's it. i have a lot of resentment towards my dad and brother for leaving me in this so alone. when i try and bring it up they say no one is forcing me to stay and care for her so it's on me.  i think that's really unfair because they all left her and i was the last one standing. i can just leave here to die alone."," you are not wrong. your feelings are entirely valid. there's nothing like a long term debilitating illness to show you who your family is.my fiancé takes care of his mother, who also has dementia. his brother and brother's wife (a nurse), who live across the street, have come to see her twice in the last year. and only one of those times was to give my fiancé a two hour break.sorry, didn't mean to piggyback on your post. the point is, you aren't alone and you aren't being irrational. unfortunately, no matter how badly you want to, or how angry it makes you, you cannot force them to help. all you can do is let it inform your decisions in how much influence they get to have in your life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/eyw70g/am_i_wrong_for_resenting_my_immediate_family_for/,am I wrong for resenting my immediate family for not helping?

tldr: clients husband is spending money irresponsibly due to worsening dementia and needs card not linked to bank account to maintain dignity and some independence. any suggestions ?hey guys i’m a caregiver for folks who live at home with disabilities or are just older and need a little extra help doing things that need to get done. i have a client/friend whose husband is spiraling down into what the doctor thinks is going to be alzheimer’s and he’s financially starting to hurt them by going over their individual “personal allowances” budget they each get every month. i know there are cards out there for families for children to monitor the money they get and spend that you can add onto whenever you want to and when it’s used up it done and you cannot spend anymore. i am wondering if anyone here uses any type of cards like that for their loved ones that i could recommend for her. he’s even been giving out his credit card info online to those girls who dm him on google hangouts and facebook messenger asking for “help” so they have had to cancel prior bank attached debit cards already., we used prepaid cards for my dad.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ey91pw/financial_independence_card/,Financial independence card
"so last night mum went to bed around 6pm, i was asleep by 9ish.  before she went to bed she was saying she wants to go home.   this is her home and has been for a whilegot woken up at 12.30ish am my a male voice in the house shouting my name.  once i'd realised it was a neighbour who has a key and acknowledged him he went on to say ""your mother is on the roof"".  we live in a two storey with a single storey flat roofed extension below her bedroom window.  apparently she'd climbed out the window, had been out there a while then started banging on the neighbours bathroom window.  after i climbed out and got her back inside she was still adamant it wasn't her home.all the windows have now been locked, to prevent this happening again.  as i understand it this is called sundowning?  are there any good ways of reassuring her that she is at home and stopping crazy stuff like this?"," my mum is always worse in winter, she has only just started believing that we moved to a new home. thankfully she seems very happy and excited about it, only downside is she now thinks i am a male nurse instead of her son. hopefully she will snap out of this bad patch soon, it has happened before. the only solution i have found that works sometimes is playing popular music from her childhood, it seems to transport her back there quicker than anything else, it creates a good distraction from the dissociation. i hope you find a way to alleviate her wandering.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ey8vo9/sundowning/,Sundowning?
"uk hospital post. my grandad has been in hospital 11 weeks this sunday, this is his second stint in hospital since july. they’ve been bouncing him around the hosptial, from ward to ward because they couldn’t find out what is wrong. now he’s waiting to go to the rehab hospital and they’re shipping him off to a inpatient care home whilst they wait. this place isn’t actually in the hospital, it’s 5 minutes away from the hospital. i know that isn’t far, but the city it’s in is a nightmare to navigate and for him, he’ll feel so lost. this stint in hospital has made him depressed and i think this move is going to make him feel worse. he already thinks he’ll die there. i know we can’t even argue the move as it’s inpatient so technically part of the hospital but what worries us is that he could be there ages. this hospital hasn’t been very helpful with us either. they barely tell us anything. they tell him information despite his dementia. they’ve been moving him around the hospital coz they need his bed in the wards he’s been in, they don’t do hangovers (one ward didn’t know he had dementia and struggles to feed himself) and they moved him over the weekend without even calling us to let us know. they also had his phone stolen between ward transfers! i just wanted to rant. if anyone has any advice that would be helpful."," i got to where i'd fight tooth and nail to keep my dad out of the hospital.  every time he went in, he got worse.  they kept his body alive longer by destroying his brain- his sense of self.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ey8ku2/i_dont_know_anymore/,I don’t know anymore.

"my grandfather has been showing signs of dementia for a few years now. he lives in a different contry, and my family wants to bring him over to our house. unfortunately, he made up that beleives that planes are scary, even though he has flown on them before. my grandmother lives with him, but is unable to persuide him either. what can my family do to convince him to come over?he is still generaly sound, and can still have a full conversation, but he is is starting to forget and is sometimes incapable of formulating his thoughts. i talk to my grandparents very often via skype, but nobody in my family is physically able to visit him overseas. the thing that makes everything more difficult, is that he is quite stubborn. he doesn't want to go to the doctor, doesn't want to board planes, doesn't want to do sports, etc. the point is that he needs company, and close people who can take care of him when his dementia develops further. furthermore, a more active life that my family can offer him could potentially limit the loss of mental capabilities. the only way this can be done, is if he boards a plane and comes over to live with my family. are there any techniques to convince such people, or are there places where it would be useful for me to look for help?"," planes and dementia don't mix. i really encourage you to find an alternate mode of transport. i mean commercial planes, economy class. i was able to fly my dad first class to vegas (his 'last vegas', yes, that's a fucking thing).after that, went downhill. do not force him on a plane. you're going to get in big trouble if he has a crisis mid flight, or, if you really must absolutely fly him, have a carer with him, notify the company, notify your doctor, make sure he's sedated. i kid you not. i wish i was kidding.as for convincing people of doing things they don't want - i can't beleive i'm saying this so easily now but lie. you lie. that took me a year to get used to but all doctors begged me to lie saying that if i instead tried to reason, i would confuse him, and therefore hurt him, further. lying isn't always bad. do it only in case of emergencies of course.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/exzyoz/how_do_you_persuade_a_person_suffering_from/,How do you persuade a person suffering from dementia?

"my mum and her gloves:mum has a love hate relationship with gloves. she has had, over the past year, at least six pairs of gloves that she wears. i say wears, but really i mean leaves lying around the house and car. she never truly wears any of them. she will get a pair, put them on, get in the car, take them off and put them in the door, or in the backseat, or the glovebox, or the sun visor or under her seat. and actually she doesn’t really even put them on. she basically grabs a pair and then carries it to the car and then into the door, backseat, glovebox, sun visor or under her seat. i am forever collecting gloves, searching for the matching one and putting them away. last year i got tired of this so i whittled her down to two pairs which i put in the pockets of her winter coat. her winter coat is huge with giant pockets that are able to each hold a pair of gloves and lay them flat against her body so that you can’t tell they are there. but mum can tell. to her these pockets are bulging with gloves. the gloves are so conspicuous to her that she wants to walk sideways through doors, she thinks people stare at her and mock her silently as she walks by. no matter how hard i argue that every person in the northern hemisphere is wearing gloves either on their hands or in their pockets at this time of year, her vanity prevails. “i’m huge!” she cries! “everyone can see the bulges in my pockets! it’s the height of indignity!” so everyday we prepare to leave the house by releasing these huge fleecey beasts from their cavernous bulges of her coat and carry them to the car. (carefully of course; mum’s arms full of giant gloves means she can’t use her walking stick and is therefore extremely tottery as she manoeuvres her way to the car and god forbid i should offer to carry them for her) once in the vehicle the gloves are relegated to one of her usual spots for the duration.today we took a day trip to the city and on the way we stopped at a starbucks for lattes; mum’s favorite treat. however lattes for some reason are never served with a sleeve to protect your hands from the high temperature beverage. mum, who’s body no longer correctly regulates body temperature, always burns herself on the cup finding it too hot to hold. so my husband, in his thoughtful yet accidentally malicious way, suggested she wear the gloves to protect her from the heat. as you can imagine, trying to get mum to wear gloves has become a touchy subject. she doesn’t understand why he wants to her to wear the gloves, but she likes him more than she likes me, so she tries. first the left glove is tried on the right hand. my husband tries to correct her. then she tries the right glove on the left hand. when that doesn’t work she tries the right glove on the right hand but the wrong way round. then the right way round with the thumb in the finger hole. all while holding this latte. after rising levels of frustration and annoyance at our attempts to help, she gets one glove on and tries to drink from the latte cup but she not only has the cup tipped the wrong way, she hasn’t lined up the hole with her mouth and her fleecy gloves are slipping against the cup. i can see that she is going to drop it any moment and my husband who is always in a hurry has already gotten back on the rainy highway and is travelling at high speeds while trying to correct her at the same time. i am trying not to freak out. i’m also trying to help from the backseat knowing as i do so that this is actually making things worse but powerless to stop. mum is just getting more and more confused and irritated about why we are making this so complicated not realizing that we don’t want her to burn her hand or spill her latte. finally i get martin to pull off the highway, where we take the latte from mum, hold it while she puts on the gloves, realizes they are two slippery for the latte, takes them off and stuffs them, not in her pockets as i suggest, but under the seat, takes hold of her latte and finally has a successful sip. she declares it too hot and refuses to drink it."," i love your stories. have you thought about making or buying a reusable cup sleeve?  i know time can be a luxury, but if you sew, crochet or knit it could be a great together activity--go to joann's to find yarn she likes, then reminisce as you make the sleeve.

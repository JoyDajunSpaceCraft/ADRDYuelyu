"it’s a holiday today. i’m home with my two children - one had a massive diaper blowout at the park, the other peed her pants during nap.my father, mid 70s, has dementia but is obstinate about giving up any independence. he fell twice yesterday. my mother, also mid-70s, has her own health problems and is struggling to deal with both of their issues. she’s having a bit of a breakdown today. i do not live in the same state as they do, but have been communicating via phone.i’d like to help as much as i can, but it’s hard with me living away, having two young children and a stressful job, and having worked really hard over the past 5-8 years on boundaries with them (they are a narcissist and enabler, respectively).not sure i’m looking for advice (although i’ll certainly take it), but just wanted to air out my feelings. i know it’ll get worse as they continue to age."," small rant:people love to pretend to care about folksy 3rd world sayings about villages and taking care of each other...but i am a bit shocked at how many people just up and seperate from immediate family.  aging, decline, and death is inevitable.  moving across the country and pretending to be shocked at the clusterfuck of long-distance management is almost funny.it's hard enough when it is local.seems like calling someone a narcissist is some reddit free pass for disregarding a family relationship.  very casual use of that label round here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/vgtn4v/feeling_sandwich_generation_hard_today/,,Feeling sandwich generation HARD today
"so. big fight about moving my mother in law w slight dementia, from sweden to denmark. they (siblings of my wife) finally convinced her to go. day of the move they (siblings) took her phone and tablet. my wife has been unable to talk to her or connect for over a month. sometimes my wife gets email, claiming is from mother, but most likely her sister faking it. they refuse to give address where the mother is staying w my wife's sister. legal system powerless. no one cares about lady w slight dementia. she can move wherever she wants and if she doesn't have phone doesn't indicate anything ""bad"". so what to do? forget that she exists? go to europe and find her and visit unannounced? cannot take her in anyway. so to what purpose?  so i guess just forget. she is most likely brainwashed by siblings after fight about move, so would never admit all is not ok or that she wants phone back. i think only option is to pretend she is dead and move on w life rather than getting caught up in this crazy family. and no, not interested in getting lawyers and investigators and spend years of more fighting. any other thoughts?", doe the country in question have an agency that oversees the welfare of the elderly?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/vgmroq/they_stole_my_mother_in_law/,,They stole my mother in law.

"i need advice. my mother (75) has been very depressed for about 6 years (long story) but over the last 2 years she has dropped so much weight that when i hug her she feels like she is all bone. i do all the things i know to do - ask questions, talk, bring over food she likes, recommend someone for depression counsel.... we have a great relationship and she is honest and open, and knows she isn't healthy. but she won't make changes to get healthier. the stress she endures daily surrounds unresolved bitterness in my parents' marriage (they are still together, living independently closeby). i've reached the point where i feel helpless, she is dangerously underweight, and her mind is starting to show signs of dementia. my dad sees this too, but doesn't encourage her to get better (because of the unresolved marital stuff - she had an affair 30 yrs ago and he hasn't forgiven her even tho they stayed together all this time!). i've talked to my dad and he just doesn't care about her health, says she brings it on herself. i've offered to have her come live with us, but she refuses. it's like she needs to stay in this guilty state of misery and decline until my dad forgives her.  i want to respect her decisions, but literally watching her waste away is sooooo hard and im concerned this muscle loss is irreversible.  i need to know your thoughts on this situation,  reddit community!"," the on,y thing you can do is talk to her. along the lines of mom, i love you and i am concerned about your health. can we talk about it?if she’s given up there isn’t anything you can do. she is mentally sound and seems to have just lost interest. i would encourage a full physical and sit in on the results if she will let you",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/vet8ew/need_advice/,,need advice
"my mother has dementia, and my father is in the hospital. he normally lives with her, but my sister and i are taking turns living with her until they both go into assisted living (in progress).the problem is that my mom drives is crazy. since she has dementia, she asks the same questions repeatedly. i’ve been staying with her a week, and i think she’s probably asked me a question every three or four minutes during our waking hours. they’re usually questions like ‘what day is it?’, ‘is it the 15th?’, etc, nonstop. it gets exhausting, but she notices if you answer in anything other than a straight, sincere voice and gets upset.i take her grocery shopping, and she’s very social. she’ll talk to strangers, and it usually goes pretty well for a few minutes at which point, i get my mom and let the other person continue their shopping.however, on occasion, she’s began to talk to another senior and the conversation goes pretty well. they both just ramble on and laugh a bit. it’s good for both me and my mother (and apparently the other senior).i’d love to find a place that’s like a big room full of seniors chatting where i could go with my mom, let her unwind and talk, and sit off in the corner with a book or just sit, relax and enjoy not being interrogated.i keep thinking of dog parks, and this would be like a senior park. is there anything like this?thanks in advance for any advice."," my mum has had a stroke and is the same. my sister is a doctor and she calls it being ""**disinhibited**"" - lost ability to follow social rules like waiting your turn to speak or realising when you're talking too much. so talkative people will become very talkative. i've also heard doctors use the term ""**impulsiveness**"" - acting without thinking, which i think also ties into the constant flow of chatter, so they are literally just broadcasting whatever is on their mind like a river with the dam removed. this is in my mother's context of a stroke and not dementia (my mother doesn't repeat questions so your mother's issue is clearly on another level), but may help you to know. at least, know you're not alone in being driven crazy by this. it's a tough situation for carers.if your mum has hobbies (e.g. knitting, book club, etc), then that would be a good starting point to get her along to senior social groups based on that hobby? or something to distract her at home, e.g. favourite tv shows work pretty well on my mom a lot of the time. i'm sorry if i sound ignorant about dementia and she is unable to do these things. let me know and i'll see if i can think of other ideas.you must set boundaries for your own insanity too. it's not selfish, it's necessary. if you need to, take breaks. remind yourself this is temporary. you're fortunate that your parents are going into assisted living (a bit envious to be honest as i wish my parents would).",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/vet5wc/please_help_mom_driving_me_crazy/,,Please help: mom driving me crazy

"i started writing but it was a book lol so i decided to keep that elsewhere and write a much shorter hello and concise intro. my husband and i are semi retired working on small property flips. we have no real debt and enjoy a very simple life. he’s 62 and i’m 57. we live on almost 16 acres and have a paid off 3-2.my mil was a fiercely independent woman that enjoyed dancing and being frugal. yes, i think being frugal brought her joy. :)) she lived with us the last 4 years of her life and i watched her slow decline with non-tremor parkinson’s. despite our best efforts she got covid and died at the age of 86 this year. ultimately my husband cared for her the first two years while i was still working and i stepped in for the last two when i retired from corporate america. it wasn’t an easy transition for either of us (mil and me) but we made it work. a month after her passing i learned my parents (both 80) were going to need a place to stay sooner rather than later and that my dad has the early signs of dementia. my sister lives with them and has learning disabilities.  we told them a year and a half ago we would build them something small next door to us. my dad wanted to keep working and wasn’t ready yet. so we focused on one of our daughters. my son lives with us and has asperger’s / anxiety. we bought him an rv next to us (his wish) so that he could have more independence. (early 20’s)my middle kiddo (late 20’s) and her fiancé moved here at the end of last year. we’re finishing up on a small property for them now and they are borrowing the rv until they can move.  (son kept his room with us) my parents live on social security now and my sister on ssi. they’ve always lived for today and haven’t planned any funds at all for their retirement or for the care of my sister. (grasshoppers  through and through!) they are used to eating out daily and frequenting casinos as their entertainment. they have a few funds from the sale of their home and my mom’s car. luckily they listened to us and paid off both their vehicles.  my son is currently sleeping on a trundle bed in our room while my parents and sister occupy the other two rooms in our home. we (hubby and i) are polar opposites from my parents and i’m truly concerned about how we will all adjust. so far … 2 months in and things are a tad rocky. i’ll share more but this is a first glimpse!thanks for the read,geekythinker", you have a lot on your plate!  please look at the link to the right “new wiki section from propita106.”  it’ll give you info and a heads up of things to consider for the future.

"my ils live 6+ hours away. mil (in her early 70s) is competent. fil (mid-80s) has dementia. over the course of covid, my husband has visited a several times on his own. the communication about their future has gone no where. mil refuses any outside help (beyond visiting doctors). she continually claims my fil ""isn't ready"" despite the fact he hallucinates, can be adversarial, and regularly suffers from paranoia. he is much bigger than  her and has already injured her by accident. nothing we say seems to make her interested in being upfront with us about their health or finding a way we can help them long-distance. even honest communication would be something!last year, i asked her what she thought would happen to my fil if she ended up in the hospital (a likelihood at the rate she's going even though she's 12 years younger than him). she told me she expected my husband to quit his beloved well-paying job and move in to care for fil until fil could go to a home. there was no mention of what happens to me or our kids. my husband already ended up in the hospital for a slipped disc. it would not just be disruptive and financially unfeasible for him to do, but potentially physically dangerous for him to care for his father. when i told him what his mom said, he was angry. he tried to talk with her about it, but she just got nasty and shut him down. since that point mil has not given us any direction or information or solid plans. she says she picked a nursing home for fil in case something happens, but really didn't tell us anything about how he'd get in there (just said he's on a ""waiting list""). recently my husband returned home from a trip visiting them. he seemed stressed out of his mind. no information at all. just everyone continuing to get older and expecting us to fix everything. at this point, we've decided that he should quit as poa while mil is still mentally competent and can find someone else to take over. there's a problem. my husband is an only child. there are younger relatives in their town (second cousins), but i'd be  very surprised if any of them would even have a small interest in taking  over. mil has managed to enable fil's weird toxic behavior drive everyone out of their lives—except a  handful of older relatives (most of which have their own serious health issues). but we just can't anymore. we fear when an emergency happens, we will not only ruin our and our kids' lives, but also really suck at caregiving as we don't have the resources or ability to do with without being allowed to find help early in the process (before an emergency happens). my mil has not allowed us any flexibility or resources to make it work. she does not communicate well nor treat my husband with respect. my guy plans to speak with an elder care attorney we found this week to find out how to resign. once we have things set up, he plans to tell his mother. he is heartbroken to do this, but neither of us see any other way out of it.are we being unreasonable horrible people? is there anything we can we do to make this transition easier/kinder for his parents? i read you can hire someone to poa, but that will completely come down to his mother's choice. my husband thinks she's going to be really really hurt and possibly even cut him off for a while. my mil is not leaving us much choice, but we still love them and are concerned with their vulnerability. we feel damned either way.", doesn't poa mean you can make the decisions? so who cares if she says she wants x. you have poa so do what you think is best (if that's a home or whatever).,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/va3zh5/resigning_as_poa/,,Resigning as POA
"for about 12-14 years my fil had been acting odd. i had noticed and repeatedly brought this up to everyone (especially as a lot of his behavior was directed at me), but little came of it for a bit. mil would join fil to gang up on me—even when it was about really absurd things. my husband has difficulty dealing with his parents in confrontations so we'd just leave early when it got to that point. about 3 years ago (several months before covid), my husband was convinced something was wrong and called my il's doctor. fil was sent to a neurologist and diagnosed with dementia. i had to really press mil to even talk about it. she would have nothing to do with my guy being involved in these conversations. he said she'd shut him out. i had no idea how bad it was until i witnessed it myself. i think she is scared about aging and has trouble not seeing my guy as an adult at times. he was trying to get me to be the communicator between her and himself, but it was too much pressure for me. she became confrontational during early covid. they listen to fox news and were not taking covid seriously even though they were both very high risk. i lost my temper and told mil i'd have fil tossed straight into a home if she got ill. luckily, they both started masking up, and they are both pro-vaccine so they did get updated on all their shots as they came out. neither of them got sick. this is what made me realize i just was not in a good place to be a go-between for my husband and his mother. i also hate how it's projected just on women...and i felt his mom was pushing that. i've seen caretaking kill one of my aunts who was stuck coordinating all the care for my grandparents (her inlaws) who were in a similar situation (grandfather had dementia, grandmother refused professional help). i refuse to be put into that position myself. my ils live 6 hours away. over the course of covid, my husband has visited a couple times on his own. the communication about their future has gone no where. mil refuses any outside help (beyond visiting doctors). she claims my fil ""isn't ready"" despite the fact he hallucinates, can be adversarial, and regularly suffers from paranoia. he is much bigger than her and has already injured her by accident. nothing we say seems to make her interested in being upfront with us about their health. i asked her what she thought would happen to my fil if she ended up in the hospital. she told me she expected my husband to quit his beloved well-paying job and move in to care for fil until fil could go to a home. my guy already ended up in the hospital for a slipped disc. i think it would be dangerous for him to care for his father, and he does not want to quit his job or move back to his hometown. we have kids (which she never even regarded in her plans...nor me). since that point mil has not given us any direction or information or plans. my guy has trouble approaching the subject with her as she shuts him down and she refuses to speak to us together. recently he came home from a trip, and i was told it was more of the same.... so we've decided together that he should quit as poa. he's an only child. there are younger relatives in their town (second cousins), but i'd be very surprised if any of them would even have a small interest in taking over. mil has managed to enable fil's weird toxic behavior drive everyone out of their lives—except a handful of older relatives. still, we just can't anymore. we fear when an emergency happens, we will not only ruin our and our kids' lives, but also really suck at caregiving. we're just not in a position to do it well on our own, and my mil is not allowing us any flexibility or resources to make it work. so my guy is speaking with an elder care attorney this week to find out how to quit. once we have things set up, he plans to tell his mother, and he is heartbroken to do this. are we being unreasonable horrible people? what can we do to make this transition easier for his parents? we are considering helping them hire someone to poa, but that will completely come down to his mother's choice, and he believes she's going to be really really hurt and cut him off for a while.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/va3nd4/resigning_as_poa/,,Resigning As POA
"looking for any help out here. i have a mother (69, in ga) who isn’t in the best financial, physical, or mental condition, and is living alone. she currently has no retirement and no assets, so assisted living feels out of the question but would be the best solution (not quite a nursing home but more “hands on” than independent senior living). i’m working with the area agency on aging to get her some “at home” help in the meantime. unfortunately, their elderly and disabled waiver program (which would provide meals, at-home nursing care, transportation, etc) would take all of her income except for $841 / mo (she makes $2215 / mo). this would barely leave her enough for rent / utilities / food for the rest of the month. the person i spoke to said it would “give them the services they would need, but forces them to live in poverty”. so this option feels out of the question, too.they have a lighter “at home” service called the home and community services program (which provides  meals / light housekeeping), and the cost is subsidized (not too terrible at $5/hr)... but it doesn’t include transportation or skilled nursing and has a 3-6 mo waitlist. i’ve at least applied to get that ball rolling, but i’m wondering what our next step would be when the “at home” stuff no longer cuts it. again, her physical health can really take a dip at times, and her cognitive health is waning (she’s fallen for many scams, caves to pressure, can’t remember what doctors tell her, and really struggles to keep up with medicine / appointments)...if she were to go into a nursing home or personal care home, i believe she’d only get to keep $150 or $250 of her income, which isn’t the worst since at least transportation / meals / skilled nursing would all be provided. but the places in her area for these things look awful (rating of 1-3 stars with horrible comments). i would really like to hold on these until the last possible moment...so i have a few questions:1. i’ve heard that some assisted living places take medicaid or hud, but i have no idea how to find those facilities and aaa wasn’t much help here… has anyone been able to get into assisted living using these? and if so, how did you navigate that?2. given the cognitive decline, i’m also getting her evaluated for dementia and alzheimers. are there any special programs to help pay for service for these?3. i live in atlanta, ga, and it feels like some of the nursing homes are a tad better. would it make more sense to look for a “nice” one here, so long as they can provide transportation for doctor visits? on the one hand, i’d hate to alienate her from where she’s always lived, but if it means getting a better facility, it might be worth it to uproot, especially if it means having the peace of mind that she’s totally taken care of (especially if they handle doctors, medications, transportation, etc) and that burden doesn’t fall on me…4. is there a totally different option out there i’m missing? would love anyone’s thoughts who have navigated this.", the biggest thing you can do is move her to a facility close to you so you can visit often. she will get better care when ppl visit frequently re: the squeaky wheel gets the grease.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/v9ivzf/long_term_care_options_for_parent_with_no_assets/,,Long term care options for parent with no assets or retirement?

they are going to get a divorce finally. maybe.   they haven't actually done anything legal towards a divorce but he bought a new place to live but cannot move there until august.  my brother and i are banned from their house, and then with covid we have not seen my mother since 2019. her husband has had a 20yr campaign to isolate her from everyone and he finally accomplished her totally cutting us off in 2020. before we would only speak a few times a year if we called her. she is complicit in not having a relationship with us, it wasn't just him. she really doesn't actually like her children. in the last few months she has reached out to me because her situation with her husband has become untenable. if her life were even slightly better she would not be talking to me at all.  they both are dishonest about their situation and lives so i don't have a good idea how bad everything actually is. he is undoubtedly abusive, that is not in question. i've witnessed it, my brother, her brother, her neighbors, the few friends she has left. no one will get involved because they are afraid of him.he takes the stance now that she is actually abusing him by lying about his abuse of her and has dementia. i would not discount that she cognitive problems. when i talk to her she is different depending on the type of day and tells me things over and over like it's brand new information. i am not sure if the things she says he is doing are real or hallucinations. she had ms lesion/plaque on her brain already 5 or so years ago. her ms is so bad right now the fire department had to come out last night because she could not walk and she will not allow her husband to help her because she says he is too rough. her husband chose to contact me yesterday after 3 years to whine about her abusing him with her lies and refusal to get medical help. he then proceeded to send us a bunch of pictures of her in her underwear crawling on the ground to bed. the fire dept helped her into the bed. we have called and involved adult protective services but because she is coherent while they have spoken to and visited her and she is not being neglected (the no medical care is her choice,) not living in filth, no provable physical abuse and she refuses to leave her home they say they cannot do anything until she makes the decision to actually do something. they have given her contact information and resources but none of it is apparently bad enough to get involved. outwardly, they are upper middle class boomers. he doesn't ""allow"" her to contact anyone. she has to wait until he leaves their home. he had up until recently been working from home so he was rarely gone, he just started going back to the office a few days a week but now he has covid for the 3rd time and is back home. she's not vaccinated so i have no idea how she hasn't gotten it from him yet. i am 99% sure this is all a combination of her ms, cognitive decline and abuse. my brother and i have no legal rights so we're just stuck. i reached out to her doctor today, well i tried. i don't know their name and it's a big conglomerate, and they refused to even me give me the doctor's name. i just wanted to talk to the doctor and tell them what is going on and then me personally take her to an appointment. i am pretty sure she'd sign releases to enable me to get medical information, i just need to get her to see the doctor. the doctor is supposedly going to call me at some point.i really think she is getting to the point that she is not going to be competent to make decisions much longer. her living situation is certainly speeding that reality along - she never leaves her home, sleeps all day, talks to no one, posts ugly negative propaganda to facebook all day long. it'd be one thing if she were posting kittens or uplifting somethings, but the only media she is taking in is all scary and negative. if she really isn't competent and still married to this man, i am guessing i won't be able to do anything. she'll be stuck with him until one of them dies. i am willing to help her. she thinks she is going to be capable of living alone and once the husband is gone everything will be fine. she'll be able to walk and think and rainbows and butterflies. i think she needs assisted living. she is adamantly against this. we went through all this with her mother and her mother's mother. she swore she would never act like my grandma did.. i guess once you need assisted living you apparently can't accept it. she hasn't paid any bills since getting married, she can't order in groceries, she can't drive, she barely can figure out how to use a phone. she cannot live alone. i want to put conditions on taking over her care. she needs to be under the care of a doctor. she needs to either suddenly become self-sufficient in a whole lot of respects or be in an environment that offers her help. she cannot live with me but she is going to have to move closer, i cannot be driving over to her constantly. i am not even willing to do that once a week, maybe once a month but i don't want to do that either really. there are assisted living places within minutes of my home that are full apartments that would be perfect. i would not be removing her from her support system to live here because were she lives now all she has is her husband.    i feel guilty about all this but i know she would not lift a finger to help me if i needed it and she were capable of providing it. she was not a good parent, pretty much ever and honestly i am pissed that i have to deal with all this. this is mostly vent-y i am sure everyone here can relate to some part of my huge nightmare mess.  (i also am apparently in charge of my former step-mother too! because i am the girl, she luckily is in much better shape other than just being in her mid-70's. )", this is just focusing on one thing in your post but people have been profoundly helped by changing their diet when they have ms. if she’d be open to it suggest she goes on the dr terry wahls protocol for ms. dr wahls went from a wheelchair to waking around fine but just figured out what helps people with ms. just search online… it’s mostly sulfurous vegetables and proper fats and proteins.i wish you much luck in this awful situation.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/urtz0y/mother_is_70_hasuncontrolled_ms_in_an_abusive/,,"Mother is 70, has""uncontrolled"" MS, in an abusive marriage.

"i hang out in my garage to get away from my ‘problems.’ i go inside to use the toilet and notice a blanket (from my mom’s bedroom) in the washing machine. just sitting there, not washed or anything. i think maybe my dad put it in there for later. i decided to be a nice daughter and start the wash. a little later. i get summoned by my mom (f75) via remote (simpl - awesome device) to come upstairs. she demands i fix the simpl remote. wtf?? it’s working fine. i finally get out of her that i need to ‘fix’ the tv so she can watch her program. i tell her the simpl remote doesn’t work the tv and i proceeded to use the tv remote.i ask her about the blanket and she says it needed to be washed. when i asked why, she claimed there was poop on it. she could not tell me where or why there was poop on it. she demanded it to be washed and i had to get in her face and tell her it’s already being washed. i asked my dad (m87) about the blanket and he is totally clueless. the only laundry he does are his own clothes. legit. he has no idea how the blanket got in the machine. i ask my daughter (my back up), if she her my mom go downstairs ( we installed a chair lift that is easily recognized upon operation). my daughter didn’t hear anything and suggested my mom walked the effing blanket downstairs. omg!!! my mom could have easily fallen walking by herself let alone with a cal-king blanket!! the blanket just mysteriously’ show up in the wash???my poor mother has vascular dementia. getting coherent needs is a task unto themselves. asking why is another thing. anyway, the stupid blanket is getting washed and i have no idea why or how it got there. thank you for the rant"," oh man, everything in my parents house is a mystery and no one can tell you how anything got anywhere or what the hell is going on. very frustrating. i find myself just not saying anything anymore, to prevent arguments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/urg8zu/the_mystery_blanket/,,The mystery blanket

"i posted here about a year ago: [link](  quick background if you don't want to read all of that: i am 26 and an only child, my mom is 62. she has bipolar disorder and has been pretty unstable most of my life. she had custody of me for two years when i was a kid, but ended up giving up custody to my dad. i saw her every month for a while, but that tapered off in my teen years because she was often in and out of the psychiatric hospital. i see her now every 1-3 years. she wants to move closer to me but i'm moving to a new state next month and we aren't staying there long term (so is in the military). she had lived in supportive house, an adult family home, or assisted living for all of my adulthood.  a lot has changed in that time. i don't have power of attorney, but i am on her advanced directive as her decision-maker if she is incapacitated and have access to all of her medical records. she got covid and was very sick, but made a full recovery. [more info here]( the physical therapists were able to get her up and walking again in the hospital, which was amazing. she hadn't been walking for over a year at that point. i convinced her to go to a skilled nursing facility for physical therapy because the fact that she was wheelchair-bound is why she got so sick. i also really did not want her to go back to the last assisted living, because they were happy to just let her sit in the wheelchair all day and were even using catheters to prevent accidents, which is awful because she is prone to utis. she ended up moving to a new assisted living that i found and that she hates.   the reason i feel so helpless is that she is just an anxious wreck, 99.99% of the time. i have tried to get involved with her mental health team but it is hit or miss if they actually include me. i managed to get in on a zoom meeting once with them but it wasn't very productive. every time i call her she is sobbing and hyperventilating. i can barely understand her half of the time. it makes me not want to call her which makes me feel even more guilty, but there is no talking her down or reasoning with her when she is worked up like this. i know she is driving the cnas there crazy because she is always crying and wandering up the halls asking for medication for her anxiety or screaming and asking for help with things she can do herself, like her television. this isn't her and i know it is likely dementia progressing, even though her entire family is in denial because her memory is still sharp. i feel like she might need to be in a memory care facility but it would make her feel even more awful because she is still more with it than other residents would be. i feel like even if i got more involved, there is nothing i can do. i feel like an absolutely horrifically terrible daughter. i am about to graduate nursing school and i'm letting my mom rot in some assisted living facility she hates. i know mentally that i could not care for her at home and it would severely jeopardize my mental health and marriage. just trying to help her from out of state has been really really hard on me mentally. her sister has said it is an absolutely terrible idea to try to move her in with us. i just don't know what to do. i know this comes across more like just a vent but i could really use some advice from others who have been in a similar situation."," safe is your priority for your mom.  is she safe? yes.  happy is outside of your control.  sounds like you did some looking before choosing the place she’s at now.  you can look again, but my bet is you’ll see that she’s at the right place.  that her upset is the disease, not the place.  the cnas are frustrated?  reach out to them.  thank them for caring for your mother.  send them a case of fruit, chocolates, a heartfelt note.  send pictures of the woman she used to be.  ask them for updates.  they may see some intermittent positive moments.  and they will take more care knowing that you care about her and that you appreciate them.  you might try a similar campaign with one or more members of her mental health care team.  make them see your mom as who she was, and to connect you with her as her healthcare advocate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/uqk9ci/only_child_feeling_guilty_and_helpless_mom_in/,,"Only child feeling guilty and helpless, mom in assisted living with mental illness and behavioral disturbances"

(although it was transferred to my name in 2015, which puts it past the medicaid look-back period, my mom refuses to have anything to do with medicaid - and honestly the medicaid funded options in my area are absolutely subpar and i wouldn't put a dog in one of those nursing homes if i could help it - my aunt is already in one and it's dreadful - so it's the least attractive option, though it is an option.)mom refuses to even consider the option of selling her childhood home.  and under our state law, the house (though my name is on the deed as ""owner"") cannot be sold out from under her without her consent because she has life estate.however, the law also states that the life estate holder (my mom) is solely responsible for the upkeep of the property during her lifetime.  as i said, she's broke.  she cannot afford critical repairs to the house that are looming.  she has basically misspent her money on relatively frivolous things like a new fence (not needed) or a prettier new window here and there, or glass block windows for a basement she never goes in, etc.  she continually demands i pay ""my share"" of the lawn mowing, yard cleanup, plumbing in the bathroom that only she uses, or whenever she wants the handyman to come by and plant some azaleas.  that sort of thing.so, while she scrapes up enough cash to pay the taxes every year, she's not got the funds or even the understanding that she is (not we are) responsible for critical maintenance of the property.  and we've got a roof replacement looming.  she has zero funds to pay for that and did i mention she refuses to borrow against the precious childhood home because ""she might lose it to the bank""?my question (which i never thought i'd have to ever ask) is: do i have the option of suing her for not taking care of critical repairs, and more importantly, what legal recourse do i have to get her to agree or to force her to sell the property?  i feel like the only option here is either for me to (a) spend my life savings on in-home help for her or for assisted living, or (b) vacate the premises, get an apartment, and watch from a distance as she continues to implode and also trash the property, eventually calling aps on her (and realistically aps usually does nothing in these cases).  note- i do not live in a ""filial responsibility"" state.i'm resistant to finding an apartment only because there is a shortage of apartments in this area and i would be forced to move to an inconvenient distance away from both her and my aunt who is in nursing care and has no one to look after her (the nursing home is horrible and being investigated by the state, so that's a whole nother ball of wax for me to deal with).""take out a home equity loan to pay for care"" -- see above, can't do that without her permission.""apply for medicaid"" -- see above, the only possible option is medicaid funded in home like pace but the person has to be approved for nursing level of care, and my mom probably won't need that until she falls down and breaks a hip or something (she's fallen 7 or 8 or 9 times now, i've lost count).i can't see any way out of this that doesn't involve suffering/injury for her and and/or losing the family home.  is there something i'm not considering?"," i would agree that suing her would only cost you dearly and likely not produce the desired result. i would also agree that speaking with an elder care attorney about conservatorship and likely guardianship would also be prudent. the attorney i hired to represent me in the petition for both required a letter from a qualified physician stating that my dad was no longer capable of caring for himself due to poor judgment resulting from chronic alcohol abuse. i had to pay the attorneys fees and expenses for this as well as the fees and expenses for the court appointed guardian ad litem who represented my dad. once i had a doctor in my corner, the entire process from hiring the attorney to prevailing in court only took 4 months. mind you it took over a year, one near death experience, two hospital stays and several life saving procedures to finally get a physician to agree that he could no longer live on his own, but we got there in the end. my dad is also a narcissist and is completely out of touch with reality of his situation. the geriatric care manager may be able to refer you to a doctor in your area specializing in geriatric care. best to you and good luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/uaruwm/hate_to_ask_but_do_i_have_to_sue_her_in_order_to/,,Hate to ask but: do I have to sue her in order to properly care for her?

"dad is 78, in an alf, been there for 6 months (been my responsibility for 1.5 years now), made no plans or preparations for this time of his life, it's become my problem, no other family to help or ""block"" this constant interaction, and he has major depression/anxiety issues that pretty much affect him like he has dementia.i'm just at this point where i don't know how to respond to him anymore. i've tried all the things people have suggested for me to do and it never works. be kind, be understanding, be agreeable, deflect, ignore it, yes them to death. nothing works.i get these daily phone calls. same conversation every time.him: ""oh, just calling to say hi.""me: ""hi, what's up?""him: ""you won't believe how crazy it is here. it is just so crazy!"" proceeds to tell me how (for example) the staff went in his room to look for him because he wasn't in his usual spot, complains about having to wait to get in the dining room for his meals, there's too many people, then there's not enough people. you name it, if it's mundane enough, he'll complain about it.so, today i instantly just say nothing and let him go on and on. for one, i don't want to hear it. i replied to the staff looking for him with, ""well, they were just doing their job and making sure you are ok."" that pisses him off and i get a, ""ok then! well, you have a nice day. bye."" this is what i deal with constantly. no matter what i say, it's not good enough. or i don't say enough. what am i supposed to do in this situation?he lies about dumb things or completely over-exaggerates. i don't directly call him out about it, but i'll maybe ask a few questions (like a lawyer would do lol) and now he's outted himself and realizes it. again, then i'm the jerk. when i go to his alf, he's like a damn celebrity. he knows everyone, knows the other resident's family, the staff love him and tell me how great he is. why do i get to deal with the manipulative liar?? the person who makes sure he's not living on the street and gets taken care of properly. i don't get it.i know he's bored, i know he feels like he's lost his independence, i'm sure he worries about how things will progress with him physically. i've tried over the past year to help with things like boredom and letting him do things on his own. nothing sticks. nothing works. i've done it all from hiring companions to giving him little jobs to giving him things to entertain himself. he won't entertain himself. it's like he's just waiting and wants to be ready for his life to change and doesn't want any distractions from that...he seriously used to think one of the nurses or companions would take him home with them and he'd live a regular life again. when do you get to a point of acceptance? he's been in facilities for 1.5 years now. thanks for reading this rambling. i know i might sound awful, and i've posted on here before...i never have good days with him. it's always sad or irritating. i feel bad for getting to this low point where i'm about to be like, ""fuck it. what's the point."" any advice or insight appreciated."," this might sound counterintuitive, but . . . be mean. not a lot, just a little:""i don't have time for this bullshit, dad. if you're going to complain about trivial stuff and lie about things i can easily verify, don't call me.""""i'm not your nanny, dad. make some friends and live your life. don't call me every day.""my thinking behind this is that it can *cause* anxiety when people are too accommodating, too nice. it's infantilizing, and it makes you feel like a child, or a mental case who needs delicate handling. it's crazy-making. if he's not in complete dementia, treating him like an adult with agency might inspire him to act like one. his boredom is his problem to solve, not yours. maybe ""mean"" isn't the right word, but blunt, or honest. if you're not being honest with him, why do you expect him to be honest with you? what do either of you gain by continuing a charade?also, you don't have to have his approval. you're holding yourself hostage. if he's safe, fed, and medically cared for, you've done your part. it's up to him to make his own life good. he needs to grow up and realize that he's not going to live forever, and start thinking about what he needs to do to make what's left of his life meaningful. actually, we should all think about this long before we wind up in a facility, but it's never too late to start. if he's religious or believes in a hereafter, he  would do well to prepare himself for that eventuality. i suggest reading *being mortal,* by atul gawande. both of you should read it. after all, in a few years, you'll be in his shoes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/u4f9qk/i_dont_know_how_to_respond_to_the_endless/,,I don't know how to respond to the endless complaining/exaggeration/lies anymore.

"**key facts**between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22%.by 2020, the number of people aged 60 years and older will outnumber children younger than 5 years.the pace of population ageing is much faster than in the past.all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready to make the most of this demographic shift.**overview**people worldwide are living longer. today most people can expect to live into their sixties and beyond. every country in the world is experiencing growth in both the size and the proportion of older persons in the population.by 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years or over. at this time the share of the population aged 60 years and over will increase from 1 billion in 2020 to 1.4 billion. by 2050, the world’s population of people aged 60 years and older will double (2.1 billion). the number of persons aged 80 years or older is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050 to reach 426 million.while this shift in distribution of a country's population towards older ages – known as population ageing – started in high-income countries (for example in japan 30% of the population is already over 60 years old), it is now low- and middle-income countries that are experiencing the greatest change. by 2050, two-thirds of the world’s population over 60 years will live in low- and middle-income countries.**common health conditions associated with ageing**common conditions in older age include hearing loss, cataracts and refractive errors, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, depression and dementia. as people age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time.older age is also characterized by the emergence of several complex health states commonly called geriatric syndromes. they are often the consequence of multiple underlying factors and include frailty, urinary incontinence, falls, delirium and pressure ulcers.**factors influencing healthy ageing**a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole. additional years provide the chance to pursue new activities such as further education, a new career or a long-neglected passion. older people also contribute in many ways to their families and communities. yet the extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on one factor: health.evidence suggests that the proportion of life in good health has remained broadly constant, implying that the additional years are in poor health. if people can experience these extra years of life in good health and if they live in a supportive environment, their ability to do the things they value will be little different from that of a younger person. if these added years are dominated by declines in physical and mental capacity, the implications for older people and for society are more negative.although some of the variations in older people’s health are genetic, most is due to people’s physical and social environments – including their homes, neighbourhoods, and communities, as well as their personal characteristics – such as their sex, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. the environments that people live in as children – or even as developing fetuses–combined with their personal characteristics, have long-term effects on how they age.physical and social environments can affect health directly or through barriers or incentives that affect opportunities, decisions and health behaviour. maintaining healthy behaviours throughout life, particularly eating a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity and refraining from tobacco use, all contribute to reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases, improving physical and mental capacity and delaying care dependency.supportive physical and social environments also enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity. the availability of safe and accessible public buildings and transport, and places that are easy to walk around, are examples of supportive environments. in developing a public-health response to ageing, it is important not just to consider individual and environmental approaches that ameliorate the losses associated with older age, but also those that may reinforce recovery, adaptation and psychosocial growth.**challenges in responding to population ageing**there is no typical older person. some 80-year-olds have physical and mental capacities similar to many 30-year-olds. other people experience significant declines in capacities at much younger ages. a comprehensive public health response must address this wide range of older people’s experiences and needs.the diversity seen in older age is not random. a large part arises from people’s physical and social environments and the impact of these environments on their opportunities and health behaviour. the relationship we have with our environments is skewed by personal characteristics such as the family we were born into, our sex and our ethnicity, leading to inequalities in health.older people are often assumed to be frail or dependent and a burden to society. public health professionals, and society as a whole, need to address these and other ageist attitudes, which can lead to discrimination, affect the way policies are developed and the opportunities older people have to experience healthy aging.globalization, technological developments (e.g.,in transport and communication), urbanization, migration and changing gender norms are influencing the lives of older people in direct and indirect ways. a public health response must take stock of these current and projected trends and frame policies accordingly.**in doing so, age-friendly practices:**1.recognise the wide range of capacities and resources among older people;2.anticipate and respond flexibly to ageing-related needs and preferences;3.respect older people's decisions and lifestyle choices;4.reduce inequities;protect those who are most vulnerable;5.promote older people's inclusion in and contribute to all areas of community life.6.pay more attention and company.if there is no time to accompany them, you can buy digital picture frame

"this going to be a long one, so apologies in advance.the start of all of this was march 2020, my mom was living alone in a very rural part of new england, slowly slipping in and out of mental clarity and unable to either recognize, or admit the severity of the cognitive slippage. this didn't become clear to me till my mother was placed on furlough due to covid-19 shut-downs at her workplace, and came to me for help purchasing and setting up a cheap smart-phone, and forwarding supervisor updates from her microsoft outlook account to her gmail. she had no pc at home, and had been relying on the local library computer, and a flip phone to stay in contact with her employer. with all of the local libraries closed, no internet access at her home, and no cell reception in her neighborhood (again, an extremely rural part of new england) plus no landline, she needed help trouble shooting, and fast. connectivity was immediately necessitated so that she could stay up to date with furlough requirements, and continue checking in with her supervisor.i helped her find an affordable smart phone and a hot spot near her house (just doing some basic googling from across the country gave me a decent map of where she could go to log-in to xfinity hot spots) i then tried to grab all of her login information and start the process of forwarding the most pressing emails from her outlook account to her gmail. that is when it became apparent that she had not been operating at full mental capacity. apparently the local librarian near her house was holding her usernames and passwords at the local branch, and mom had no idea how to access any of her accounts without that specific librarian's help. she was also too ashamed to admit this to the tech department at her work, and insisted that we try to guess her passwords for many hours, unsurprisingly we were locked out due to suspicious activity... later i would find out, that due to the confidential nature of mom's work with clients, it was specifically against her company's tech policy to forward her work emails to a personal account, and that the local librarian having access to her logins was a fire(able) breach as well. she also had an extremely hard time learning and retaining the basic operations of her extremely low barrier to entry consumer cellular (specifically for aging persons) cell phone, and began to call me from a neighbor's landline three or four times a day for basic operating instructions, how to charge it, which button turns it on, etc. she'd almost immediately forget these details.eventually, due to the severity of her tech handicaps, and the increasing level of anxiety and fear about losing her job, i crossed the country to get her set up. this was after two weeks of spending multiple hours with her on the phone, and little progress made. when i got to her house i realized what kind of issue we actually had. the house was in a state of squalor, rodents and bugs. laundry was in black trash bags in her room. there was no food in the refrigerator. the freezer was full of banana peels, bags of fish bones, and eggshells, basically she was freezing food scraps, to eventually bring to the compost center in town, but never was doing it... she'd dropped weight down to 90 lbs, this is a 5 ft 10 lady.i immediately began to suspect something neurological was going on, what clinched it was her car accident 8 days into my visit, she'd gone for a ""drive to release stress"" and ended up taking out a portion of a neighbor's fence, when she misjudged the distance between the passenger side of her car, and his property. the car was totaled. she then admitted, she'd been having these kinds of accidents more and more, but ""i shouldn't worry"" because ""these accidents wouldn't be going on her driving record"" since she was wasn't making insurance claims, she was settling with the recipients of the property damage in cash, and paying out of pocket for autobody repairs.after the accident i contacted her primary care physician and got three referrals, one to a neurologist, one to a neuropsychologist, and one to the radiology dept. at the local hospital for an mri. this was incredibly difficult, as it was in the middle of covid, but i made it happen. the neurologist suspected wernicke's syndrome, but it was eventually ruled out, he had no other insights. the neuropsychologist gave her a battery of tests, and identified slippage in working memory, attentional resources, and heightened levels of anxiety and paranoia, but couldn't offer a specific diagnosis. the mri revealed white matter irregularities consistent with severe white matter disease, but her pcp wanted a specialist to weigh in before issuing an official diagnosis.2 years later, and i'm still at her house. it was decided that she would stop working, and could go to live with my aunt in nc, she could sell her house, and live off of social security and the home sale profits down in nc. my aunt had graciously agreed to put her up in the spare bedroom rent free ad infinitum... the only catch was - that in order to sell her house, it needed fresh flooring in the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room, as well as a complete bathroom remodel, and interior/exterior painting, that's where my elbow grease has come in handy as i've taken on her remodel myself. mom's entire savings was and is $11,000.00 to survive on for the rest of her life. her disability has rendered her incapable of learning new skills, so there are no job prospects for the future.here is where i need advice, 4 days ago my aunt threw in the towel and decided having my mom there was way too stressful. she didn't have the grace to tell me in person. she just bought my mom a one way ticket back to her house (where i am) for a few weeks from now. the kicker is, in my mom's irrational state, and high paranoia, she's decided i'm the enemy. she's accused me multiple times of plotting against her, and when we are in the same house her rants turn vitriolic. the bummer is that, she also won't admit that the white matter disease, and cognitive decline are an issue, she is chalking her previous problems up to the stress from being put on furlough and facing job insecurity during covid, she says she is fine now.so here i am expecting my mother to arrive in a few weeks, the house is not completed or ready for sale, she now has nowhere to live on the horizon after the sale of her house. i only have a few thousand dollars in the bank and a small apartment waiting for me back home in oregon, so i don't have the space or resources to house her. my brother has an extremely modest income, and has told me that he doesn't have the patience to help her when she gets ""erratic"" which is more and more often.i've looked into asking another one of her 5 siblings to help her, but they either live out of state, so i have negligible relationships with them (have only seen them at weddings or funerals, a couple times in my life) or they are in the state i am currently in, but family relations have broken down over the years. mom has thoroughly alienated them with her ""erratic"" (my brother's word) behavior. i've also looked into ssi insurance to help her since she is now physically disabled, the catch is that she refuses to admit disability, as a matter of pride, she also refuses to see anymore specialists to determine the underlying cause of the white matter disease (ms?) the only way to access ssi insurance would be to have her disabilities fully documented, something she has not completed.i am doing my best to help my mom, i'm aware that she might lose her house, her only asset, and her ability to survive if i don't figure this out. i'd like to approach some other aunts and uncles to ask for help, but i'm not sure how to do that. i'm not even facebook friends with them, in the 2000's before the dementia like symptoms, she already had a diagnosis of disordered personality (dependent personality disorder, with gad, and borderline as co-morbid disorders, diagnosed by a previous therapist) which alienated our nuclear family away from the extended family...if she loses all of her resources and ability to attain income, and she can't find a way to get along with the family, it seems logical that as she deteriorates more, she could become an adult ward of the state and be placed in a medicaid funded nursing home, the medicaid funded nursing homes in my area are regularly cited for violations, and the average senior placed in one passes away between 6 mos to a year post placement... i have no idea what to do...anyway, sorry this was so long, any advice or perspective would be much appreciated. thanks.", i'm so sorry you are living this! i have an idea of how awful it is. it seems like power of attorney might be vital for you and for her. her doctor can give the affidavit form and then it is filed. once you have this you can act in her best interests which sounds like a hospital for

"my parents are going through some rough times, arguing on a daily basis and my father wanting to divorce and leave. it is all around my mother's infidelity which happened more than 50 years ago.it's not new news, this came out decades ago already, we talked about it as a family and all this time it seemed like my father got over it and forgave her. but in the last few weeks it seems to have suddenly exploded with my father, with fits of rage and jealousy and him wanting a divorce and to leave. my mother doesn't want to split up, thinks it's unwarranted and irrational after all these years, and that it would be bad for both of them. but together they're making each other's lives miserable.they are in their 80s, so both advanced with their ages. neither are really independent, so whilst it could be an option to go through with the divorce and live separately, it would be a huge upheaval for both, for me to provide care for them and would probably mean both going to live in some assisted living arrangement. and i can barely cover my bills, working and studying at the moment.impossible to reason with him though, seems like he's stuck in a groove and can't snap out of it. it's driving me and my mother insane.anyone gone through something similar? any advice?(crossposting here for too. someone in r/relationship_advice mentioned to check out for dementia, so i will get onto that as well.)"," my dad constantly talks about 2 events that happened in the 1980’s where he claims my money was cheating on him. she wasn’t, but every few months for the past few years he fixates on this. sends me and my brother tons of texts about and will only talk about it. i’ve told my mother he needs an evaluation. she says nothing is wrong with him. my brother doesn’t care and is out of state and says it’s not his problem. idk what to do either. if they refuse to have and eval, what do you do? i’ve just sort of put my head in the sand. it gives me so much anxiety to deal with them when they act normal. i just can’t deal with this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/tq1ay4/dealing_with_older_parents_their_potential/,,"Dealing with older parents, their potential divorce and their ancient infidelity drama"

"like so many here, dealing with a difficult parent. mother is 83, divorced from my dad 35 years ago, remarried in her 80s, second husband died a few years ago. have a difficult and distant relationship due to her behavior throughout childhood and then also as an adult. shes made terrible financial decisions her whole life, culminating in deciding to move a giant household of crap from tx to sc ""to be near family"" who didn't want her 8 years ago. she expected my brother to take care of her and her husband, despite our stepfather being an almost stranger to us and that he has his own kids in il. since he died shes gone downhill, several health problems, was hospitalized last year and her health and cognition declined rapidly. she is literally malnurished due to multiple abdominal surgeries and her poor appetite. she was sent home and i flew to sc (i live in wa) to stay with her for a week. her house was filthy, bug infested, cats not cared for (skinny, fleas, untenable litterbox) and cats had toileted all over the house. i cleaned, i hired caregivers for daily help. my brother lives there but hes really really busy, and also my brother cared for our oldest brother who died young of cancer and then our dad who had alzheimers and lived with my brother and his wife for 5 years. my brother also lived next door to his in laws. he told my mom flat out she should not move to sc he could not take care of her. but she was butt hurt since he took care of our dad and did anyways. we hoped being home and recovering from her illness would let her get better but her cognition slips more and more. shes no longer safe alone. she can't take her meds correctly, she doesn't eat. she pays lip service to eating but secretly is happy shes thin and let it slip a few times she doesn't want to gain any weight. no insight into teh fact shes literally malnourished. i also think she thinks she ate (remembering eating yesterday) when she hasn't. she finally (with much drama, yelling ""get out of my house and don't come back"" etc etc) agreed she needs help, agreed to move to assisted living. because of her health issues she has a chronic wound and won't be accepted to assisted living in sc. she could move to wa and they would take her here. plus i'm a health care provider and i know stuff and can help her arrange care. since she has no money (many years of squandering it especially buy a crapload of stuff that fills her house) the only reason this is an option is the housing market gave her some equity in her house. but it needs emptied, it needs repairs and its not going to sell for top dollar until shes out and its fixed up. she initially agreed to make my brother poa but is now freaking out saying were stealing her stuff. she thinks she has another house somewhere with more stuff in in ""and shes not going anywhere until she goes through it all.""she thinks her lifetime of collected totchkes and junk is valuable and she ""has to get someone in here."" she can't dress herself anymore.  its constant arguing. we went through 2 weeks where she insisted she was not in the house shes in. she keeps saying ""no i also have a house at 123 mystreet"" and when i tell her thats where she is she says ""no! i'm at that place by the lake!""  i can no longer pay for caregivers, its costing a lot. i considered putting out my own money to get her into a facility here and then taking it back from house proceeds but as my husband points out, without one of us being poa she doesn't have to pay me back and honestly with her personality i could see her not doing it plus her cognition. finally got the dr to take me seriously about her cognition but can't get an appointment with neuro to get a test and diagnosis until late march. my brother is having to go twice a day to give her her pills because even with a pill organizer and reminders she skipped doses, took the wrong doses, takes the meds out of the box, sets the on the table then never takes them. shes furious he took her drugs and thinks she can manage them herself.  i'm very close to pulling caregivers, calling aps for self neglect and asking the state to apppoint a guardian."," i am so sorry. get her to the hospital. pull the care givers. then get her declared incompetent.  this way you can then get a poa to do what is needed. sell the house in as is condition. also, you don’t mention it, but those animals are being abused. the harsher way is to call animal control and get her arrested for animal abuse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/t1rece/mother_issues/,,Mother issues

"my dad (64) has had dementia that was clinically diagnosed about 3 years ago (lived a hard life). on christmas day, he fell and broke his hip. sadly, he ignored the pain until a week later (new year's day), when he called me and said he hadn't moved since he got home. he was taken in an ambulance to a hospital in ny where he has now been for 53 days. after his hip surgery, he basically fell into a near-coma state, where he couldn't speak at all for close to two weeks. the doctors are adamant that he didn't have a stroke, so they are uncertain why he has declined so rapidly. since then, he has been able to speak, but what he says is totally nonsensical. i talked to him tonight, and he told me he couldn't talk because he was ""in traffic driving back from connecticut"". he doesn't know where he is, what year he is, who is, or why he's even in the hospital. he has been taken off a feeding tube, but is fed via spoon pureed meals. he hasn't moved his body since he got there, let alone gotten out of bed. the hospital is eager to get him into a long-term care facility, but spaces are far and few between. has anybody experienced this situation, and what the future holds?"," anesthesia can advance dementia, this is why it’s important for doctors to be informed prior to surgery and for the caregiver/family to ensure that anesthetics that are less likely to cause problems are used. they typically give narcotic pain medicine following this type of surgery and this can also be causing his disorientation. falls, surgery, and hospitalization also commonly advance dementia. plus, hospital delirium may be in play as well. what i’m saying is that there are a lot of reasons for him to not be doing well. it would probably be good to get him out of the hospital as soon as possible and into a rehab facility and to then tell them to stop any narcotic pain meds (such as oxycodone). has he been participating in any physical therapy at all? he needs to be participating in therapy and improving (even if it’s small improvements) in order for a rehab facility to accept him and keep him and have it paid by medicare. otherwise, you’re looking at him going into long term care (with no rehab) and having to pay for it himself or getting on medicaid. this would be disastrous. get him into a skilled nursing facility for rehab and get him off narcotic or sedating meds. he can’t live independently anymore so you need long term plans (know where he’s going to go and how he’s going to pay for it when the rehab facility says he has to leave.) i hope this helps. the hospital social worker should be helping you but they are often overburdened and are sometimes lousy. your dad needs you to advocate for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/szya89/dads_broken_hip_whats_next/,,Dad's broken hip--- what's next?
"i’m in my early 30s and my father is in his mid 60s. he had a stroke 3 years ago, and started showing symptoms of dementia about a year later. as his physical health improved from the stroke, his judgment, memory, and temperament started declining. simultaneously as all that was going on i also started becoming more and more angry about my childhood. i figured that i’d probably never get any apologies about anything about my childhood, but not that my father has dementia i know that it’ll never happen. as an adult i haven’t had the closest relationship with him as an adult, but to be fair i’m very standoffish and distant from everyone. i feel like i should be empathetic about his situation, but i’m not. all i can think about is how miserable he made me as a child. i was pulled out of public school to be homeschooled in the 3rd grade, but my parents barely taught me anything. i denied a basic education and socialization from children my own age for no real reason except for my father being a narcissist and thinking he could educate me better than the school district but he never really attempted attempted to educate me. i also have a few memories that i barely thought about previously, but recently i can’t stop thinking about. when i was in my early teens my father attempted to groom me over a few weeks, then a short time later tried to convince me to take a shower in front of him (view my post history if you want to see the full story). at the time it seemed kinda weird, but the closer that i get to bring his age at the time of the incident i realize how inappropriate that was and it makes me hate him more and more. i try not to dwell on the incident, but it keeps popping back in my head, nothing actually happened, but the more i think about what he attempted the angrier i become. so at this point my father has been in an assisted care facility for a year(a pretty nice one i might add) and i only saw him once since he was admitted. he doesn’t have access to his money, a phone or a computer. he doesn’t have a phone anymore because he kept calling 911 on the staff over trivial or non existent problems. he’s always felt that he’s the smartest person in the room and even though he has dementia and is aware of it, he still feels that way. and the police are the only thing that he tries to use to gain control. i feel like i should feel bad about his predicament, it’s basically like he’s living in prison with occasional visits from my mother and sister. but i don’t feel bad about his situation, i just feel bad about not feeling bad. i know this has been a long rambling drunk post, but i’m curious if anyone has experienced a thing that i have or if i’m just a sociopath?"," you’re not a sociopath, you have a right to be angry. you also have a right to personal peace. talking to a therapist would help. he doesn’t deserve your sympathy or empathy, but you do deserve closure. best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/syybam/is_it_normal_for_a_parents_declining_health_to/,,Is it normal for a parent’s declining health to reignite anger and resent about your childhood?
"so i replied with something similar to this in another thread on this sub but i wanted to hear if anyone else has had different results. my mother (80) passed last year from cancer. before she did, she was pretty much incapacitated from a hip replacement due to a fracture in cancer riddled bone. she was a very difficult individual all of her life and became much more so with illness. no dementia so no way to have her declared incompetent. however, she essentially refused all outside help and was demanding round the clock care to the point that my father and i didn't get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time for nearly two months outside of those times she was hospitalized.we were at the end of our ropes and truly unable to safely take care of everything she needed by the end. each time she was at the hospital we would communicate this to the doctors and social workers. and each time they sent her home anyway with nothing more than a list of services to call despite us explaining that she wouldn't accept the outside help. we tried hiring people and refusing to do all of the care while that person was available but mom would scream and refuse help form them to the point that they all felt they had to immediately hit for liability reasons.we tried eps who again just gave us lists and also pretty much said that as long as she was in the house we had to care for her if we couldn't keep other caregivers there. not that we wouldn't have cared for her just that we were trying to see if there was a way to force her to accept even a modicum of outside assistance before one or both of us had a psychotic break due to stress and sleep deprivation. the answer is that there is no way unless they are declared incompetent.the point is, pretty much every post suggests handling a difficult elder by telling the doctors, social workers or eps that they aren't safe at home like that is some magic bullet that will fix things and it's not. the hospital is not going to keep them more than a few days extra, they are not going to force them into rehab or care, and they are going to expect anyone that is resident in the same house to see to it that care is provided no matter what the situation."," i could’ve wrote this post myself as i’m currently going through it. mom left skilled care on saturday. she is basically bed bound, on oxygen, and can’t take care of herself in the least. i went over all of this with the discharge planning team and they still released her. now it is tuesday morning and she’s back in the hospital. i don’t know what the future will bring and i am very scared. i have called all the resources i am aware of. even got aps involved at one point. i just don’t know what to do other than leave her to her own devices, which seems cruel and possibly deadly. hugs to you all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/susnaa/the_home_situation_is_not_safe_advice_is_not_a/,,"""The home situation is not safe"" advice is NOT a magic bullet"
" dementia changes lives. even though the disease is gradual, no one is ever ready for the impact the disease has on family relationships and responsibilities. as a grandson, i was flattened by my grandmother's diagnosis a few years ago.i had a strong connection with her. her distinct sayings, lessons, cooking and laughter are forever ingrained in my brain. we are bonded for life, despite the fact that she has recently passed away.my grandma lived in italy, so, unfortunately, a lot of the burden fell on my dad. while we all had an inkling something was wrong, we mostly assumed it was normal ageing. we had no idea my grandmother would go from being a seemingly independent, vivacious and driving woman; to an entirely dependent old child in less than two years. but once the doctors diagnosed her with dementia, it happened this fast. maybe she was truly lonely without her sister, who was her living companion and passed away a few years before her. still, she became old seemingly overnight.when i was asking my grandmother for her address, she used to give me the exact address of the home she lived at as a child. i felt like i really got a chance to know a 'younger' version of my grandmother. she told me about life with her sisters and when she first started dating my grandpa. it was pretty sweet.and here comes my regrets.i wish i had listened to more of her life stories. i wish i had recorded some of them to re-enjoy them now she is gone. i wish i had kept some of her memories to pass to my children. this thought had become my obsession in the last few years when i realised that my memories of her were slowly fading out.i am a software developer, i have co-founded several tech companies in the past, so i decided to put all my knowledge at 'dementia cause' service. i recently founded a company that helps people maintain the mental well-being and the brain activity of those with dementia by applying the reminiscence therapy methodology. i aim to create a support tool that facilitates conversations with our loved ones and transforms those conversations into an archive of audio recordings to treasure forever.we got overwhelming feedback from single people, and we are now trying to scale a bit, but we don't have an extensive network. the reason i am writing today is to ask for help to reach more charities, associations, care homes or support groups to pilot it. of course, the app is free, and we won't charge anything for it. if any of you have relevant contacts and are willing to make an introduction, please, dm me. happy to provide any further information.**🙏🙏🙏🙏**thank you in advance for the help.", is there currently an app for individual people to use?  or is that still in development?sounds like a wonderful tool.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/st7hgz/need_help_to_reach_charities_and_associations/,,[deleted by user]
"hi everyone,wanted to get some guidance from the community on my parents current situation. got both parents into separate alf in 2021 after a long battle to get them out of their houses. it was a major win and my father (80/dementia) appears to be transitioning nicely. my two sisters live 5-10 minutes from both facilities and i live roughly 1 hour away. while my mother (70/severe dementia/copd) seems to like the alf facility, we struggle with a few different items. she has copd level 4 and requires breathing treatments 3 times a day + having a rescue inhaler always with her. because of her severe dementia, she constantly loses the rescue inhaler and the alf nurses just aren’t able to stay on top of her needs. the dementia also causes her to lose things (remote, shampoo, etc.) in which she calls all of the family throughout the day asking for help. she also has many appointments that she has to attend and it is tough on the family to take time off of work to help get her to the appointments. on top of this, she recently fell and broke her hip and is currently in a rehab facility struggling with getting her proper medication. the family (3 children) are doing our best to manage the nursing staff, appointments, mothers needs/asks but it doesn’t seem to be working great. we are constantly having to ask the nurses at the alf why things are done incorrectly or get random calls from our mother that she can’t breathe. plus the dementia makes it very difficult to explain a situation to her without her getting upset. i am going to move out of state in the next two years so my wife can be closer to her family/older parents but i want to put a plan in place prior to the move. the current set up seems very reactionary and not sustainable long term. my question is, would it make more sense to interview caregivers to help my mother at the alf facility to help with inhaler/dementia/errands/appointments? or would it make more sense to look at a nursing home versus alf facility? my sisters are against the caregivers as they feel like it will mean more people to communicate with versus actually helping. they also don’t want to move her from her current alf facility because she is so close to their current housing. but the current situation feels like a fire drill every week and is wearing on all of us. i am stuck because i feel like there are better solutions to help our situation versus us doing everything ourselves. open to any suggestions, thanks for listening."," i'd say she needs to be in memory care, which most assisted living facilities have. assisted living is doing the laundry and cleaning the home really. it's very limited in terms of care especially with dementia patients. i would look into that or a nursing home or skilled nursing, depending upon her level of care. the case worker at the rehab may have suggestions on what level of care she really is. assisted living will take anyone willing to pay. memory care can offer more support depending upon the facility. nursing homes are more regulated by feds/state and offer the option of some medicare (from what i hear) payments. this is a good rundown of each type vs each type:  [ and this one [  if you're happy with her al, and they have memory care, consider moving her. if not, it takes a lot of reviewing, visiting, etc. to find the right one. good luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/ssqp10/assisted_living_additional_help/,,Assisted Living + Additional Help

"i've posted a couple times. my dad is in an alf with mild/moderate dementia. he can still do mostly everything physical for himself. his short term memory isn't that bad, but his perception of time is. i've been having monthly meltdowns over the responsibility of making sure he is taken care of. i have waves of emotions that range from anger, to guilt, to resentment. it hasn't been an easy year for either of us. since it's just me and only me dealing with this, it gets overwhelming juggling my screwed up life and his. i've became his everything and that made me extremely uncomfortable. i did my best, but he ran me into the ground. i ignored everyone telling me to take a break...maybe i ran myself into the ground. regardless, i felt awful for yelling at him over his paranoid, rapid-fire calls. i got mad at myself for correcting him when he has no idea what he'stalking about. my irritation at his neediness turned into more of an irritation at myself for not being more kind and loving. i realized you can't force these things.i told him he can not call me multiple times in a row for something that isn't an emergency (and yes, he realizes he was calling multiple times). he needs to wait for my return call. i told him that i myself have health issues, i have good days and bads days and i cannot be smothered by anyone. i reassured him that i love him and will make sure he is taken care of. i will do what i can for him when i can. i apologized for him being in a situation he doesn't like, but that's the hand he was dealt. he cried, the phone call ended. i felt a slight weight lifted off like i got something huge off my chest. i also felt like an asshole, again. why can't i just suck it up and let him run rampant over my emotions and life during the last years of his? no. i matter also. i remind myself if i don't put my mental health first the whole ship is going down.i called him today to say hi. he was in a pissy mood. i got the ""oh, thanks for calling,"" that was kind of dig like he was expecting to never hear from me again. i haven't seen him in almost 3 weeks. i offered to send him some groceries and he accepted with the tone he's living in a desert wasteland and has nothing. he has everything he needs; he just wants more. i feel a tinge of acceptance. ok, this is how things are going to progress. after a year, there's still no acceptance on his part. i don't know if that'll ever happen. he might be pissed at me and think i'm cold, but i'm preserving myself for the both of us. thanks for reading. and don't be like me, give yourself a break."," this is so sad, both ways. how often do you see him?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/sld09e/i_finally_had_the_boundaries_talk_with_my_78_yr/,,"I finally had the ""boundaries"" talk with my 78 yr old father yesterday.

"my dad had a stroke in late 2020. i traveled back to south america to help him recover and after 3 months he was able to mostly live by himself again. one of my siblings who does have a bit of a mental illness moved to the house next to his to keep him company and keep him safe. in late 2021, my dad fell and broke his hip. the doctors didn't notice the fracture and for ten days he just laid in bed. he didn't want to call another specialist or anything. finally, another specialist saw his x-ray and noticed the fracture, so he was moved to a hospital. in the hospital, he had a terrible experience. they waited for 7 days until his prosthetics was requested, another 7 days for the request to be approved (while being in isolation due to covid restrictions), and finally another 7 days to get the surgery done and be discharged. in that time, he lost a ton of weight and i think he suffered delirium due to the bad care he received (it'd take nurses hours to come and give him painkillers and once he had to spend more than hour before he was changed after having done number 2). after he was out, he spent about a week living again with my sibling who ended up quitting and just leaving because he couldn't care for him. my dad was refusing food and water and suffering constipation as a consequence. another sibling brought him to his house and pushed him and was able to eat a little bit more and drink a little bit more water. he spent there two days before going to a good recovery center (basically, an alf that is also equipped to treat people recovering after surgery). however, my dad is still refusing food and water. he always finds an excuse to not do stuff (e.g. the doctor said i should drink tea and they haven't brought the tea, so i cannot eat until then. or he says he is drinking and eating when he's not doing it as much). he's been in pain because of cramps in his stomach because he doesn't eat or drink as much as he needs, and of course fails to have good bws as well. he doesn't sit supposedly because of that pain which also means he's not recovering from his surgery at all.what can we do at this point? should we ask the center to call a psychiatrist and see what is wrong? is it possible this is dementia? when we talk to him, he says he does want to recover and do all the stuff we've planned (like coming to the us for my phd graduation) but at the same time, it just all feels like he's saying stuff, so we don't tell him what to do, but he's starving himself in the process."," i'm a bit confused about where your father is living now. the hospital seriously messes old people up (unfortunately your dad isn't that old). i think we were told one day in a hospital needs a week of recuperation out of the hospital. that's about a year for your dad.  delirium is all too common too and hardly ever dealt with or diagnosed. in my dad's file during his extended hospital stay it said he has dementia, which he doesn't! if your dad hasn't eaten in so long he might need to get iv nutrients for a while to get his stomach active again because it seems like it's shutting down. it's a pretty serious issue especially if he isn't drinking. you should def talk to a doctor about it asap and push for force feeding / iv feeding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/siu0a5/parent_is_not_recovering_from_a_hip_injury_and/,,Parent is not recovering from a hip injury and seems to have mentally decayed significantly.

"my parents are 82 and 83. mom has copd, neuropathy, incontinence, and has been in a cycle of hospital, rehab, home, rinse and repeat, for the last three years. she is not strong and has had numerous falls, usually related to a bout of uti or pneumonia. the falls so far haven't resulted in anything more than compression fractures in her spine, which cause her pain even a year later. her mind is fairly good, unless she's having a bout of illness.  dad has psoriatic arthritis, with damage and severe pain in his feet and hips, some sort of heart issue he hasn't told us much about, and some level of dementia that has mainly affected his executive functions. he takes medications that depress his immune system and lives in a state with a high number of covid cases, but still goes out every day to the store, to eat out with friends, to be the chauffeur for an injured friend, etc., etc. they're both vaxxed but at their age, that doesn't mean as much as it does for younger folks. and we can't persuade him that he should exercise caution in regard to covid. when he was at the er a couple of months ago, he called a friend who was 8 days from a covid positive test to pick him up, rather than have my brother who lives 1.5 hours away come get him.  they live in an apartment complex, in a state that just got two feet of snow. i talked with dad during the snowstorm, and oh, yes, he wasn't planning on going anywhere, they were safe and didn't need anything. the apartment complex had a team of workers clearing snow constantly during the heavy snowfall. but the next day, my mom tells me that he decided he had to go out to buy a snow shovel, to clear off the walkway! 1) the apartment complex will do that! 2) dad has no business trying to shovel heavy, wet snow at his age! that's part of why they moved to an apartment!  and mom also tells me, proudly, that she talked to her friend who is as old as she, who uses a rollator instead of a walker. and mom decided she would switch from her walker back to the rollator that is in their closet. no! aghhh! my husband and i tried to remind her that her physical therapist told her not to the use the rollator, that the four wheels and turning action make it too quick and unstable for her. she needs the greater stability of a walker, with only two wheels, which don't rotate, and the tennis ball back legs which glide. she was furious that we weren't proud of her and insisted that it has been ""fine"" for the day that she's used the rollator. yes, it is fine, for days or weeks, until she falls once again, and it's only a matter of time before one of these falls results in a broken hip or worse.  i am powerless, living states away. the visiting nurse association social worker (no longer on their case unfortunately as they timed out and are now with a long-term charity instead) insisted that they work on getting the frail elder waiver so they can apply for medicaid, and then get medicaid to pay for a home health aide to be in the home for more hours, to enable mom to stay at home rather than go into long term care. they agreed to do it, but wouldn't let me run the paperwork, and so it is taking for. ev. er. it will move forward soon, but in the meantime, they make bad decisions all the time that are dangerous or wasteful and so on.  i don't know if i'm venting or asking for advice. my brother and i know that honestly, it is time they had almost full-time care or were in a facility, but they are \*just\* coherent enough that no judge would give us guardianship yet, and they won't agree to go into a nursing home yet. and i get it, no one wants to leave their nice home and their things and live in a facility, but then, please be smart and don't do crap that makes it more and more likely you'll be injured or sick, okay?!?!?"," i struggled with this a lot with my father, until he passed away and to some extent with my mother still. about four years ago i moved back to this small town to take care of them because they couldn't manage anymore but couldn't admit that.with my father it was a lot more pronounced, i had to go through the process of taking over a lot of activities he didn't want to give up (driving being the most obvious), while at the same time understanding that feeling like he had no control and being useless would make him really miserable. a lot of times i had to let him take a measure of risk, and find ways to give him autonomy and appreciate the things he could do. it was increasingly difficult as that he had dementia that was eventually diagnosed as alzheimers. the advice i have is admittedly difficult, but don't think of them in terms of making poor decisions. they are making decisions the best they can sometimes, but pick your battles and give them as much freedom and acknowledgement as possible for the ones you can't win anyways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/sh3zbx/so_frustrated_that_they_keep_making_bad_and/,,So frustrated that they keep making bad - and dangerous!

"according to the most recent doctor's notes, my mom has moderate cognitive impairment from vascular dementia. we did not know this was an active diagnosis from her md, so had never discussed it. (long list of factors how this seemed to happen; better for another post.) i live about 300 miles away from my mom, so i have begun spending  brief, intensive visits with her each month for the past 3 months. these visits have been very focused on what she needs right now, whatever the urgent issue of the day is. on the last visit, she was complaining about not being able to keep her own meds in her room in the al. (relevant - she got to the al because she was not taking her meds properly for a long time and ended up in the hospital a few months ago.) as she calmed down, i sat down with her and asked if we could talk about something. she made eye contact with me as i told her about her dementia diagnosis, that although she has been complaining about memory issues, this diagnosis means it's more than just simple aging, and it makes it hard for her to make safe decisions for herself, etc. after a couple of minutes going back to how she knows how to manage her meds, and me trying to direct the conversation back to what i said to her and if she understood - she looked at me directly and asked ""so, why are you telling me this?"" i answer ""because i don't want you to think that i am lying to you or hiding anything from you. you have a right to know what is going on with your health.""and, she said: "" so, what am i supposed to do with that information?"" ......it was not a question i had thought about how to answer. i was not prepared for it - i was prepared for her arguing with me, maybe being upset about it. it was a great question. it was a heartbreaking question. i told her ""well, i guess you don't have to do anything. but, i've been honest with you about it, so i guess that's it."" and she went back to complaining about something else. i suppose it would have gone differently if we had the discussion a few years ago. it just really stood out to me that at *this* time, at *this* level of impairment, the label has no meaning to her anymore. i am still stuck in thinking about this more than feeling anything about it. i'm wondering about other people's experiences. maybe it will help me figure out my own feelings."," so i found this post because i have you tagged as a ""friend"" in res.  i think from /r/atlanta and i recall we lived in the same neighborhood oak grove / briarlake area.  i'm in tucker now, none of that really matters though.what does matter is what you were / are going through.  i went through the very same thing in 2016/2017.  my dad, who lived by himself in south georgia, had been living with chronic myasthenia gravis, but was in otherwise ok shape for 81.  in late october of '16 his condition turned worse suddenly and he spent a night on the bathroom floor because he could no longer stand.  his housekeeper found him the next morning and called an ambulance.  he was admitted to the hospital and after a cardiac incident in the hospital and five weeks in icu, he died.  my sister and i spent almost all five weeks with him.  meanwhile, back in decatur, our mom, who had been dealing with severe chronic pain from multiple back surgeries due to ms.  about 8-10 years prior though, she was diagnosed with around an 80% occlusion in one of her carotid arteries.  the surgeries were very major and left her with painful scaffolding hardware in her back.  additionally, recovery from the anesthesia alone seemed to take weeks.at some point around 2014 one of her doctors mentioned ""vascular dementia"".  mom was a nurse and nursing instructor and had some inherent disdain for physicians, so she dismissed these warnings (but knew something was wrong because she would buy these 'memory enhancing' products she'd see on tv.)right around the time dad went into the hospital, my sister and i realized mom couldn't be alone 100% of the time.  i had been buying her groceries and taking her to most appointments for a year or two but she was still driving occasionally and that scared us (and probably everyone else on the roads).  she got lost once and also ran into another car in a parking lot.  she went to an atm and paid the car owner $800 cash to not report it.  (just like her stepdad did 20 years ago.) but she was terrible at keeping secrets and i was paying her bills, so we found out.  so we had to have ""the talk"" with her about no longer driving.  that went badly.  much crying and yelling.after dad's funeral, we knew that someone visiting daily was not going to be enough.  she needed overnight assistance.  mom was always terrified of assisted living places and nursing homes.  (rightfully so in my experience). we desperately wanted to keep her in her own home, with her cats.  the one saving grace in the whole sordid affair was the fact that she had **long-term care insurance** which i highly recommend.  we filed a claim.  i expected to get pushback from the company but no, it was pretty easy.  a visiting nurse came by and determined that she could not accomplish 2 or 3 of her adl's by herself, so that engaged the policy after a waiting period which i think was waived because she'd pretty much been in that shape for months.the ltc policy did not pay enough for 24/7 care, but it did pay enough for 4 out of 7 days.  as it happened, my sister had cna experience and was unemployed at the time, so we calculated what we paid the cna's and paid her to stay with mom (my sister is from nc) when the regular cna was off.  (btw, we did not use an agency, my sister met this cna doing shopping for another client, so we paid her cash, but kept records to submit for reimbursement.)anyway, her vascular problems only worsened.  an ablation from a few years prior helped, but edema had returned with a vengeance.  we had to cajole her into wearing the compression boots when seated.  all the while pain from the surgeries worsened to the point where she had to take oxycontin on a daily basis.  we talked to her doctors and they said that at this time addiction was the least of her issues as long as it kept the pain at bay.we'd been to the er four or five times in the 18 months prior to her death.  they were each singularly miserable and terrifying experiences for her.  finally, on the day she entered (home) hospice care officially, a visiting nurse (tasked with setting up the hospice care) had said her bp was dangerously low and and she needed to go to the er.  mom was still lucid (enough) most of the time and insisted that she was not going to the er again.  she knew what that meant, i knew too and i called my sister.  we all agreed she should stay at home if that's what she wanted.  she died about six hours later.there were moments in the weeks and months prior when she 100% knew something was wrong in her head and asked us to explain what was happening.  we did, and she would understand and be thankful for a little while.  i'm glad she had some moments of relative clarity, not everyone does.i still suffer from guilt from the death of both of my parents.  i second guess so many decisions and point out to myself how i could have done this better or that better, or if i had only stayed another weekend instead of going home for a few days that i could have changed the eventual outcome.  (i couldn't have).  i experience guilt from being frustrated and brusque at mom when she was having bad days.  either my sister or myself were with her *every single day* during her last nine months.  somehow, my brain still says ""you could have done more.""oh and did i mention my marriage of 20 years collapsed during this period?  not because of this, but it didn't help either. tl;dr: vascular dementia is a bitch can just as bad as alzheimer's.  nurses make terrible patients.  buy long-term care insurance now.  talk to your loved ones and family now about what you want done for yourself.  fill out an advance directive now. consider therapy for your own sanity for what you're enduring now.i hope your situation doesn't get any worse.  i know her condition is unlikely to improve, but know that even on the days she fights and screams, she still loves you and that person appreciates everything that you do for them.pm me if you ever need to vent about it.  hugs./sorry for the great wall o' text.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/sgrojb/if_your_parent_has_dementia_did_you_talk_to_them/,,"If your parent has dementia, did you talk to them about their diagnosis and what it meant?

"my mother is 64 with decades of mental illness. when she was younger she had more emotional problems but as she has aged it has transformed into issues with her thinking (paranoia, panic, delusions). the paranoia is especially acute at night, to the point she cannot be alone at night and we have to have in home aides from 10-7 every night ($$$$$).in the last 4-5 months she has spiraled:police picking her up when wandering to get away from her home which she feels is unsafe (it’s an independent living facility that is like fort knox - i can’t even get in because they won’t issue more than one key fob per resident)multiple trips to the mental hospitaltotaled her car in october and is not driving now (thank god)3 trips to er in the last two weeks because she felt panickyphysically, she has had health issues as well. some of these we have discovered in trying to get her evaluated and helped. they are:stage 3b chronic kidney disease with more symptoms manifestinghigh blood pressure (shoots up to over 200 systolic at times when she is in an episode) - fairly well controlled when she is not in an episode chronic utis which seem to be related to urinary retention. every time she goes into the hospital she has a uti. they really seem to accelerate the delusions and paranoia. we have a bladder study and follow up urologist appt in the next two weeks, but it has taken two months to get these appointmentsa ct scan revealed that she has emphysema. she doesn’t seem to lack of oxygen saturation, but we are waiting for an appointment with her primary care to discuss the results.her mental acuity seems to be fuzzy at times. she has difficulty with anything with complex planning involved, and sometimes i think her ability to grasp and understand medically information is lacking…but her memory is ok. i worry about dementia but i can’t tell if her brain is just foggy from medications and urinary tract infectionsshe doesn’t have mobility issues, she can cook (though doesn’t do a good job of planning her day around meals or the forethought it takes to shop and cook), she can shower, dress, and physically can do the activities of daily living. but emotionally and mentally she cannot run her life.in your experience is assisted living a fit for these kinds of limitations? would they take her? i think having a structured environment that cleans the house, feeds her, has staff available for when she is freaking out, and provides transportation would help her immensely. because she is unstable and i have a five-year-old i do not feel comfortable letting her live with me", it sounds like the utis could be part of it. they can cause people to be paranoid. if that could be fixed it might help ease other issues. best of luck,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/sf9rwo/is_assisted_living_the_place_for_mom/,,Is assisted living the place for mom?
"i need help! knowing what are my next steps here... i have a stage 4 cancer and am 43, the only child, only nearby living relative, the only person able and willing to take on the job of managing her affairs for now...my widowed mother has finally started showing serious signs of dementia this past 16 months or so; forgetting conversations, getting lost on the way to familiar places, forgetting to pay bills even with constant reminders. lot of self neglect; house is a hoarder house with trash piled hip deep, no heat, no running water, no food in the house, no microwave, stove, refrigerator, hot plate... no working toilet... she hasn't showed in over a year, gets by on a couple sponge baths weekly. hasn't done laundry in over a year, just rotating through 2 or 3 outfits and hanging them outside ""to air out.""sometimes she forgets where i live, or gets lost on the way to her favorite grocery store where she's shopped for 20 years. her license has been revoked for several months now. she had chances to get it reinstated and i tried like hell to hold her hand and walk her through it but she just couldn't get it done. had almost 3 months to study for the written test and couldn't light a fire under her own butt enough to do even that much.so now she's been driving every day on a revoked license. she lives in a town 30 miles away from where i live, and she'd understandably much rather come ""bother"" me daily than sit out in her hoarder house in the middle of nowhere being bored and lonely. problem is she's a danger to self and others, driving 90 minutes round trip daily minimum, on a revoked license, so of course she keeps getting pulled over and ticketed. i believe last night was the 5th or 6th time she's been ticketed, but the 3rd time an officer from her hometown has called me at 10 or 11 at night to say; ""hey we have your mother and we hate to ask... but if you guys can't come get her and her car and her dog, we're going to have to impound the truck ($700) take the dog to the pound ($150+) and take her to jail ($$bail??).""besides it being physically tiring as a cancer patient to put my plans for getting some rest on hold and driving a near 2 hour round trip at 11pm, it's also a bit mentally exhausting to never know when you're going to get that call.i've gotten her a good local lawyer to handle the tickets and court hearings, and got a case open with dhs/adult protective services regarding serious self-neglect.the thing is, she's deeply in denial... she will sit there, confronted with proof that she just forgot something she used to know, or a conversation we had 30 seconds ago... and she obstinately will not admit that her memory and function is anything other than perfect. and when you confront her on it, she'll make up a blatant lie and claim to believe it 100%.for example i asked her, if she's such a great driver, why does she weave in her lane? and she instantly came back with ""it's driving accuracy practice..."" and spun me some bs about how her old driver ed teacher used to have students practice driving in different portions of their highway lane to avoid potholes and hazards on the street. i tell her it's illegal to do that and we go back and forth with a lot of ""no it's not-yes it is..."" conversation ends in stalemate, no matter what approach i take.all i want is to get her an ok apartment in town, and a home health care person who can take her to run errands a couple three times a week. she's got insurance and she's got over $4000 a month in retirement and nearly $2000 in ss. so honestly she might be better off if i can find her a little studio place and someone to help out, than a nursing home. she's not so far gone that she can't eat a bowl of cereal or safely microwave a burrito. i think she still has some time before she needs to be in memory care.the problem is, she will not have that conversation willingly, i don't know how to get her to have that conversation.  i tried to take her keys from her last night and she shoved me away and ran into her house and locked me out. yes i probably could physically take them from her but i would probably cause her some bruises in the process and might have to technically commit some assault, battery, breaking, and entering to get it done.everything that i need to do to take control of hear situation and get her someplace safe and healthy, she is going to hate, fight me on tooth and nail, see it as unnecessary and the vilest of betrayals by an ungrateful devil child who has inexplicably turned on her...i'm fine with that, i'm ready to do what it takes", ask your attorney about applying for guardianship. they should be able to walk you through the standards and process.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/serwl2/just_got_83_yo_mother_out_of_jail_i_need_your_help/,,Just got 83 y/o mother out of jail...

"no advice needed, just venting.we use an agency that comes by in the morning and at night to administer pills. one of the evening pills will zonk you out till kingdom come. we arranged for a minimum of 9 pm. this pill will immediately put you out. earlier this year we noticed that they started coming earlier and earlier (like 7:30), so we complained, as dad will get up too early and think it's still evening and get super confused. well we got a new evening person, who, after a few weeks, started coming in at 530! we noticed when we'd visit dad he'd be out like a light, so we checked the security cams.we complained again, they said they'd work it out with her. but she calls my elderly father with dementia and tells him  that life is super hard for her, she's working two jobs and can only do the pills in between them etc etc. my brother was hesitant about complaining again because he feels for her, as she's a woman of colour and struggling financially etc. i'm sympathetic and all but making him go to bed at 530 drastically affects the quality of his life (especially for a sundowner), not to mention the fact that she's doing it unasked and then calling my dad directly to complain?! not exactly ethical.long story short, i'll be the one administering the pills from now on.

"sorry in advance if this seems jumbled, i’m a little sleepy and shaken up. my dad has short term memory issues/possible early onset dementia. he was prescribed meds for his memory but won’t take them.after my mom died the probate attorney told me to get financial and medical durable poa for my dad so we did. he has no wife or anything. he has a close friend - i’ll call her lisa. more about her below.i worked my whole life to move away from my toxic hometown and my dad supported me a bit through college (i had full scholarship but he supported my housing costs), so i definitely am just feeling obligated to help. however i’m applying to med school and my schedule is packed and difficult right now and will likely be difficult for many years. it has also come to light that my dad has been financially irresponsible and owes the irs $100,000. so here’s what happened today:my dad calls and talks to me for an hour about politics, his pets, how he wants to take a trip to hawaii. he never asks me about my classes which kinda hurts me a bit but i guess he doesn’t remember what i do.then later i get a text from lisa saying he has no money, is in a dire situation, doesn’t eat except for cheap snacks, the water was turned off, he can’t bathe, is trying to sell a property but there’s lawyers trying to take the proceeds to pay irs debt. she’s been paying his electric bill and he’s been using a fireplace only to keep warm. lisa is basically telling me i need to support him financially but i don’t want to give him too much money and get tangled up in this mess and enable him. he has tons of junk, old cars, property, that he should sell before i give him my money that i need to pay for education right? he’s not asking for my money - but i’m feeling guilted into it.*should i cancel/revoke my poa’s? i’m scared of taking on too much responsibility.* i work and study a lot and can’t deal with lawyers calling me all day and i’m scared tbh! my mom died by suicide 2 years ago and i am depressed and still grieving.the thing is that my dad also gets mad when i ask questions, he’s very secretive, and won’t give me any info about finances. so idk what to do, any advice is appreciated. thanks if you read this far."," sorry about your situation. it sounds pretty shitty. i do feel in posts like these, it helps us to help you by at least know what state you’re in (or in this case, your dad). the levels of help and assistance vary greatly from state to state.that said, as others have said, i strongly urge you to get a lawyer and a therapist. you mentioned college/applying to med school; does your alma mater have legal services for alumni? also, legal services association (either where you live or where your dad lives) should be able to help, as it sounds like he qualifies no matter what state he’s in. likewise, if you don’t have insurance/deep pockets you might have to dig around, but there might be free/cheap/sliding scale therapy services where you live. also, have you looked for aging services organization, again either where you or your dad lives?finally, i want to commend you for at least writing this post and feeling at least obliged to help. it isn’t easy, and helping difficult parents like this is really hard, so thanks for what you’ve done already. best of luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/s9x5ji/62_year_old_dad_in_a_bunch_of_financial_trouble/,,62 year old dad in a bunch of financial trouble and idk what I should do to help (I’m 27) from out of state
"hello all, i've posted in here a few times about my mom.  she has dementia and back in october of last year she had to go into a hospital because her break with reality stuck around (for many days) and she was posing a risk to herself and my father/her husband.  she spent 2 months in a geriatric psyche unit to get her stabilized as best as possible.  they did a good job and she's now in a memory care unit.  she's been there 2 weeks.  she had a visit from the doctor's office that visits that nursing home.  i got a call from the office wanting to talk about our request for a hospice referral.  it came as a total surprise to me because i had never even thought about hospice for my mom.  the poor rn that was talking to me seemed completely flustered and said she'd have the hospice people call and talk to me directly.  she also apologized because it was in the chart as though we requested it, but we obviously hadn't.  she had hospice call us because the np had said it would be a good fit for my mom.  after talking to the hospice nurse, i agree.  hospice is going to provide a lot of extra care for my mom that the facility isn't be able to.  she's getting a new hospital bed and a recliner for her room.  the nurse has already found some things that are treatable to make her more comfortable.  she has also called and talked to me more in the past 36 hours than the hospital or nursing home people ever have.  she is passionate about what she does and she does it well.  (i have kinda high standards because my mother in law is a nurse and used to be a hospice nurse)i'm having very mixed reactions to all this.  my motto when it comes to life is always ""quality over quantity because what is quantity without quality? suffering"".  i knew that nothing was going to bring my mom back to what she was before the dementia kicked in.   i'm no longer angry at my mom for not going and getting meds to help slow this down when i first talked to her about it.  i've moved past my anger at her for sending so many people money.  i know that she is my mom, but isn't at the same time.  (low key proud of the therapy work that's gone into that).  while i know i'm never getting my mom back, i guess i wasn't quite ready to not have her around any more.  there's a lot of grief in my heart for all the things she's going to miss, for all the things that i'm going to miss, for all the things my daughter is going to miss.  my daughter is only 5.  she'll maybe remember her grandma but not any of the fun stuff.  my mom is never going to be able to make cookies with her.  she's never going to teach her how to sew or garden or anything like that.    i don't know why i'm posting this.  i'm not looking for advice.  i don't have any advice to give.   i hope everyone is having a good night/day/afternoon/evening/morning.  we're all doing our best to do right by our parents.  whatever you're doing is enough."," i’m a retired hospice nurse. during the sign-on process, ask about the bereavement councilor and if they can make visits to help you out. you may also want to contact your therapist if you aren’t actively seeing them any longer for help from them. this is the hardest part of hospice for the family. the starting part. you will get so much support that you’ll wonder how you were able get along without it before they were involved. lean on your hospice team. that’s what they are there for.

"hello. as i (40f) have gotten older, i’ve realized how much emotional trauma my mother (68) has been carrying from her childhood, her young adult years, her unsupportive marriage (that she’s still in for almost 50 years) and from the loss of close family members. as i’ve interacted with her over the past few years, it seems like i’ve become less of a daughter and more of a therapist, where she divulged things about the family, my father (70), and really just stuff that i would be better off not knowing. my mom is retired doesn’t have any friends and has no hobbies. she doesn’t like to initiate things. she’s extremely shy, which is why, for the most part, i just let her talk and cry.despite a family history of dementia and alzheimer’s, she still in her right mind with no major ailments (so thankful) but has no interest in pursuing anything to occupy her time, other than going out to your typical “boomer” discount or grocery stores to buy random things she doesn’t need.

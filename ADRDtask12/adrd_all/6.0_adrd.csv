"i take care of an alzheimer patient in her home. i work long long shifts(12-20hrs) of no sleep (cant trust her). shes not a good person and was abusive to everyone her whole life. i only got hired on to help take care of her 3 years ago.anyway, im going to be vague (in case anyone i know is reading)its very normal for her to be combative,  physically and verbally. sometimes everyday a week, sometimes once a week. usually its for something silly like changing clothes or taking meds, in which we can just say ""okay!"" and try again in a few minutes/hours.last night there was a fire alarm in the building. we're 6 stories up. the fire alarm was loud and when it goes off, 3 alarms are sounding off in each apartment while flashing lights, and about 10 in the hallways of each floor. it was late so i knew it wasnt just ""testing the alarms"".things got chaotic. she was so weak she couldnt walk with her walker, i had to run to get the wheelchair, even the 2.5 seconds i ran to get it, she fell against the wall. she was clawing me, kicking me, cussing me out, hitting me, refusing to get in the wheelchair yet she could hardly stand and definitely couldnt walk. i had to think fast and grab her a coat as its about 0¬∞ out(again, gone for mere seconds and she was getting up trying to run away), when i went to open the door she kicked it shut and held her feet against the door so i couldnt open it. the elevators were obviously shut down, so we had to go to the stairwell, the whole time she is putting all her might shoving her feet against the floor so i could barely push the wheelchair, all the while trying to claw my arms. she wasnt acting like an ""out of her mind batshit crazy person just rambling nonsense"" but just straight up fighting against me while telling me to ""get the fuck away, fuck off!"".  when we get to the stairwell, she is trying to escape (but again, was too weak to walk) so i had to hold her as firmly yet gently as i could to stay seated in the wheelchair, otherwise all it would take is her to fall foward and tumble down the stairs.the stairwell smelled like burning so i definitely knew then it wasnt a drill.it took around five minutes to get her out of her apartment. from where she was sitting to the door was about 15 feet, and it took 5 minutes!!! all the while getting beat up on. this isnt inckuding the time it took to go down the hallway to the stairwell.luckily the fire was contained but my whole body was shaking out of stress and out of anger. if the building had actually been in more serious danger of a bigger fire, i am 100% confident we would have died because of her. i have a small child who needs his mom,  i dont deserve this shit. even getting her from the stairway back to her apartment once it was deemed safe and the alarm was off (20 mins later of combating me in the stairwell) it took forever and more abuse getting her back and into bed. she was yelling obscenities at me telling me to ""get the fuck away"" while kicking me and dragging her feet. all we did was evacuate to the stairwell and stayed on the flat part that was connected to our floor. in no way would i have been able to get her down the 6 flights of stairs had it been necessary for survival, as i am petite and she is so combative and too weak to walk.next time, i will not die for you. im sorry i wont.", omg.  that‚Äôs rough. i literally thought ‚Äúchloroform would settle her down‚Äù,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/sew4kk/i_will_not_die_for_you/,I will NOT die for you.

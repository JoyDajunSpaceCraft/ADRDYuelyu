what signs or situations made you realize they weren't able to live alone?, my grandma accidentally killed her cat by giving her cat her (my grandma’s) medications. poor cat covered the basement of my grandmas house in vomit and diarrhea and eventually had to be put down. also she couldn’t understand medications and when or how to take them. she was cutting up her pills for no reason and placing them around the house. basically only ate pudding and made her diabetes worse. she also has diverticulitis and was unaware it flared up again until her church dragged her to the hospital.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sgnv0o/how_did_you_know_they_couldnt_live_on_their_own/,How did you know they couldn't live on their own anymore?

"hi i'm new here, dealing with a family member who is likely in the beginning stages of dementia. thanks to covid we had to wait a long time to get her to a neurologist, but the appointment is around the corner. what can we expect?what i'm mainly concerned about is that since she doesn't believe anything is wrong, she will downplay everything to the doctor. a family member will be present with her at the appointment so she doesn't go alone. ideally we'd be allowed to speak the doctor privately without her present, because some of the things that need to be said are uncomfortable to say in front of her. for example, i think it needs to be pointed out that she has basically stopped bathing aside from washing her hair in the sink with dish soap, but that's kind of embarrassing to bring up in front of her.i guess overall i just don't know what to do if she doesn't think anything is wrong, and i was hopeful that we'd get a definitive diagnosis (maybe not from this first visit, but eventually?) that would help her understand what's going on and realize she needs more help. she is making all of these grand plans for her life that absolutely should not happen with how bad off she is right now. for example, she wants to adopt a dog, but she couldn't even take care of her cat and we had to rehome it. she wants to buy a house, but she can barely manage an apartment at the moment (it's starting to look like an episode of hoarders). she couldn't handle her finances at all so we've already taken over that for her. imo she needs to move to a retirement community that has a memory care unit that she can eventually transition to if/when she gets worse, but she is not receptive to that idea at all.anyway thanks in advance for any advice, and for just for letting me rant a bit (figured this community would be understanding)."," insist on getting brain imaging done - cortical atrophy may already be visible; if not, you at least have a baseline for future comparison. any cognitive tests done will also be useful as baselines, so make sure you get documentation of what tests were administered and the scores.also: if there is any chance for your relative to get long-term care insurance get it now before they have a diagnosis!!i remember my mother's the first visit to a neurologist. she acted amused about our insistence that she be screened for cognitive problems. ""my daughters think i have memory problems"" she told the dr., with a smile and an exaggerated eye-roll.  she did great on all the tests administered then - short term memory was fine, she was oriented and alert. she didn't have alzheimer's. what she did have was most likely a form of fronto-temporal lobe degeneration, which presents not so much as memory problems but a decline in executive functioning, a loss of inhibition, overall regression in social skills. later, the memory goes.  bathing-refusal was a definite symptom. she would insist she didn't need to take showers, or wash her hair. don't be surprised if there's no diagnosis at this first visit. insist on a follow-up appt in at least 3 months.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sfweaj/advice_for_first_neurologist_visit/,Advice for first neurologist visit?

," they can help but in my opinion they're not the best method for a couple of reasons.in order for a sad lamp to work, the person has to allow light through the eyes for 20-30 minutes, depending on power of lamp and distance from bulbs.not that you look at the light but it needs to get through the eyes to the brain. this type of light is in the blue range, and there are versions that are ""full spectrum"" but the science is based on blue light.do you know how computer screens and mobile phone blue light keeps us awake at night? that's what sad lights are doing. it's working on the same pathways.when we absorb certain wavelengths of blue light, our circadian clock says it's time to suppress melatonin because it's daytime. since sundowning is around 4pm, the sad light messes with the circadian clock with an opposing message -- suppress sleepiness at 4pm.there is some evidence (not nearly the quantity for blue light) that red and infrared light can produce the same positive effect without the blue light downsides.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sf10td/do_sad_lamps_help_with_late_afternoonevening/,Do SAD lamps help with late afternoon/evening upset caused by sundowning?

"my mom (mid-stage dementia) will be moving to an independent living facility next month and i'm looking for any advice or tips i can get. she has accumulated *a lot* of stuff over the past number of years as the disease has crept its way in, and there's so much to consider taking/giving/selling/junking. not only furniture/belongings, but just junk in general. she loves her stuff. she's very trusting of me and i hope this all goes ok, but i have to be very strategic about this. there is not a lot of time and a lot to do. plus, her new apartment would never fit even half of what's here. what have others' experiences been like when moving their family member with cognitive decline? is there anything helpful you discovered in the process that you'd like to share? thanks in advance."," try to set up the apartment to look as much like her current living situation. for example my mom had a specific painting over her couch, tv in a specific corner, etc, so i tried to set thing up in similar locations. same with the kitchen cupboards. it’s hard to get it exactly the same but if it’s close i think that helps. when i set up her kitchen i left every cupboard door and drawer open. i told her it was to help her learn where her things were at, & to keep things open as long as it took to get used to it.if she has any specific hobbies make sure those items are set up and ready to go. my mom does jigsaw puzzles and likes to paint, so i had a puzzle table and her easel ready to go. she loves to read and always had tons of books, so i made sure she had a filled book case as well as little baskets of books placed around the apartment just like she had in her house. if there are any small electronics that require batteries, have fresh batteries put in them because i can guarantee you within two or three days of her moving in, the batteries are going to die!despite your best efforts, expect her to be looking for some random small item, probably one you may not even remember her ever owning.my mom moved in right at the beginning of the pandemic, so i couldn’t see her in her apartment nor take her out for quite a while. in some ways that may have helped her transition a little more quickly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sdvtqu/mom_with_dementia_advice_or_tips_for_upcoming_move/,Mom with dementia: Advice or tips for upcoming move?

"my grandmother was diagnosed with dementia around the time i was born, i am not sure how old she was, i think early to mid sixties, and remember being worried about my mom getting it when i was a kid. me and my mom were very close and she was the only person i could talk to during some hard times. when i was in middle school she started showing signs and was diagnosed after a car accident with early onset alzheimer's.for context she was 38 when i was born so she was diagnosed around 55. i think for a while i was just so devastated by it that i wasn't able to process it, this was something that i had a extreme fear of as a child. it's been a little over four years since then and i'm 19 now. she's getting toward the later stages it seems and i care for her often but it gets more painful. every time pick her up and help her in my car or try and get her to focus on chewing her food i feel like i'm closer to getting alzheimer's myself. since i think my grandmother was diagnosed with a different form of dementia than my mom i am not sure it's familial, but there's no denying that they both got the disease at a relatively young age. i'm terrified that i could develop it at an even younger age then them and that ill spend my 30's or 40's like them. some of this may sound callused and i know it is somewhat selfish to think about me when they are both still going through this but this is killing me on the inside. from what i've read familial alzheimer's  is very rare but my families situation seems like it could be a case of it.i would like to hear some of your stories and if anybody can give some advice i'd appreciate it, many people i've talked to dont understand how hard taking care of someone with alzheimer's is. it's not like when somebody dies and you can grieve and move on, this has been going on for years and i have no closure, i don't know what to do."," i’m in a somewhat similar position as you. i’m a few years older (just turned 29) but didn’t expect to have to care for a parent with dementia at such a young age when i’m just starting to have a career and family of my own. my dad is suspected to have lbd at 67. average age of onset is 78, so he is on the younger side. he was diagnosed with parkinson’s a couple of years ago but my husband and i have been noticing strange behaviours and issues with verbal processing in the past year that is much worse than is expected for his stage of parkinson’s (stage 2).for context, my grandparents (dad’s side) are still alive or lived to their 80s so it never crossed my mind that i would lose a parent so young.i too share the same concerns about genetics. my other grandma had alzheimer’s although she didn’t develop it until she was 80. knowing the risk of dementia and parkinson’s in my family, i did a 23andme test and i don’t carry any of the main genes that increase my risk. so it appears that my grandma’s and dad’s dementia are likely both flukes and/or environmental. still, i’ve been trying to do things that’s would lower my risk such as drinking 2 cups of coffee a day, making sure i get at least 7 hours of sleep each night, exercising and eating well to lower my risk of heart disease and high blood pressure as my grandma had heart disease and my dad has had high blood pressure for 20 years so i’m thinking the cardiac stressors may have something to do with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s9njwt/mom_has_early_onset_worried_about_the_future/,"Mom has Early Onset, worried about the future."

"we're in the process of getting my mum to see a neurologist to get a formal diagnosis but over the last couple months there hasn't been anything to suggest that it's something else (no changes in medications, no infections, vitamin levels etc are in check). she wasn't remembering anything from earlier in the day, let alone the day before or the week before.fast forward to the last 2 weeks or so and her memory is markedly improved. it's still not 'normal' but she's able to remember most of the times we went out, what we did and saw (in a big picture sort of way) and have a rough idea of how long ago they happened. as before, she remembers more when little prompts are given to jog her memory, but these prompts result in even more information than before.had this lasted for a day or two i wouldn't be fazed as i'm aware 'good days' occurred but this has been over an extended period of time and i'm unsure if this is also normal? i'm not trying to get my hopes up but if it is expected i just want to be able to brace myself for it going away again (and more importantly for when it comes back again so i don't get too 'happy').tl;dr how long do 'good days' typically last?"," is she eating enough? i’ve noticed my aunt gets really, really bad on days when she hasn’t had enough to eat. yes, we give her plenty of choices but she just wasn’t hungry and didn’t eat.took her to a doctor, he gave her an antidepressant that also increases her appetite. this is all still very new but on days that i’ve been able to get her to eat a lot, she’s (almost) like her old self. on days when i can’t get her to eat much at all (even ice cream or apple pie): she has trouble remembering and putting a sentence together. the difference is striking she has always preferred sweets and desserts. i specifically asked the doctor and he says he doesn’t really care what she eats, he just wants more calories right now.

"so for starters, my dad is 79 and he was involved in a car wreck last month. he turned left in front of someone going through the yellow light. i was the passenger and sustained injuries from the airbags and he had similar injuries. the other party was not injured, but my dad's car was totaled. now he has no car to use and is housebound, but i come over everyday to help him out. it was determined by my siblings and i that it would be best for him not to drive again. while he's been housebound, he only asks for the same meal every day and would have it for dinner if i allowed him. all he wants is a nacho bellgrande from taco bell. while it is true, he did like it prior to the wreck, so that's not new. he cites that ""its the only thing i know i can eat."" he will eat some other things but they also prove to sometimes be foods that he used to like, but pick at and barely eats a lot of it. he has not be formally diagnosed with cognitive decline, but it seems like he's showing unsettling symptoms just as recent as this weekend. he has a doctors appointment tomorrow (the 20th) and has it marked on his calendar. well i needed to get him a few things at the store today and when i came back he was in bed and was mixed up about if it was time to leave for his appointment. i told him, no it was tomorrow. clearly he was sundowning since it was about 5:30pm, i thought he was just hungry so i made him something, which he ate. then after a few hours he said, ""okay when do we need to leave for the appointment tomorrow?"" i said, ""at 9:30, i will come and pick you up and we can go around 10."" he nodded and said, ""okay at 9:30."" then i left and about 1 1/2 hours later, he called me and asked when do you need to leave for the appointment, to which i said ""at about 10."" he replied, ""so in thirty minutes why aren't you here now then?"" he was mixing up am and pm. he said he had set his clock to get up, and was confused about if the appointment was 11 am or pm. i have never seen him act like this. the appointment tomorrow isn't with his doctor but the nurse practitioner to check on his meds and see if his diabetes is still in check. i'm not sure what i'm supposed to say to her if she asks. i find this behavior alarming and worrisome. could it happen this fast? or is it medication related? he was always good about taking his meds on time everyday. not sure what's going on."," just went with my 81 year old aunt to her doctor appointment yesterday because her appetite isn’t what it used to be. she loves sweets and she would eat her favorite meal - double cheeseburger, large fry and a strawberry shake from a local restaurant - every day. i was surprised when the doctor said that was actually fine and she can have all the ice cream, scones and cakes she wants. he is more worried about her losing weight and getting weak than anything else. (he also checks her for utis every time.) check with your dad’s doctor. he may be okay with taco bell every day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s8a9iq/my_dads_new_behaviors/,My Dad's New Behaviors

"my father, 81, was diagnosed with parkinson’s back in 2016. his disease slowly and progressively has gotten worse over time. he has the type of parkinson’s that makes a person stiff and tense hardly has the shakes. he was fairly lucid up until about 2 years ago. he was diagnosed with lewy body dementia which is under the spectrum of parkinson’s it affects his nervous system pretty aggressively. physically he has a hard time moving plus the dementia has become more frequent lately. a mix of both his physical limits and dementia had caused him to fall pretty bad at least 30 times last year. he has lucid moments, but they’re less frequent. he was doing physical therapy he got better for a short while then suddenly this week as of saturday he can barely stand or get out of bed. he was walking fine last monday. is there anything i can do to help him? are there vitamins he can take or can a change to his diet help? how can i get in home assistance from the state of florida? what kind of home will he end up in if i can’t care for him anymore? it’s so heartbreaking and stressful watching someone you love deteriorate like this. i don’t know what to do.", come join lewy body dementia carers group on facebook. there are a ton of people who are very responsive and they share everything that they know and learned and can give you great tips on how to navigate and i’m sure one of the first things they will urge you to do is have your father checked for a urinary tract infection which causes sudden changes in those with lewy body.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/s7s5y5/my_fathers_lewy_body_dementia/,My Father’s Lewy Body Dementia

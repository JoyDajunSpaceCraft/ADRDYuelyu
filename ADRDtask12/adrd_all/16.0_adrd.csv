[removed], ugh. i feel every part of this :( i’m so lost. it’s been two years since dad died and it’s me taking care of mom. she has dementia and still drives and lives alone. which is terrifying. i’m with her 5-6 days a week. and when i’m not with her she’s calling constantly. i’m almost numb to life right now. some days i can’t get out of bed. life sucks. but we have no choice at the moment. dad always said “this too shall pass” and that’s what’s i’m waiting for. my time will come. but right now mom needs me so i’m here. or a shell of me is anyway.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/m1hupw/how_do_you_deal_with_the_stress/,How do you deal with the stress?

[removed], my grandmother when she started declining had trouble understanding how to use her electronics. she’s always been very tech savvy. she started blaming me for “breaking” her stuff when i was cleaning because she couldn’t remember how to make them work and assumed i must have broke them. when i convinced my mom to take over my grandmothers finances we discovered she was doing bizarre stuff liking writing herself a check depositing it and then taking the money out at an atm. so it would be 3 or 4 transactions from her trying to withdraw money for groceries. she’d also give stuff away to strangers and forget and blame her grandkids. i was very close to my grandmother my whole life. i was the first to notice her symptoms and it took me having to pick her up from a bad part of town after she got lost on her way to the grocery store for any of the rest of my family to take my concerns seriously.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/m10uc8/absolutely_heartbroken_over_false_accusations_of/,Absolutely heartbroken over false accusations of theft.

"hi everyone!  my mom has middle-stage alzheimers and it’s time for her to be placed in a care facility (cannot be left alone, wanders, hallucinations, combative, and so much more that is beyond our capacity to properly care for her).  my question is: how in the heck are we supposed to pay for her care?   back story: she lives in california, does not have long term care insurance, makes slightly too much in social security to qualify for medicaid without using the cost-share option. if we use the cost-share option to get her approved for medicaid, we were told she’d be disqualified from the assisted living waiver program - which does us no good.  we cannot afford $100k per year for a home (or even half of that).  does anyone have any advice or recommendations on services we can look into?  this is all new to us and we are lost.  thank you in advance!"," i know this is over a year old, but you can still qualify for medicaid without a share of cost. if she has enough monthly medical expenses, that will knock down her income into the qualifications threshold. the non-profit that's been helping me recommended getting her overpriced insurance for eyes, teeth, etc -- that would qualify her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lxvj43/how_can_we_afford_a_care_facility/,How can we afford a Care Facility?

"my dad, fairly early stage dementia, moved in with us about six weeks ago and we're all still adjusting. the biggest challenges are:  1. trying to anticipate and prevent the things he'll do mainly while trying to help -- 'troubleshooting' our perfectly fine appliances (and breaking them), putting ice cream in the fridge to melt, moving trash to the recycling bin, constantly moving things from where they need to be (lots of things are now labeled with sharpies), etc.  2. worse, the socialization part. i can handle breakfast, lunch, weekends and dinners but early evening is overwhelming. with the pandemic, my husband and i found a way to carve out some time by switching up the routine so the kids watch tv while i cook dinner -- basically, a working/cooking cocktail hour to transition from my intense workday into the kids' also-intense dinner and bedtime routines. but now, dad comes up as soon as i'm off work and just ... hovers. he doesn't have a lot to talk about at that time of the day but wants to interact, so i basically have to try to make small talk  every night -- at a time when i'm at my most depleted. it's hard and, frankly, i'm a little resentful of the intrusion into my husbands' and my time to connect. but i don't want to tell him he can't hang out. the pandemic is making everyone feel isolated and i'm sure dad needs some company, but he frustratingly won't talk to anyone on the phone so it all falls on us. i'd love any creative ideas for improving either of these problems!"," hi, i’m so sorry you’re having to go through this. i know how difficult this can be. i’m 27 and i cared for my dad for 3 years and it wasn’t easy. my dad eventually developed difficult psychiatric behaviors along with primary progressive aphasia. he passed last easter. i’ve been through it all with my dad. so please don’t hesitate asking me questions. i don’t have a husband or kids but i know how stressful it can be dealing with alzheimers. i would start by asking/ telling your family or loved ones how much it would mean to him/ you if they would take him out every once in a while. it can be to the park or to run errands. i would buy a used (or trash pick) electronics that he can tinker with. tell him to fix this today and if he does before you go to bed break it so he can do it again tomorrow. i would put a white board on the fridge giving my dad “chores” or actives to do and have a calendar with the times you will be “at work” or out so he can see it and prepare and he will know when you’re “available”i hate to say this but get used to having a monologue. i won’t ever forget the first time i took my dad out to lunch and he barely talked and if i wasn’t talking nothing was said. from then on i would prepare myself with things to talk about/ show pictures or videos/ play tic tac toe or word search. i made a bunch of magnets and a “memory game” on shutter fly. they were little tiles that you can put any picture on and a description. it comes with two of each because you’re supposed to flip them over and try matching them as a game but i would give it to him and talk about some of the tiles. i put sports team logos and our favorite city and pets so when i brought them out i would talk about memories i had. my dad would be my moms shadow as soon as she got home from work. it will take time for you to find what works for him/you. so my mom would put that she would be away on the calendar and spend the hour in their bedroom so he didn’t look for her. try finding activities that he can do just during that time. like put on his favorite show on his tv or tell him this is the hour he spends time with his grandkids doing puzzles/ special craft/ special project / whatever they want or give him tasks like setting the table or tell him that you have to work on repairing this appliance for the next hour. take all your important documents and special things and buy a safe for them. my dad loved going through everyone’s stuff and packing it or throwing it away and flushing it down the toilet. if he could, he would steal papers like tax forms or wills and rip them up or flush them or burn them or hide them in places like the attic. my local alzheimers association had a program where people of a specific stage would meet for 3 hours once a week. they would do activities, lectures, crafts ect and it would give us time to do thing plus provide him socialization especially with other people with alzheimer’s. i would also put out/ give him things that he can move around or pack or organize. like office supplies like old papers and file folders so he can go through it all day and carry it around. he liked paper. i would also ask him to separate all the pens and pencils (and then mix them up so he can do it the next day) he also loved to go through boxes of junk/ tools/ nicknacks so i would put some out for him to do whatever he wanted with. this way he wasn’t messing up our things or going through our things as much. try asking him what he enjoyed as a kid and start getting him to do those things. as a side note, i would recommend taking as many pictures, family photos, videos, and maybe an interview/ legacy video. they also have books that ask questions with space for you to write a response.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lx3l5r/new_to_alzheimers_caregiving_advice/,New

so my father just passed away yesterday. my mother has alz and asks “where is bill?” every few hours and she basically has to re-live the news of his passing. i fear that this will completely break her. is it ok to just string her along with some white lies and shift her attention to something else? or do we have to continually explain that he has passed?thanks in advance.," something that helped me when caring for my dad was “meet them where they are” if he thought he was 10 i went with it. if he asked for his dad that passed he would be on vacation at the shore. in my opinion it makes things easier for them and less stressful for you. imagine if you asked where your dad was and you were told they passed 8 years ago. that’s kinda traumatic and distressing and disorienting in my opinion. i used to tell him the truth until i read an alz book that said to meet them where they are. and it has helped sooo much. i used to try convincing my dad that something was true for like an hour and he would end up getting angry/ annoyed/ sad and it would never end well. i never had that problem once i stopped doing that.  but that quote also applies to their physical ability and mental ability. like don’t do a 1,000 piece puzzle unless they are able to. instead do a 100 piece puzzle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lwotbv/groundhogs_day_from_hell/,Groundhog’s Day From Hell

weather was,... small talk. they liked talking about their past, and lots of it, and going over memories, and as they processed further also their traumas became more clear. so i listened. i asked them to tell me stories, i prompted them with bringing over old pictures. the more gaps their memory got the more precious the stories got for me, i think they really appreciated i listened so well and fully interested in it. when old trauma startedgetting into conversation, i'd like to believe it gave them some relief me just listening. and acknowledging it happened, and being empathic about it (that's sad it happened to you, that must have been hard for you, i see it affected you, etc). listening to those stories actually became key for me. focus on topics and stories changed somewhat. i picked in on those. my grandpatent started remembering their old, late childhood/teenager dog a lot, so i picked in on that. talked about the dog, brought out those pictures, etc. you will notice what they respond to. after getting so familiar with their stories, i could help fill in gaps later on. in the beginning i was patient and let them search them their words, and told them it was alright, it was okay they had to search for it, i acknowledged it was frustrating for them (they were very frustrated), i also said that i understood and it was unfortunately part of the disease and thus made them understand i knew (in theory) what they were going through, i understood it was frustrating to them, didn't blame them but saw it as part of the disease, and slowed down together with them and tried to meet them on their level of functioning. i started filling in more and more gaps at the end. they had trouble finding words, i filled in facts or suggestion for words. while finding their precise words was difficult, they could easily let me know if my suggestion was right or wrong by saying yes or no, nodding, letting out a frustrated grumbling, and so on. no doubt it must have been very frustrating to them i had to fill them in, but i saw it as still being able to make conversation and connection. those stories wouldn't be told anymore without my help as they became too difficult for them to find all the right words and facts. and i believe they appreciated still being able going over those stories, even when they needed lots of help with them. listening to their stories never become boring to me, as the alzheimer processed the focus could change, they picked different wordings and expressions, and so on. those stories became really fleshed out, it helped me understand my grandparent better. in the end, when things got very difficulft, it was possible for me to tell them their stories. unfortunately i couldn't take a lot of advantage of that because of corona, but i believe it was comforting to them listening to stories of themselves that 'ringed a bell' and were comforting to hear, but they couldn't go into those depths themselves anymore to reach for those memories themselves. that's your advantage over a care member.i started writing down pieces of their past and stories. made a timeline with important dates, their interests and hobbies, a family tree, little important facts,... i brought those notes every time with me. i opened them and told them i wanted to talk some more about it, and tried filling in the timeline and gaps or clarify some things. it was a great conversation starter and helped things going. a certain day they would remember x well, so we would talk about that. when it got difficult we talkedabout y. so on. their so was present and could help out sometimes. the notes gave purpose, direction, and i think they felt so as well. for me, those notes helped me to fill in gaps in conversation from her past, keep track of points of interest, links to talk about, and so on.i also, started bringing over pets more and more (dogs were easy). if they like pets, it's very therapeutic. people don't connect with other people as they do with pets. with pets, the verbal aspect isn't important, you connect on an emotional level. the animals won't judge you if you say a wrong word, or forget something, so it relieves sstress and pressure on your loved one (even if you let them know it doesn't 'matter' to you, it must still hurt them right?). they can connect with the pets in the here and now. the petting themselves is sensorial stimulation as well, and relaxing. how does their fur feel? how nice and soft is it? and do they see how those pets react to them petting them? with dogs, they are so very responsive so it's nice to see them react so happily because of them petting them, or the dogs being happy just to visit and see them, them coming over if they call them out, making them happy giving them a threat, and so on. way easier way of connecting wth them than with other people. i believe it made my grandparent feel competent they had so much direction in those contacts, and seeing that action-reaction so clearly, feeling purpose of making the pets happy, and so on. i also had so much small talk about the dogs. told them their names. what they looked like. just descriptive what they were  doing. what they were up to at home. so on. it was truly a joy, for all involved i believe. it's very much possible to get contact with the person, through the 'medium' of pets as well. my grandparent wasn't only connecting with the dogs at that moment, but with me as well.there isn't so much of a logical flow-chart, or step by step, or guidelines, really. you will have to feel it out. you will make errors and you will also grow. that's alright. that's very human. figure it out together with your mother along the way. who knows, it might give her some relief you aren't perfect either or don't know all exact answers either, during those moments she feels her mind slipping. getting some comfort of going through those wild waters together. i believe the most important thing is to be empatic. try to meet her on her level, always. connect there, in ways it is possible. don't gloss over the fact she has alzheimer's, acknowledge it and let her know you don't like it either and make her understand you understand her emotions related to it. read a book about the disease ans understand it well. i saw my uncles reacting with misunderstanding and frustration and denial, that doesn't help anybody and sometimes it even hurt me seeing how they responded to my grandparent and how it must have made them feel. read some notes about paraphrasing, and other psychological dialogue tips, that does come in really helpful. get creative about ways to connect and bond, there is so much more than conecting on conversational level. i also think it might take some stepping out of your comfort zone, and be okay with that (like getting more okay at figuring out with your mother what she tries to express, it's okay it takes time). taking some distance from your own 'ego', and your expectations. i think it helps letting those go and to focuse on the person with alzheimer. another important thing is the shifting of roles, and it was diffent for me as i was a grandchild, but i can understand it can be difficult going from 'child' to the more caring role in the relationship. take care of yourself through all of

"my grandma recently turned 84. she has been a strong-willed, smart, and independent woman for years and still is to this day. she raised seven children and went through a troublesome marriage for years. it’s fair to say she’s been through hell and back. she’s one of my role models and i hope i can be as good of a person as she is one day. however, in recent years, especially the last few, my family and i have noticed a slip in memory and very slight personality changes. most of these things are small and not significant. in the past year, these things have slowly become more noticeable. i do not live far away from my grandmother and am with her almost everyday for hours at a time. (i’m still in school) i’m really grateful to be able to be around her often because it’s a blessing for any elderly person to have company. when i’m talking with her, i never notice a large difference from how she’s been for years. she rarely asks me a question twice... the exception may be if she asks where our cats are. i may let one outside and a few minutes later she will be unsure of where it is. she has had me help with writing out bills/important forms for the past 2 years...but could still do it herself if she needed to do so. i do notice that it takes her longer to think of the right words to use or to describe what she’s talking about. she also occasionally forgets to take her “morning” medication and will end up taking it around noon or 1:00. but this doesn’t happen all the time. she doesn’t use technology besides tv. i’ve noticed she sometimes struggles to use the same remote she’s used for the past ten years. not with changing the channel or anything, just turning it on and off. we have to use multiple buttons to get everyone off. she rarely ever calls people on the house phone unless they call her and she can easily find the missed calls. i think she has slowly developed issues with organization for awhile now, she receives so much mail and can almost never sort through it all. i feel like any issues she has relate to short-term memory though.she is a very active lady. it’s not an uncommon occurrence to see her outside working in flowers or the garden. this was the case this past summer too. she doesn’t get lost or become disoriented while out in public. we haven’t been in stores much since covid but when we do go she doesn’t act any different than she did before. but she rarely goes alone and hasn’t for years. i have no idea if she would still be able to drive and direct herself. (she was never one that went out everyday anyway. ) when she is with me, she knows where we are in town and doesn’t act confused. she still does dishes, laundry, etc.(she has lost an interest in cooking for a long time now. i wouldn’t contribute that to memory, even when i was younger and she was in her early to mid-70s she claimed “i cooked for years with my kids, it isn’t much fun no more” and would laugh. nonetheless, she still makes soup or easy to make items.) i hate to write so much, but i promise i am getting to where i begin to have real concerns...in late 2019, my grandmother had a knee replacement after suffering with knee pain for years. it would hurt for her to walk, and it was a relief for her to get the surgery. (i’m so thankful she got it before covid, because she almost postponed until the spring.) she recovered with no issue and walks perfectly now. but before surgery, she would get her hair done once a week. she used to paint her nails often. and she would always try to wear “pretty” outfits. after the surgery and since the pandemic began, i’ve noticed a decline. she just seems sad and doesn’t seem to be her old self. (she has suffered from depression in the past) i know the pandemic has been hard on almost everyone, but i just have a weird feeling that my grandmother has begun to lose hope and will never be the same. when talking with her recently, she expressed some concern about her memory when i asked. and she even went as far to say, “i know i probably have alzheimer’s or am developing it. but i can’t sit and fret about it everyday. there’s nothing i can do, so i’d rather not discuss it.” when i pressed further about why she has lost hope, she said that she feels like “she goes backwards instead of forward” and that it “doesn’t matter anyway” because “no one comes to visit.” she is very aware of the pandemic and has taken all precautions...but our family did visit more in the summer and fall. i know the winter has been bad with covid..but we did have a few small get-togethers individually socially distanced. she’s always been a people person and i think seeing almost no one besides me has taken a toll. she doesn’t seem to struggle with personal hygiene. she can’t easily take baths or showers anymore because of balance and other issues. she can take a bath or shower if someone is here, and i usually am. but i know she fears falling otherwise. so, she usually bathes at the sink. i will add that she hates to wash her hair...and i don’t think it has anything to do with her forgetting about it. she has always had her hair styled and curled with hairspray. in the past year, she hasn’t had her weekly appointments and only goes maybe once every month or 2 months to get it cut. the risk of covid is an issue, and she doesn’t want to get out as much...i understand that. but it’s also a depression issue i feel like too. she still wears appropriate clothing and matches with the season. she just lacks motivation more so now. and she has had a yearly health checkup in recent months, no concerns were ever brought to anyone else. i know her provider has asked about memory before and has given her small “written tasks.” so she must be okay if no health professional has large concerns?... she still gets dressed up and does everything like she used to when she *has* too. but discretionary events never seem to interest her and she will try to get out of them if she can.the most concerning thing probably happened in the past few weeks. we live in a rural area so we have a field and an empty house next door and there are some vehicles left behind... a few days ago, my grandmother claimed there were people in the vehicle “a woman with sunglasses” and when we had snow “there were people up in the field.” there are trees and bushes so i’m wondering if it is a vision issue partly. (i hope) she has had cataract surgery and has a prism in her glasses so she won’t see double (the issue is mostly when she drives.) but she was very adamant about it and no one was actually there. she understood after i explained to her but has brought it up again since. every time it’s the same “woman” but even my grandma is starting to realize no one is there. because she doesn’t “move around” apparently... this issue has happened no where else. when we were out in public she didn’t complain once about seeing something that wasn’t there. so i’m hoping that’s just a vision thing 🤞🏻 and for further reference, my great grandmother (her mother) had alzheimer’s for many years and finally reached the point where she could no longer do basic functions. (eat, drink, etc.) she was 86. my grandmother was the primary caregiver for her so she has told me many stories. i hate to write all of that and not be concise and clear about what her symptoms are...but it’s not one thing or another and i can’t really summarize without explaining personal stories. if you read this, thank you and i’m sorry for taking sooo long. i personally feel like my grandma is probably developing mild/early alzheimer’s. i would just like reassurance if any can be given. it scares me to death that she may have this awful disease. but i’m also still very thankful that she is still largely the same person i have always known. she has lived 84 long years and i pray she has many more. i’m so blessed that i have been able to live close to her and spend time with her more than almost anyone in the family. and i find peace knowing that she will have people no matter the  outcome. thank you again for reading!"," your relationship with your grandmother sounds lovely and precious.from your description alone i don't see a lot of similarities with my two grandmas who has/had alzheimer's. the only thing that might be worrisome is her own concern. people with alzheimer's does know something is wrong with them and, in the case of my grandmothers, they compeltely lack/lacked the ability to understand what is/was happening. your grandma seem to know very well what she is having trouble with. memory problem doesn't have to be always caused by alzheimer's. it could be just normal aging. it sounds like the thing with the person in the field is the once sign, but if she does alzheimer's, there would be many symptoms that happen together, the most obvious one would be repetitive questions. maybe your grandmother is in the beginning phase, but you can only know either by seeing a doctor or by waiting to see if other signs show up. i feel like the hallucination and depression may warrant a visit to a psychiatrist, or maybe get a camera facing the field. best of lucks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ltgslc/is_my_grandmother_showing_early_signs_of/,Is my grandmother showing early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease?
"my father just called from the hospital where he was sectioned under the mental heath act. he remembers to call us (or to ask the nurse to call) but he forgets where he is (he thinks he's in a cafe) and tends to refuse to take the medicine he needs to. we have been told he has alzheimers and it's in the mid to late stages.he and i never got on. he was very neglectful of me and wanted absolutely nothing to do with me. he told me everything started going wrong when i was born. he never hugged me, never told me he loved me and when he had to 'care' for me when my mother was working, he would ignore me. he never spoke to me. he has never been a family man and always hated us for 'taking away' his singlehood. we argued a lot.so today he called as i said and he seems lonely. he asked me how i was (never did this before), he tells us he loves us and he wants us to call him. i broke down because i felt like he was all alone and helpless and thinks we don't care about him. i am not a vengeful person so i don't take the attitude of 'you never cared for me so i won't feel for you' but it's very hard dealing with this new person that i feel emotionally responsible for. he can't make himself happy any more because he is no longer independent. he keeps forgetting he has dementia and they have to remind him in the hospital but he is very heartbroken when they tell him. he thinks he is coming home but he will be going into a home because we cannot manage (again he won't take his medicine and he will keep leaving the house at all hours which is very worrying). this is extremely difficult and i am terrified about when he finds this out.i'm just confused by it all. this is a kinder man and a lonely one and i feel so sad for him. i can't process that he is this needy person.how have you managed dealing with being needed by a person who never liked/wanted you?"," why in the world are they reminding him? what's the point of making him relive that pain over and over and over again when they know he's just going to forget? that bothers me. it seems cruel. your mom is telling a lie of love (that's what people call it, i think) where she's saying things specifically to comfort him, because it's much easier and kinder than trying to force scary truths and logic down his throat. it might be easier for you too. when you move him to a facility, you will definitely want to use this. it's especially tough because you have all those memories that you have to carry around and be constantly reminded of, and then you have to reconcile those with what you see in front of you. i'm sorry i can't give you any recommendations on the complicated parental relationship (i'm actually in the same boat as you haha) but you've got a whole community here to lean on, and i can see others have commented here already.good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lszbcz/is_anyone_dealing_with_a_relative_they_did_not/,Is anyone dealing with a relative they did not have a good relationship with?

"my (26 m) father (56 m) has early onset dementia and according to his neurologist it is progressing rapidly. this has been very difficult to cope with for me and my family, as my dad started showing symptoms a couple of years ago at a rather young age. none of my friends/peer can really relate so i don’t really have anywhere else to go and talk about this. i’ve been stuck for awhile now because i am working a pretty good job now and can afford to move out and think it would be beneficial for me to move out and maybe relocate to the city like i’ve always wanted (about an hour away from my family home). however, i feel this tremendous guilt about moving out since my dad is regressing so rapidly. i’m not sure what to do and it’s really eating at me. i have two younger siblings who will be home for awhile and some other family comes by and helps out here and there, but leaving to move into the city and have fun while the time left with my dad is numbered makes me feel so guilty. has anyone else been through anything similar? on one hand i think it would be really good for my personal growth but on the other i’m not sure if it is the right thing to do. my dad and i have always been really close and i am also afraid of upsetting him more by moving out. as things currently are now i work a lot and when i’m not working i am trying to catch up with life with things like going to the gym and seeing friends so i was thinking maybe if i moved out the time i would be spending with my dad would be more quality time idk. i’m sorry for the long ramblings, but like i said i feel so stuck and don’t know who i can turn to and talk about this stuff."," i would say i'm sorry, but you're probably sick of hearing it. i was faced with a similar decision and ultimately decided to move back to my home area, it was the right call for my situation, but might not be for you. don't lose yourself in this, it's so easy to do. you're still a person with needs and wants, and those are important. it's an incredibly delicate balancing act.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lrybhb/should_i_move_out/,Should I move out?

"2014-2015 (73/74 years old): father's alzheimer was starting to be more prominent. it starts when he's talking to people, he'd keep repeating what he's saying. 2016 (75 years): he starts forgetting where is he going when driving. like, he would leave from point a to point b, and while on the road, he'd forget where is he going for point b is, and eventually ends up going back to point a. one time, he was going somewhere that's only a 30-minute drive from our house. while on the road, he forgot, he went into circles, and six hours later, he thankfully made it back home.2018 (77 years): he started to forget how to go back to the house from our yard/garden. you'd have to guide him. he used to water the whole yard, but around this time, unless you guide him, he'd only water one area.2019 (78 years): he started to forget how to go from one place in the house to another. let's say how to go to the bathroom from the living, or going to his bedroom. also, this is around the time that you have to give his medicine to him, as he cannot take it by himself. 2020 (79 years), you had start guiding him with personal hygiene, and when taking a shower. you have to make sure he actually gets in the shower, that he actually uses the soap and shampoo, and you have to pick out the clothes he's gonna wear, and set it on the counter. though, he still knows how to put clothes on. he also started losing his perception of time. when he wakes up from an afternoon nap, he thinks it's morning. or he'd wake up my mom in the middle of the night, as he thinks it's already morning. he would wonder out of his air conditioned room, to go some other part of the house, would sit down, and complain that it's hot. i would bring him back to the room. a couple minutes later, he'd do this again. he would also ask where my mother is, i give him an answer. then 30 seconds later, he'd ask the same question again. 2021: about a month or two ago, he's having trouble when you give him a command. let's say if you want him to flick a light switch.   based on the timeline above, what stage is my father at? and how long is this going to last before advancing to the next? also, i've read that people with alzheimer's would live about 8-10 years, or if they're lucky, up to 20 years. how long do you think my father is going to live?i would like to apologize for the dumb questions. i am just curious. especially, when dealing with this everyday. thanks.", tryi found it really helpful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lqje7u/my_fathers_timeline_of_alzheimers_progression/,My father's timeline of Alzheimer's progression.

"my dad lives in a big house alone, my sister and i do a 12ish hour (9a-9p) day shift. he doesn't drive and the house is on several acres so he hasn't wandered out, but pretty soon i think staying overnight will be necessary.i have a camera to see when he is up at night, and an automatic skype tablet in case he doesn't answer his phone. the memantine is starting to not work and the evening shift is getting hard to get him settled so i can leave. he wants to know where his car is, and he wants to go home.i started him on cbd, and it helps some.the neurologist has only prescribed xanax, which made him really sleepy and quetiapine which can cause death, so i haven't given him any. he has delusions about my husband so i can't bring him to my apartment, and i can't stay over with my baby because he gets agitated and angry out of nowhere because of his delusions.my sister isn't ready to do overnight every night. any advice on different meds i could ask the doctor about, or how to segue to the next step in taking care of him?he's very stubborn so we will be keeping him at home rather than a facility in the future. thanks you guys❤️"," it's awesome that you're keeping track of his meds and the effects it has on him, continue to do that and communicate everything with his doctor. tell the doctor your concerns and they can try different meds. it might also be time to look into extra support so that you and your sister can get a break.  is a great place to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lbvo1y/have_a_little_one_and_my_dad_has_recently_gotten/,Have a little one and my dad has recently gotten worse..
"all those years i had done alzeimers walks for a cure, i would never have thought my mother would be one of the statistics.    stage 5 has taken over her mind and wow each day is a journey.   i have found that playing 50's music is a trigger of hope and peace in her mind.   i wonder if others who are caregivers have tried this?   our house is on a crazy strict routine to keep things the same each day for mom.  those sundown hours or when her mind wants to take control, i now put some music on.   wow, wow calms like a baby!!  she breaks out into song with such joy and all the words flood back into her mind.   each day i pray this continues to give her peace.  in the back of my mind i dread the thought that stage 6 is knocking on the door.", i put on the axs channel on direct tv and my wife is calm and sometimes sings along. any show that has music seems to help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lbpj1b/music_therapy_alzeimers/,Music Therapy Alzeimers
"my 70 yo dad had a recent episode of delusion, saying things that were paranoid and somewhat incoherent. my stepmom said it’s the only one he’s ever had. she recorded it because it was so unusual for him. he was calm and very sweet but tearful and scared. i’ve never heard anything more heartbreaking.my uncle thinks it’s possibly drug related, dad admits to using speed occasionally. we live in the midwest. he has had a small stroke several years ago. this just complicates everything. stepmom also has a history of drug use, is a hoarder and not the most stable support system. but she did call me so i’m grateful she was there. before this he’s been shown signs of more than normal forgetfulness. forgetting names and names of objects. he says it’s the common things he forgets and has limited short term memory. he just saw the dr. last week and was told that’s just age but i think i need to push him to let me go with him. he said he’s concerned but doesn’t think anything can be done.he’s always been introvert, working on cars in his shop most of his day. and nights. i’ve just let him be and happy when we do connect. but the last two years he has not returned calls. isolating more than normal. he’s not exactly himself. he’s still sweet and loving but just not... it’s hard to say exactly. where do i start? ask him to make an appointment with his regular doctor and go with him to express our concerns? would it be terrible to call stepmoms daughter and ask her to help her mom clean the house? i’d help too. i doubt stepmom will be open to the idea. it’s a bigger deal than just a deep clean but i know it’s affecting his depression because he’s talked about hating it and how it’s ruined his house."," start there, it has lots of good stuff ❤️ my thoughts are with you and your father, please feel free to come back with and questions!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/lb9bew/where_do_i_start_my_dad_is_showing_signs_but/,Where do I start?

"it shouldn't be behind a paywall but just in case..&gt;for the alzheimer’s study, the researchers looked at a group of 80 men and women in their 80s — half had alzheimer’s and the others did not. but, seven and a half years earlier, all had been cognitively normal.&gt;the men and women were participants in the framingham heart study, a long-running federal research effort that requires regular physical and cognitive tests. as part of it, they took a writing test before any of them had developed alzheimer’s that asks subjects to describe a drawing of a boy standing on an unsteady stool and reaching for a cookie jar on a high shelf while a woman, her back to him, is oblivious to an overflowing sink.&gt;the researchers examined the subjects’ word usage with an artificial intelligence program that looked for subtle differences in language. it identified one group of subjects who were more repetitive in their word usage at that earlier time when all of them were cognitively normal. these subjects also made errors, such as spelling words wrongly or inappropriately capitalizing them, and they used telegraphic language, meaning language that has a simple grammatical structure and is missing subjects and words like “the,” “is” and “are.”&gt;the members of that group turned out to be the people who developed alzheimer’s disease.&gt;the a.i. program predicted, with 75 percent accuracy, who would get alzheimer’s disease, according to results published recently in the lancet journal eclinicalmedicine.i encourage you to read the whole article for context. here is a link to the lancet article:",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/laekdh/alzheimers_prediction_may_be_found_in_writing/,"""Alzheimer’s Prediction May Be Found in Writing Tests"""

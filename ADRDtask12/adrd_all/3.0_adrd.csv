[removed]," while studying, you might want to look into alzheimer’s. your father’s brain is dying at an agonizingly slow speed. as it dies he will lose the ability to do everything. he won’t hear or see correctly. he won’t be able to recognize anyone or much of anything. he will forget how to coordinate his muscles to be able to walk or sit up or chew and digest food or to breathe. many people in the sub are caring for loved ones with this disease. in my case i cared for my mother for five years until she passed away. while there were moments of joy. that joy did not come from the disease. in fact if you care for your father at all, even the tiniest bit, you might decide that death is better than alzheimer’s. you might even pray that he will die from anything but alzheimer’s.  also if you have any humanity, you will start right now learning everything you can in order to make the hell your father and mother are going to experience a little more bearable. people dealing with this disease are too tired, sad, and bewildered to listen to your misinformation. also, by the time you and your family realize you have alzheimer’s it’s too late. there is no cure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uqb3o1/my_father_has_alzheimers_and_maybe_thats_ok/,My father has Alzheimers and maybe that's ok.
[removed]," it’s sad to say, but there are plenty of people who have been exactly where you are right now. there are things you’re going to have to figure out- proper care, handling finances, her living situation, etc- it can feel overwhelming, and that’s fine.tackle one thing at a time when it comes to the stuff you have to get done for her. did she pay the bills? grab one bill right now and set up autopay. did she do the grocery shopping? set up a plan for that. next week, tackle something else. every one of these day to day things you can get done should give you more of a sense that you can handle that aspect of things. most importantly, don’t forget to take care of yourself- you need to make this a priority, since your mom will benefit the most from having you at your best. do not ignore your own happiness- spoil yourself and get selfish when you can with your happiness, and watch out for depression- therapy definitely helps. one thing my therapist said that stuck with me when i told her i just wanted to be happy again- it would actually be abnormal for someone to be happy while first dealing with this. keep that in mind- you will be happy, but maybe not right now. it’s going to take some adjusting, and some time to get used to- this disease does not get better, it only gets worse- but you can adjust with it, just tackle one thing at a time, and take care of yourself",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/upzuf5/need_help_my_moms56_got_it_she_is_too_young_and/,"need help.

[removed]," you're far too young. what you're dealing with is caregiver burnout, it happens to many, and as i was told at the memory care community we ended up putting my mom in, it's a big reason for the high turnover rates with dementia caregivers. it's an exhausting (mentally, emotionally, and physically) disease.i agree with gold-eyed-cat. be selfish. this is too much for you, and you sound to me like you're already dealing with anxiety and possibly depression. i've been there. it sucks. get up the courage again to see a therapist, but ask specifically one who specializes in caregiver burnout. my current therapist said most people need to see three or four before they find one who is the right fit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uook8x/i_cant_handle_it_at_a_young_age/,I can't handle it at a young age.

[removed]," i’m so sorry you and your family are experiencing this. your fil is gone. he’s not there anymore and it sounds like your husband and his family haven’t come to grips with that yet. if you decide you’ve said your goodbyes and you want to remember him as he was and not continue contact, that is fine and healthy for you. one of the few silver linings of alz is that the person who has it wont really remember if you do something that would be emotionally painful to them under normal circumstances. it’s all about soothing their fleeting discomfort. if his behavior is scary to you, you should be able to step away and anyone that chooses to continue visiting or caretaking for him should be able to tell him a little white lie when he asks about you. as long as he is calm and upsetting things he can’t process aren’t being rubbed in he is face constantly, (like your abandonment because of something he did) the only people truly bothered by your decision are your husbands family. if they’re upset then they haven’t fully come to terms with the progression of the disease. fil won’t be hurt by your decision unless his family shoves it in his face. this whole issue is way less about your fil actually being able to harm you and you needing to “give him a break” than it is you just being at your limit of watching him deteriorate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uomqzi/alz_fil_said_he_wanted_to_rape_me/,Alz FIL said he wanted to rape me
[removed]," my grandmother is on memantine, i had to increase intake gradually, starting with 1/4 and so on until we hit a whole tablet. the quetiapine is a little sus here, why would the doc prescribe an antipsychotic, if there are no such issues (according to your description). it's also not fda approved for older patients with dementia. i would discontinue quetiapine and keep taking donepezil. i would drop the ginko as well, it's not really proven it helps. definitively get a second opinion. nasal insulin and [type 3 diabetes]( sounds interesting, but it's still in trials, so you are unlikely to be able to do that.  or at least try to search for a trial locally. i also believe you didn't completely understand the implications of type 3 diabetes. let's first look at the [mechanics of type 2 diabetes]( it's caused by insufficient production of insulin by the pancreas and general resistance of tissues to insulin. the pancreas is usually the bigger factor in type 2, but tissues resistance increases over time. in type 3 diabetes (aka alzheimers) the brain tissues develop a resistance to insulin, could be that you develop that resistance just in the brain. type 2 diabetes will generally increase tissue resistance as you live with the disease and it progresses thus increasing your brain cell insulin resistance and impairing their functions. we don't know all that much about insulin and brain function, but [it's pretty interesting]( and getting clearer and clearer how insulin resistance and alzheimers are linked.  nasal insulin does seem to affect food choice and satiety. but it could be that your dad just always liked sweets, had to cut back because of diabetes and is now losing his inhibitions and control (while also forgetting he already ate; food issues are common in alzies). definitively get his diet  and diabetes (impossible, if you don't live with them) under control and proceed from there. check for utis as well (although not as common in men i guess), sudden drastic changes with alzies could be related to an infection.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uojfbi/please_help_a_newbie_alzheimers_caregiver_who/,Please help a newbie Alzheimer's Caregiver who belongs to a country where no proper medical care is available for this disease.

(alzhms diagnosis 12 yrs ago)she also is not at all a day-time tv watcher, not unless it's pouring rain.gosh, yr mom can still check facebook & navigate internet?  wow!  my mum can barely manage to change tv channels . doesn't forget people, forgets anything that's happened even just half-hour ago - vaguely remembers when reminded.  can't even remember a few hours after being told of family deaths - not our immediate family, like her in-laws.  could you find some websites of simple games for her, mark them in her favourites, or on a note next to the computer?snacking thing - leave variety of low-cal but nutritious snacks.  fruit (having to peel mandarins/oranges even better), yogurt snack-packs, plain puffed-rice/corn cracker-wafer things (you know, the palm-sized round ones) muesli bars... kids lunch-box snacks of dried fruit strips, sultanas, whatever low-cal low-sugar snacks i can find... i buy variety of them when they're / whatever is on half-price sale.   it used to annoy heck out of me that she'd be eating smaller lunch / dinner portions due to snacking - but it's not the end of the world, in the big scheme of things, actually.  if the snacks are nutritious, and she's not gaining excessive weight or complicating any other health issues - it doesn't matter.  she's losing her mind, i'm not gonna stop her from grazing snacks if she wants to.mum used to do lot of simple xword puzzles but they're beyond her now, she does wordsearch though.    i always go through the books and randomly start a few for her here & there, it's encouraging to her when some are already started, rather than give her a fresh blank book - then she's much more unlikely to do some.    leave a few around already opened to the page with a pen right there.  like, next to her armchair, next to verandah chair, on the garden table.  with a snack next to it, & glass of water.  encourages to sit down have a snack do a puzzle, rather than walking walking.  same with the adults 'mindful' colouring books, i start bits on a bunch of pages (then tell her 'look, you've already started these ones why don't you finish them' lol) but she doesn't like them so much.having been a kids school teacher all her life after spending so much time on play-ground duty, she also had/has the pick-the-rubbish-up thing - so frustrating.  have at least got her mostly off that thank goodness.  i've repeated thousands times 'stop it, don't know what germs are on that,  now you need to wash yr hands, you're not council garbage-picker-upper, just leave it'.   but she'll do it when i'm not with her.walking - as they say, 'use it or lose it'.  yr mom has gps tracker?  cool!we don't - she has an engraved safereturn bracelet.    i changed all her clothing to colourful items  (easier for motorists to see?), good walking shoes with velcro fastenings & gel/comfort inserts.  she's going to do it, just need to make her as safe as possible. at least she'll only walk round our suburb.i need to manage her wardrobe season-appropriate, sounds like you ought to also  -- pack away the heavy coats after winter, the flimsy stuff after summer...she also likes to get the tram up or walk up to the shops for 'something'.  so, if i'm out for a few hours or the rare away for the day,  i leave out on her bedside table small change & small bills.  enough for - a newspaper - (next trip) a loaf of bread - (next trip) a litre of milk - (next trip) a snack lol etc etc....our garden rake & broom, she loves sweeping the pavement outside our place.  usually there's at least some leaves, always the odd random people passing doggy walking, mums with kids in prams, whatever... she sweeps it (seemingly obsessively) multiple times a day.  yeh, she just can't manage lot of other pass-times, can't think of what to start.could you get yr mom some of those things like - a big jar of different coloured & sized buttons or ribbons or beads to sort into separate tupperware containers?  thrift stores are good for gaining collections of such things.we're lucky at least down her in aust we can get in-home care & dementia-appropriate day-care / respite outings quite economically or even free, for pensioners, and we're in a major city, so they have quite a few programs.  she goes out with them now up to 4 days a week thank gods.  it's heaven-send salvation for me to get time off, i'm 24/7 carer.  during covid when it all shut down i was near nervous breakdown. i feel for folk in country towns, & other countries where they don't have such programs easily & cheaply accessible.good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/unoh86/any_advice_for_dealing_with_extreme_compulsions/,Any advice for dealing with extreme compulsions?

[removed]," that’s scary, but it’ll be ok! i used to work at elder protective services until recently. generally, they should say they received a report of concern, but they shouldn’t have outright said they were concerned you were abusing her. could be an inexperienced worker. either way, that’s just semantics and you will be fine.from your report here, i can see why a report was filed. your grandma is what we would call “at risk” - the biggest concern is her being able to get out of the house without anyone noticing. on paper, that would be considered possible neglect to be investigated. in my state, they do a 30 day investigation to find out what’s going on and how the incident is being handled. the thing is- these things happen and most people don’t know what to do. it doesn’t sound like she got hurt in any way and you’re taking the appropriate steps to get her the help she needs to be safe. that’s really all that matters.the social worker will probably be involved for a little while until she settles into the memory care unit and be there to help you through the process. after the investigation, they’ll give you some tips on how to handle these things and other resources for how to care for grandma. you’re not going to get in trouble or charged with anything. feel free to ask me any questions if you have any!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uihaw2/social_worker_came_to_the_house/,Social worker came to the house.
[removed]," the home should be putting in appropriate safeguardings, and you can report them. they need to look at either moving your mum to somewhere more appropriate or moving the men, and i think the men would be the best option as they may pose a threat to other residents. if not, you could also involve the police to get the care home to act, they probably won't charge the men depending on their mental capacity, but you'll have a police incident number and safeguardings to will have to be put in place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ui5m94/tw_sa_mum_keeps_being_taken_advantage_of_by_male/,(TW: SA) Mum keeps being taken advantage of by male residents in her care home.
[removed], get her a flip phone.  most older people can use those and just call her every day.  i call my dad every single day on my way to work.  he forgets it five minutes later but remembers the general feeling.  they say that those with alzheimer's won't remember the actual conversation or interaction but will remember how it made them feel so i'll call him every day until he can't answer the phone anymore even if it is just me talking.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uhuq8p/advice_on_keeping_contact_with_affected_family/,Advice on keeping contact with affected family member long distance?

[removed], make sure they are about caring for your father and not focused solely on management of him. the home i put my mother in i’ve already had to slap their hand on all the extra meds they was wanting her on for her to stay at this facility. also found out they was using their own dr. to get around my mothers primary care physician for the drugs the nurse at the home wanted her on. good luck and watch the home like a hawk. this was the worst decision i let my family talk me into. i would have been better having her cared for at her own home.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ugu0w1/need_advice_dad_decided_to_put_mom_into_a_memory/,Need advice.

[removed]," i think it has more to do with the loss of higher brain function and inhibitors. so i can see how it would seem like they are becoming a ""baser"" self because they aren't able to reason out situations any longer. in your dad's case he never had that social filter so it isn't surprising he would continue being abusive in that manner. my dad never cursed while he was able bodied and now when he's frustrated, since he doesn't know how else to communicate agitation, he'll throw out curse words instead. in his other mannerisms though, he's actually become a much gentler person. the brain is so complex and its frustrating how little we still know about it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uge4uz/do_you_become_who_you_always_were/,Do you become who you always were?

[removed]," you are not alone.  truthful loving kindness here (yes; it is my full legal name).  my dementia symptoms began 41 yrs old (feb 1999), and my story is a lot like yours in prior physical dys-abilities.  i have a few dementia friends that decided on the nomad style of life; did not work for a couple of them, but it works well for the 3rd.  tempo of decline is extremely variable, even within the same type of dementia -- much depends on pre-dementia ability levels (cognitive cushion) , prior health conditions, and (forget the word, but ...) health conditions that exist at the same time as dementia.i have several ""young-onset"" friends that had tbi, but tbi does not seem to predict any one type of dementia .  my symptoms have been slowly progressive since they became obvious feb 1999.  i was administrative assistant for dementia mentors from ... i dont remember the dates but it was about 5 years and ended last year (or maybe the year before) because i simply lost the abilities.  then i went to hosting a couple of the zoom weekly chats, then i went to co-host for only one chat ... and now i have lost the ability to even do that.like you, my husband has options of participating in zoom groups, and since i was so involved with dementia mentors i first got him involved by telling him i needed him in the thursday night ""family chat"".  that worked, and now, finally he is sometimes participating in the care-partner chat on sunday afternoons - for care-partners of dementia mentors' members. i am now at the stage that i need his help for loads and loads of every-day tasks.i will start with the page where i have been collecting links for insight in common symptoms and strategies.  specific symptoms may start earlier or later for various types of dementia, but usually by end stage majority of symptoms have been involved (unless the person dies earlier with complications from some other condition).  but remember you are not alone.

[removed]," i think that's pretty common with people like me who love to eat because of how nice eating is. it's not that he's hungry, it's that the usual curbs on his appetite, which is different from hunger, are the highly complicated calculations that his brain can't do anymore. my friend with alzheimer's is the same way, and one of the ""eat to live"" carers tries to reason him out of eating all the ice cream at once. and i'm like ""that wouldn't even work on me, and i don't have alzheimer's.""i agree with hiding and disguising food (a brown paper bag will work with my friend); i would also consider finding some things that he could eat a lot of and making those readily available. rice cakes are hard to eat fast and have good crunchy mouthfeel, and you could try diy popsicles that are mostly water with a bit of juice for color and flavor, for a couple of examples. fridge and cabinet locks can work in some households, but it sounds like right now your dad might be just as capable of unlocking them as you are; anything you can do to make it look like a food is all gone will be helpful, like hiding the full jar of pbj in the over-fridge cabinet and keeping one with just a tablespoon on the regular shelf. (and don't throw that one out when he uses it--just add another tablespoonful from the secret source and put it back on the shelf.) it's going to be more a matter of supervising and redirecting him, and/or making peace with the slipping out for a sandwich. it's also possible that it's a kind of brain stimulation that's too satisfying to be easy to stop--a lot of what you're describing is ""this feels nice and i'm going to keep going."" it might be worth exploring a fast transition to something really interesting and absorbing for him when you consider a meal is over (and have the kids bus his plate rather than pointing him back to the kitchen). unfortunately, a lot of the things that would likely serve your goal here are the opposite of what you'd want to do with a pair of hungry teens in the house, so you may want to enlist them as helpers in making this work for everybody.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/uay7zd/dad_forgets_that_he_eats/,Dad forgets that he eats!

[removed]," you’re doing great. good idea to start researching now. the book *the 36 hour day* is the most commonly cited “guidebook”.  if he is in early stages, just talk to him a lot, try to make good memories, ask him about old family stories or those from his childhood, your parents childhood. explore some of the local tourist attractions you never visited. enjoy mundane nice things and the abilities he does have like walking around and enjoying sunshine, fresh air, music. record his good days, take photos. later on, he may get very mean, say very hurtful things; before his cognitive symptoms show. you’ll want to have those good memories to remind yourself that this new mean guy isn’t actually granddad. look up the term sundowning to learn how to prevent it. medications can help a lot such as aricept and seroquel. most important is to prevent hospitalization and physical injury in general. each hospitalization accelerates the dementia, for example if someone becomes bedridden even a short time it becomes hard to practice walking again. so it is important to try and prevent falling. grab bars in the shower, shower chair, good quality shoes, extra furniture and stuff in the house and on the floor, that is hard for him to maneuver around. if he has hearing loss and it is not yet addressed, he needs to get hearing aids or at least a pocket talker. continue having conversations about interesting, stimulating, nuanced  topics. if he doesn’t understand or forgets something don’t correct him just change topic or move on. it’s common that people say “don’t argue or correct him” which i always found rather useless. find reasons to postpone his demands or to redirect. if you come out, you may find that it simply doesn’t stick. in which case you decide if it’s worth it to you to go over it each time.as it gets closer into mid-stage, he may forget who you are but it is patchy and varies by day. he may suffer from the capgras delusion. or he may say “you look a lot like my little granddaughter” in which case you can ask him to tell you all about his favorite things about her. you can offer to sit and write a letter to his grandkid that he dictates to you. and you can drop your girl mask in this situation.how long it lasts, it all depends. my 90 year old grandmother practically fast-forwarded from mid to end stage when she broke her hip and never bounced back. then there are people who suffer no physical illness and live for 20 years with the disease still walking around blissfully unaware.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/u8yjxp/my_grandad_has_some_form_of_early_onset_dementia/,my grandad has some form of early onset dementia or alzheimer’s. he’s been going downhill all year. what can i expect? how can i help support him and my nana? how do i cope? and more. i have so many questions.

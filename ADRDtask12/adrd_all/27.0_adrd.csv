"my (33f) dad (59m) is in the early stages of alzheimer’s. my mom is not working so she is with him almost all the time. i regularly visit my parents on the weekend, sometimes for friday night and sometimes both nights. if my mom isnt there (she sometimes has commitments out of town) i usually don’t go. it’s gotten to the point where he is not a danger to himself or others, but he will forget to feed the dogs, forget to give one dog her medicine. my mom asked if i would stay friday night with him to help remind him of things and give him some company. i went over there with my dogs friday night, we went to dinner and had a nice time, i stayed overnight and left around 3p today. i told him i would call him tonight and tomorrow morning to remind him to feed the dogs and to give them their medicine. when i left he hugged me really tight and said he was lonely. i feel like an awful daughter but i need some time to myself over the weekend. i guess i just need some confirmation that i’m not a terrible daughter for leaving today.  my mom will be back tomorrow."," you are definitely not an awful daughter! you deserve to have a life, too! i'm guessing that when your dad was in his early 30's, he had more of a life than just being isolated with one of his parents. i'm surprised your mom has out of town commitments if she isn't working. are they really necessary? she's the one with the wedding vows, not you. really though, the ideal thing if they can swing it financially would be for them to move to an independent living facility that also has options for assisted living and memory care for when he needs those in the future. then they won't be so isolated. if they move now while he's still in the early stages, they'll be able to make friends. she'll have a support system and social life beyond just you. if she does leave town, there would be staff to check on your dad and a dining hall he could eat in and activities. i had to push hard to get my parents to give up their house and move to a place like that, but it was one of the best things i did - for everyone's sanity and their safety.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/du2gk9/lonely/,Lonely

"hi all, i'm 42 years old with a wife and two kids, smart and college educated, but terrified of getting alzheimer's.  my parents are 70 and don't have any signs, and i don't actually know anyone close to me who has had it, but it's literally the worst thing that could happen to me.  last year after i turned 41, i was talking with my wife and she was incensed that i didn't remember even talking about some topic she said we had talked about a few months prior.  and then i started thinking about how i sometimes miss our exit when we're driving together because i'm not paying attention.  and how i'm always misplacing things.  and i had just gotten a fitbit and it showed that i only get like 38 minutes of deep sleep a night.  and back when our first child was born 10 years earlier, we did the attachment parenting thing and during the week my wife asked me to get up when our daughter cried, which then progressed to me basically rocking her all night long and me getting practically zero sleep for about 7 months, and i'm worried i did permanent damage to my brain... anyway i made an appointment with a doctor for early onset dementia even though i know i sounded crazy.  she gave me a ridiculously simple test which was obviously not designed for early cases, and had an mri run--of course they found my brain was perfectly healthy.  i do everything else i can think of to keep my brain healthy--exercise, my diet is great, fish oil, coq10 etc. except nothing i've tried has improved my deep sleep...so i've had adhd all my life, i was diagnosed as an adult, i probably have some anxiety, and i know that i've always misplaced things or my mind has wandered during conversations... so the rational part of me knows this, but then i'm just always looking for signs that i'm getting worse.  it's like i'm a hypochondriac for alzheimer's.  the other day i was at the gym and a song came on, and i was upset that i couldn't remember who it was by.  it was on the tip of my tongue.  i've heard it many times, and the group is one of my wife's favorites.   i was thinking about it the rest of my workout and on the drive home, and then later that night i finally remembered it--florence and the machine.  but this tip of my tongue episode really bothered me... maybe this is a midlife crisis, but do people grow out of them and get used to the fact that you're getting older?i've also decided that i'm not going to go out with a disease like this.  that means that if i'm ever diagnosed with dementia that i'll probably have a small window of opportunity to take action before i'll be too confused to do anything about it.  and i hate contemplating things like this--like should i go buy a gun now and take lessons just so i have it when the time comes...  but i'm just wondering are there others here who are freaked out about getting this too?  maybe people who know it runs in your family?  how do you deal with that?  the thing is, i may be a hypochondriac now, but the risk keeps going up the older i get.  if i make it to 85, there's a 50% chance that i'd be right...."," undiagnosed, mudthirties and 99% sure i have it. the advice i received was to retire quick. i haven't even finished paying off my student loans yet.i have found in life that whatever you are afraid of has a way of consuming you from the inside while the thing itself consumes you from the outside.i have been attacking this disease just as one would attack depression and refuse to give in. i'm changing my diet to mind , i'm following dr. brendersens's research, i'm keeping my mind busy. i've been noticing a lot of improvements. i used to drink one can of diet soda a day and just cutting that out rendered tremendous improvement in a month. the rest is slow going but worth it. it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle, and it's a refusal not to give in, roll over and die.once you are not afraid of it, you will have more mindspace to fight it instead. my spouse gave me some wise advice t try not to compare every bit of my life to it. because when i do, i'm kind of just willing myself to get worse. instead, treat it like a migraine, you know that it's there but you try not to think about it because that makes it hurt more. instead you take the medicine and you do what needs to be done to get better. remember, you will go through a sort of grieving cycle as you come to terms with this.i would also like to say that i bet if you took your tenacity to measure what is going on like a hypochondriac, and took all of that energy and ferocity and turned it around to attack your sleep problem, i bet you would figure out what is going on and be able to sleep much better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dtjz5b/terrified_of_getting_dementia/,Terrified of getting dementia

"just spoke to my dad (66) on the phone. he had forgotten that we actually talked recently, just about 2 weeks ago if that, which wasn’t encouraging. he said he has a cat scan on monday and will know more at that point, but it’s possible he’s in the early stages of alzheimer’s. this isn’t all that surprising to me, we don’t talk very frequently but i’ve definitely had to explain a few things to him multiple times - things that are pretty major, like the fact that i’m still in college.i’m 26 and i live on the other side of the country. he has a long-term girlfriend and they live together but aren’t married. i worry about the implications of a long and difficult illness on the horizon. i don’t have the resources to care for a parent - i have a ton of debt and, unfortunately, decided to pursue a degree that doesn’t leave you with a lot of stable employment options upon graduation. i’m planning on going to graduate school in a couple of years, after which i’d be able to teach, but that’s so far out that who knows what his situation will look like by then. i guess i’m just feeling guilty and uncertain. i have so much of my own life to figure out still. my dad and i have had a rocky relationship at times over the years - he and my mom divorced when i was 9. frankly, sometimes he can be an insufferable jerk, but at the same time i still value his support and input when i get it because, well, he’s my dad. i feel like i owe him something, in a way, even if it’s just trying to maintain a healthier relationship while we still can because that’s really all i have to give.please excuse me, there wasn’t really a major point to all this. i’m just wondering if anybody has some advice to share. my parents were 36 and 40 when they had me, and i don’t really feel prepared to approach this situation at this point in my life."," i am very sorry you are dealing with this. given the circumstances you mentioned, if he is diagnosed, be sure to keep a close eye on your dad's finances. it is very common for people in the early stages of alzheimer's to make poor financial decisions. if you feel that you may be one of his primary caregivers, it's probably a good idea to start reviewing his bank statements and to keep an eye on his credit and investment decisions. i know it sucks to be thinking about money right now, but what you don't want to do is get stuck in a position where you have less money to work with while fighting the disease than you initially thought. it might even make sense to speak with a financial planner to plan what will happen with his assets throughout his treatment and at the end of his life. the earlier you do that, the more he will be able to participate in the decisions.i hope this helps! good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dt8qec/facing_the_possibility_of_my_dad_having_alzheimers/,Facing the possibility of my dad having Alzheimer’s

"hello everyone, wanted to reach out and hear your thoughts. my father over the past year has re-kindled a relationship with a woman whom he knew years ago. my mother has alzhiemers and still lives at home. my father, under the advice of myself and my brother, just recently got in-home help for my mom. the original thought of which was that it would free up his time to spend with family. he is 72 and mother is 70. instead of doing this he now goes on weekend trips with this other woman. this older woman re-entered his life about a year ago and he disguised it as being a friend. she would stay at  my childhood house and go to church with my mother and my father. he always said it was just a friend. however, the weekend trips became more frequent and he became harder to reach. he began coming up with really poor lies. he and i went on a fishing trip together this last july and he was texting this older woman, sending her pictures of the trip. about three weeks ago he went completely mia and couldn't be reached. following this episode, i confronted him about it. told him that he was having an affair. told him that i did not approve of what he was doing. asked him what my aunt and uncle would think? he told me that i would not understand. i called him a slimy and he hung up on me.  this was about 3 weeks ago and have not spoken to him since. my older brother really does not care that much (he has been very removed from my family for a while, moved to the west coast a year ago, his wife is not very friendly). (on another note 2 years ago my brother came in town for christmas with his wife, and at the time i was single. my father got sick with the flu and instead of staying in town on christmas he proceeded to leave town on the same day leaving me and my mom alone on christmas.  i live in the same city as my parents and had a much closer relationship with my mother. the only reason my brother is letting this slip i think is because his wife has no family so my father is the only grandfather that his daughter will have. additionally, they are money hungry and i think he would prefer to not rock the boat than risk being put out of any will. i thought about this myself but realized that looking back i would hate myself for not saying anything to my father. oh and also i am recently engaged so the throwing out of the ""in sickness and health part"" really is fantastic considering i will be taking my vows in a year. &amp;#x200b;thoughts? is he in the wrong? how should i follow back up? do i not follow back up? what do i do? any help appreciated. thank you.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dt6061/father_has_started_another_relationship_while/,Father Has Started Another Relationship While Mother Has Early On-Set

"basically, my 84 year old grandmother is wearing my mother down. we live in the same house, which is split. my grandma has a basic apartment to herself as she is still able to manage herself to a degree. her memory for things has greatly declined, and yesterday she pretty much forgot who her eldest daughter was when my mother (second of 4 siblings) reminded my grandma. regarding my post. she insists that she continues to have a phone. demands a cell phone or a landline. we have gone through quite a few of each. a flip phone with basic tech to big buttoned land lines. she cannot grasp how technology works anymore. she comes out and gets angry, throws fits saying how she wants a land line ""you have a land line grandma"", how she doesn't understand after we explain it both verbally and in written form. we write extremely legible and simple instructions, that she never follows.after these confrontations my mom is in tears of frustration and sadness. there's more to my grandma's fading world, but right now my focus is on tech. could anyone who has experienced similar suggest anything with a voice command option? has alexa or an echo worked, something that requires no pushing of buttons as she has a light touch and claims to press buttons but ends up turning the phone off in the end. any help would be greatly appreciated."," have you tried a simplified phone, such as the [jitterbug phone]( it's designed for seniors. whatever phone you choose, make sure her contact list is limited to only a few numbers:  the people & numbers she would most need.**updated thoughts:**   does she know how to use siri? (if you're using iphones) i believe you can set it so all your grandmother has to do is raise the phone and say, hey siri, call sally and it makes the call for her. ...the sad reality is that her condition will progress, and she won't be able to figure out what to do with objects like phones, no matter how simplified. even light switches and toothbrushes become puzzling to someone with alzheimer's, so they need more and more help. her frustration is understandable, because sometimes during those moments, she knows something is wrong but can't do anything about it. other times, she doesn't get frustrated, but you will, because she doesn't realize anything's wrong and it's a skill she knew just a few hours ago -- like using her toothbrush to brush her hair or not remembering how to put on a shirt. when she gets frustrated, maybe you can agree with her that it's frustrating and redirect her attention to a different solution: ""how about if i sit with you and help you make the calls you need to make? i can come by every morning or evening and we'll do that together."" and maybe her friend and sister can agree to call her more regularly, so she has less need to call them (i'm assuming they know about her condition and that she may need some help?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ds0ywy/grandma_and_the_rise_of_technology/,Grandma and the rise of technology.

"hi all! new here on reddit and also new to this sub.my father got his alzheimer diagnosis when i was 21, i had just given birth to my second child that same month. it had been something we expected for a couple of years before that. he is in his 70s (so he was nearly 50 when he had me). it has been a couple of years now and thankfully it goes slowly. he still has his good mood intact, and he remembers family. i take care of him 1 day/week and i appreciate to be able to spend time with him when there is still time. it also feels lycky that my children get to experience him before he gets too sick. my oldest and him have had a very close bond. he is one of the best bookreaders i know about, making every story exciting no matter how many times he has read it out loud.sometimes it feels really lonely to be young and also go through this - most people i know about are at least 20 years older than me. and most of them go through different things in life, i’m still studying, i have small children, i don’t have a carrieer behind me, i’ve just started to work.i can’t really be young, it feels like i’m ”off” generationwise. i feel.... can’t find the right word, but like... it feels unfair? i never get to experience him as an adult. i got so little time with him. i can feel angry with my teenageself that just spent time away from home, conflicts we’ve had.. not realising how short time we had.any more young folks out there? and maybe young folks that also are parents? the mixture of parenthood, sick parent and still being in my mid 20s are a sometimes hard combo and i don’t know many others that goes through the same. would really like to meet more people to be able to talk about it...how has it affected you?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dnzc4a/young_people_with_a_parent_with_alzheimers_and/,Young people with a parent with alzheimers?

"my mother who is 78 has been in a memory care unit for 2 years now and the facility has required us to hire an additional aide 8 hours a day as she is ""too difficult"" for things like bathing\\changing\\toileting. aides quit all the time and that's exhausting. she can sometimes be a 3 person assist even though she's just 110 lbs and under 5 feet tall.she has become fully incontinent in the last year and is paranoid most of the time. visits consist of her asking if i am leaving every minute and she usually thinks i am her deceased second husband. she also sometimes says things like ""you're going to cut my head off"" or "" you want to kill me"" or ""you're going to throw me in the river til i die"" or ""i'm not that bad a person. why do they all want to get me?"" that's less often than the ""don't leave me"" repetition but it's once an hour. other than the repetition she is at a ""word salad"" stage too. i only visit once a week now.the current facility has urged me to look into skilled facilities and i have gotten on several lists but honestly they all don't give me a good feeling in my gut. i've been at this 6 years now after moving cross country to assist. i also cared for my biological father who had cancer for 5 years and lived in another house while i was still working 50 hours a week at a job. i'm shot and am now unemployed since his death a year ago. i've had to sell and clean out 3 houses in 3 years. my girlfriend's mother also died in this time and now a best friend in his 40s.so i am probably going to move her to a place where they will accept medicaid when her money runs out (it might last two more years). they specialize in alzheimer's - but honestly lots of places say that. i find it hard to believe she needs the skilled level but another memory care facility who has assessed her (really just based on feedback from the current facility - they met with her for 2 minutes) says she'd need a private aide at their facility too. she can still walk on two bad knees and feeds herself though asks if it's ok to take a bite.i just don't know what to do...i need to get out of limbo."," other than the anxiety, this sounds like my mother a year ago. mom was living at a memory care facility but her personal care was lacking. the folks at the alzheimer's support group urged me to consider hospice for my mother. i made an appointment with her doctor and she referred mom to hospice.    what a difference it has made. hospice care includes a physician, nurse, social worker, spiritual support if desired, a personal care aid who bathes mom twice a week, visiting volunteers, and equipment and supplies. hospice care is entirely covered by medicare. the hospice team took over much of my mother's care. the hospice social worker also helped us find a wonderful board and care home. the board and care home costs about as much as memory care but they are focused on personal care, nutrition, and comfort.    my mother may now only have days left of her remarkable life. but, she is well cared for and comfortable. hospice was the start of making things better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dj5elo/time_for_a_skilled_facility/,Time for a Skilled Facility?

"i suspect that my father has early onset alzheimer's. i'm seeking advice on how to navigate this considering both of my parents are psychologically abusive.i grew up in a very isolated household and i have since moved out, graduated college, and am living in a nearby county. until i came to college and met other people's 50-60 year old parents, i did not suspect that my father was very forgetful and had poor comprehensive skills compared to people of a similar demographic. my mother has her own problems, and has gaslighted us to the point where i was convinced that i was the one with memory problems until i left home.&amp;#x200b;some of the things that make me feel that he needs to be checked out include:\-forgetting the color of my apartment and insisting that it has been repainted. my apartment building has always been a hideous florescent green.\-visiting approximately every two months &amp; never remembering any of my roommates names despite having full conversations with them\-being unable to find a part of a machine from a diagram. both the machine itself and the diagram were clearly numbered, with only approximately 22 pieces\-not knowing what i majored in in college (microbiology, never changed or anything)\-not being able to install an in-window ac unit. \-not being able to realize a clearly marked, glowing power button would turn the ac on\-not being able to keep a job longer than 8 months since approximately 2008. he is consistently fired because his ""bosses don't like him""\-tells stories or facts in ways that are 4-9 times longer and more verbose than i would have.\-speaks slower and takes more breaths when speaking more than 2 sentences.&amp;#x200b;this is just a short list of things that are ongoing or have recently happened. i should add that my father comes from an educated family and has a 40+ year career in engineering, so he definitely was mentally acute at some point in his life.how can i approach my father and ask him to see a neurologist? he gets upset when you imply he should have remembered something or he is not doing things fast enough (partially understandable because of my mom's gaslighting). he is also skeptical of modern medicine; he believes vaccines are unnecessary and uses a ridiculous amount of vitamins/essential oils. &amp;#x200b;i should add, i don't really feel a sentimental reason to help my father get treatment. they were really terrible to me my entire life, ignoring my health problems, actively trying to prevent me from obtaining counseling, and ridiculing me for multiple suicide attempts. i feel obligated to help him because my parents supported me financially as a child, and not much else. moving back home to be a caretaker or sitting him down to have a heartfelt talk is out of the question due to the deep lack of respect he has for me. it wouldn't be inappropriate to say that i hope early treatment will help me avoid having to help him with things so i can see him less. i know this is a different tune than most other posts on this forum, but its something i've come to term with.&amp;#x200b;considering these points:1. what things should i note and consider when bringing this up with him?2. what kind of doctor should i try to make an appointment with?3. should i come with him to the appointment?4. any other tips?thanks in advance.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dhgfw7/how_can_i_22f_approach_my_father_61m_about/,How can I (22F) approach my father (61M) about thinking he has early onset Alzheimer's?

"hi all, this is my first post here so excuse me if i ramble on. my grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimer’s roughly 10 years ago. it wasn’t until this last year or two that her condition has worsened deeply. so much so, that most if not all of what she says is complete gibberish. it should go without saying, that at this point, she has no idea who i am, or any one else for that matter. it’s been extremely devastating watching someone i love so dearly fade away before my eyes. the lively woman i knew ten years ago is no longer here, and this has been so hard to cope with. now, to relate this to the title. i came out as gay to my friends and family a little over a year now. it’s been so freeing to be who i am openly with the people i care about. i even started a relationship 8 months ago, and in that aspect of my life, i have never been happier. however, there is one person who has yet to know, and probably never will know. my grandmother. it pains me every day knowing my grandmother will never see me being my truest and happiest self. i regret every day i wasn’t honest with her, because i now know it’s too late to tell her, and for her to fully understand. i’m not sure how much longer she has left on this earth, and i continue to feel worse and worse. i am so angry at myself for not being truthful to one of the most important people in my life. it’s been a very isolating process, and i just wanted to know if anyone else has gone or is going through this at all.  sorry again for the rambling, but thanks for reading if you made it this far."," did anyone react to your coming out as, ""yes, we suspected this since you were five""?then your grandmother possibly knew or at least suspected already. by all means, go and tell your grandmother. just be aware that she might forget it by the next day. or in ten minutes. if she reacts badly, don't bring it up again. if it's a happy reaction, she's a fine woman who loves her grandchild.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/dgif7i/coming_out_to_my_grandmother/,Coming out to my grandmother

"my grandfather has been living with my parents and i recently for about 5 months now. he has early stage dementia, but still is largely coherent, can use the restroom and communicate (he's coherent enough to read books and follow current politics). we have all noticed that he has extreme staring issues, in which he stares at people for long periods of time when he thinks they're not looking... it's very apparent at the dinner table. it's beginning to drive everyone in the house absolutely mad, but none of us have confronted him about this. i'm just wondering if anyone has experience with this or if it's common among very early-stage dementia patients to stare at people? google searches have been no help.truth is, my grandfather has another relative he'd rather be living with instead of us. we're kind of questioning if the prolonged staring isn't due to the dementia, and is alternatively because he dislikes his new living arrangement with us. i would greatly appreciate any insight y'all might have."," have you brought it up to his doctor? it might be an absence seizure you’re seeing. since he’s able to communicate pretty well, have you asked him where he’s going or if he can hear you guys when it’s happening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n0fvqt/staring_at_others_issues/,Staring (at others) Issues
"my dad had a recent fall and has several compression fractures. since covid restrictions, i haven’t been able to see him often in his independent living facility, but when he made it to rehab after the fall, he was confused and having a lot of trouble with conversations. he was angry one minute and fine the next. so, they did some memory tests and they came back with some serious deficits. (he got a 9 of the slums.)my mom died from complications of dementia and her care was much easier - mainly because she was extremely abusive to me (and my dad) throughout my life and i was able to make decisions for her care pretty unemotionally. however, with my dad - i find myself walking on eggshells. i keep looking to him to make decisions and approving of things. he’s pretty resistant about handing over finances and i completely understand that because it is not my strong suit. i’m the only living relative at this point and know i need to do something, but i’m paralyzed at the idea of making the wrong decisions. so far, he’s not able to follow conversations, care for himself (bathing and bathroom), repeats same stories within minutes of each other, gets paranoid and upset sometimes, and is having trouble remembering anything i tell him. i know it just goes down hill from here, so i need to step in sooner rather than later. i know i need to get him moved from independent living. i know i need to control his spending (he’s an amazon junkie and bulk orders things or gets them sent to the wrong address). i know i need to get the power of attorney filed. but i’m scared to do anything until he tells me it’s ok. any advice?"," so, i’m completely befuddled. he’s experiencing these symptoms and was moved to a memory care unit in his rehab, but now his nurse is telling me he has no memory issues or signs of dementia. what on earth could be going on here??? she just keeps telling me “he’s fine.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/n0ckqk/confused_on_next_steps/,Confused on Next Steps...

"(us) my dad is having some serious dental issues, teeth falling out/chipping, some infection, etc. he has all his natural teeth/crowns, and is currently dealing with and managing diabetes/frontal temporal dementia. in general he had decent health albeit declining, and unfortunately his dental health was neglected while getting his dementia more under control. personal hygiene is becoming an issue, and surprisingly he says he isn't experiencing tooth pain currently. he has flip flopped on his willingness to go through tooth extractions/implants (as dementia folks can do), which makes it more difficult to even schedule a procedure.the question is (assuming money isn't an issue), what are some good paths to take, both in terms of ensuring we are doing the best for him but also his overall well being (and our family's too)? am i missing something obvious? we are currently presented with 1) do nothing, risk it further affecting his nutrition/eating abilities, teeth falling out, etc. 2) get dentures (doubt he will adapt to these with dementia) 3) extract many teeth and get implants (long stressful recovery, general anesthesia risk for his dementia/age, etc.)two endodontists recommend option 3 (of course), but i want to know if i am missing some sort of compromise option that is less stress overall for him and us, his family. i can add more details but wanted to get a sense from the elderly community.any help is super appreciated! thanks."," it sounds like you should find a good dentist who can work with him. personally, i had a tooth removed and am pending an implant. it depends if your jaw is strong enough after a bone graft to take an implant. being older, it worries me how he'd take something so jarring. dementia also increases swallowing difficulties - which worries me. i'd try doing one after you're certain the dentist is the right one for his needs. keep a real close eye on it, because complications like infection happen often.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mzy764/elderly_dental_implants_vs_medical_minimumrisks/,Elderly dental implants vs medical minimum+risks? 80yo father with dimentia (FTD)
"alright, i will try to be accurate as much as possible. one year ago my mother lost her job and from there things went downhill. she slowly started having trouble walking, she would always fall. however, one day she fell down the stairs and that got me quite worried but she said she was fine and i asked her if she had any symptom, she just said her head hurt where she hit but nothing else. now fast forward 4 months, we are not at 6 months. my mother is acting quite weird, she is having gastrointestinal issues and shes seeing a doctor. the doctor diagnosed an overgrowth of h-pylori (if i remember correctly) and things started getting even worse. she started to lose her memory a bit, not that much but somewhat noticeable. things were quite stable at that point. however in the last 2 months so 10 out of 12 months already, she began to really go downhill. she had an mri and the doctor said she had a build up of fluid in her prefrontal cortex. she was having a lot of memory problem, cognitive function were diminished, her balance became even worse, she started really having trouble speaking, her speeches were disorganized. we suspected alzheimer or some sort of dementia, however i read that it take years to progress. at this point my mom is going down hill really really fast, faster than anyone i've ever seen. fast forward to the last 4 weeks, she started having difficulty with temporal events, what date, what hour, what year. one week later she began to act really really strange, she started saying things that made no sense at all. one week later she did not recognize her home and she lost appetite. now last week, shes been in a total delirium, she stopped eating and drinking water (we have to force her but she says she doesn't have the thirst or the appetite) nothing she says make sense. she literally stood up and removed her pants and tried to poop right in front of everyone thinking she was at the toilet. i am worried about her life, if we force her too much she get mad and make a mess. she is seeing a neurologist in one week, but her state is aggravating so fast that i am worried she won't even make it until then. the hospitals here don't care at all. i am completely devastated, i can't stop crying. we've just recently started getting along after all these years of fighting and arguing and now i am losing her? no way! this is not fair! help me please! i need a hint to know what is happening."," could it be fluid on her brain? i heard that they can put a shunt to drain and the symptoms should releave. the test they want to perform on my mom would be a timed walk like a cross a room, then spinal tap to take some fluid then time the walk again. he said if there is improvement then it would be fluid on the brain ( i forgot the medical term). keep plugging away. wishing your family some answers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mzodgo/psychiatrist_neurologist_anyone_my_mother_mental/,"Psychiatrist, neurologist, anyone?

"hello, my partner has an aunt that he’s reconnected with and been helping for the last 5ish years. however the past few months/weeks her health has severely declined. she has been non stop calling and harassing my partner, her neighbors, her tax lady, her finance manager, her friends and even her friends daughter. like 200 text messages or 35 missed phone calls saying she needs help. it has gotten extremely bad and continues to get worse with every passing day. some background on the aunt. her primary doctor recommended her to see a neurologist so she did and my partner went with her. she got an mri scan and the doctor said the memory centers in her brain are severely shrunken. my partner asked for a diagnosis but the doctor kept dodging the question. he ultimately prescribed memantine 5 mg twice a day and told my partner and his aunt that they should come back after 6 months.she currently lives alone in a two story condo with her two dogs. she’s unable to get to the second floor due to hip pain which is where the bedrooms are as well as the washer and dryer. so she sleeps on the floor in the living room and doesn’t wash anything. she’s afraid for her two little dogs to go outside because of coyotes so they go to the bathroom inside the condo. most of her power outlets have been short circuited and don’t work because she’s spilled water on them. my partner finally convinced his aunt to have a caregiver come in and help her but the care giver left immediately due to the state of the home. he’s tried to get a cleaning crew in there but his aunt will last minute cancel or change the locks on the house thinking my partner has given the cleaners a key to her home. she also has an alcohol problem but she got sober but replaced her addiction with pills. this is how she ended up with her current primary doctor because no other doctor would prescriber her the medication she wanted. at first it was xanax and then it was lorazepam which she now takes for her panic attacks. however, the last few weeks/months, were both not entirely sure, she has started drinking again. this is where we have both seen the huge decline in her health. at first we couldn’t figure out why she would have these mental loss/panic attack episodes until my partner found empty bottles of alcohol in her condo. then he put two and two together. her neurologist reported my partners aunt to aps and my partner met the worker when she came to evaluate his aunt and her living situation. the worker gave my partner a number to call for help but it’s just the crises hotline and they’ll only help if his aunt is a harm to herself or others. the police have been called for a wellness check on her multiple times and they talk to my partner but ultimately say there’s nothing they can do. my partner just wants to get her help, get her a stable and clean living situation for her and her dogs, get her clean from the alcohol, and have her consistently taking her medication. we have no idea who to contact for help since she doesn’t meet the criteria of her being a harm to herself or others. he’s tried for a conservatorship but since her primary and the neurologist are kind of slimy they keep pointing fingers at each other and saying it’s not their responsibility but the others. so no one will sign the declaration of capacity. my partners aunt refuses to see any other doctor. she’s refusing any kind of help or assistance despite calling constantly asking for help mostly because she wants alcohol and we won’t give it to her. she’s already lost a lot of weight because she’s not eating and she constantly calls complaining about not having any food despite the fridge and cabinets being stuffed. she’s unable to shower or care for herself. my partner and i live 2 hours away and are unable to care for her full time. he visits her almost every single weekend and occasionally during the week if she has a doctors appointment. since typing this post she’s already called my partner 8 times. my partner as well as everyone who know her want to get her help it just we have no idea how or what to do. my partner and i are both in our 20s and can not afford to pay for services for her because she refuses to pay for them her selves. believe me, we both really wish we could. she also refuses to go to assisted living or be evaluated. we’re just at an absolutely loss. my partner spends anywhere between 3-4 hours a day trying to help her through her panic attacks. it’s exhausting for him and i feel it in our relationship. any help or guidance is extremely appreciated. thank you for taking the time to read this. i know it was long it’s just a lot. also, she’s called another 3 times crying she needs help and to come help her. tldr: need help having partners aunt evaluated as incapacitated or committed so we can get her the help she desperately needs."," hello youi’m so sorry you all are going through this, it is an incredible difficult journey helping an elder with cognitive decline. my heart goes out to you all. my questions and suggestions below are not professional advice, they are from our experience with taking care of my grandmother who has dementia. 1. is there any way to get a 2nd opinion from another neurologist?2. apply for home healthcare, so a home healthcare worker can help take care of your her needs. these are government-paid employees, so it doesn’t come out of your pocket. make sure the neurologist fills out the paperwork as best as possible so she can be approved for more hours. for example, my grandma’s primary care doctor did not fill it out good enough to qualify for more hours so we only received 80 hours/month for help. we had her neurologist fill it out for us and reapplying again. 3. when #2 gets approved, you then have to hire someone. we decided to hire a family member. you did mention she has a finance manager, does that mean you can hire a caregiver for her to help take care of her? or can she afford to be put in an assisted living facility, if she needs the help and is a danger to herself & others?4. this is a touchy one, but if there’s a way to file a durable power of attorney so your husband can help with her finances after she becomes officially declared as incapacitated. get this done asap. along with a power of attorney. this might be difficult to get done, because some people take advantage of the elderly.5. in the meantime, suggesting to install security cameras inside her home so you can keep an eye on her. we had to do this in the beginning, and we’re glad we did.6. patience. patience. patience. compassion. compassion. compassion. if his aunt is truly experiencing cognitive decline of any kind, then she cannot help her harassing and difficult behavior. my family experiences both sweet, tender moments and pure, out-of-control tantrums from my grandmother. heart goes out to you

"hey there - i'm posting here because i feel like i have run out of ideas on how to handle my situation. any thoughts, advice, or feedback is appreciated.recently my mom, who is 73 and lives alone, has started saying there are people that come to her bedroom window at night and shine flashlights into her window, keeping her from sleeping. it got so bad that she now mostly sleeps in her living room.initially, i thought she was seeing things due to some changes the neighbors recently made with their landscaping, i.e. car lights were hitting her bedroom window differently/more visibly than before due to less foliage to block them.then, she said she specifically saw a man right outside of her bedroom window one night after she got enough courage to open her curtains when he was doing the flashlight thing. she described the appearance of the man, gave a full description. i looked around the wooded area where she said he was and the fence was bent and mangled, which made me think he hopped the fence, broke it, and that this wasn't a hallucination, but was something very real.i then put up a bunch of nest cams and trail cams around this wooded part of her yard trying to capture whoever was doing this on video. one night, she said it got so bad that she was so pissed off that she went outside to confront the ""several people dressed all in black wearing black ski masks that are crawling around all over the property."" i have video of her doing this at 1:30 am on the nest cam, bless her heart for being so brave. i asked her to send me the photo. she sends me the photo of what she claims shows the several people scattered about. there's nothing in the photo. there's nothing on the nest cams. i drove over there and checked the trail cams, nothing on them either.so then i shifted back to thinking this is all some sort of hallucination. thanks to 23andme, i know i have 2 copies of the apoe4 gene, which indicates--but does not necessarily guarantee--that i will get early onset alzheimer's. there is no family history of dementia or alzheimer's that i know of. but my mom has lived longer than most of her direct relatives, i.e. mother and father, grandparents, etc.i trimmed a lot of bushes around her bedroom window to help prevent any branches or things of that nature from swaying in the wind, causing some sort of optical illusion for her. after i did that, the activity stopped for a while. but this morning she told me they were back, and that they started as soon as she went back to bed. what she describes as ""comic book people shining lights and doing the shimmy in the yard near her bedroom."" i gently asked her to clarify what she means by ""comic book people"" and she said to forget she said that.clearly something is amiss here, and i am trying to cover all options in order to keep my mom safe in case there is some sort of nutcase shining a light into her bedroom window at night, but it is looking increasingly more likely that this is a hallucination and the beginning of something that could potentially get worse.if you were in my shoes, what would your next steps be?", i think that based on the cameras that you can rule out actual people. these types of delusions are common. my brother has taken food and water out to the family that lives in their car and thinks his neighbors are throwing garbage at his house. does she have someone to look in on her more often? there aren't any good answers other than trying to reassure her and make her feel safe. evenings are rough. if she wants to sleep in the living room that's ok.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mz4bwo/advice_for_possible_dementia_symptoms_with_mom/,Advice for Possible Dementia Symptoms with Mom
"i don’t know what to do. he won’t play card games because he doesn’t understand (yes, even go fish), he gets too distracted and confused to play checkers, he gets restless and bored sitting down and watching tv, i can’t keep baking things with him because i won’t eat them and it’s not a solution i can use every day, folding laundry isn’t a solution either because he just refuses to do it saying “i can’t” (which is his answer to 99% of suggestions/attempts), he can’t exercise because he’s wheelchair bound and his body is finally breaking down at age 96...i just don’t know how to entertain him anymore. he sleeps a lot, but it’s so stressful when he’s awake. he just asks “what can i do?” we tell him nothing and he looks sad, but it’s... true. he won’t fidget with things anymore so fidget boards are out. he just... exists. is this it? is this normal? i’m pretty sure it is, but... it’s just so disheartening."," i hear you. my dad is the same. he complains that he's bored but either refuses to do any activity we come up with or tries something and panics because he can't do it. i think, depending on where the dementia is attacking their brain, they can develop a lot of apathy and lose the ability to take any initiative. i think a lot of these old dudes were also workaholics who didn't really have hobbies, so you can't get them interested in anything but work-related activities - which they can't do anymore. natch.unfortunately i don't really have any solutions. my dad watches a lot of tv. sometimes he'll agree to walk with someone down the driveway to check the mail, or help put recycles in the bin. once in a while we get him to agree to short outings, like going to the ice cream stand. but mostly, he watches tv.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mz2nb4/says_he_wants_something_to_do_but_theres_not_much/,"Says he wants something to do, but... there’s not much he can do anymore."
"i visited my grandmother in memory care today. she moved in a month or two ago. this was the first time i've seen her since before covid, i couldn't see her before because i work with the public but i just got vaccinated recently. she is very depressed and bored, and also has pretty bad anxiety. she told me that she just sits on the bed all day doing nothing, just existing as the time goes by. it breaks my heart to see it. i tried to talk to her about some different things she could do to stay busy, like reading, coloring, or listening to an audio book. she also talked about how she doesn't like her room and i thought it might help to put up some more decorations. i bought her a few books, colored pencils, a succulent, and a cute lamp. while she was thankful that i brought her things i don't know if she will be able/willing to use them or if they will help her feel better at all. i feel kind of dumb for thinking that it would help. none of that is a complaint about her just to be clear. it just sucks to feel so helpless.on the bright side though she seemed really happy that i visited. the rest of the family visits regularly as well so it's not like she'll be all alone, but it was very hard to say goodbye. she cried when i was leaving. i can't stop thinking about that."," with covid winding down, hopefully the facility she’s in will step up and encourage her to participate in activities. at my grandmas old place they had all kinds of things going on every day (exercise, cooking classes, church, games, live music, animals, painting, etc). they were regularly encouraged to join in. of course my grandma normally declined, but i believe it was good just to know things were going on around her. they also took folks on outings and my grandma actually volunteered at a library once. covid took all that away but hopefully places are starting to liven up again. last week i was told my grandma participated in something. also, it was a great idea to bring the art supplies. i did that too-and i also brought yarn and stuff to crochet. i always have a couple of books on her nightstand as well. she’s lost the desire to do any of these things, but it gives her something to look at and i figure it can spark discussion when folks ask her if she likes to do ___.  at times she reminded me of a kid saying “i’m bored!” but then not wanting to do the 500 things i requested. :) folks just keep asking, that’s all we can do. i believe part of her isolation is fear of not being able to keep up in conversation, etc. she told me she can no longer understand what she reads, and she can’t focus enough to crochet or paint, which she used to love. my grandma is also introverted-so group things have always exhausted her, and if people push to hard she gets mad. when she gets super bored she’ll walk around the facility-and i believe she enjoys watching other people do stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/myr60p/i_wish_i_could_help_her_more/,I wish I could help her more
hello everyone lately i've been feeling really sick with multiple symptoms occurring to me in the past weeks. i would say it all started a month ago with stomach problems like floating stools and nausea whenever i ate but the nausea is now gone i still have floating stools sometimes. i was really worried for some reason and during that time i started having short term memory problems like forgetting where i left my phone this has been happening a lot lately and about two weeks ago i had an enormous pain in the back of my head that i had to get up from my bed and hold my head the pain only lasted a few seconds but that was only a one time occurrence but still quite alarming because of how painful it was. another time i has a headache was when i went to a pool the pressure when i put my head underwater made my headache go crazy that i could barely hold my breath for 10 seconds maybe less didn't even last 30 minutes before i got out of the pool but the pain went away as soon a i got out. i've been having other symptoms like mouth aches which made it hard to eat but those only lasted 2 days and went away. it's been a week since i started having trouble reading things like i make many mistakes that i have to read a sentence like 2 or 3 times to understand it sometimes i skip a word or read a word wrong which makes me confuse. im also having new speech problems like not being able to say some words i was able to before not being able to sing some of my songs because of my speech problems or me forgetting the lyrics. like i said before every symptom i get goes away within a week but my memory problems are not going away in fact they seem to be getting worse. i've went to my doctor at least 6 times this month and starting to think they believe im making this symptoms out since first i started with stomach problems then muscle pain and now memory problems they might not even take me seriously anymore but i can assure all this symptoms are real. i've had blood tests done cbc was one them don't remember the other and they told me everything came out clean my organs were fine and all but im still having me doubts especially with my new memory and speech problems.," there are occasions when dementia can hit very young, but considering everying i would say chances of dementia as cause for these symptoms is very slim.  you need to see a doctor that will eliminate loads of other causes for dementia symptoms -- and the dementia is reversable for many of them ((smile)).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mynimq/im_18_and_think_i_have_dementia_or_alzheimers/,Im 18 and think I have Dementia or Alzheimer's disease

"i'm really struggling with my elderly father. we moved into his house after my mom passed from cancer to help him because he's never really taken care of himself, the house, bills, cooking, etc. we've been here a bit over a year and between covid happening a month after we moved and grief and stress it's been crazy.i'd been chalking it up to his weed habit, his grief, etc. now i'm very concerned it's dementia. he's always had a bit of a temper, but it took quite a lot to get him upset. over the last 4 years it's gotten worse, to the point of him starting to yell and get upset simply if he doesn't like what you or someone else says. im thinking that may have been the start.now we are seeing other things, like he was convinced he was 73 and i explained that doesn't add up based on his birth year and he got so mad. i had to change it to the wrong age on the form i was filling out and he still stomped off pissed at me. he came home from a dental appt furious because he didn't understand what the receptionist was trying to tell him. what he told me she said and what i clarified with her directly were vastly different. he's telling stories he's told a hundred times and switching details or people in them. he has targeted all his vitriol and upset at my husband, making up things about him (like that he's had 3 duis, which he has not), he repeats a story or thought immediately after he just stated it. man, just typing this out i'm realizing it's got to be dementia.here's the thing, if i tell him i think somethings wrong, he's going to lose his shit. we got in a fight today (well, i stayed calm) because i told him he can't smoke in the house (not that i let him before, he just seems to have forgotten all about 2nd hand smoke dangers) and he accused me of all kinds of crazy shit. told me i was emotionless, that i don't care about him, that my husband is going to shoot him (wtffff) and that i never communicate anything that is happening (i 100% do). my brother thinks he's just an asshole narcissist. which is probably true too, but this seems like something more. i think my bro is in denial. losing our mom and taking care of her as she slowly wasted away from cancer was really hard, i don't think he wants to face the possibility we are there with dad already.open to any feedback or advice, i'm overwhelmed and not sure where to start for help. he has kaiser and they make it super hard to just call his doc."," get a formal memory care assessment. my mom also has kaiser, and it wasn't that difficult in getting a formal assessment. if you use the kaiser permanente website, you should be able to contact your dad's physician directly through messaging and get a referral to a memory care physician. whenever i message my mom's primary physician, i almost always get a response by the next business day, if not from the physician, from the nurse practitioner. let me know if it seems hopeless, so that if worse comes to worse, i guess i could try to put you in touch with my mom's memory care physician with the hope that she'd be able to refer you to memory care physician in your area. hopefully that would be possible without violating any doctor/patient privilege. good luck. dementia is an arduous road, and, if that's what your dad has, you're gonna need to make efforts to set aside time for yourself to unwind. it can be done, but it takes patience and some planning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/my1ovo/i_think_my_dad_has_dementia/,I think my dad has dementia

"hello, there’s gonna be some details i’ll miss, but i’ll rush through this a bit. my dad was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia in 2018. when the illness started (before 2018), he was having troubles remembering a few things, and my mom caught him saying the odd thing here and there. it was quite evident he was also having delusions as well. as it went on, his ability to find the right words when speaking deteriorated first. then his behaviour started to change. he started doing repetitive tasks such as mowing the lawn even though he already mowed it the day before. things start to become difficult for us as he begins to progress through this disease as he always left for walks; even late at night. we’d tell him to come back in immediately and sometimes he’d listen. he starts getting more sicker, and bolts it for the door without listening to us at all. he said he was “looking for something”. this spirals to a point of utter delusion and distrust for us (his family). he starts accusing us of trying to do something bad to him so he always ran off. my dad had moments of seemingly being okay, and then a flip switched off and he would bolt not even looking for traffic. even more time goes by, and he starts becoming more violent. his speech has gone to only saying yes or no, and sometimes the occasional surprise of a big sentence. anyways, his violence starts towards my mom. he’d hit her, and all that. cops would be called, and we’d have a big family talk. it was clear she could no longer look after him. my dad goes to the psych ward, and the doctors there want to change his meds around. time goes by and he’s in and out of the hospital because my mom feels guilty for having him in there. she can’t let go. my dad has become increasingly violent, and has deteriorated so much this past year. we had a meeting with a worker about getting my dad in a facility to live in permanently, but homecare won’t accept him. not sure what options we have, but the psych ward he’s in now sounds like they’re tired of having him there. i didn’t know there would be no place for my father to do once his illness got worse. if he didn’t hit, this would be much easier for everybody. the doctors at the ward said they’ve only ever seen 1 other person like my dad. it’s a rare form of dementia apparently, and it’s not hereditary.", dose him up real good,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mwfccg/fathers_dementia_extremely_tough_quite_violent/,Fathers dementia extremely tough; quite violent

"hi all, i would love some advice on how to approach my mother in law and father in law (if at all) about her showing dementia signs. please know that i only want to help her.my mother in law is 65 years old, and had an extremely traumatic upbringing which has undoubtedly affected her adult life, so it is hard to find the line to draw between trauma and possible dementia signs.i have known her for about 10 years and in the last 2 years i and another family member have notice a huge decline in the following areas:-telling the same story every single time we speak, dozens of times-paranoia that everyone is looking at her and speaking about her-inability to follow simple stories that were telling her- for example, stories about our day, or instructions-falling out with all of her friends-forgetting appointments and family plans -inability to sleep, constantly complaining about insomnia and waking up at 3am-increased extremely heavy alcohol consumption, regularly 2-3 bottles of wine per night and she says it’s “to help her sleep”.things to note:i have tried to speak to my husband (her son) about this so many times and he becomes defensive, saying that i’m just being mean to her.  i have spoken to my sister in law and she has noticed the same things that i have noticed. we have tried to speak to our father in law (her husband) and he just brushes it off saying that she’s doing crossword puzzles so she’ll be fine. i feel like if i speak to her directly she will get extremely defensive and dismissive.so my question is, is there anything we can actually do or say to help her?! are there early intervention techniques? or do we just watch her deteriorate?"," if the family aren't accepting then maybe you can phrase it as something different like emotional support or helping to decrease her stress so she can better enjoy her life.trauma is definitely linked to dementia, so treating trauma is super important. people with ptsd push their memories and feelings into the subconscious because they just can't deal with them and this ruins their foundation. without a grounding in reality what are their chances to fight off cognitive decline?i don't know if therapy is an option but i think it would help, if not anything that can get her off the wine so she can sleep better naturally would be ideal (drink helps you fall asleep but the quality of sleep is greatly diminished). evening exercise like walking or yoga, guided meditations, creative time to process emotions.people greatly underestimate the importance of managing stress. crosswords are not enough, the foundation is managing emotions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/muo7oq/motherinlaw_showing_early_dementia_signs/,Mother-In-Law showing early dementia signs

"my grandmother is 88, she was formally diagnosed by her pcp with dementia about 1.5 years ago, we started noticing some minor issues maybe 2.5 years ago.  the thing is, she doesn't really fit into any of the ""stages"" of dementia.  if you go by the 7 stages, or just a more broad early, mid, late, she's all over the place with symptoms.  in the last few months there's been a handful of times she hasn't been able to recognize me, my mom, or my grandfather.  she doesn't think we're strangers, but confuses us with someone else.  two month ago i picked her up for a doctor's appointment around noon (usually she is very good at this time of day) and she thought i was her brother for the entire ride there.  on the way home though, she knew i was her grandson.  two weeks ago she thought my mom was her sister.  just last night, she woke up in the middle of the night and refused to believe my grandfather was her husband, she thought he was her father.  but in between those incidents, no problem.  she recognizes everyone just fine.  even this morning when i stopped by she knew exactly who i was, and was back to knowing who my grandfather was.  honestly, these more severe issues are an outlier.  i'd say 75% of the time she's relatively fine, and things come across are simply more age related forgetfulness that you would expect from someone who will be 89 in six months.  for example, if i go over when the news in on, we can talk about current events.  she knows what's going on, and she understands it.   the majority of the time it might just be mixing up what day it is, repeating some family gossip she already told me a few days before (so she still has the ability to make new memories), or screwing up while cooking dinner because she forgot something in a recipe.  on a day to day basis she gets dressed on her own, she cleans the house, she goes up and down from the basement to do laundry (though sometimes she forgets the right settings on the machine), she goes grocery shopping, and she even still writes out the checks to pay the bills when they come in the mail. but she's got these off and on periods of severe confusion, and her pcp has diagnosed her with dementia.  it just doesn't make any sense to me, and i've begged my grandfather to take her to a specialist or just *anyone* for a second opinion to make sure there isn't something else going on (maybe a medication issue) but he refuses.  not because he's an asshole, but he's just very old school.  their pcp of 30 years gave a diagnoses, she gets mad if he talks to her about her symptoms, so he just deals with the issues and placates her.  so i'm just wondering, maybe i'm in the wrong here, and something like this is common....the ""stages"" are more mixed and not rigid, and this is just a normal case of dementia.  it's just....""fishy"" to me.  i want the best for my grandmother in her final years, and i feel like i'm the only family member who is researching this and not just accepting the opinion of a 75 year old pcp diagnosing an 88 year old with dementia and not looking into it further."," there are things like vitamin d deficiency and thyroid issues that cause dementia like symptoms so it wouldn’t hurt to have a full work up. a neurologist will do this. it’s probably not worth it at her age. a high percentage of elderly get dementia. dementia does do strange things. my mother is late stage. today she could walk and talk fairly well. last week she could barely stand, couldn’t feed herself, spoke only gibberish. she is on hospice and they said this is part of the progression. her level changes daily, sometimes almost hourly. as dementia destroys the brain, cells are damaged. sometimes they work correctly. other times no. they flicker like a light bulb burning out. you may see a short lived big improvement. then you notice that the bad that was every now and then is the norm. it’s not so bad when there are plenty of small things to lose. the person has enough working brain to compensate. it’s horrible at the end. your brain controls everything.  google dementia. go to the alzheimer’s society site and read about the a’s of dementia. things will become clearer. you are starting a long terrible journey with your grandmother. luckily she is older now that it’s beginning. she won’t linger/suffer as long.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mubl3c/is_it_common_for_someone_with_dementia_to_not_fit/,"Is It Common For Someone With Dementia to Not Fit Into Any ""Stage""?"

"hey allanother visit to mom in the memory care unit, another crying jag when i got home. i really struggle with grief, loss and fear of loss in those visits, even if i manage to tuck it away until afterwards.   have any of you managed to focus on enjoying what you and your loved one has left? how did you do it?"," my mam moved to a nursing home a few weeks ago. we are only allowed to visit two times per week due to covid restrictions. mam cries a lot due to going from hospital to nursing home and not back home and not seeing me every day like usual. i have loaded my ipad with songs from the 50’s, 60’s and 90’s dance music i got her into. i try to build her up with silly  jokes too. there is less continuous crying now it’s more like a wave of happiness then some sadness then some happiness. i try counsel her too and help her express all her feelings and make her feel grateful for the lovely life she had and current care and love etc... i don’t know what else to do for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/msxzex/how_do_i_change_from_grief_loss_and_fear_to/,"How do I change from grief, loss and fear to appreciating what is left?"
"my dad is in his late 70s and experiencing increasing short-term memory loss. he's also finding it more and more frustrating that he is losing words and getting things ""wrong"".i'm giving him lots of time to find words (it's a good thing i have a rich inner life, because conversation can be slow...) but it's upsetting seeing how angry he gets with himself.for context, my mum died with alzheimers three years ago. when he was caring for her, he'd get frustrated and constantly try and correct her. that was difficult dynamic to observe, and i tried to persuade him to humour her. but it seems that message didn't get through. and now he's turning that same 'needing to be right' attitude on himself.i usually understand what he's trying to say, so i try and reassure him that it doesn't matter if he can't get a word. but actually saying ""don't worry, it doesn't matter"" seems to make it worse - because it really does matter to him!i'm at a loss to know what to say instead though. any ideas?"," communication is more crucial to some folks than it is to others, because we all primarily communicate in different ways.  your dad may be one of those who primarily communicates thru words, and it creates panic when he is unable to communicate.also, some of us get extremely irritated when someone with an intact brain tells us ""it's okay"" and ""it doesnt matter"".  to us, it is not ""okay"", and it matters a huge amount !  the process of losing our abilities that made us unique is  tremendously painful.some of us really get irritated with ""help"" to find our words, because if you are guessing wrong, then hearing your guess just put the word we are trying to grab twice as far away from us.  i am very fortunate that after 30 years of marriage my husband guesses correctly most of the time, so in our communication that is usually helpful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/msx7ud/how_can_i_reassure_my_dad_when_he_forgets_words/,How can I reassure my dad when he forgets words?

"we’re moving mom to memory care within the month.  it’s a lovely place, but she’s moving to a typically tiny memory care apartment and will be losing 90%+ of her stuff.  she’s obsessed with losing her things, actually since a house fire 15 years ago and even though we were able to replace many items, she is getting ready to lose most of her things again.fortunately, she will be able to take her little dog, but what other kinds of things can we move with her that might minimize the sense of loss?", these are some of my strategies >>  [ ;,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mst9yf/how_to_deal_with_losing_her_stuff/,How to deal with losing her “stuff”?

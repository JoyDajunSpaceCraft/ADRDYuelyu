"hi i'm simone from new zealand and i've been living with my partner in part of his mothers house. she has advanced dementia and is 96. she can still get herself up in the morning and get herself to bed but that's about it. we cook, clean, shop and launder for her. she has no comprehension she has any problem we thought we had a place lined up for her for when things got too tough for us. that time passed 2 weeks ago because we found out that she has no care level status at all, even though the district health board etc has been around to assess her. we discovered this when we went to the resthome my partner has lined up. nobody told us that even though they were aware she has dementia and needed a lot of care that she would need a further assessment. the place we lined up has hospital level care only and seeing as she has no care level next to her name anyway, it doesn't really matter. we went to her gp and it was obvious to the gp that she was reallly far gone. she sent an urgent referral for a new assessment. 10 days later nothing has happened except a geratrician ringing from the hospital board, who basically hung up without advising us of any further processs. this was 2 days ago. my partner is an alcoholic and it's like living with a time bomb. i can barely cope. he is beligerant and trying to take on the whole world. i keep trying to pull him back to reality but he thinks he's in control. i'm going to ring this health board tomorrow myself because he will blow up all over the place. it's so hard. yesterday in frustration he grabbed and yelled at her. how much does it take these idiots to react ?? this is what we get for our tax dollars in a public health system. i feel for all of you, i really do. it's very hard to deal with."," i took my father to an er when he got sick.  that was where he was finally diagnosed.  he went from the er to a memory care center.  if all else fails, do that.  if she does anything that could harm herself, take her to an er.  it's the way to get around the red tape.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dpjnop/my_partner_at_his_wits_end/,My partner at his wits end
"went to see my great-grandma the other day. she’s practically suicidal at this point and definitely on her way out. she refuses to eat or drink much of anything, but she managed to drink a small cup of tea while we were there. my grandma managed to get her attention long enough to show her a video of her great-great-grandson, but it didn’t really mean much to her. she doesn’t know any of us anymore. she’d been calling me sarah for years, but now she doesn’t address me, period, or any of us for that matter. my grandma asked if she was ready to see grandpa and jesus. she said nothing, but nodded slowly. when we left, my grandpa said it was time for us to go home. she said two words, the only time she spoke while we were there: “me too.” my grandma went to pre-plan the funeral today. we don’t know if it’ll be a month, a few months, or a year."," i’m sorry, this is hard to handle. it sounds like she is ready to go though. if she has been suffering for a long time, she is probably so very tired.  take care of yourself during this tough time, stress can do a real number on you. {{hugs}}",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dphy6x/shes_on_her_way_out/,she’s on her way out.

"last night, we had dinner with grandpa. afterward, he asked my dad about something, but he can't remember the question he was going to ask. he mentioned something that he was out of cash and had no money in his account. dad brought up that grandpa has millions in his bank account. grandpa said he wants to withdraw cash, but he can't drive per doctor's orders. grandpa, however, brought this many times in less than two minutes after we told him he can't drive anymore. he then repeated the thought that he had no money. we do fear that he will drive and (hopefully) stopped by police as his doctor sent word to the mva that grandpa can't drive due to the possibility of hurting himself or others. we want him to move in an assisted living so that he can be monitored and have his dementia checked regularly by doctors. his memory functions are pretty severe and is often repetitive. we are still deciding on a move-out/move-in date. we figured that after christmas might be better, so that he can have time in his house before leaving for good. however, there is a possibility of getting him moved in to the assisted living much earlier."," agree with u/lordica to take the battery out of his car or something else that will totally disable his vehicle. however, i don't agree with taking the air out of his tires. in his condition he would probably still drive with no air in the tires.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/do9p8m/grandpa_is_still_struggling_to_remember/,Grandpa is still struggling to remember

"carer abused a service user with dementia multiple times in front of me and in front of at least two other carers (separate incidents). service user is supposed to have two carers present at all times due to basic manual handling and health and safety, this doesn't happen 98% of the time due the boss refusing to pay for agency workers alas theres not enough to cover.carer was reported for abuse and was not disciplined or sacked but instead the carer was simply moved from giving care to said service user and continued to ""carer""for other vulnerable adults/elderly patients.due to employer not taking any action, i reported my concerns to cqc who i believe are investigating. my concerns are that the carer and employer will somehow comeout the other side unscathed and the service user will continue to be abused.do they ask the service user about abuse? do they take the service users dementia into consideration when/if asked about abuse?i am worried as service user would say they didn't like the carer but also wouldn't remember any specific incidents?i have been the vulnerable adult (i suffered a breakdown a longtime ago) and though many people witnessed my abuse, no one actually reported anything and i suffered horrifically because of it and of course the more no one speaks up the more others join in as they think its okay to do!!any help would be much appreciated😊", you should be congratulated for reporting abuse. i myself reported bad care with the result was that the manager of the unit was sacked and unable to work as a registered nurse in the future. please hold your head up high as having the courage to report such abuse you are ensuring that the culture will change.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dne4z6/reported_a_carer_for_abuse/,Reported a carer for abuse

"i went to visit my mother in law this week and it has been heavy on my mind.  she seemed further away, less herself.  i have only seen her a handful of times since she moved into the nursing home from our house.  part of me feels guilty about it but it is just so sad that she is slipping further and further away.  and she doesn't remember us at all.  just a sad situation to be in i guess."," i know how you feel. went to visit my grandma for the first time since she moved into the home from our house and i was shocked how much she’d deteriorated in the space of just a month. she looks much more cared for as when she lived with us i couldn’t dress her (partly i wasn’t comfortable with it, the other part that it was quite difficult to do as her mobility is very poor, we had a carer come in the mornings to help her wash and dress but she’d often refuse them) she was dressed and had her hair done but from a health standpoint she wasn’t good at all. it took her a while to recognise me which is scary considering i cared for her during the day most days when she lived with us. her mobility was bad before she moved in but now she can hardly move, we tried to help her to the dining room to have lunch with the other residents but it took her several minutes just to take two steps and her bones were audibly cracking with each step, so the carers decided it’d be best to let her eat in her chair. saying goodbye was really hard, she got quite upset but i promised her i’d be back soon and gave her a kiss. there have been some positives through her going into care though. her and my mum have a much better relationship now than when she lived with us as most of the negativity was directed at my mum. it was lovely seeing them sat next to eachother holding hands and just chatting without any hostilities. i also feel like i have a better relationship with her now, admittedly i held some resentment towards her for how she used to treat my mum and how i had to put her before any of my own needs which maybe sounds selfish but it’s the honest truth, some days you just need to take care of yourself. now i just feel a lot of sadness and sympathy for her, she has lucid moments and she’ll get very distressed and ask us “how did i get like this? i can’t believe i’m here.” which is honestly heartbreaking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dn4ffz/visiting_someone_in_the_nursing_home_is_hard/,Visiting someone in the nursing home is hard.
"hi everyone,i have been lurking in this sub for a few weeks now and your posts have been so helpful for understanding what might be going on with my great grandmother, though it's been very hard to get a solid answer in regard to what's actually wrong.she is 84 years old and in august she had cardiac surgery. i want to say it was a valve replacement, but i know it was minimally invasive. when she came out of the anesthesia she was extremely confused and thought the year was 1976. at first it seemed like the delirium many elderly people get when staying in the hospital. it seemed less extreme when she got back home, but she's had issues ever since. she's been a widow for over 3 years yet she constantly forgets her husband is gone or when/how he passed. her daughter (my grandma) and son help care for her but she has episodes where she doesn't know who they are, or she remembers them as little kids and doesn't recognize them as adults. it's like her memories are there, just mixed up? the most concerning things have happened over the last few days. one of her biggest issues was believing that her house was not her own when she has lived there for 60 years. she would sometimes get angry and think there was a conspiracy to keep her in this strange house which she insisted wasn't hers. this confusion gets worse at night (sundowners?) so her kids take turns sleeping there to make sure she doesn't hurt herself somehow. but last night she got up, attempted to get dressed, and was determined to ""go home."" it took a while to calm down but eventually everything seemed okay. then this morning she woke up and had no idea where she was or who anyone was. usually she at least has an idea of her surroundings but today she didn't and it's so worrying.she goes to the doctor regularly but whenever these concerns were voiced he just dismissed them. is this post operative cognitive decline or did surgery just speed up the development of dementia? will it just continue to worsen? my family is close knit and we all live near each other, so this really does affect everyone. any advice you guys might have would be appreciated ❤️"," she sounds like she has the mid stages of dementia. she's becoming unmoored to time and place. i recognize your story from an elder of mine that was ""a little forgetful"" but then became suddenly much worse following their hospitalization for an illness.  physical health  dropping can advance dementia symptoms quite a bit.  in the case of my elder, their illness brought them to a mental place that once healed it took them another 18 months or so to drop down to.  it was a preview of things to come.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dmy4ff/very_concerned_about_my_great_grandma/,Very concerned about my great grandma
"my family had a meeting this week to discuss about what to do for my grandpa, who has dementia. my grandpa has been suffering mental decline and his doctor insisted he and my grandma move into an assisted living because grandpa's condition is so severe. grandma and grandpa don't want to leave the house that they lived in for over 50 years. i honestly don't blame them because i would hate to give up the house too. i have such fond memories in their house. christmases, easters, fourth of julys at their house was a magical time for me. however, since they have grown old and are unable to care for themselves, there comes a time to make a sacrifice. my family said they would like for grandpa to tour an assisted living that has services for his dementia. i know he will not like it because he hates to give up his independence. grandma doesn't want to either, but she has bad arthritis and is immobile. she relies on a walker and a scooter when she shops. she has also severe back pain due to the arthritis and gets morphine injections almost every week to relieve the pain. those services might be available at this assisted living. it will be a difficult time for me as well since we won't be having magical times at their house anymore. it's hard to give up something you love."," hi, i work with a home care agency. when a community has new move in, they bring us in to be a ""personal assistant"" for the first 2 days to help get them acclimated. we help them unpack and set up their new apartment, show them around the community, take them to the store/go to the store for them to get odds and ends for their new apartment (shower curtain, mini trash cans, etc), go through the activity calendar with them and circle things they would be interested in (and then drop that off to the activity director), make sure their tv is set up, make sure all appliances in their apartment work, introduce them to the director of nursing/any other important department heads at the community, etc. it is so helpful to have extra eyes on them the first few days because moves are very stressful for people with dementia and usually increase confusion. this helps too so their family members  don't have to do as much. i would really consider doing this once they move in to a community!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dmw51i/family_meeting/,Family meeting

"so just some backstory, my grandmother is 84, and she's had dementia for quite a few years, but it's very gradual, fortunately. she still remember names, but most of the time she is not able to match the names correctly anymore. we've moved for 8 months now, but there are times she thinks that it's a hotel and she wants to go home, or she just want to go back to the old house. so sometimes she really leaves and goes out, but we have a helper at home whose priority is to follow her if she goes out when no one is at home. so yesterday, in the late morning, she left again, and i went to bring her home because she was acting up and imagining things happening to her again. at one point, she said that she didnt know who i was. normally she does, because we live together, but of late there are times when she doesnt. so after i brought her home, i drove her out for lunch. on the way home, i asked her again, whether or not she recognises me. and again, she doesnt. the conversation is as follows, and in mandarin:me: do you know who i am?   grandma: no.   me: if you dont know who i am, arent you afraid to be in the car with a stranger?   gm: no. i'm not even afraid of guys, why would i be afraid of a girl? i know qi gong (taichi). she is 142cm and like 35kg. but she is fearless, bless her. typing this out now seems like it's nothing much, yet i had a good laugh when it happened. i guess i just wanted to share, that despite all the depressing shit that comes along with dementia, there are also times when a comment comes along that lightens the situation, or that things might not be as bad as they seem, and that they're still there behind all that. while dementia patients have it bad, a lot of credit have to go to the caretakers as well, and that'd be whoever is reading this, so keep up the good work! and remember that your life is still yours, and you still need to do your own thing and not be suffocated by the caretaking.", thank you for sharing this :),https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dk2jc7/just_wanted_to_share_a_happyamusing_tidbit/,Just wanted to share a happy/amusing tidbit.

"my mil is still pretty lucid most of the time, but she’s definitely got dementia (along with some movement disorder symptoms) and she has a team of medical professionals working to find the cause of it. she’s “there” enough that a lot of family members don’t really even believe the dementia part of it. we live with her and care for her (when she lets us...she’s in a lot of denial) so we know for sure that something is very wrong. alzheimer’s has been mentioned, although it doesn’t explain the physical symptoms. one thing that doesn’t line up though is that instead of having the hygiene issues i keep hearing about — not wanting to change into clean clothes, for example — she is constantly doing her laundry. as in, several days a week, increasing to that point over a period of several months. to the point where i often have to do my three kids’ laundry during the night and we believe it’s part of the reason the electricity bill has been going up. i’ve suspected for a while now that she’s been having some night time incontinence, which was confirmed recently during a hotel stay, so we assumed that she was washing her sheets after an incident and didn’t want to talk about it. but lately it’s been a lot of clothes. full loads of them, with just one or two days in between. and this is all hers; we do ours separately. is this a thing? is it possible she is forgetting that she did laundry and then washing it again and again, or is it more likely that she’s just trying to give herself something to do when she’s stuck around the house?"," ocd tendencies are a symptom of dementia.  obsessively fixating on something and performing the action over and over again (either out of habit, the sake of repetition, or a compulsive need/driving want) is absolutely normal for those with dementia.  for my grandfather, it's shaving.  he takes his electric razor and shaves up to three times a day for about half an hour each time.  he does forget he's already shaved, but another layer of that is he feels he isn't shaven enough so he simply shaves and shaves and shaves.  because of this, we don't really change the blades in his razor (even though it can't hurt him, regardless)  just to be sure he isn't doing unnecessary damage to himself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dcgmo9/mil_with_dementia_constantly_doing_laundry/,MIL with dementia constantly doing laundry

"my mil was diagnosed with bvftd early this year. she's 65 and her doctors told us that its likely she had it for many years due to the severe damage seen on her brain pet and mri scans. over the course of the years she went undiagnosed, she has burned every bridge, sympathy, and good graces from people around her. my husband, being the only family member whose bridge she hasn't torched to cinder because we reside on the other side of the country, decided to have mil live with us so we can provide good care for her. we welcomed her with open hearts, open mind, boundless patience, and love which soon turned into a nightmare that we're still gasping for air to cope.  when we were first told of the diagnosis, we thought as long as we learn how to manage her behavior with teepa snow positive approach to care, we should be fine. early on living with us, she has shown quite the violent streak which her doctors are concerned enough to prescribe seroquel to help with the severe behavior on top of her rivastigmine since no reputable memory care wanted her due to her aggression history. my husband believed that love and patience can overcome antipsychotics; he basically denied mil her prescribed seroquel with the fear that it will cause her an early death. without antipsychotic to dampen her impulses, paranoia, and delusions, my mil operates on adrenaline rush that gave her almost superhuman strength enough to gravely injure others.   over the course of the months of us being caregiver, mil aggression went out of control and sexually assaulted my husband, my oldest son, and one male home care nurse. my mil has also physically assaulted any females that dared to get close to any of the males she deem hers. she has pushed me down the stairs for saying good morning in my husband presence, resulting in broken ankle. she assaulted the social worker because my husband talked to them. she bashed a female home care nurse head for trying to wipe her with warm towel. she gouged meter maid one eye for no reasons resulting in permanent vision loss.  with mil leaving behind strings of victims, the court and aps had to remove her from our home to be permanently cared for at state mental hospital secured wing. my husband was livid and started binge drinking since he got the call from aps and the police last week. i have scheduled for my husband to see therapist which he said he will but i wont know until he actually goes on the date of the appointment. while waiting for the appointment, he fell into this wild thought pattern that its the state's bureaucratic fault for his mother's predicament. he simply wanted his mother to live longer by not letting her take antipsychotics disregarding the fact that his mother unmanaged dementia aggression has left 2 innocents with permanent disability.  my oldest son (13) has been in state of trauma from being sexually assaulted by mil (her doctor told us some bvftd patients often act sexually inappropriate) plus witnessing all of her violent episodes. i've been taking him to see child psychiatrist and hoping he can come out of it. meanwhile, my youngest (10) became detached and seeming lost in his own mind which i'm also scheduling therapist for to see what can be done to help both of them.  as for me, i'm shell shocked as i watched my family sink into the grim vortex of hopelessness. i, too am talking to therapist because i feel guilty for being a part of my husband decision making not to medicate which end up hurting other people. before mil pushed me down the stairs and threaten to stab me, i supported my husband with his decisions not to medicate. after mil sexually assaulted our oldest, i suggested my husband to give her the prescribed antipsychotics before more people get hurt which he rebuffed. i kept my head down when he told me that i am free to leave, take our kids and go far away because he will never ever let his mother touch antipsychotics. i do not want to ruin my marriage so i kept my head down and quietly took my children and myself to therapy and finding a safe place in the house where mil wont be able to hurt us.  when my mil gave the first home care nurse a black eye, i tried calling social services and infuriated my husband who has guardianship of mil that he started calling our mutual friends asking for recommendations of divorce lawyers that will let him keep our house (we share mortgage) so my mil is free and clear to stay in his care. i backed down once more, kept quiet and reassure myself things will be just fine and that my husband acted the way he is because of the immense pressure caring for lo with dementia. as the violence escalated, my husband begin turning blind eye by saying the nurses probably wasn't qualified enough, just out for the money, and deserved it.  everything came crashing down when mil gouged the eye of a meter maid. my husband at this point has run out of strikes and the judge wont have anymore of it. aps brought the police to pick up mil anticipating violence which came true. my mil had to be physically restrained for safety.  my mil is institutionalized and no longer made us (my children and i) fear for our safety on daily basis anymore but the anguish, fear, guilt, uneasiness still linger like thick and choking corrosive fumes. are there dementia caregiver survivors here that can help with advice on what i can do to put my family mental health back to baseline again? i know we will never be the same and time will eventually diminish the feeling, but for now, we need suggestions for relief in between therapy appointments.   thank you!"," has your husband gotten genetic testing done? has anyone else in his family had neurological diseases such as dementia, alzheimer’s, als, ms, etc?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/dc6iwv/needing_advice_on_how_to_heal_on_top_of_seeing/,Needing advice on how to heal (on top of seeing therapist) and deal with the aftermath of caregiving for family member with dementia.

"i've been struggling to find a tv set up that works for my mum. the key features i'd really want are:* completely simplified design, the only buttons on both tv and remote should be: on/off channel and volume - that's it, don't even think about an av or input source button!* remotely controllable through an app so i can turn it on/off, change channel and any other settings necessary. she should be able to call me and within a few seconds the tv should be just how she wants.* built-in streaming services, but, they just play like any other channel. so for example, there would be a ""historical dramas"" channel which just plays netflix's entire catalogue of historical dramas on a loop whenever you go to that channel. same for other key netflix categories. obviously i should be able to call up any show through the app if she requests iti just don't understand why it's so hard to produce one product like this"," i work in a group home with adults 55+ and honestly the cable box remotes are a nightmare for people without dementia (and these are the ""simplified"" senior remotes). i can't imagine trying to explain them repeatedly to someone with dementia! i really am surprised a product like this hasn't been invented.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/davlax/my_dream_tv_product_for_dementia/,My dream TV product for dementia
"throwaway account because honestly i don't know anything and i don't want this getting back to my account.before i get into it, i don't think he's completely faking it. my dad has been diagnosed with frontal-lobe dementia about 2 weeks ago after losing his memory and being hospitalized for it. it came back after 3-4 days. this isn't the first time it has happened and it took some time getting this diagnosis as he always has a medical condition called dissociate amnesia (which leads to memory gaps and such). we could tell something was different though, as he's lived with da for 30 years and the episodes were different as of recent.anyway, ever since leaving the hospital 2 weeks ago almost every single day he has something wrong with him. he wakes up claiming he doesn't know who he is, where he is, can't do anything has to sleep. he puts on a baby voice and refuses to listen to us. he never did this before the diagnosis. he would have bad days, and there were certainly some he just didn't want to do anything but sleep, but not like this. there's a difference between not wanting to do something and saying you don't even know how to or physically can't. he didn't even know how to use a bottle of water. doctors said that the dementia was 'early on' (whatever that means regarding whats to come). honestly i don't know anything about dementia than what a quick google check can do.at this point i think he's faking it, it's easier to say he doesn't know and go back to sleep, despite our protests, than to handle the reality of it. there are times he talks fine and then you ask how he is and suddenly his voice drops and gets all mopey and he doesn't feel good. but two minutes before he was talking fine?? right now everything revolves around him, if he is having a bad day we can't leave him alone. so my whole life has shut down to be at home 24/7. can dementia act this way so quickly? or is he putting it on? any help would be great. i know i sound like an asshole but i need to know if this is normal behavior. i need to know is this my life now."," sounds similar  to my mother. last year was obvious her memory  was going, but some days she was fine. she would say she couldn't do things herself, but if no one was around she could. she would even occasionally  drive. well it can speed up real fast, a year later she has lost bowel control, currently in hospital,  she believes it's the 80,s now. her health not good at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/daosul/i_think_hes_faking_it_my_dad_wakes_up_every_day/,I think he's faking it?

," personally, i don’t have any personal friends who i would feel comfortable asking for help with this.   the trouble is, she’s been isolating herself too, so her list of friends has shrunk too.  and i’ll have to come up with a great backstory that i could convincingly deliver to pull this off. i’m kind of at a loss about that part. i’m not sure i could be convincing enough!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/damhdj/i_realize_now_im_not_enough_in_helping_my_mother/,I realize now I’m not enough in helping my mother combat loneliness.

"my grandmother has vascular dementia.  her dementia causes confusion mostly. she's not able to write or cook or operate things like lamps very well any more, but she's still pretty sharp mentally.  she can read still, just a bit more slowly than before.  she's always been a writer.  she wrote a few books but mostly wrote poetry.  one of her books was her pride and joy.  it was a memoir from when she was in her early 20's when she traveled out west with nothing that didn't fit in their truck with dreams of starting a ranch.  it's a lovely story.  she tried to have it published once but the publisher got back to her and said it wasn't their genre and to try another publisher.  she was too defeated by the rejection to try.  she's always talked about this book and told me the stories in it over and over.  she gave the carbon copy of the manuscript to me earlier this year.  recently, after years of being stable, she had a decline.  i don't know what caused it, but suddenly the confusion became worse and her speech became more jumbled.  i had always thought of self publishing this book for her with the intent of allowing her to think it was picked up by a publisher. she doesn't know about amazon or self publishing so it wouldn't be hard to let her believe that, and i wanted her to feel good about herself and about her book and to make one last dream of hers come true.   but, i was hesitant because i was worried it would be crossing a line - maybe overstepping personal boundaries.  with this recent decline, i decided to do it anyway and if she gets mad at me, well, i'll just add that to the list of things she's mad at me about!  so, i started researching how to self publish and typing up this manuscript.  i couldn't scan it in because it was too faint from being a carbon copy.  it was 65,000 words and i typed it into microsoft word.  so. much. time. was put into this. i wasn't expecting it to be so much work.  i thought i could type it, upload it and print it out. the formatting alone took days.  the cover art took days.  i must've reread it 5 times looking for typos and formatting errors.... but i did it! i got it done and uploaded.  i ordered a copy to take to her and crossed my fingers. i was literally shaking when i handed the book to her.  she read the title but didn't recognize it.  then she read her name but it didn't register.  i told her it was her book that she wrote a long time ago and it finally clicked.  her first comment was, ""you didn't pay for this did you?"" i could honestly answer that no i didn't pay to have it published.  at first, i don't think she understood. she was making faces and grunt noises and turning it over and over in her hands.  it had to sit with her a while. her brain had to process it a bit. i was worried i made a mistake. by the next day, when i called her, she was raving about it!  i was so relieved!  she was raving about the pictures i added to the book, the cover art, the fact that her name is everywhere. she was enjoying rereading all her stories and she was reliving the events as she was rereading her words.  she was just so happy. happy to be remembering names and faces that went along with the story. she kept asking me if she finished writing the book or if i had to finish it for her.  i assured her she completed it and that made her happy all over again.  and the pictures, she loved them.  she kept referring to them and saying, ""my babies.  look there's my baby.  wasn't she a darling baby? wasn't he so handsome? her brother loved her so."" she even said, ""i wonder if \[husband/my grandfather\] can see this where he's at.  he would love this."" i'm pretty much floating with joy right now.  my sweet grandmom was thrilled and it gave her back some of her memories. best part is... i showed her that it's available online for sale so now when the other residents say, ""oh i would love to read it!"" she tells the to go buy a copy :d  she rocks.", oh cool! can we see it too? i'd love to read it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/daasf2/published_a_book_for_my_lo_with_dementia_sharing/,Published a book for my LO with dementia - sharing good news
my grand father has been in a nursing home just shy of 2 months now. in that time he's had 3 incidents where he's attacked others residents. the first 2 he was provoked which of course doesn't excuse his actions. today i got a call around 9pm saying there was a 3rd incident. apparently he had been restless and was wandering around going into others residents rooms. one tried to keep him out but he managed to push his way in and punch her. staff said they don't think he was provoked this time and unfortunately that exact spot doesn't have camera coverage so they likely won't be able to see exactly what happened.has anyone else had experience with this? he's in a really nice place so i'd hate for him to be transferred or worse sent to the mental hospital. we had hoped once he went to the nursing home we'd be done worrying about him but these incidents just make us worry more. the thought that he could even end up being charged with something and have to deal with all that is really gut wrenching.," >the thought that he could even end up being charged with somethingsevere dementia is a form of mental illness and it sounds like your grandfather lacks the capacity to understand that he's committed a crime. most law enforcement officers know this and would not charge an elderly severe dementia sufferer nor would the district attorney prosecute such a case.where it's dicey is when you have a dementia sufferer whose condition is not yet severe but memory and cognitive function are significantly diminished. when such persons commit crimes, they can sometimes be charged if it's something like vehicular homicide, hit-and-run, theft of significant value, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/daa571/nursing_home_violence/,nursing home violence
"i am wondering what you do for a loved one that is combative with medical treatment? i am wondering what i do if/when something serious happens. i want to be prepared. what do i do if she ever needs to be hospitalized and is trying to run from the doctor? do they sedate dementia patients? even with a broken arm i could see her screaming ‘nooooo’ and running off. my mom is young, 68 and still strong and steady on her feet. she has stage 6 alzheimer’s and it’s very hard (if not impossible) to communicate with her. i want to be prepared and am wondering what others have done? in case it’s relevant i have full medical powers/conservatorship of her.my mother’s behavior is fine at her memory care home, she is generally happy and pleasant, occasionally stubborn but generally her caregivers can get her to cooperate (with showers, dressing etc). however it is very difficult to try to control her if a doctor visits and they are trying to take her blood pressure, blood prick, bandage her foot etc. etc.  she will refuse to move sometimes, or walk away or she will pull the blood pressure band off of her, she will wiggle etc. it can take 3 of us for a simple task (doctor, nurse and me) to try to hold leg to bandage and distract her for example. my mom is much bigger and stronger than me (5’9, 230lbs) combined with her willingness to pull things out. luckily so far her only medical treatments she’s needed has been for utis and for an infected ulcer on her so foot. but i worry about the day when something happens that requires a trip to the emergency room."," my father was assigned a ""sitter"" when he got combative in the hospital.  it was essentially a big guy who would assist the staff if necessary.  all my dad's sitters were very sweet and kind.  i don't know if all hospitals offer this service.  you should call around in advance and find out what your area hospitals policies are when dealing with dementia patients.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/da61ro/what_happens_at_hospitalization_if_dementia/,What happens at hospitalization if dementia patient is combative?

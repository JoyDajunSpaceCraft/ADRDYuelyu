"hi there!i hope you all are doing well!  recently, i was approached by a few people asking how to navigate medical care and hospital stay without frustration.  i am thinking of starting a project to teach everything i know about this, given my insider perspective as a physician who takes care of a lot of patients with dementia. would you or someone you know be interested in learning this?if so, please kindly reply yes so i know whether it’s worth spending time on.thank you much!leslie", yes please!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u36ocn/navigating_medical_care/,Navigating Medical Care
my grandmother has both dementia and diabetes. she is late stage dementia. hard for her to understand what we are saying as we say it. none of her sentences make any since. she is very childlike at this point. she likes candy and dying eggs so we are going to dye eggs. what could i put for a gift basket thing for easter? ofc it would have candy (not sugar free since it upsets her stomach) what other stuff could i put in a basket for her?, you could put some small arts and crafts! like those “magic” water markers or maybe it’s called invisible marker where you draw in a coloring book and it shows the different colors it’s mess free. or maybe some stickers. that gives something creative fun and hands on,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u363xc/easter_basket_for_grandmother_with_dementia_and/,Easter basket for grandmother with dementia and diabetes

"if i had to guess, going by the ""seven stages"" my grandmother is probably around 4, but moving into 5.  although, it's hard to tell because the deviations in her memory have become so drastic the past few months.  i see her seven days a week, so i'm familiar with how she is on a day to day basis.  on monday she might be completely out of it.  you would think she's end stage.  she doesn't know how i am, she doesn't know who my grandfather is.  she's just laying on the couch, speaking weakly and saying she can barely move.  she will ask where she is, and then insist this isn't her home, despite living there for 50 years.  and this won't be just a small episode, i usually stop by three times a day, morning, afternoon, and evening.  on days like this it will last 24 hours.  then, i could stop by the next morning on tuesday.  i'll get there at 8am and she's coming up the basement stairs with a load of laundry, she's got breakfast cooking, a pot of tea on, she knows exactly who i am, who my grandfather is.  she'll be talking about something she saw on the morning news.  later in the day she will ask my grandfather to take her out grocery shopping, or to go out for dinner.  it's suddenly like she's perfect.  then on wednesday she might be just as good, or back to monday, or somewhere in the middle.  thursday could be awful, friday could be amazing again as if she doesn't even have dementia.  she's seen multiple doctors, she doesn't have a uti (i know that will be brought up), she's just had a typical ""age related dementia"" diagnosis.  if anyone else here had a family member like this, how did you deal with it?  it's taking a toll on my grandfather.  he has the money for a home nurse/caregiver, but the issue is that right now it's impossible to schedule one.  he said he struggles a lot on her bad days, and i see it.  but at the same time, there's 2-4 days a week when having one there would be a total waste of money (and would piss off my grandmother when she's having a good day cognitively).  how do you handle this stage?"," i'm not sure if this actually what is happening in your case, but in my personal experience: my grandma will be good and full of energy and then the next day be absolutely wiped and sleep a lot/be more disoriented. i'm wondering if she is experiencing something similar. my grandma is stage 6 so she might be a bit more drastic. but as an example, she did he adult day center yesterday. today she was awake at 9 am and i got her dressed and she had breakfast. then she watched a tv show. an hour later she was asleep. she slept (occasionally waking) until 2pm. she had a 3 hour nap in total. i just wonder if it is catching up to her from all of the activities during the week and she is honestly exhausted but doesn't realize it. maybe try setting a schedule with grandfather and staggering activities? we do m, w, f with activity and tuesday and thursday as rest days with the occasional doctor appointment. if she can settle into a routine, it may be easier to find a day that works for having extra care too. again, not sure if this will help in your situation but it has done pretty good for us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u2bhnn/the_extreme_deviations_between_a_good_day_and_a/,[deleted by user]

"my grandmother is 75. she has been experiencing short-term memory loss that i and several of my family members believe is indicative of dementia. i'll try to list a few examples off the top of my head:* she asks the same questions repeatedly in a conversation even when we've answered them several times* she wakes up in the middle of night wondering where she is and sometimes asking ""how to get home""* she struggles with numbers; for example she has difficulty handling money and remembering information like birthdays and phone numbers* she expresses concern about me walking outside alone because i'm a ""little girl."" i'm 18 years old. i should point out that she did not mean that figuratively or humorously. she often speaks to me in an infantilising way and i have heard her asking my father how old i am on several occasionsrecently, my father went to visit her in her city. he went out with his brother and their cousin and while they were out he expressed concern about these symptoms. he told them about my great-grandmother (from my mother's side of the family) who died of dementia. by the time she died, she was confined to her bed, had very limited speech, and could only remember a select few people and everyday objects. the cousin, upon hearing this, relayed it to my grandmother, and basically told her that, if it's dementia, she needed to seek help in the early stages or else she would end up like my great-grandmother earlier than was necessary.my grandmother was absolutely enraged by this. she said that she was not 'crazy' or mentally ill. we tried to explain to her that it's not about that, but she absolutely doesn't care. she has flat out refused to even consider that it could be dementia or to see a doctor about any of her symptoms. she seems genuinely insulted by the idea and won't accept it. she has now stopped talking to my dad's cousin. it's been several weeks and it doesn't seem that they've had any contact.i am becoming increasingly worried. i don't know what to make of any of it.", to me that doesn't sound like early stage. when did memory problems first get noticed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u1eh30/grandmother_refuses_to_seek_diagnosis_for/,[deleted by user]
"i always thought of my mom to be a higbly neurotic person. she's 50. always anxious, always somethinf on her mind. paranoid. she was never diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (i myself am diagnosed adhd and ocd), but deffinitely harbours ocd traits. i mean frequent checking and a ""what if"" type of mindset. she can never relax because there is always somethinf bothering her, mostly in her marriage with my stepdad.  abouf 6 years ago she got a really bad case of meningitis and was in icu for quite some time. she was also on bloodthinners for bloodclots caused from sprained ankle.  i think that took a shot at her memory. lately she has been really forgetful. like she made me a pizza yesterday and asked me if i liked it. then today she knocks on my door and asked if i liked the pizza. i was like you asked me this yesterday, and she didn't remember. sometimes she forgets the curling iron is on but that's more rare, though it does happen. i find it weird how a very cautious person could forget such a thing. my cousin works with her and i asked if she has trouble forgettinf words ans events at work. she's like ""that's just the meningitis"".i just dont want to make her doubt herself anymore than she probably does by telling her to get checked. hee mother has been diagnosed with dementia a few years ago (apperently).", sounds like she should be seen by a psychiatrist instead of a neurologist.  anxiety and stress can cause memory troubles.  50 is pretty young for dementia though not impossible but the majority of the time it ends up being psychological.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u18ll8/should_i_tell_my_mom_to_get_checked/,[deleted by user]
"i’m a 20 year old full-time nursing major. i currently work and recently had to quit collegiate track. i’ve become a full-time caregiver for my wonderful grandmother, 93yrs old, that helped to raise me as a kid.it was december when my gram was diagnosed with alzheimer’s. i knew i couldn’t cope with the fact that i knew the stages of it/how it progressed/etc and my brain had ended up blacking that out in order to protect me mentally. it was until last week that i had decided to break my own heart and revisit the progression of it when i was looking into respite care.my gram is a great great great grandmother. we have a relatively large family. i only mention that because i never thought that being a caregiver would be so ungodly lonely. i’m so alone in this. i already suffered from gad, ptsd, and unspecified depression prior to this, and i hate to sound so so selfish but it had increased horribly since taking on this job. i have sought out a therapist, but it’s through my college and will be discontinued in the next few weeks.i was always unphased by everything i had to do to and for my confused/sundowning patients at work. i always saw my gram in them and knew they deserved the utmost respect and love with the unforgiving situation they were in… but it’s so different when it’s your own family member. to say it’s difficult is possibly the biggest understatement i’ve ever come across in my life. i have so much guilt going anywhere, even if it’s for an hour or so. or even just going to class since i’m a commuter. i get violently ill and especially panicky at the thought of it. she is still mostly independent (can clothe/feed herself) and won’t wander off. it makes me so sick to my stomach to even think about what i’m missing out on because that’s so selfish and disgusting of me. i want to be with her. i want to do everything i can for her. but the thing is, i’ve destroyed myself in these past few months. completely and utterly ruined my mental health. i absolutely do not blame this on her though. i’d die for her in a heart beat.i never thought i’d see every inch of my own family member. i never thought i’d come home from my job at a hospital only to continue exactly what i did at work for my grandmother. cleaning her in every way and down every crack. i also was never prepared for the fact that i had to know every single thing about her, which i have no problem with now. but taking on her medications/making sure she takes and receives them, her appointments, taking her everywhere she needs to go, taking all calls that were for her because she doesn’t understand a single word they’re saying, making sure she gets some sort of stimulation so she doesn’t deteriorate even faster than she already is, being in charge of all of her bank/money/financial things and writing all checks because she forgot how to spell her name, everything you could possibly imagine. i didn’t know i’d be a parent figure at 20. i live every day in fear of her passing. she’s a dnr/dni and i’m constantly reminded every time i go to the fridge and see the big pink order on our fridge. i wake up constantly throughout the night whether it be because i want to make sure i still hear her breathing, or because she made the slightest noise and i’m praying she’s okay. i live my life in fear of something happening to her. and as a nursing major, of course i am burdened with the knowledge of signs/symptoms of impending death and i hate it more than anything. it makes me so nauseous. i didn’t know i’d be waking up to her screaming for her mother in the middle of the night. i didn’t know i’d wake up to her completely naked and running around because she claimed her dad was trying to kidnap and kill her. i didn’t know that i’d have to learn that the only thing to soothe my sundowning grandmother was to let her into my bed because i convinced her my room was safe and free of any harmful person, only to have her wet my bed because she can’t control it. but i will never ever blame her for that. i’ve sought out a home health nurse to visit her occasionally, but the process takes about 6 months according to her case manager. my mom didn’t see that it would be necessary in 6 months (possibly assuming her mother wouldn’t make it 6 months) and so i’m yet again alone in this. i’m the only person that lives with her. she has 5 children, and innumerable grandchildren/great grandchildren/etc, yet nobody calls her. nobody visits her. nobody cared especially when she was diagnosed. they didn’t care to make time to deal with that.since i’ve quit track due to the situation, and considering that i’m also a commuter, i don’t have any support either besides my incredible boyfriend, but he can’t take on everything i endure.and that’s the thing. i can’t take on everything either, yet i still wake up and attempt to do everything i can every. single. day. no matter how much it destroys me.", god bless you for trying to be all

"i am in a very complicated situation my landlord's mother has some type of mental illness i think that it is dementia but i am not sure because i am not a psychologist or a doctor. i know that she has some type of mental illness because when her daughter aka my landlord dropped her off at my house i noticed that she had some strange behavior she would leave food on the stove walk away forget that it's there until it is burned, she mopped our floors with shampoo and conditioner, and she bought plants from home depot put them in the sink with our dirty dishes and said that she was recycling the water.  i don't know if my landlord is in denial or if she does not want to deal with her mother. but my landlord has dropped her mother off at my house and forced me and my roommate to watch her mother two times. every time i try to talk to her about her mother in a calm professional manner she either ignores me or gives me an excuse. i don't know what to do about this situation i tried talking to a lawyer about this and they said that because i am renting a room in a house i cannot stop her mother from coming onto the property. i don't know what to do about this situation i am thinking about calling adult protective services on my landlord. because i think that my landlord is abusing her mother by dropping her off at our place and forcing us to watch her when she knows that me and my roommate have no mental health training or experience, we have no idea how to take care of her mother and we do not have the time to watch her mother. but she still chose to drop her mom off here. i think that is very irresponsible and shows that she has poor judgement. i know for a fact that her mother is going to accidentally hurt herself or someone else if she does not get the help that she needs. i know for a fact that the law says that if you are a danger to yourself and other people you have to go to a mental health facility. i am worried that if her mother does not get the help that she needs she is going to hurt someone or herself and if that happens she is going to have a cop and a social worker knock on her mother's door and force her to go a mental health hospital. if that happens my landlord is not going to have a single say over where she goes. if the court finds out that my landlord knew about her mother mental illness and did nothing about it then the judge is not going to allow her to be in charge of her mother's care. i don't know about you but i would not want a stranger from the state to have complete control over the type of care my mother receives."," what a crazy situation! i would call adult protective services if it happens again and make sure they know this isn’t the first time. taking care of this lady isn’t part of the lease, so if there’s a next time she comes you can lock up your stuff and leave the house. you are not liable for whatever happens and it will teach your landlord not to do it again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/u0d389/how_did_you_convince_your_loved_one_with_dementia/,How did you convince your loved one with dementia to go to a doctor and get tested for dementia?

"my mom is aging.  she's nearly 70.  i think she's going senile. every day is different with her.  some days are good and then other days are bad and then other days she is middle of the road. my observations on my mom is that she's moody. i don't know what way the wind is going to blow on any given day.  these moods are different every time. some times there are outbursts and then other days there's a complete silence from her. a lot of this stuff makes no sense.  for example, there were times when my brother, an adult, was careless with alcohol and perhaps even drugs. my mom would develop unhappyiness towards him and she would misdirect her anger to me and rage up at me.  as if i encouraged him to drink and take drugs.  i don't and we were polar opposites of each other.   i work hard for a wage but unfortunately it doesn't pay a rent or a mortgage and so i live at home.  i help at home.  my brother was different.  he was unemployed.  we were polar opposites. me, being female my mom saw me as weaker perhaps and she never lashed out at my brother, only me. i am the only one at home paying towards bills and i am mindful of my attitude. i am not sarcastic or critical.  i work hard and often i just keep to myself.  then other times, i would come home to what is complete silence from my mom  no words, no speech or no conversation from her. then there were episodes from my mom where she demonstrated complete senselessness.  like there could be 100s worth of bills due and all she cared about was getting me to shop online for her for new shoes.  then there are episodes where she's behaving as if she wants to be my best friend. then there were times i caught her eavesdropping on my brother. basically i think my mom is going senile.  it's not showing up as a typical forgetfulness that you would associate with dementia and alzheimers.  sometimes there is a forgetfulness but it's mild and hardly noticable.does this sound like dementia? there's definitely something up with her and i think it might be worth exploring the dementia route although it's not showing up as a typical forgetfulness.  last night i came home from work and there might have been an hello but that was it from her. there was no talk or conversation or speech from her. the same tone this morning in the kitchen.  any attempt of conversation was met with one word.  eventually blowing up at me for using a fresh tea towel.  this is usually the pattern of her angry explosions - days of coldness followed eventually by an outburst over nothing.", is she on any medications?  has she started any new ones?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tz1gmn/what_do_i_email_the_doctors/,What do I email the doctors?

"(based in the united states if that helps) this is going to be long and i'm so sorry for that but i wanted to share as much useful info as possible.i strongly suspect that a family friend (70s; m) may be struggling with dementia. he hits all of the marks i've been researching with the exception of hallucinations. this is quite taxing on his wife as she's his primary source of everything (he's very antisocial- always has been- and spends his entire day on the computer). she's been expressing a lot of concern about his short and long term memory, his temper which has always been short but now seems to be on a hair-trigger, and general actions that don't make sense to her; most recently he's purchased a new vehicle which is the biggest concern because if he drives alone, he frequently gets lost and will cruise around for a while until something triggers his memory and he's oriented enough to make his way back.a few other things that bolster our general concern:\-in addition to the vehicle, he's recently purchased an air compressor/pressure washer which he does not know how to use nor does he have the strength to operate it safely. he's also been making tons of amazon purchases (they have more batteries than a literal battery store) that are unnecessary, are incorrect parts for whatever project he's taken to try and fix, or things that he ""needs"" in the moment but by the time it arrives has no idea why he ordered it.\-randomly yells profanities at their alexa system even when she's not offering her opinions, but who hasn't had that urge lol\-he's making *horrific* comments whenever he sees a poc or lgbtq+ person on tv (i used to think getting him out of the house more would be a good idea but with these commentaries, i'm rather relieved that he's a homebody). this as far as i'm aware is new, up until the last year he'd have negative opinions of people for specific things like their behavior, if he felt they were dishonest, things like that, but bringing race and orientation to the table is a definite change.\-he's on a ton of medications for anxiety, depression, ptsd, and physical conditions as well, insulin, testosterone, and something to regulate his blood pressure. he is very protective of these and keeps them locked up so his wife is unsure of what his dosages are or if he's taking them properly. she suspects that based on his extreme mood swings, he's often taking more or less of certain ones though this can't currently be confirmed.\-he's displaying extra caution? paranoia? not sure what to call it but the most recent examples are that he turned their roomba off because his wife wasn't supervising it vacuuming and didn't want a fire to start. same thing with their coffee maker; i started a pot, went to the bathroom, and when i came back to the kitchen, it was unplugged because no one was watching it and he didn't want a fire to start.\-he goes to the va a few times a year for blood pressure/oxygen checkups and a physical. when he's there, they also give him two other tests. one is a clock where the person administering will adjust the time and ask him to tell them what time it is; the other is a series of words they tell him and then ask him to repeat them back. he completes both the clock and the words perfectly every time.\-when he leaves these appointments, he says that he doesn't remember what the doctors told him and has thus far refused to allow his wife to accompany him into the exam room for her to track their questions/answers and any info the doctors may share. she'd like to request that he have a more thorough mind exam (i'm sorry, that may be incorrect terminology) but the one time she asked that of them, they said they couldn't unless he requested it. she scheduled an appointment for him at a non-va facility which he refused to go to since it wasn't through the va.so that's where we stand right now. our concern is growing daily and we feel backed into a corner because we aren't sure how to move forward in getting the help he may need. happy to answer any questions or expand on anything that's unclear in the comments.", i'm in a similar place to you with a parent.  it's early.  i think she's going senile.  there's some action ls that would indicate she wants as much control over everything no matter how minor and nonsensical it is.  then there's a lot of different angry outbursts and other stuff that doesn't make any sense.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tyo60i/maybe_dementia_if_so_where_do_you_go_to_get_an/,"Maybe dementia?

"hi all, thanks for taking the time to read. my dad has been getting more forgetful recently, he's in his 70's and, due to a bad knee has taken some falls resulting in impacts to his head. such accidents aren't helpful and he refuses to get it addressed privately (knee replacement), despite having the funds to do so.just the other day, he forgot some vocabulary along the lines of ""keyboard"" and ""laptop"", substituting them with ""button pad"" and ""box"". he's been using computers for a good deal of his professional life and, even in retirement, he has constant exposure. other signs are to do with forgetting plans made between us and an inability to understand some simpler concepts like the uk being in nato (he worked as a journalist for many years so he knows this stuff and we've spoken at length about it, in addition to doing embassy work as an advisor etc...).i've told him, repeatedly, that he needs to spend some money on himself for his own wellbeing and i'd feel better if a neurologist could examine him. he seems resistant to the idea though (again, not wanting to spend money). here in the uk, it would be a miracle if the nhs came through for us (waiting times for his knee op alone are at the five year mark and it's only now we're seeing movement on that front). he seems happy to discuss power of attorney matters with me but my concern is that unless he exhibits some agency over things, it's going to seem like i'm making decisions for him.am i overreacting, how would you go about addressing this?"," get the power of attorney locked in now. you don't have to do anything with it until you really need to. my father was too far gone when we tried to do it. he thought we were in cahoots with the people who were getting in through the wifi and changing the actors in his movies (like putting bruce willis in as the lead in gran torino). he would just not do anything related to power of attorney. had to wait until he was in a home before we could do it without him. the next bit is a little grim. ask what he wants at his funeral. my father told me 3 main things he wanted before he was too far gone so i was able to organise that for him. later on if your father starts to argue about things, don't try to convince him counter to his argument. in that state nothing you say is right and only serves to aggravate the situation. you can get landline phones with big buttons you can put pictures of people's faces on which helps. consider an outside motion sensitive camera that alerts your phone so you will know if he goes wandering. one last thing, get him a neck chain or bracelet with name, address, pertinent phone numbers on it. get him used to always wearing it now. apart from all that just realise it is a one way street and he will not get better. i just tried my best to roll with it. as happens to a lot of people that go into nursing homes, he died shortly (only 3 months) after he was admitted. basically do as much as you can now before it's too late, organise things for the future and spend a lot of time with him, photos and video etc, and do some bucket list stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tygad6/dad_has_early_symptoms_of_dementia_how_to_address/,"Dad has early symptoms of dementia, how to address?"
"tldr: i’m concerned how my mom will fare when we don’t visit since since a bit anti-social, yet complains she doesn’t just want to watch tv all day.my mom (moderate to severe dementia) just finished her first week at her al facility. for all accounts she’s adjusted well to the living conditions (likes her new “apartment”, staff and her are getting a decent routine in place for her basic needs). up to now i’ve been pretty involved - going every day at least a few hours - which i think has been valuable in terms of communicating to staff all her unique patterns of behaviors and best ways to interact with her. i think it would have taken weeks otherwise and my mom would have had a much worse time in the process.now i’d like to work towards cutting the cord a bit. i still want to visit her often, but i can’t spend hours every day. the few days i’ve been around less she’s complained about being bored. before the move she wasn’t doing anything but watching tv, so this new arrangement isn’t much different. she didn’t really have friends, and her social interactions were just the at home caregivers. at the al she doesn’t get lots of 1:1 time with the staff, they mostly come on demand or in regular intervals to meet her needs. the al facility has full days of activities, some which i think she’d like. but she’s never been a joiner, and now in her condition she’s really anxious too.any advice on how others here have helped similar family members integrate better into the more general activity structure of the al facility? in the short term i’m going to accompany her to some events which hopefully she’ll enjoy and then want to do again (although she may not remember!). i was also considering hiring a companion, but that can get real expensive real fast."," wow this sounds exactly like my current situation.   my dad went into the memory care facility  on march 21st.   by all accounts the first few days were pretty tough on him but he seems to be acclimating a bit better now.   our first visit was on the 31st (we stayed away at first as recommended by the facility directors) and my mom and i have visited every day since for several hours.   visiting frequently has been helpful in getting to know the staff, but not helpful for his ""social life"".   dad is a pretty quiet, anti-social type of guy, but at the same time he is scared to death of being left alone.   we want him to be a part of the community and join in on the activities as much as possible.   but when we visit all he wants to do is watch tv in his room with us.   leaving to go home at the end of the afternoon has become particularly difficult as he always wants to go with us, even if he doesn't necessarily know who we are or where we are going.   everyday feels like a new 'abandonment'.  yesterday was the first day we haven't visited as we think 'cutting the cord' a bit may be helpful in getting him out of the room more.   we want our visits to be less of a daily scheduled visit, and a bit more random to keep him on his toes and not expect us every day.   i wish i had more words of advice, but i too am a beginner in the world of memory care.   just wanted to share my situation and let you know there are others in the same boat.     if you find any helpful tips, send them my way please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tyfzmz/advice_for_less_social_mom_at_assisted_living/,Advice for less social mom at assisted living

"hi everyone! we just sent my aunt who is 86 years old to a senior living care facility because her sundowning was getting severe and it was beginning to be too much for my mother to handle.after she settled in at the facility my brother and i came down from out of town to visit her. they let her sleep over my parents house so we could all spend time. everything was perfectly fine. she was super happy to hang out with us and spend time with my daughter, but after we dropped her off she became very disoriented in the following days and her sundowning became a lot worse.i know she misses us and we miss her as well, but the owner of the facility told my mom that it probably wasn’t a good idea that we took her out for that weekend because she just got lonelier afterwards. they advised us not to call or pick up her calls and to limit her visits once a month. i am all for doing anything to make my aunt as comfortable as she can be, but it really doesn’t sit well with me that she is at a facility by herself and we can’t even talk to her. i don’t want her to think we left her and neglected her. she practically raised me, my brother and my cousins and it doesn’t feel right in my heart to do what the facility tells us.my question to anyone who has experienced this: is what they’re saying the right thing to do? will it make it worse for my aunt if we contacted and visited her more because it will just make her lonelier? if it does then i have no problem backing off like they’re asking. sorry if this post was too long!tldr; my aunt’s sundowning got worse after we visited. facility told us to stop contacting her and only visit once a month. wondering if that’s the right thing to do.", being told not to visit or call is bull! a possible red flag!,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/twoj20/my_aunt_with_dementia/,My aunt with dementia…
"so i have a good friend who is older, just turned 70 actually. i work actually work a lot with people with dementia so it's pretty normalized to me and 70 doesn't seem that old to me either. anyway, i've been noticing my friend bring up the same things a lot. we talk a lot about spirituality (buddhist) and we both read a lot, so we end up sharing a lot on the stuff we read and such. but over the last several months he has mentioned and sent me emails (at least 2) about an natural art thing he once saw in spain. i don't think he realized at all how many times he has told me about it, shown me pictures, sent me stuff on the web. etc. the same is true for a couple other things--one is a ted talk about a book he likes. he must have sent me the ted talk three times now and mentioned the book every time we talk. i saw him recently and he once again sent me a link to the ted talk. should i tell him he's sent these things before? he has some health issues which may be effecting his memory slowly and there's not much he can do about it. i feel like if i tell him he will just worry about something he can't change. it's also not that dramatic--like this is pretty small stuff to be forgetting too."," there's no harm in mentioning that they sent it to you before, and you enjoyed reading it. they know something is going on. they know they aren't remembering things.depending on how close you are to them, you can suggest when they go in for their checkup with their doctor, that they ask the doc to do a memory evaluation. there is a lot that can be done, if it is caught early, to help slow the decline.early detection is important. so if you really like this person, help push them in the direction they already know they need to go. they aren't just forgetting things with you... other people have noticed and mentioned it too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/twn2rp/when_do_i_say_something_should_i/,When do I say something ?

"i just got here. i've been dealing with my mum's advancing dementia for years now--with a major increase since the start of the pandemic--but i found this sub only today. my mother is 82 years old, and, to judge by the guides and charts and things that i see online, she's in either late sixth or early seventh stage dementia. this time a year ago, she was hostile and angry a lot of the time; blamed me for most of everything, mostly about where she was. that's pretty well passed, i'm happy to say, and now she's a lot quieter. she's tired most of the time and won't last more than an hour or so at a visit. i'm luckier than some here in that i'm not a full-time caregiver. my wife and i are the only ones local to my mum, so we make all the visits--at least half of which are generally spent changing her and getting her cleaned up. unfortunately, my mum isn't in a top-flight facility because she didn't save a whole lot of retirement money, and the u.s. is a pretty terrible place to be old and not have your wits fully about you. we do what we can, and the staff is nice and caring, but they're just too few. i've got one sibling who is out of state and pretty much stopped visiting when my mum started going downhill. it's been almost four years since she visited. i think she just can't handle it.anyway, i originally came here to ask about how you all speak or interact with a parent who is almost unable to speak or interact in any meaningful way, anymore. i've found one thing to do is to read to my mum. she was always an avid reader, throughout her whole life, but she's pretty well stopped now, and her attention span and comprehension are poor now. the other day, i pulled an old book off my shelf that i knew she loved as a child--""the house at pooh corner"" by a.a. milne. i've been reading it to her, and she seems to like it. (i do the voices.) i was wondering if anyone had suggestions for other ways to interact/things to read because we're nearing the end of the book. i'll confess i feel a little lost as to how to deal with it all. anyway, thanks to everyone for writing your posts here and sharing your experiences, your frustrations, your fears, your anxiety, and everything else. it honestly helps to know that there are others on the same journey."," i don't really have much to offer that hasn't been said (music is the one thing i would have offered up, esp if your mum was into music at all) but i feel the same about this sub. i'm not at a place where i can be super helpful yet, as i'm really just starting to learn for myself, but the resources here have been great even in lurk mode, and agreed that just not feeling so alone in the struggle helps somehow. i'm an only child dealing with this, and it sounds like you might as well be in this case. it's hard to feel like you're the only person that can do anything even if you don't have her at home. some help would definitely be nice. you seem like a wonderfully caring child with patience and grace though - ngl i teared up a little at the ""i do the voices"" aside, bc that's such a lovely detail. your mum may not realize it now, **but you're doing a great job**.  i'm so sorry for the conditions where your mum is; you're totally right that the us is a terrible place to be old or infirm in any capacity. not sure if this will make you feel better or not, but i can tell you that even in the more expensive facilities it's not that much better to be honest. understaffing is still a constant issue that disrupts their ability to offer the kind of care they should be doing. my mom is in the best location in her area that we can find (they have some money they came into not too long ago that will be gone before too much longer probably, but we'll spend it all if we have to), and i have the same issue with the fact that the people that do work there are kind and caring and lovely, but pressing the nurse button often means waiting 20 minutes or more because there just aren't enough people, which is just... awful to me, especially when it means my mom needs to be cleaned up rather than helped to the toilet. but it's still better than the level of care that i or my 83 year old stepdad could provide at home in a very real way, so it is what it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/twlq7w/thank_you_for_all_your_posts/,Thank you for all your posts

(he weighs just as much as i do and he’s taller, so i can’t lift him up) finally came my dad and he helped him up. grandpa had stood in the bathroom for only who knows how long and collapsed. he obviously doesn’t remember what he was doing or why he was in there for so long. i feel like he’s been declining quickly the past few months. but he never got officially diagnosed. the doctor just said “he’s got some dementia”. so all in all we don’t even know where he’s at on the stages. sigh. unfortunately i think the next step is a home.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/tw7cd3/first_fall_at_our_house/,First fall at our house

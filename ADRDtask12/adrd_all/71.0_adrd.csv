"my mother was diagnosed with ftd (frontotemporal degeneration) several years ago and i’ve just recently learned that if it was caused by a genetic mutation then my chances of also having it are 50%. has anybody gone through the process of genetic testing when there’s a family history? if so, can you tell me what your experience was?"," after three years of trying hard to get a diagnosis, with a radiated glucose pet/ct scan they said my wife had lewy bodies. two years later based on my wife’s symptoms, the neurologist said he thought she had ftd. he ordered the dna tests and a cholesterol test (she also has heart issues). all that was involved was 3 or 4 vials of blood drawn. they came back negative.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q8baz6/ftd_genetic_testing/,FTD Genetic Testing?

"my father is not an old man. he isn't even 70 yet.he's a stubborn, old school biker, who is decompensating rapidly these days.i wasn't aware of how bad things had gotten until my brother called me to say that our dad's neighbor called bc our dad was wandering up and down the street and didn't know where he lived. he was giggling like a teenage girl, massively uncharacteristic for our gruff n tuff father.i live out of state, and moving back honestly wouldn't be much help, as he lives in the middle of the woods and i don't know how to drive. and honestly? i don't know if i could emotionally handle the times when he gets to be emotionally and verbally abusive. he made one very cutting comment to me at my last visit and it wrecked me. not just because it was hurtful, but bc i knew my father would never, and yet, here he was.we're working on getting a surrogate poa, bc i was told by his local courts that the poa could only be signed if he was aware of what he is signing. which he clearly isn't. it's been this awful back and forth of always thinking we are about to get him somewhere safe and then it falls through.i've been working with long term care services org for over a year now, and up until i lost my shit and yelled at the case manager, nothing at all had been accomplished except having some meals brought to his home. my outburst led to him finally getting a caregiver, who is usually works with hospice patients and met with my father as a favor. she was so moved by how rough things are, how nice and grateful he was, and who he is, that she decided to keep helping. she even comes out on her days off to make sure he takes his meds.recently she had to leave town and he started cherry picking his meds again (he only takes the ones that fuck him up, bc old hardwired addict behavior, though he's been sober for many years now)he's depressed. he managed to rack up a bill for several thousand dollars with the cable company, so unless we cover that, he doesn't have television. he cannot read anymore. they finally took away his driver's license, because he was bored and just driving in circles all day, burning gas and time. all the while having dizzy spells.his house is rotting out from underneath him, but he refuses to leave. multiple times now we have secured placement for him, only to have him refuse, vehemently. only recently did his absolutely useless pcp acknowledge the diagnosis of dementia, after forgetting that he even referred him to neuro. this man was rx'ing benzos to a man in his 60's with multiple tbis, without even considering how it could be advancing his dementia, until i started protesting it and pointing out how harmful this is. his office rarely responds to the case managers request for home health etc.  i knew it was vascular dementia due to tbi for a long while. and i've pressed relentlessly for this dx, which we finally got. it's been a fucking roller coaster, man.he can't pay his bills bc he keeps blowing all his money, cannot tell us where it's going, and then showing up at my brother's work (up to 7x per day) to ask for money. which my brother gives him bc he wants to help, and my dad is always saying things like ""my water is going to get shut off if i don't give them $200 today"" and then the money vanishes and the bill remains unpaid.while my brother is local, he works full time+ side jobs to provide for his wife and two children under the age of 2. he's beat down. and his relationship with my dad is frayed at best d/t my father calling him up to 60x a day (sometimes at his place of work) to try to manipulate him or guilt him into things. so he just doesn't have the bandwidth to try and care for him after 7 years of trying to clean up his messes since our mother died in the accident that caused the first tbi. (another accident, two years later, with identical injuries made this worse. and his refusal to do any ot or pt afterward was...bad)i have been struggling to get the few members of my family who know what is going on, to understand that he isn't just being a dick. this is an illness.all of the guys from my dad's former mc vanished. exhausted by him and his house, and all he did for them for so many years now magically means nothing. no one comes to visit. and they may have tried to call but he kept going to the kiosk at walmart and getting burner phones without minute plans, so he just had like 15 cell phones stacked in the house, with no way to reach anyone, until i got a landline installed at his house in my name so they would turn it on w/o having to pay off a debt he has with them that we cant afford.i finally got on his bank account to help get his bills paid/keep his utilities on via online banking. he's been to the ed 6 times in the last two weeks. yesterday, we had another beam of hope when he called an ambulance (he's been doing this a lot lately bc he's having a ton of anxiety and depression bc his mother just died around the anniversary of his wife's death, and he knows but doesn't know how to process emotions anymore. he also has a heart condition, thyroid issues, copd, htn) and his care giver raced to the hospital with an action plan. his heart rate has frequently been below 60bpm, hold him for 72hrs in the cardiac unit, and then d/c him to a med rehab facility that he agreed to go to for two weeks, to get his medications managed and help him get leveled out again, and from there get him placed in a permanent memory care unit. except the hospital looked at all of this information, including his dementia dx, and that he lives alone in the woods, ignored the care plan. and discharged him home in cab. absolute negligence. i am so heart broken. i'm trying so hard to get him the help he needs, knowing he would be better not being alone all the time, bc that's destroying him. and it always falls through.advice is good and welcome, but i mostly just feel so so so alone in this and thought maybe, somewhere on the internet there would be other people dealing with this too who could make that feeling a bit less.thank you."," are you in the u.s.? i'm surprised adult protective services hasn't stepped in and pursued guardianship. it sounds like he need a state appointed guardian because you and your brother are neglecting to provide the care he needs. your post has a fair amount of blame and excuses. it seems like you don't really want to help or what you are willing to do is very limited and definitely falls short of what he needs. this is a case of neglect. if you don't want to do what's necessary, or you can't do it, then at least contact adult protective services so the state can step in. even if your dad is a jerk, he deserves better than this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q890us/stubborn_parent_with_dementia_out_of_state/,[deleted by user]

"has anyone found that any additional health issue made your loved one especially unbalanced? for example taking an antibiotic or being constipated or even a rash seems to make the ""wheels come off"" and makes the caregiving much more challenging. today, i am much better at jumping on any of these seeming minor issues because i know they make things so much more confused. i hate to admit this but when i was first thrown into this role, i once let a blister that was totally debilitating go for almost 3 months. i did not realize it was just a bad part of sneakers rubbing the same area, and i left them alone in the bathroom ( ah the good olde days) and they over and over again, removed protective skin with sharp scissors, rubbed in any ( and i mean any) sort of cream that they found in the bathroom into the wound and continued to wear the offending shoes. and their world crumbled during this time by spending hours "" tending"" this out of control blister. anyone else find this?"," dehydration is our main struggle. some days it is a battle to get her to drink enough. and she'll be wobbly if she does not drink enough, which increases risk of falls.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q853lx/complications/,Complications?
"we haven't had anybody with dementia in our family so we are not sure how it starts and what it's like.my grandma is 80 years old. well, even when she was in her 50s, she loved to exaggerate everything about herself and her family - how good looking or educated they were, that she was more important and loved than she actually was etc., but now it's getting worse and worse.most of the times she comes up with stories related to celebrities, famous people, whatever she sees on tv etc.a couple of examples:1. there was some economics expert speaking on radio. when his name was announced, she claimed she knows him very well, and that he was his lecturer at the university. the guy is 40 yeard old max. he wasn't even born when grandma went to college. we tried to explain this calmly, but she just got upset and didn't change her story.2. our distant relative (joe)  is a politician and has worked with the prime minister of our country. grandma claims that when she was at the funeral  of joe's dad, she hang out with the prime minister and his wife, she sat in their car, they drove to the graveyard together and had a nice chat on the way. the pm and his wife did not attend the funeral and grandma did not meet them at all. it this a sign of dementia, what should we expect next and how fast does it progress?"," if you're looking for an actual diagnosis, i would suggest that you start with your grandma's primary care physician and then maybe they will refer her to a neurologist if further testing is necessary or desired.  like others have mentioned, arguing or telling grandma that what she truly believes to be true is not true won't really do anyone any good.  you can find more information to help friends and family members by looking at teepa snow's organization, positive approach to care.

"i was wondering if i could get some opinions from you guys.  about five years ago i noticed my starting to lose her memory but it wasn't too bad.  last year at this time i took her to doctor and he sent her for a geriatric assessment.  at the time they assessed her with mild cognitive impairment.  it's now been a year and i noticed things about the same until about last month when i noticed her memory taking a turn for the worst.  we decided to sell her house which did last tuesday and got an apartment for her.  she still independent enough to be able to drive, do her laundry keep her house clean but she cannot do any complex tasks which means the selling of her old house, cleaning the old place out, getting her a new apartment, getting insurance is all up to me to do.  she is moving to apartment where two of her friends or she will have some support but i doubt she will be able to live independently for more than a year.  mainly she is doing okay'ish but i am worried how the new apartment which has 15 floors will be for her.  will she able to park her car in the right place, will she know what key does what, will she able to find her apartment etc....she mainly has a problem with memory in terms of dates.  she knows she is moving in november but not the date, she knows the closing of her old house is in december but not the date.  she remembers her friends name but sometimes has to search for while to find the name or she repeats the same question 5 times (did you feed the dog as an example).  she also starts crying when the simplest thing goes wrong (cannot find her iphone as an example).  her life will be big time simplified in the apartment since we got rid of almost everything and bought some new furniture, all bills will be auto withdrawn etc.... i know its hard to say but how is this going to progress.  do you think she will get a year or two in that apartment before she needs to live with me.  what does life expectancy look like for people with dementia.  i understand its hard to say because every situation is different so anecdotal experience is appreciated as well.", it sounds like you are doing a great job moving her into an easier to manage space if you really think things are progressing you might consider if it is safe for her to drive. a moment of confusion behind the wheel could result in a very bad situation. only you know how capable she is and can best judge her ability to react quickly and to make decisions behind the wheel. she is lucky to have you looking out for her and planning for her next phase of life.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q81ddt/what_should_i_expect_my_72_year_old_mom/,What should I expect my 72 year old mom?

"hi everyone,i'm living with/caring for my elderly father who was diagnosed with dementia in april 2021. there have been good days and bad days, but the last few weeks have been especially difficult.dad has gone from being an upbeat, ebullient and considerate parent to a bitter, angry, resentful shadow of his former self. most of his new behaviour has manifested as verbal abuse, and i've repeatedly been called ignorant, arrogant, money-grubbing, weak...well, it goes on and on. i'm also supposedly part of a grand conspiracy which has gone through the family and is spearheaded by his ex-wife, from whom he divorced 30 years ago.this latest turn started about three weeks ago, when i told dad that i was being considered for a new job that would require me to move interstate, and that we'd have to line up alternative living arrangements for him. this was entirely too much for him to process and i'd politely sit through his spray at least twice a day for weeks. i ended up withdrawing from consideration for the job because i just couldn't see a way forward that would keep him happy.so, here i am. it's not a bad life by any means - i have a good job (even if it isn't in a career i particularly want to pursue), a relatively nice house, and enough financial security to tie me over in case things get actually bad. but i'm going through the constant motions of feeling angry, guilty, jilted, and sad. it's not like i have to tell you, but it's so mentally and emotionally taxing.i can't tell you how liberating it feels to find a community with people that share my experience. i've scrolled through posts for the past 30 minutes and there have been so many instances that i can intimately and painfully relate to. thank you for being here. it's so wonderful to have found you."," i feel ya. my dad has definitely pulled some half-assed shit having several visual seizures and shifting all guilt, blame (and even not allowing me to stay with him when i fly into town). in all honesty, part of the reason is i don't like putting up with garbage and there's a new step-mom in the picture who wants to see me go down in flames as an adult. in general, he's become ""mr. magoo"" -- just a grumpy, disorganized, judgmental man in his late 60s. in fact, i think it's gone to the point where other family members and friends have stopped trusting him because he's been such a p.i.t.a. for so long. and yes, he does talk shit behind my back to other family members as well and has the constant mantra of ""deny, deny, deny."" and if i don't agree with him in any way over the phone, he'll threaten to hang up. i'm sorry, i can't get used to this at all, and he's lately become a major distraction. too much, too soon.understood people need to be patient with this stuff, but his projection and lack of support especially with my mom's mom (eg: grandmother) recently passing away, step-mom moving in and taking over my room, and his general aloofness is taking a toll on me. he's clearly not even close to being the same person he was even a decade ago. yet my new step-mom let's him get away with anything he wants.i'm a bit more critical about this because i definitely do think the wrong resources now living with him (step-mom) allow him to get away with whatever he wants in potential favor of swallowing up eventual assets. they've also succumbed to extreme favoritism for certain family and friends and sectioned off of people who (together) they don't identify with. it's obviously driven by her, but he lets it slide. and every time i talk to him on the phone he sounds like a vegetable. i mean jesus h. christ, he gives me shit for staying up late but his sleeping pattern is going to bed at 8pm and waking up at 4am? who does this?it's got to the point where he can't remember things from half a decade ago and ""finger points"" slash blame shifting whenever he can. he's become so inconsistent, but also unreliable and goony. and every time i get on the phone with him to try to have an honest chat, it turns into a pointless lecture and i get really frustrated.sorry, i know some people are the type who are laid back and let it happen, but i really can't. it's so insane that things have gone downhill mentally so fast and he just lets it all happen while semi throwing my reputation under the bus. plus he's got a black tooth which he refuses to remove affecting his brain.reading some of the other comments, question: where does the ""step-mom defiance"" and ""dementia dad"" biases (who are now merged) end? i know people want to cut breaks for these folks, but there's a dividing line of someone who's a cranky old man with dementia and someone with dementia who really wants you around. i unfortunately don't have the latter.over the last year, we've gone into so many verbal fights where extended friends and family shrug it off and i take it personally. those groups always say ""oh, be easy on him because he's had it rough"" but not entirely. there seems like there is a bizarre stage of dementia where they're still functional (for the most part, they don't dress well and bump into things but overall ok) but also just so pissy, neurotic, mean, doubtful, and inconsistent. it's come to a point where you really don't recognize any personality close to the person who once helped you grow up as a kid and into early adulthood. i also don't think his living environment was ever conducive to managing expectation upon retirement 10+ years ago. basically just surrounded in a tenement by bitchy old people. no room for mental growth = decline.and yes, i don't think it's uncommon that after a while, the behavioral patterns for them are so off-balance  that you might start to really not like them. and it's simply because you cannot relate to them anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q7subx/im_so_glad_to_have_found_you_all/,I'm so glad to have found you all.

"by the age of 19, i had suffered 6 major concussions where i lost consciousness (most from rugby). i know it was foolish, i am literally living with the consequences. after my last concussion in dec 2015, i was in the hospital for over two weeks due to loss of cognitive abilities while my brain healed. i struggled so badly with post concussion syndrome, i medically withdrew from college in march. i was on bed rest for over two months and went through intense concussion therapy spending $$$. i got a job as a server when i was finally cleared for work and since have moved up to management. 9 months after the last concussion, i was told by my neurologist it was very lucky i would be exhibiting dementia symptoms by age 40 due to the damage to my brain and other family genetics, at the time even classifying me as stage 2 of dementia. i am now 24 and strongly feeling the effects of my brain injury, i am generally lost, forgetful, exhausted, confused, can’t get the right word out. i am seeing my neurologist in 2 weeks but she told me today on the phone to be prepared, i would likely have to go through quite a bit of testing as i may have progressed into stage 3 and should bring a support person with me. i feel so terribly lost. i don’t know if this is the place for this but i truly don’t know anyone who can relate. stage 4 is when actual diagnosis comes. i have yet to have kids, get married, buy a house. i realized today i won’t even be old enough for a nursing home. so this is my shout out into the void, tips, words, suggestions would all be greatly appreciated. i wish all of the best for you and your loved ones during this time in all of our lives that brought us to this sub."," long time lurker... first time poster.i'm 33/male. also have 5 major tbis.i have issues, but honestly i actually like this version of me. something got rattled the last time that changed a lot of how my brain works. i also worked as a motorsports announcer for about 10 years (monster trucks/motocross) and getting ""your bell rung"" was common in both sports. i can say i absolutely can spot cte, and i likely have it to some degree as you likely do too. the good news is, i only know of one straight up stereotypical cte suicide for my industry which is absolutely remarkable considering the prevalence in the nfl. so what i'm getting at here is the old timers who were around long before i was born are still functional in their late 50s and some into their late 60s now. their body gives up before their brain does. what i can say is this... stop dying. just stop. you can absolutely tell death to fuck off if you do it with enough resolve. stand firm, do not give up. keep going!now with all that being said... i do not function without amphetamine based add medications. my condition is similar to cfs but with add and depression. stimulants basically do something that allows my brain to work. i've tried coming off and my memory immediately starts to decline even post withdrawal. like an idiot i got myself put on lorazepam for stim related sleep issues and that shit did more brain damage than any head injury. i lost the ability to play guitar and sign and i've done both my entire life. so avoid that for sure. i got off that (horrible withdrawal) and within months regained my sense of rhythm. so enough rambling. i'm guessing you're female. get your ferritin checked!i had non-anemic iron deficiency that presented exactly like what you just described. you're well spoken and concise, so i just can't agree with cte or dementia related to tbi. as a male iron deficiency isn't as common, but some ridiculously high percentage (like 70%) of women are mildly clinically iron deficient.iron is the most abundant mineral in the brain and it is also critical to thyroid function. regular ""blood work"" does not include the only number that really matters and that is ferritin. i had even lost my sense of smell i was so deficient. one day i walked out of the hotel and i smelled ""fall"" for the first time in years. getting my iron up also allowed me to cut my adderall dosage in half. seriously ferritin is the word you're looking for. if you don't know what that is yet, i'm telling you low ferritin feels exactly like what i imagine dying feels like. every single one of my systems started shutting down and my brain couldn't even function long enough to explain it. i went from oilfield mechanic working 90 hrs a week to sleeping 22 hours a day even with adderall in less than 6 months. i had donated blood one and had a major blood  loss event in that 6 months. by the grace of god the word ferritin somehow the got dropped in my lap because i wasn't ""anemic"" but my brain and all of my other organs were out of iron almost entirely. my ferritin was below the test cut off level meaning that whatever measurement they got wasn't even enough to register well enough for the number to he valid.  i can't even describe how it felt because my brain just didn't record much of that summer. i don't remember much of 2015.seriously... keep going. fml this was waaaay too long

"thanks everyone for the advice on my previous posti just got married recently, and it was honestly the best day ever. it was luckily a good day for my mom. there were a few minor snags (she followed me to my first look photos with my husband-to-be while my dad was distracted lol) but otherwise she had a really great time.for anyone planning something similar, here's what helped:1. professional hair and makeup services. i was advised against this by someone in the thread, but my dad had been stressing the f out trying to buy my mom makeup. it was a relief for both of them to have it taken care of, and she looked so beautiful.2. reception in a hotel with rooms on site,. i tried and failed to convince my dad to get a room for the night, but he did take my key for the wedding suite so mum could have a rest halfway through dinner. she came back for dancing and had a blast!3. my dad called my aunts and uncles to let them know what was going on. even with fair warning my mum's siblings were quite shocked, it would have been really bad if they'd tried to keep it a secret like they had originally planned.4. talking to my vendors ahead of time. the venue coordinator knew to ask my dad or mother in law any questions, and not to bother my mum. my photographer was awesome, and got a ton of great shots of my mum.5. making sure guest communication is going through me or my fiance. it's not uncommon for people to communicate through the mother of the bride (i've been guilty of that). so i made sure to proactively email everyone, distribute my phone number, figure out the addresses on my own or with help from my aunts, uncles and cousins, etc. make it easier for people to use the right communication channels.6. more than one designated ""helper"". my dad was with my mum all day before the ceremony, then my brother and cousin helped out through the first half of the reception. unfortunately it meant my immediate family left the reception quite early, but i was glad to have everyone there.that was a very long post, but i hope it helps others to have loved ones participate in major life events. i'm so happy we got to have these mother-daughter moments together, even if it wasn't exactly what i'd originally envisioned for my wedding day."," congratulations! i’m so glad this went well for you, we made the mistake of only designating one ‘helper’ at my wedding and the person ended up leaving early causing some minor havoc for the following few hours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q6ytk4/update_mom_with_early_dementia_at_my_wedding/,Update: mom with early dementia at my wedding

, whoa! there is a huge leap to not understanding how open air tv works and dementia or cognitive decline.  i grew up in an area that did not have cable tv until my tweens.  at that time our tv was analog (a dial) and in order to get the new stations we had to get a digital receiver that attached to our tv.  we had to use this until we bought a new tv with a built in receiver.  from the time that cable came to town everyone associated tv with that cable that came into the house.  i ditched cable approximately 10yrs ago and put up an antenna to get my tv channels and many people have visited me since then and are surprised that tv is still available without cable.  there was a lot of confusion when we did the original transfer from antenna to cable - it almost seemed like we were losing free tv and had to go to cable. in my opinion free tv is a posting for til and you’ll find out lots of people don’t have a grasp on this.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q6w8b8/is_it_possible_for_a_woman_born_in_the_1940s/,"Is it possible for a woman born in the 1940's didn't get cable TV until the 1980's (when it was still called ""pay TV"") would be unaware that the Big 3 networks ABC/NBC/CBS was (and still is) free with an antenna?

"so this is my first post on reddit..ever. i just need some insight. this might be long..my lovely grandma is 85 years old and diagnosed about 3 years ago. it’s been an incredibly fast decline and at times, really ugly. she has always been a woman who had her ducks in a row. meaning even before any diagnosis, her wishes had been on paper. she wanted to move to a care facility if anything happened to her to prevent any “burden” on living family.while she was still cognitive, she picked out a long term care facility she loved. it had stages of living, meaning she moved into an apartment that was taken care of by her., still paying bills and driving.within 6 months, she had to be moved to the second level of care, giving up the apartment, and into “assisted living”. wrecked her car (in the parking garage thank god) and was leaving the stove on. then quickly after the move she started heavily hallucinating pretty terrible things. afraid she was going to be raped by the strange men who were in her room. seeing my father (her son) who had passed a year before. seeing her father who passed many years ago. she’d hide her belongings around the facility, yell at different residents because she thought they were going to hurt her. — it’s worth mentioning she still knew who family was and could carry conversations, and even knew she was seeing and feeling things that weren’t real. somehow, within a few months, she seemed to get better. not much hallucinating, better attitude. not as scared and honestly seemed somewhat happy. i was beside myself with how up and down she was. we thought we were losing her and then all the sudden, she was back to just being confused sometimes.last year after some months of doing better, covid happened. all contact from outside the facility stopped and the hallucinating began again. also, her speech completely changed too. almost overnight she was using the wrong words while talking and i’d say you understood the conversation she was trying to have 50% of the time. she refused any communication with technology; phones or tablets scared her. after discussing with the facility, moving from assisted living to memory care was the next step. she was also put on aricept and a few other meds for depression. things seemed to improve when the facility was taken off lockdown this year because vaccines started. residents were allowed out of their rooms and were able to visit family as long as 6 foot distances were maintained.when regular visits resumed we were pretty shocked at the decline we saw in person. she wasn’t violently hallucinating anymore but this was way different. she knew only my mother’s face but remembered no one. complete word salad. she’d talk a lot but nothing made sense. just random words. she started taking things from her room and would put it in others rooms and started to act child-like in her demeanor. carrying stuffed animals. getting visibly angry, and even resorting to throwing books at nurses and tried slapping a male resident. we weren’t prepared for another mental change so quickly 😭fast forward to 3 weeks ago. her primary doctor brought up hospice with my mother who controls every aspect of her care and has done so even before any significant decline. again, my grandmother wanted everything handled before she wasn’t able to mentally make sound choices including my mom making all decisions. they decided taking her off all her meds and there won’t be any life saving procedures done in the event of something happening. all she is on now is a thyroid med, vicodin for pain as needed and ativan when needed.she drinks a few ensures a day when she is reminded. but only weighs about 90lbs (3 years ago she was 150lbs ish) she still walks laps around the facility daily, though. she’s had some falls but with her lack of speech, isn’t able to tell anyone what happened or if she’s hurt. she showers mostly on her own but needs help getting dressed sometimes. about a month ago she dressed herself in 5 layers of clothing but needed help taking them all back off. that kind of thing. i’m not really sure what i’m looking for here except maybe just to vent. 😔 does hospice care seem like the right call? i watched my father die from cancer and he was put on hospice 3 days before he took his last breath so i knew it was coming. do people ever come off of hospice care? anyone’s loved one still seem “strong” despite being on hospice? was being taken off meds helpful to quality of life? i know everyone’s journey is different i just don’t know what to expect. but i guess none of us do in the end 😕if anything, thank you if you read this far and i’m praying for everyone here to find some peace ♥️"," my dad passed away last night from a long battle with vascular dementia. back in august, they recommend we put him in hospice care after he had another stroke and another heart attack. my mother and siblings declined, and wanted him to go to rehab instead. i get it, they were in denial, they thought he'd improve with rehab. whereas i, having been through this before with my in-laws, understood that the suggestion of hospice care meant the end was near and it was time to shift focus to comfort care. i'll confess to you that i'm a bit angry that i was overruled and dad went into rehab instead. every rehab session left him more and more exhausted-- as well as frustrated. so much could have been avoided, had he just gone directly to hospice back in august. because he was in rehab, not hospice, when he became unresponsive they rushed him to the er. there were a few hours of limbo-- not knowing would he die right there in the er, or somewhere more comfortable. we were ""lucky"" that they eventually admitted him to in-hospital hospice, where he died a few hours later. so from august to now, he's been transferred to one hospital or facility to another a total of 5 times (initial er, then to cardiac unit two states away -- where we had the initial hospice discussion---, then to rehab, then to er again, then to in-hospital hospice). that's a lot. had we agreed to hospice in august, that would have been only 2 transfers, both back in august.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q6srpt/hospice_care_but_seems_strong/,Hospice care but seems “strong”?

"has anyone else noticed this, so my mom( dad and i) take care of my grandma once a month and i’ve noticed when our time comes(or in this case it’s sprung on us) my mother loses her shit. for example, today she was in our dining room moving some halloween crafts of mine citing “its messy”(it was not fyi). she also proceeded to move a bucket of candy that we put out every year from the living room to the dining room into another bucket(the rooms are right next to each other). it was the weirdest shit i’ve ever seen—like she’s throwing a tantrum. to top it off, when i told her in respectful terms you’re being an idiot please stop, she started going off about the candy being in the wrong place or some noise. she also started piling my crafts in my room like i never work in the dining room this time of year. i know it’s something because before my grandma came down with dementia my mom was fine. now this woman becomes a raving lunatic b*tch. even my grandma has told her stop being an ass or has said she needs to see someone. my grandma also told me my mom was ocd and they never did anything about it. but now it’s annoying as hell. especially since she tossed—no threw one of my textbook rentals into my room along with various notes i had(and this is nursing school so i have a lot of notes). i couldn’t go for that but the other stuff i just let her go through it that way there’s no blow out. now i see a therapist but i should i tell her she might not need help because it’s becoming an issue. my cousin said her mom does the same thing🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️"," your mom is having trouble with her mother being incapacitated. she's destabilized by it. iis not likely to get better on its own, either. is there a family support group she can go to or similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q6ozic/mental_health_sorry_this_is_so_long/,Mental Health (sorry this is so long)

"my grandpa developed dementia, as he began developing it, his girlfriend got him to sign marriage papers, she changed his will to put everything under her and kicked out 7 families, sold their homes, sold his 2 cars and everything he worked for 70 years to buy, she starved him for months and constantly rolled his eyes at him when he would talk and not make sense, she would always say he was never hungry then she put him in the cheapest retirement home she could find and wouldn't tell us where she put him.... we tracked him down. he ate an entire plate of food and asked for a second plate of food. we all witnessed it. he literally ate every single grain of rice. donna, that wicked scumlord, would only give him jello  and a piece of bread.. she had millions now and the place she put him in was so cheap and understaffed that he fell, smashed his face up and broke his hip and was laying on the tile floor for 3 hours before someone found him. donna, my piece of shit aunt barbara, my scumbag uncle dale waybe and my dicnhead uncle ron all never visited him.. his dentures weren't the right size so the people at the home contacted donna and she said that they didn't have the money. he ended up getting sores on his gums from the dentures being the wrong size so he had to eat nothing but liquid food and he finally passed away 2 days ago. no funeral. even though 100 people at least would show up. he was loved in his community. my dad's whole side of the family would have gone, my mom's whole side of the family would have gone, my decent side of my papa's side of the family would have gone. my mom is a christian woman so she just believed in turn the other cheek. i'm an atheist. i called her and i went ballistic on her. i called her every cuss word in the book, told her how she's so hated her own daughters and sister dont even speak to her and i said ""congratulations, you're a millionaire now that you stole from someone with dementia you piece of shit. when you die not a single person is gonna mourn your death. they'll probably just flush your ashes"" then i hung up on her. then my aunt barbara and uncles called me a faggot and how i'm such a piece of shit talking to a grieving widow like that blah blah blah. the moral of the story is my grandpa was loved, by hundreds of people. he was the best. in his industry he started with one truck he bought in 1958 with his brother and built a business. he loved me, my mom (his daughter) and my mom's mom was the love of his life. he fought for thud country in the korean war, he moved to california from missouri during the great depression and picked cotton and potatoes with his 3 brothers, his dad and his mom in bakersfield living in a tent. by the time he sold the business to my mom and dad he had 12 trucks and was loved in his industry. he was always smiling and always laughing.but please. protect your loved ones. we never even thought someone could be so evil. we always knew donna was a 2 faced bitch but we had no clue she could be this evil. do whatever you can to protect them because my papa suffered soooo much in his last 5 years of life because of her. he was helpless and now she had complete control over him. don't let what happened to my papa happen to your loved one. there are truly evil people out there and your loved one who's beginning to show signs of dementia may be in their sights. protect them in everyway you can.", your grandpa's suffering could have been prevented. the hundreds of people that loved him didn't do anything. it doesn't make much sense that even 1 person that loved him would do nothing to help him. not even 1 simple phone call to adult protective services. the family is as much or more to blame than the girlfriend.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q5l14b/my_grandpa_passed_away_she_got_everything_update/,My grandpa passed away.

"a few months ago i went to visit my grandmother in the nursing home she resides. when i arrived she was having an episode where she was severely stressed (partly because of her low blood sugar).this has left quite an imprint of fear in my head and the following weeks i found myself completely losing joy from what was still keeping me occupied and under constant worry/fear that i might be getting dementia too. and of course i was seeing signs of dementia in everything around me too: from news articles to conversations with my parents. because i’m 29 i find it doubtful that this is the case but it has left a hyper attentive mark on me. i also brought it up during a visit to my gp, and he confirmed that it shouldn’t really be the case for me.for the past two months i’ve been hyper aware of every small forgetful thing (ex: not knowing where i left my keys) or error in speech (ex: not remembering the dutch (my native tongue) word, but knowing the english word) i’ve made. it cumulated to the point where i had to keep myself occupied with mindless gaming to prevent myself from thinking, was afraid to speak so i couldn't mispseak and panic attacks when i’m trying to sleep.last month i decided to go to a psychologist and while the panic attacks had stopped just two days before the appointment she did help to find solutions should they return and i feel future sessions will help.i have managed to somehow lower the amount of times i think about the potential of having dementia but the thoughts haven’t left me. i have tought of going to a hospital and having an examination done, but that creates more fear by thinking what if my fear gives me a false positive or what if i really am in the starting phases.as it stands right now i haven’t gone and visited my grandma in over a month. it’s killing me inside because i know she appreciates me visiting and spending time with her, and i do want to take whatever time i can still get with her. but at the same time i’m afraid that visiting her will return the panic attacks and make me even more hyper aware of flaws.is there anyone who has dealt with similar things and has managed to beat the fear?", yeah man sometimes i get this anxiety after visiting my father. its all overthinking. anxiety will make things worse as your brain will be frying from pessimistic thoughts instead storing properly important information,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q3w3ih/m29_fear_of_dementia/,M(29) fear of dementia

"my grandmother was just recently diagnosed with an early stage of alzheimers this past year, and its been so difficult seeing the woman i love and idolize more than any other person in the world slowly deteriorating. she's stopped doing a lot of the things she loved - playing piano, painting, gardening, she repeats herself multiple times in conversations, she constantly forgets the date. going out to my grandmother's used to be nice, but now every time i visit i just feel sad and wonder how much time i have left with her. i almost don't want to visit her, but i know i would regret that even more in the end...what breaks my heart most is that my grandmother is completely aware of it. both her brother and father had alzheimers and she saw what it did to them, how they slowly became almost completely different people. she told me about how scared she was. she told me about a friend of hers who was also diagnosed - that friend took pills and committed suicide before she ""lost it"". my grandmother asked me how i felt about that, and i knew it was because she was thinking about doing the same. i didn't know what to say. i told her i love her, that i want her to be around, but at the same time i feel that it was so selfish to say that. i want my grandmother to be around, but i don't want her to suffer. i don't want her to be unhappy, confused, and trapped within her own mind. i feel guilty for having these thoughts. i don't know why i'm writing this...maybe to vent? or share my thoughts with others who are going through the same? this is 100x more difficult for her to deal with than me, but i just dont know how to cope."," i'm so sorry and you are not alone!!!!  i know firsthand and many others here as well understand this pain.  its a slow, methodical, almost prescriptive in how it engulfs the ones we love.if this is at its earliest stage and your grandmother has some long term memory left, this might be a very good time to get what is left and document it.  i wish i had done that with my mother as all of our family secrets have vanished with my relatives.you are such a sweet grand kid for loving her and you should let her know every time you visit how much you love her.this is a painful time i know.  so many thoughts run through the mind.  love her for who she is, not who she will eventually become.god bless you truly and best wishes to you and your family",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q3lrgq/feeling_guilty_about_grandmother_with_dementia/,[deleted by user]

"hello, i just found this sub a few days ago and i want to thank you all for being so open and honest. my mom started showing signs of dementia in 2016, she was forced to retire early soon after. initially i (27 now just out of college then) was told she was having memory problems but that it wasn’t alzheimer’s, and my dad insisted she had been seen by the best doctors who assured him it wasn’t alzheimer’s. she kept getting worse, i was told she was under the care of physicians and that she didn’t have alzheimer’s. it wasn’t until the middle of 2020, when she fainted a couple times and was brought to the hospital (it was a uti) that she was actually diagnosed with alzheimer’s. my dad hadn’t mentioned alzheimer’s when checking her in, but it was the same small town hospital she had been a doctor at so thankfully they recognized her and realized the situation and intervened to get her diagnosed. i quit my job and moved home with my parents, realizing my dad couldn’t handle it and that he wouldn’t allow others in the house because of the pandemic. when i arrived i found my mom was not being well taken care of, and that she hadn’t actually been seeing a neurologist or been put on any medication. it took me a long time to get him to take her to get started on medication because of his complete denial of the situation. this denial of reality took many bizarre turns (he thought the covid vaccine would magically heal her). i have been here nearly a year and i will never regret moving home, but i want my dad to start getting in home care set up. my mom is in the early part of the late stages - wears diapers and mostly does ok with them, needs to be reminded to eat/drink but can do it on her own, can’t talk other than occasional words she often seems not to understand. she is well cared for now, but our ability to continue caring for her will diminish. additionally, living here has been extremely difficult on me  for all the expected reasons made worse by my knowledge i’m apoe 4/4. i would like to move somewhere close but stop living with them.i’m not comfortable doing this until they have some level of in home care, but my dad still insists they are fine. how can i make my dad see the reality of the situation? his denial of reality has caused so much damage already.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q3gsah/denial_of_reality/,[deleted by user]
"my mom died yesterday after a long battle with dementia. here is what i've learned in hopes that it may helps those of you starting out.&amp;#x200b;1. have a conversation early about what they want they dementia journey to look like. what things are important to them to have around, so you know what things to take with them to a nursing home? what are they worried about or afraid of, so you know where to focus your energy? who do they want making decisions for them if you they can't make them? most importantly, what does a good death look like to them? this will help your decision making along the way.2. get medical and financial powers of attorney documents drawn up, along with a dnr, if at all possible. these documents will make everyone's life so much easier. 3. email an electronic copy of the dnr and poas to yourself and keep those live in your inbox. hospitals, emts, nursing homes, doctors and funeral homes will all want to see them so they can be sure you are truly the person allowed to make decisions, and being able to email them the moment you are asked for them will mean you won't have to wait to make any decisions, and can make sure your loved one gets the best continuity of care with the least confusion and the most consistency on what they want.4. if you do not have a financial power of attorney document, banks cannot give you access to your lo's accounts to pay bills, monitor for fraud, etc. if at all possible, convince your lo to sign you on to their accounts as a signatory (i.e. ability to sign checks from the account.) review the account monthly for weird charges (signs of fraud or scammers). close credit card accounts they don't need. put a freeze on their credit card and social security account so scammers can't take out loans in their name or get social security checks redirected to someone else. where possible, set up direct deposit on social security/retirement checks, and direct withdrawal on bills.5. if you have to make a payment or transfer on your lo's account, use the ""note"" feature to document what it is. for example, i buy my lo's groceries, and i put ""june groceries"" in the note feature when i transfer money to my account to reimburse my expenses. that way if someone ever accuses me of stealing from their account, i can explain what the money was for.6. if your lo's doctor uses an electronic medical records system, try to get the sign on information. your lo will have to give permission for you to talk to the dr, or you can use your medical poa. being able to email the doctor via the medical records system before i took the lo to a doctor's appointment with my real concerns and what was really going on helped all of us. the doctor had the background to make the right treatment decisions. i didn't have the lo disagree with me in front of the doctor ""no, i'm not forgetting anything, i'm fine to drive."" and it helped me establish a partnership with the doctor to discuss concerns, which was important especially as my lo got worse and needed more care.7. being a caretaker means a level of selflessness that many don't really understand. you have to give up being right in favor of your lo's comfort (""you're right, mom, it's awful that someone stole your wallet"" when you know they just put it somewhere and don't remember). be ready to apologize for things you didn't do because it will be easier on your loved one than fighting them. 8. you may get called names, insulted and even face violence. dementia will teach you a level of love and forgiveness you won't expect. 9. but you also need to care for yourself. you need to remember that you are in this for the long haul. take breaks. get respite care. ask someone else to be with your lo for a day or an hour or a weekend or a week. this isn't failure, and it isn't you being demanding. just like you have to sleep to face the day, your need a respite to face the next battle. 10. if your loved one is violent, it is a sign that they need more care than you can give them. you can't care of them if you are hurt yourself.11. relatives and friends may second-guess you, criticize what you do, etc. the best defence is a power-of-attorney and the ability to say ""lo and i talked about this and this is what the lo told me to do in this situation. please stop contradicting lo's directives."" say this publicly in front of witnesses if possible. tell others what your lo has told you about what they want. the more this is widely known, the harder it will be for others to interfere in what you do.12. accept that the time will come when you can't do it all yourself. this isn't failure. it takes 2 people to bathe or change an incontinent adult just due to their size. 13. early on in the journey, think about what level of care your lo would need before you would feel comfortable putting them into assisted living/ memory care. then back that level up 3 months - that's when you need to start looking for a place to move them to, because if you wait until an emergency, you may have to take what is available, not what is the best possible place. and waiting until an emergency placement could mean waiting until something awful has happened. 14. most memory care facilities do a quarterly care conference to review how your lo is doing. at that conference, you want to ask many of the questions you asked when you were looking at which place to move them to - what level of care do they offer? what is their staffing and how has it changed in the last quarter? do they have any concerns about your lo that might lead to them evicting your lo? do they think your lo is far enough along that you should engage hospice? 15. be aware that you might have to move your lo from one assisted living facility to another. we all hope that will be the place they can live until they die, but facilities close. they have staffing problems. your lo could develop a physical issue that needs more care. sometimes you have to move. 16. hospice hospice hospice. use hospice. hospice will provide medical equipment that you don't have to pay for (wheelchairs, special beds, lifters, shower chairs, so many useful things!). hospice will provide extra aides to tend your lo. hospice is a separate set of eyes on how your lo is doing and how your lo is being treated, which is especially useful when your lo is in an assisted living center and you can't be with them 24x7. ask hospice to give you an update on what they see and think 1xweek.17. know the names of your lo's aides and caretakers. the more you know them as people, the more likely they are to treat your lo well. and if something bad happens, you will be able to tell the police who said or did what. thank them for their care of your lo. people who are appreciated treat lo's better.18. keep records. keep a few notes about who said what and when after every visit or conference. if something bad happens, those notes will be critical evidence for the police, or critical medical records for doctors in tracing the progression of the disease. 19. label everything you take into the assisted living center, but be aware that things move around and everything - clothes, knickknacks, jewelry, pillows, etc - may disappear from your lo's room and appear somewhere else. likewise things may appear in your lo's room from elsewhere. don't take anything valuable. don't take anything you can't bear to lose.20. when you have to pack clothes for your lo, keep in mind clothes that are easy to put on/take off. drawstring pants are better than button pants, because your lo may lose weight and drawstring pants can be adjusted to still be worn. my lo's aides preferred button-up shirts over pull-overs because it was easier to get them on my lo. my lo couldn't have enough shoes, because she would kick them off as she walked about her assisted living place and it could take a while to find them again. slip-on loafers and slippers were better than tie-on tennis shoes.21. after surgery, be aware that it can take a week or two for all anesthetic to leave the body of the elderly. you may think that your lo has taken a drastic step down when you see them in the hospital the day after a hip fracture. it's possible they might have. it's also possible they might still be under the lingering traces of anesthesia and they'll bounce back in a week. it's really hard to know their condition at first. being able to tell the hospital care takers that ""they remembered my name on tuesday and fed themselves dinner, then watched tv and laughed appropriately before walking to their room, all before breaking their hip on wednesday"" will help the hospital know how to grade your lo's condition post surgery. it also helps people like occupational/speech/physical therapy know how to interact and motivate your lo.22. have in mind a best case and a worst case for your lo, and be able to say it. for example, after my mom broke her hip, i was able to say that my best case was for mom to return to her nursing home, scoot herself around in her wheelchair and be able to take part in activities, while my worst case was that she have an easy, painless death. that helped the doctors know what to work towards for my mom, and also helped them know what to tell me as to whether my hopes/fears were possible. 23. as your lo's condition deteriorates, they will have trouble walking. there will be falls. this is not a sign that the nursing home isn't treating them well. it's a sign that they are deteriorating. on the other hand, the nursing home should be able to tell you how they are monitoring and supporting your lo. if they can't, be concerned. ask more questions. visit randomly. ask the aides what they think. sometimes management will tell you a better case than the reality. sometimes aides will tell you nothing is wrong because they won't want increased work. you have to balance out what everyone tells you with what your eyes see and with what common sense and knowledge of the disease tells you.24. pre-arrange the funeral. no matter how prepared you are, your lo's death is going to be difficult. the fewer decisions you have to make, the easier it will be on you. and you are less likely to miss things if you make decisions when it is not a traumatic time. this includes packing a ""funeral bag"" which includes the clothes your lo should wear in the casket. 25. consider if you want any personal items to put in the casket - i promised my mom decades ago that she would have a new mystery novel and a chocolate bar in her casket. hospice will be able to tell you if they think your lo is declining (""declining"" is hospice-speak for moving into the pre-dying phase) which gives you time to acquire and do any final tasks you need before the bad things happen. i went out and bought a book and a couple of chocolate bars, and added them to her funeral bag. it was all there when she died, i didn't have to think of a thing, and i knew here wishes were being carried out.26. read up on the pre-dying phase and the active dying phase. hospice and the assisted living center can't predict what will happen to your lo or the timeline, but the more you know, the more you will understand their euphemisms like ""declining"" and be able to ask the right questions about timelines and symptoms.27. if you think your lo is in the pre-dying phase, think about what music they might like to hear. they say hearing is the last sense to go. download a couple of albums to your phone of the music they might like so you can play it for them on your visits.28. when your lo gets the the later parts of stage 6 or early stage 7 (fast scale), start hoarding vacation and sick leave. you will need it at the end. 29. be aware that the fast scale is not like a road. people don't move linearly from 6c to 6d. my mom could talk right up until she went into pre-dying phase, even though she was incontinent and couldn't walk. you have to consider your lo's overall condition to figure out how far along they are in their dementia journey.30. ask for help. your friends want to bring you dinner when you are exhausted. your cousin wants to pick up a new pair of slippers for your lo because they lost them. your doctor wants to give you anti-depressants when you need them. your assisted living center wants you to come to the support meetings to help you along the way. accepting help isn't failing, and it isn't weakness. it's being a general mustering an army to help fight the disease that is hurting your lo.31. forgive yourself. you will have doubts along the way - am i doing the right thing? you will agonize over mistakes - i missed x sign, i made the wrong decision about y. you will feel guilty when you miss a visit or are so tired that you snap at your lo. forgive yourself. there is no way to be a perfect caretaker because there is too much going on, and the disease is just too complex. this is a cruel and vicious disease. do the best you can. act with love in your lo's best interest. meet them where they are at in their disease progression, remember the person they used to be, and grieve when you need to. things will happen. forgive yourself.32. when the journey is over, rest. it's ok to be relieved, even happy that it is done. let yourself heal. let yourself grieve. let yourself not feel grief, because you grieved for months and months while your lo was losing themselves. go do something to regain the life you put aside to care for your lo. they would want you to be happy and to live again. 33. good luck to you, and to your los. dementia sucks. but we caretakers are the best of humanity. what else is love other than taking care of someone who needs it? be well,peppermintgoddess", just beginning this journey with my mom so this is very helpful. mom is about 75 and has diagnosed mild dementia at the moment. looking into a care facility in hopes to make things easier for everyone in the future.  i was raised by my 2 aunts and my mom and lost one aunt 2/20 and now my mom is starting to slowly decline.  it's tough but i just want her to be comfortable and i know i can't take it on by myself and my other aunt (her sister) is 81 and i pretty much take care of them both. ty for the write up as these will help emmensly. 🙏🏼,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q3axo0/from_one_ending_the_journey_heres_my_advice_to/,"From one ending the journey, here's my advice to those starting out"

"my elderly neighbor has dementia, so i help watch over her once a week. she can do mostly everything on her own, she just likes to leave her house a lot, which is the main reason i'm here. i'm not a caregiver, just a friendly college student neighbor who wanted to help. i watch her from about 7am-3pm so i usually have to make her breakfast/lunch. she never wants to eat and claims she's not hungry, but even if she isn't, her husband still wants me to feed her. he is very stern with her and also the only person she really remembers, so she listens to him. i'm too scared to be stern, as i don't want her getting upset at me (sometimes she forgets things after a few mins or sometimes after about 20, so i don't want her mad/upset at me). i try to do small tricks like setting it by her and she will think she was already eating it, eating with her, taking her to go get food bc she will eat in the car, saying something about the food (ex: your cereal is going to be soggy if you don't eat it). she always just smiles and walks away though. is there anything else i could do or try? i don't want to be too stern as i'm a very shy and timid person and don't know them really well either. on the other hand, i don't want to waste their food or have her go hungry. also, she likes to snack. whenever she does sometimes get hungry, she will go to the pantry and get a little cake or some chips. so it's not like she just refuses to eat all the time and is starving. when i do make her food, i give her a snack on the side and most of the time she only eats the snack. if i give no snack, she won't eat any of it. i'm not sure what to do. tl;drmy neighbor says she's not hungry and won't eat. she needs to eat, but walks away anytime i give her food.", if she only likes junk food then you could try the sneaky recipes that sneak veggies & healthy things into junk food. like black bean brownies… i think jerry seinfeld’s wife wrote a recipe book about them?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q39ggy/how_can_i_get_her_to_eat/,how can i get her to eat?

the neurologist says that federal  medicare and a medigap plan is better than any of the commercial plans.  most doctors dislike federal medicare because its slow to pay and  the neurologist agreed...but...said federal medicare is better and faster coverage.  many of us on this sub are caring for an elderly family member on medicare. the process of choosing an appropriate program is onerous. i've even busted an insurance broker selling us a plan that in the fine print excludes dementia symptoms.  every state is different.  any good suggestions for florida?," don't know if your family memeber is already on an advantage plan or not.  here is what i have recently learned:  stay away from advantage plans.  doctors don't like them, you are restricted to coverage for the state you live in so if you travel out of state you have no coverage, they can change coverage at any time.  if currently on advantage plan and want to switch to a medicare supplemental (medigap) they can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. i am trying to get husband on medigap, he has lbd, but have been told likely will be denied based on having dementia.  medigap has better coverage overall, you might pay more for the premium but worth the benefits.  don't know of anything specific to florida.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q326ky/medicare_and_dementia_coverage_in_florida/,Medicare and Dementia Coverage in Florida
"hello everyone. i previously posted about my grandfather [here]( things have progressed and i'd very much appreciate some insight. my mother is poa and sort of the unofficial caregiver, but does not live with him.first of all, shortly after that post, one of the dogs was put down. we are unsure exactly what happened, but she was throwing up and apparently miserable. i believe papa was talking about ""putting her down"" like, ""in the backyard"" if you catch my drift. this was alarming. my mom convinced him to try a medication the vet had suggested. the short version of this story is that the dogs looked very similar and the wrong dog was getting the medication and therefore the sick dog did not improve and therefore got euthanized by the vet. to say i'm horrified about this is an understatement. the remaining dog (11 year old yellow lab) is overweight, arthritic, currently has a double ear infection, and recently sprained an elbow. supposedly she fell off the bed. she is 110% not getting medicated for arthritis, nor is she getting the care she needs for her ears, because papa does not remember to do this. he loves the dog. but also apparently is starting to forget he has a dog. i guess he asked my mom last night ""where did this dog come from?"". but also still thinks he has two dogs sometimes. his gp and neurologist seem to think it's good for him to have the dog. do they know about the state of the dog? i do not know.papa is moving in to an assisted living facility this month. my mom is trying to work in conversations about the dog coming to stay with me/my husband while he moves in and then hopefully he'll just forget about her. my mom is convinced this isn't going to work and papa will get belligerent. i guess she's brought it up a couple times before and it hasn't gone over well...the general idea of the dog coming to live with me. quite frankly i don't give a shit if he likes it or not. this dog is suffering and needs to be taken care of and no one is taking care of her. papa is already forgetting her and how many dogs he does/does not have. i know the doctors think the dog is good for him, but it's not good for her.what can/should i do? from what i understand about papa's condition, he's going to be angry about it but probably not remember it the next day anyway. do we take the dog and all the dog stuff out of the apartment at the same time and then poof! she's gone from his mind?"," so here's another problem (?): my mom (poa & sort of caregiver) keeps saying she ""needs to talk to him"" because he's not totally in the grips of dementia yet. he's in the middle stages. like sometimes he's lucid and then other times he's not. i have no way of knowing how often he actually is lucid. i get this feeling that he's farther gone than she wants to admit, but again i have no way of knowing this for certain.she thinks if i take the dog, papa will start acting up in the care facility and be demanding his dog back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q2pfch/need_urgent_perspective_on_a_dog_situation/,Need urgent perspective on a dog situation.

"my situation is that i have moved in with my father about 50 miles north of my home in central florida. he has dementia &amp; it has progressed very rapidly in the past year. he lost his license so can no longer drive &amp; our family met with his doctors &amp; his church pastor to informally tell him it was time he can't be on his own any more. he has agreed to this &amp; is happy to have me living with him and taking the lead in keeping him on track with bills &amp; expenses.i have been designated executor for his will for many years but he has never set up poa documents. when we contacted his attorney to do that it was decided by his attorney, a second elder law attorney &amp; now his doctor that he is no longer competent to sign poa &amp; a guardianship is now needed. we have an appointment to see another attorney this week to start that process but neither my sister or i have the money to pay for this right now. i am considering selling my condo to get the funds, knowing i can get reimbursed once guardianship is granted but to get my condo in shape to sell it is in need of some work that i can't afford either. since i live 50 miles away and was going to have to make regular trips back &amp; forth from his place &amp; mine i had to ask him to help me with some much needed repairs to the truck before i started racking up millage on it. they totaled about $3000. i now understand that borrowing money from dad to help with this is a giant no no as it will have the appearance of me exploiting him in his condition &amp; most likely factor into the courts decision to my fitness to serve as guardian. so i must wait until i can afford to fix the condo up a bit on my own, sell it &amp; then repay him for the truck from the proceeds before starting the guardianship process.this is going to take some time. what i am worried about is if it takes longer than the time my dad has before something really bad happens with his condition. what are some of the things that can happen if no poa or guardianship is in place when he gets into the worst of it?"," you cannot delay seeking guardianship. it takes a long time and he needs a guardian right now. you've already waited too long. there's a lot at risk here for your dad's present and future care if no one is legally able to care for him and he can no longer care for himself. \-contact your local office on aging or adult protective services. tell them the situation and see what they can do. in extreme circumstances they do initiate guardianship proceedings on their own. if you can't do it, and it needs to be done, that might be enough for them to take care of it. \-see if the office on aging can give you a referral to a legal aid office that can handle the guardianship proceedings either free of charge or low cost. technically, you do not need an attorney to seek guardianship but it's a lot easier if you have one. maybe you can find someone to help you and you do some of the legwork yourself. \-if you haven't done so already, ask the elder law attorneys what options you have if you can't afford to pay for guardianship proceedings. be prepared to tell them how much you can afford. how much money are you being quoted? the most i've come across is $10,000.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q2ecth/father_with_dementia_no_longer_competent_to_sign/,Father with Dementia no longer competent to sign POA.

"hi everyone, i’m not sure if this post is worth sharing, but wanted share this with a group of individuals i feel could relate with me.i wanted to share how an abba song just made cry like a baby while i was mowing my lawn.long story short, my grandmother just passed away after dealing with dementia for the past three or so years. unfortunately, due to a head injury from a fall, her decline was so very rapid. over the past six or so months, my grandmother, the most intelligent person i’ve ever known, slipped away so gradually and tragically.i was extremely close to my grandmother, she had such an impact on my life. the past two weeks have felt strange, a plethora of emotion. peace knowing she is out of her pain and confusion, sadness for my grandfather, pain in seeing her deterioration in her final months. that being said, i hadn’t cried much. i did leading up to her passing, but other than getting teary eyed a few time, i haven’t since the funeral. at least, not till now.funnily enough, i’ve heard abba’s slipping through my fingers in some goofy tiktok trends. i thought the song sounded catchy, and decided to give it a listen while mowing my lawn. as i listened, i paid close attention to the words. the song hit me like a ton of bricks! now, i know the song is about a mother watching her daughter grow up, but it made me, some 28 year old guy break down thinking about his grandma who just passed away. the words really struck chord with me, deep in my soul. i feel funny saying a swedish disco group’s song about a mom was what broke down the walls i had inside of me and really helped me process a lot of things. i know music affects people emotionally, some different than others. honestly, i’ve never thought of myself as that type of person, but  for some reason that song did something in me. if you’re struggling to process this season, maybe you’re a wannabe tough guy like me and are having a tough time navigating your emotions, this song might do something, maybe even help you.be warned, please, listening to this song while a loved one has just passed from dementia is not a feel good experience, but i think it may help anyone else who feel stuck or frozen emotionally after your love one has passed. i want to send my love and prayers to you all in this season.[slipping through my fingers](", thank you for posting this song.  hoping you find release from your grief and are able to move forward with the loving memories of your grandmother. peace.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q29bjw/slipping_through_my_fingers/,Slipping Through My Fingers

"it's been maybe 6 years or so since my grandfather had some leakage in his skull that required a shunt. i don't know exactly the issue, it's mostly been my parents and uncle dealing with everything, but i know that it started a gradual decline in memory and presence. in the last year or so it's gotten worse, and very recently he had to give up his dog because he just wasn't able to take care of him anymore. luckily our neighbors across the street wanted him so we're still able to organize visits. but it's getting harder and harder for my grandpa to carry on conversations or remember what day it is. but i feel like the worst person in the world sometimes. because my parents, especially my mom, shoulder so much of the burden. but when i think about my grandpa, i don't think about the one alive right now, if that makes sense. i think about the one that i used to know. and it creates a weird kind of paradox where it feels like he's not even around anymore. i think my mom is ready for him to ""go"" too. the other night she mentioned at dinner that he had told her of a dream in which someone was holding his hand in his bed. she kind of joked about wanting him to take that hand. and it made me feel very weird and sad, like ""why would you joke about that?"" but at the same time what right do i have to think she shouldn't?i just don't really know what to make of it all. i've never had anyone close to me die before. but at the same time it feels like it happened a while ago. has anyone felt like this before?"," my mom just passed after 5 years with dementia. it was like saying goodbye to her in peices until i recognized that the woman i loved was no longer there. although every day i kept trying to find pieces of her, in showing her photos, in saying her name, in music. part of me is relieved that she no longer needs to live like that, and part of me is broken from the ordeal.it’s changed me in a way i never wanted to be changed; taught me things i never wanted to know. one thing is that it’s  important to be clear: it’s not just that you want your loved one to go, it’s that you don’t want to see them be and/or suffer in a way that they never wanted to live in the first place. dementia takes a cruel toll on everyone involved. not wanting to see the people you love suffer does not make you the worst person in the world; until there is a cure, there is only one way out of this. so be with them in whatever way you can, appreciating that you will need to have boundaries, and wish them a peaceful passing. i’m so sorry. what you’re all going through is so hard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q1glkp/feeling_like_my_grandpa_passed_a_while_ago_even/,[deleted by user]
"this is a long one, but i’m a writer and we tend to be a bit wordy. my mom is 76 and i’m becoming increasingly worried about her cognitive functioning. i’ve had my doubts for the past year or so, but she had just lost my stepfather to cancer around this time, so i thought it was simply associated with her grieving. however, i recently became aware of the music project known as everywhere at the end of time, and the experience renewed my suppressed concerns. this was especially true once i began reading related comments. her memory is obviously the thing that i find the most troubling—misremembering events or not at all, wrong names, retelling the same stories within a short period. an example would be this past friday and i took her to see the many saints of newark, as we are rewatching the sopranos together. the next evening, she was discussing a scene that happened in the sopranos pilot, which we saw about a month ago, and she was certain it was in the movie we just saw. this may be nitpicking or superficial, but i think that’s part of the problem that i have become hyper aware of everything she says and does now. lately i’ve noticed that she is having trouble remembering the day of the week. last week, she was under the impression that we were a day later than actuality (thursday when it’s really wednesday), despite being corrected. my mother has always been an incredibly intelligent woman, who squandered her dreams of being an artist and dropped out of nursing school to have seven children. she graduated college four years ago just to say that she finally did it. she can have deep conversations about astronomy, world history, theology and politics. but lately i’m noticing issues with her speaking as eloquently as i’m used to. a couple months ago, she took a job at home doing customer service, primarily as a means of doing something productive, other than watching soap operas all day. she was fired the day after her training ended because she was not understanding the software. now i’ll admit that my mom and technology never went together very well. but she was asking questions like how to turn off the computer or what a usb port was—answers to which that i know she should know. she did find another customer service job and has been in training for about six weeks. she says she likes the job and she understands it better. i don’t know if it’s exaggerated paranoia on my part, or if there is really something to fear. i love my mom very much. she is one of my best friends and i will proudly admit that. i’m the youngest and was sick with asthma when i was young, so we have a pretty unique and strong bond. but this seems as though it would be a difficult topic to approach. by bringing it up to her, i fear she will take it as an insult to her intelligence. my brothers aren’t as active in her life and don’t seem like viable options for a support system. so what can i do? is there some sort of “test” that i can utilize to clarify my suspicions? should i be contacting her doctor. i feel so alone and in the dark with these feelings. i don’t know if i’ve ever been more frightened than i am am now. thanks for reading."," these symptoms can be chalked up to a bunch of stuff besides dementia. a dementia diagnosis is made by excluding everything else that could cause the symptoms. if a dementia were the source of her problems it may be too early for a diagnosis. if she hasn't had a physical exam with her doctor since her husband died, you might suggest it. you don't need to tell her your concerns. you can write down your concerns, with examples, and provide it to the doctor's office. if you're in the u.s., they can accept information even if they can't share information with you. to share information, such as their findings, your mom would need to sign a hipaa release. problems with finances are usually among the first big problems with dementia, so keep an eye on that. also, kitchen safety (expired food, leaving the stove on). and if she doesn't have financial and healthcare poas in place, now is the time, whether or not this is the beginning of a progressive cognitive impairment. i wouldn't be frightened at this point. late onset dementia usually proceeds quite slowly and as i said, i doubt she'd even be diagnosed with dementia at this point. sleeping, eating well, exercise, and keeping her mind active are important.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q1fpl7/scared_for_mom/,Scared for Mom
"both my grandparents are 89.  they are in good shape physically, in terms of people of that age.  they still live on their own.  i go over daily to offer some help with things, but they're pretty independent.  my grandmother is early/mid stages of dementia.  it's hard to tell reading these different symptoms, and different resources seem to have different views on what's early and mid stage.  just a quick rundown on my grandmother, since this post is mainly about my grandfather.  90% of the time she is aware of who she is, who everyone else is, and where she is.  her long term memory is excellent, no issues with it.  her short term memory depends on the day.  sometimes she might ask the same question five times in a 30 minutes visit.  other days, she's on the ball and has minor or no issues.  her ""middle term"" memory is the worst.  she has trouble putting together memories from recent weeks to recent years.  there's a lot of confusion, and a lot of false memories.  sometimes people can get her to remember things, other times she is adamant of her view, and gets annoyed if the issue(s) are pressed.  a very recent thing this past year, is she sometimes gets confused over the season.  last spring, she sometimes thought it was fall.  this fall, she sometimes thinks it's spring.  interestingly enough, she knew it was summer the entire summer, and never got confused.  she does have some worse issues when sundowning, and *occasionally* in the first few minutes of waking up.  for instance, in both times of day, she's sometimes forgotten who my grandfather is.  she believes he's her father (but remembers my grandfather exists and asks about him, to him).  and on a few occasions wants to know in the mornings ""if the kids have left for school.""but those issues have only occurred in the past year, and according to my grandfather, maybe once a month at most.  now, on my grandfather.  he is an intelligent, kind, loving, man.  really the best kind of person, someone i strive to be like.  but he's still 89.  he's still ""old school"", and doesn't really know how to deal with this.  because she got confused a handful of mornings about who he was, he now interrogates her every morning as soon as she wakes up.  i've seen it.  he gets up about an hour before her, and when she comes out of the bedroom he goes right up to her and starts asking 20 questions.  ""debbie, who am i?  do know my name?  do you know your name?  what year is it?  how old are we?""she immediately gets flustered and confused and starts stuttering.  every time i've witnessed that though, she manages to say yes she knows everything, but then gets mad.  most of the time if i'm there that early, i'll push past him and meet her in the hallway.  and guess what?  i smile and say, ""hello nana!"", and she knows my name and who i am right away.  then she seems my grandfather and says, ""good morning, dan"".  she then moves right into her morning routine with no issues.  my grandfather's other huge problem, is arguing with her when she's wrong, especially in situations that make no difference.  she might say to me, ""oh, we saw your cousin at the mall today.""  and my grandfather has to chime in with, ""no we didn't, it was at the grocery store.  we went to the mall yesterday!""he also has this thing with no ""lying"" to her.  my grandmother's sister died six months ago.  once or twice a month, she'll ask, ""did something happen to my sister?""  if it's asked to me i'll tell her no, she's down in florida, i'm sure she'll call soon.  then i redirect her to a new topic.  my grandfather though will answer, ""yeah, she's dead!  don't you remember?  we went to the funeral at 'abc' cemetery, they had the wake 'xyz' funeral home.  she had a stroke.  do you remember?""and of course then she's upset for the rest of the day.  the worst part is nobody in the family, myself included, likes spending time *alone* with my grandfather anymore.  we all still love him, but prefer my grandmother is around.  i use to love alone time with my grandfather.  we share so many interests, he has amazing stories, good advice, etc.  but all he does now is complain about my grandmother, and insists on telling us every mistake she makes.  even if it's a mistake she's made every week for the past three years.  if i go to visit, and he catches me alone while she's in the shower, or she's outside and we're indoors, he just uses every single second to complain.  i know everyone needs to vent (honestly, i think that's more what i'm doing now than actually asking advice), but it's nonstop with him.  ""do you know she took the bedsheets off to wash them when she only put them on three days ago!......do you know she put the pork chops in the fridge, when we bought them to eat next week and were meant to be frozen!....do you know i planned we planned to have spaghetti for dinner, but when i came home from a haircut she was making soup!.....do you know she took the curtains down to iron while i was in the shower!it's nonstop complaining, about things i and the rest of the family know she does, and have heard about a thousand times.  and you can't redirect my grandfather.  if there's a pause in the conversation, i try to bring up another topic, something he normally would be interested in, and he blows it off to keep complaining.  we've tried sitting him down as a family to talk about this, we've tried explaining that while none of us are experts, we've researched dementia and understand it better than him.....he just blows it all off.  i know he lives with her 24/7, it's his wife, it's tough for him, but he can't comprehend that his actions are making things more difficult for him.  and what also stresses me out, is i just want to be able to have conversations with my grandfather like we use to, that he's still capable of, in the limited time i have left with him.  the last thing i want to do is blow up on him and hurt his feelings, but lately after hearing the same rants/complaints for the 500th time (especially when he's refusing my advice), i get close to losing it.  i want to scream at him to shut the fuck up.  we're all trying to help my him and my grandmother live their happiest final years, but he makes everything so much more difficult and won't listen to advice or reason.  **now that i've written all this....i just realize that i had to get it out.  this is a long post, and i don't expect anyone to read it all.  if you have advice, i appreciate it.  but honestly i feel better just getting it all out.**"," i hear you and it's a tough situation, give yourself some slack for trying to help and dealing with something truly difficult. could you arrange for your grandmother to visit a daycare center for elderly once or twice a week? then your grandfather would get a break, sounds like he needs it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/q1eyze/my_grandmother_has_dementia_but_my_grandfather_is/,[deleted by user]

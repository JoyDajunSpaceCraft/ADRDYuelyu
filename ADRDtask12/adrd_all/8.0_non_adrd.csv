"it's my first time posting here and i'm pretty new to reddit so i'm sorry if i mess it up.i was wondering if anyone here has any advice regarding getting frustrated with a relative with dementia.  i want to preface this with i know that she can't help it at all, and i feel awful for letting this bother me so much, but i'm only human and this is getting to me.i'll give you some context. myself and my mother are the primary carers for my grandmother who has dementia. i have absolutely no problem doing this and love my grandmother to pieces, but several times per day we have the same conversation. she asks how my now ex-husband is? she still has my old wedding photos up. it wasn't the most amicable of divorces and the conversation brings up pretty painful memories.now obviously this doesn't affect the way i care for my grandmother, or the way i feel about her at all. but i come back from hers and end up crying my eyes out.i can't help but feel awful about the fact that i'm letting this get to me and i feel that i'm being so selfish about the whole situation since she honestly can't help it. i was just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to tackle this."," when i was caring for my mother she did this same thing.  i'd already came to peace with the fact that my mom, my real mom, was gone and this person was just the shell of the woman she once was.  when she'd ask about my ex-husband i'd give her a positive but limited answer.... her:  how's bob doing?  me:  he's doing great.  i'd never bring up the fact we were divorced or that he's really a jerk because it's not relevant information in her world and just confused her more.more or less, i'd just give the appropriate/expected answer.  for example: she'd ask me about dead relatives and i'd just say ""i haven't seen them in a while.""  she'd ask if they were ok and i'd say yes.her:  how's your mother and daddy? (lots of times she didn't recognize me).me:  my parents are doing great.her:  have you seen my mom?me:  no i haven't seen her lately.when she'd have lucid moments and recognize me, she'd ask where  daddy (my dad, her husband) was.  i'd always say he was at work.when she was having a bad day she'd get mad and say, ""why do you keep calling me mother?!""  i'd just smile and say, ""because you remind me of her.  i had the best mom in the world.""i'd also use redirection.  i'd redirect her attention to something else to break that thought process.  she's ask me for the 100th time what she's supposed to be doing and i'd say, ""look at that cloud, looks like it might rain.""  i think the key is to join them in their world, their reality.  trying to make them join your world confuses and upsets them.  i used to tell people it was like mental gymnastics....always jumping around and totally exhausting.  don't try to explain things in depth to her.  her mind can only do one thing at a time now, so keep everything simple, like you would with a toddler. it's hard, but don't sweat the small stuff.  pick your battles wisely. don't take her comments and questions personally. i found it easier to call her by her first name and kind of distance myself from the situation.  don't ever feel bad about venting or ranting.  cry when you need to.  laugh a lot (even at inappropriate things).  this is the hardest job in the world.  everything will be ok in the end, but getting to the end is stressful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/6i1twx/dementia_advice_needed/,,Dementia advice needed.
"i am caring for my mom who has dementia. about a year ago it had advanced to the point that she can't live alone anymore. i have a long distance relationship and have not been able to go see my boyfriend in a year. i have two siblings, but neither even calls me to see if i'm doing okay, although they talk to my mom. i spoke to my counselor and she thinks it's reasonable for me to ask to be paid to do this, and my mom can afford it. it would only cost her part of what she gets every month, and would not touch any of her savings.i am also searching on google but would appreciate any help.i want to know if any of you have done that and what to watch out for please.i also think it's reasonable that some of it should be retroactive, but i'm concerned that that would be the biggest sticking point.i lived here for a little while before she started getting to that point so i think that might muddy the water, but i am not sure.my counselor suggested that i make a list of everything that i do for her, but i'm finding that's making me somewhat uncomfortable, but i still want to do it. it seems reasonable.i feel that this is reasonable in every way shape and form, but i am pretty nervous about my sister and brother arguing with me or shutting it down or any number of other things.also, i mentioned some things like this on another forum and felt the responses were overly critical. i don't need any criticism, just some input and hopefully some kindness.as i read this it seems somewhat choppy, but i still need to get some of this done so please excuse my lack of writing skills today.thank you in advance.edit: yikes, this is longer than i realized.tl,dr: i think it's reasonable for me to get paid for caregiving and i would like to know how to best present it and defend it to my siblings.", one of my coworkers did something like this before and was getting paid for being the caregiver through medicaid.or check with department of elder affairs to do a cares assessment to determine if she needs a higher level of care and she might qualify for medicaid waiver programs for a long term care facility.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/68bj9b/trying_to_get_paid_for_this/,,Trying to get paid for this
"was the caregiver of someone with alzheimer's who passed away a couple of years ago. though i stave off the depression to some extent by being busy, sometimes random memories or a trigger (e.g. i saw the film logan) just cause an intense depression. it causes such a feeling of hopelessness and sadness that i wish i could totally forget it sometimes, like a ptsd of some sort.

"hello,a few years ago my dad became very ill and had to go to the hospital. while in the hospital it was determined that he was no longer capable of living on his own primarily because of his mobility issues. before he was showing signs of memory loss, but while in the hospital, his memory deteriorated further. naturally, it was decided that my father would move in with us. at my lawyers advice we had my dad sign a poa before moving in with us. this became a major issue. we had forgotten that we had taken my dad to make a poa over 20 years ago, which named me and my brother joint poas. in addition, we were unaware that my brother had taken my dad to sign a new poa that made us joint poas and also drafted a new will that was to my brothers families advantage, in secret. me and my brother have had a toxic relationship for years. when my brother found out about the change in the poa he was understandably upset. he demanded that we retract the most recent poa and honor the poa that he had taken my dad to make in 2009. at the same time he started trying to convince my father that his finances were under threat and that i was taking advantage of him, and that he would take him to make a new poa.several months later we sold my father's house, as it was no use to him anymore, and shortly after my brother served us with a court application alleging that my father lacked the mental capacity to sign the new poa while in the hospital and alleged that me and my family were siphoning money from my father's account. the legal proceedings dragged on for more than a year. during this time my father was assessed and informally deemed incompetent. we passed the accounts and my brother objected to virtually every disbursement and tried to argue that my father's finances were being handled incompetently. he demanded that we reimburse my dad most of the money. in addition, he argued that we should not be compensated for managing his property or for the personal care we provide, on the basis that his previous poa explicitly stated that the poa would not be compensated. finally we went to mediation and a settlement was reached. essentially, he acknowledged the legitimacy of the most recent poa. he agreed on a management plan that was based on how we had been spending my dad's money since he had moved in with us. he agreed that the compensation we had been taking for personal care was reasonable. we did not have to reimburse my father for any of his disbursements. we agreed that we would send him the accounting every month and receipts upon request. although he accepted the most recent poa, there was a caveat. we agreed not to take compensation for managing my dad's property for the period within the passing of accounts, but were paid out a similar figure from my dad's estate to cover our legal fees as part of the settlement, anyways. the partial minutes explicitly state that my brother reserves the right to challenge us if we try to claim compensation for management of property in the future.we're getting ready to pass accounts again and are wondering how successful we would be if we were challenged by my brother. he's going to claim that the last poa stated that no one is to receive compensation, therefore we shouldn't. our thinking is that (1) in his own affidavit he stated that my dad started showing signs of dementia almost a year before that poa was signed and (2) the previous poa had no such provisions and it doesn't seem in my father's character to not want to compensate us.  (3) that stipulation seems incredibly out of character for my father. he has always compensated us for any help we've provided. it's just the way he is. (4) throughout the legal proceedings my father maintained that he strongly he thought it was fair compensate us to his lawyer on numerous occasions. my father's lawyer made this clear to the other lawyers and mediators during the proceedings. and (5) even if my father didn't want to compensate us, managing his property is a huge undertaking and we feel it isn't reasonable to expect anyone to do it for free.  this is what hull and hull says. again, my question is realistically how successful we would be if we were challenged by my brother?"," this is the sort of question that is above the paygrade of free advice from internet strangers. go see your own lawyer - not your father's, and at a different firm - for a consultation.

"so i've worked with clients who are developmentally disabled and also have different mental illnesses. there were some personal factors going on in my life that interfered with it so i ultimately quit. fast forward some months and i'm thinking that perhaps i'd rather work with elderly people. i applied at a company and they called me for an interview on thursday. then this morning they call me back and actually offer to have me working with someone who needs 24/7 care. i'm told she has dementia, needs assistance with most everything, not too well physically. i think ""ok this will be challenging but i feel capable taking this on."" my mil worked in caregiving so i asked her opinion and she mentioned ""well people with dementia may get frustrated easily and be mean."" but i don't feel that anyone being mean to me, or even physically hostile is a deal breaker. (my problem with my previous clients were that they were young enough, with goals to achieve, yet they did not actually want to change themselves.) i've been trying to ground myself about the situation. this is someone who just needs care and is not setting out to achieve goals or do more in life. i feel well enough to be able to assist this person with their daily needs and be there. what can i expect from a situation such as this? i'd be working three 13 hour days, which isn't entirely new since i worked a couple 12s each week at the previous company. also i have an interview/likely offer at another job that i'm considering taking for the other 4 days of the week. it's not healthcare, just barista work which i love. it's very relaxing and much like a hobby to me. i am concerned about burnout but i feel that having something that i think is fun to do will keep me focused (rather than having 4 days off to potentially do nothing.)"," i got to watch my grandma become like she was as a little kid. so moody, so stubborn and independent willed, but so helpless and need all day help. it dawned on me that we were extremely lucky that her last boyfriend and dance partner was a skilled caregiver. the key is to find something that gives them a warm feeling as from a distant memory. you might brush up on some child psychology while you're at it...",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/51nw4j/curious_about_what_to_expect_with_dementia_care/,,Curious about what to expect with dementia care
"so i have been a professional care giver for about five years now.  i have worked with various disabilities both physical and intellectual, terminal diseases, brain injuries, dementia.  i also have worked with people of all ages from children to geriatrics.  i now currently work with three men in their 20s who all have disabilities.after reading about me before you, i'm very uncomfortable about how much people are taking to this story.  i find it very disturbing that any hired caregiver would start a romantic relationship with the individual he/she is working with.  not only does the person she works with have a disability, but also is battling depression and has attempted suicide.  to me, this would be the same as starting a romantic relationship with a person in a psych facility for suicidal ideation.  being a caregiver who mainly works with the male population i pray that the family members do not compare this character to me.  i take my job very seriously and i do care about the guys i work with, however i would never push those boundaries. also for any of those familiar with the story, is lou hired help from a home health care service?  how is she not concerned about losing any licenses or certifications for sexual abuse?  i'm very concerned about the effect a movie like this is going to cause and i am interested to see if anyone else feels the same way."," i don't think you have anything to worry about, because lou is not trained to be a caregiver at all. she isn't trained to do anything at all, this was the only job she could find. will has an actual medical caregiver as well, he just isn't there all day so they hire someone to make sure will doesn't commit suicide again.i liked the book, but i am also not any kind of certified caregiver, i just live with my intellectually disabled aunt, so i didn't think of that aspect while reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/4mhr7i/what_are_your_thoughts_on_me_before_you/,,What are your thoughts on Me Before You
"so, as the title text says, my dad has suddenly had to move in with us, and i'm absolutely overwhelmed. the story is as such: a couple of weeks ago i got a call from the police. apparently my dad, who lives alone 3 hours away since my step mom died, had called the police to complain about people having a sit in on the front lawn, and having broken into his house. the cops arrived, and my dad is talking to bushes and there's no one there. he's been bothering the neighbors about it too, who saw nothing. the police said they couldn't admit him to the er, as his vitals were good, but he refused to go back into the house, and then drove to the local gas station and started having a fight with an invisible person in his car, and the police were called again, and so i drove up the 3 hours, and took him all the way back home with me, where after a good deal of sleep and some discussion about the possibility of hallucinations (he was an er nurse and understands the concept very well), he calmed down and seemed to go back to himself, though i could notice a considerable disruption in his normal cognitive abilities. we took him to a psych facility the following day, and they told us they weren't going to admit him because he wasn't a danger to himself and he was getting belligerent about not being allowed to smoke, and with the virus they thought he'd be better off at home, and the symptoms were mostly gone by then anyway. so they set us up with an outpatient appointment the following week, and we set dad up in the guest bedroom. we've since had the outpatient appointment, and the psychiatrist basically said that he thought dad had a mini stroke, and it caused an onset of dementia, and he didn't think dad should live by himself anymore based on how he answered the questions. so now dad is moving in with me.first off, dad seems able to take care of himself in many ways, like hygiene and self feeding, but has issues with more complicated aspects of living. he can't really work the tv (he could if it was just turn it on and change channels, but the whole smart tv thing and multiple remotes has him stumped constantly, even with a regular cable box and two remotes). he also has a hard time working the keurig, with its 3 buttons, and can't manage his dumbed down little flip phone, accidentally deleting phone numbers, etc. this is a man who used to work regularly in excel for a clinical trial management service, and the man who introduced me to the internet, set up a computer in our house when dos was the os, and had an atari 2600 from release, so he wasn't a luddite, but now he can't use a computer to save his life. it's heartbreaking to see him futz with his seatbelt for 3 minutes, or with the ac knobs, or the tv remote we got him which only has about 6 buttons, but i used to work in mental health, and patient care isn't something i have a problem with.my problem is this: how do i begin dealing with all of his stuff? he has a whole three bedroom two bath house filled with 40 years of stuff. he has two cars and a truck, a rental house, and two empty parcels of land, all 3 hours away from us. and, i found out after going up there and going through all of his stuff, that he got depressed after my step mother died and hadn't dealt with any bills in almost a year, and his taxes and god knows what else were all kinds of screwed. the first thing i did was get all of his bills paid up, and i'm trying to deal with his finances, but i've found so much stuff i'm out of my depth on, like that he never made any claims on my stepmother's life insurance or anything, and he gets money through investments but he can't really tell me how that works tax wise or anything.here's where i am right now:- i've got his bills paid for april, and i'm working on may's. i have years worth of paperwork to go through and i'm trying to sort through it a little at a time.- we went up this past weekend and i had him label everything he wanted to bring down, and everything he wanted to keep or put in storage.- i put one car in the shop because he just left it in the garage for a year, and we got a new battery in the truck, and drove it back down to our house. the other car is so old i don't think it'll make the trip.- i got his neighbor to cut his grass for the time being, after getting dad's permission to tell him what's going on.- the current tenant of his rental house wants to buy, so i guess i need to figure out how to sell a house without a realtor, which i've never done before.- i've gotten the name of an estate sales agency, to maybe go through and sell all dad's other stuff, which is the only thing i can think to do to deal with all the stuff we can't keep, and i've gotten the name of a junk remover for whatever is left.- dad's house will bare minimum need a major landscaping overhaul (he's let his land grow up significantly, and there are trees down in the yard), and possibly a new roof and definitely new flooring if we're going to sell the house. he owes $100k on it, but maybe we could sell it as a fixer upper regardless. i don't know.- i've gotten a family friend who is a lawyer to send me information on wills and power of attorney, but dad doesn't want to sign anything and doesn't have any active paperwork, and i'd really rather have him sign willingly than have him declared incompetent, if i'm going to survive living with him for the next however long.- i let dad manage his own meds (and double checked him) for about two weeks, and he just couldn't do it himself, so now i'm managing them for him.the whole time this is going on, all i can think is am i doing the right thing? how is this going to affect my life? how is this going to affect his life? am i missing something? and i'm constantly second guessing myself and my actions and whether i'm doing the right thing at the right time.i have no resources. my wife is still employed, thank the gods, but i've been laid off due to the virus, which is the silver lining to all of this because i'm getting unemployment with the extra money for the time being while i use my time to help my father, but eventually that's going to run out or i'm going to have to get a job to maintain our home and pay for him until we can get his finances figured out.so, i apologize for the long rant, but i guess what this post is about, is that i need help and though i know more than some i've never dealt with this and i feel like i'm drowning in stress, i don't know if i've missed anything important, and i don't know what resources might be at hand for this.and hell, in the midst of all of this, how do i actually care for my dad!? i'm managing his meds for him, and making sure he gets food, of course, but i'm at a complete loss for how to occupy his time, and help his life be worth living, especially in the midst of this virus stuff.and, selfishly, i need to figure out how i make sure that my dad's life doesn't consume my own? i know my life is derailed currently, and there is now a new normal, but what's on track for me going to look like going forward, etc.any advice, or resources, or anything at all is helpful at this point."," \- get power of attorney so you can deal with his finances, his property and other matters. his wife's insurance money will come in handy once that gets settled. \- put his name in for an assisted living residence close by - you do not have to take the placement if his name comes up quickly, but some places have long waiting lists. my mother's place has assisted living and memory care in the same residence, just different floors. it seemed to be a humane set up, so they don't have to move to a whole new place if they need more services. \- if he is still driving, it might be time to check out alternatives. before my stepdad even started hallucinating, he would get lost and sometimes even ended up in the ditch. finally his kids started ""borrowing"" his car for weeks at a time until he was diagnosed with lewy body dementia and was told not to drive. \- check to see if he is getting all the financial aid and services he is allowed. many places have senior's social workers that can help with that - your town/city likely has a seniors' center that can point you in the right direction for many things - including caregiver supports and day programs. \- it sounds like you are doing all you can so far. it will be challenging but the hardest part  is now when things are in such a mess. he is lucky to have you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/ggvuc4/dad_71_coming_to_live_with_my_wife_and_i_after_a/,,"Dad, 71, coming to live with my wife and I after a stroke with hallucinations and an onset of dementia.

"my 72 year old mother has been forgetful (getting her dates wrong for major events like weddings, misplacing things, forgetting to pay bills) as long as she's been my mom, but her memory has been steadily getting worse over the last few years and she is now acting weird in other ways.she loses her train of thought mid sentence and just starts stating facts that are sort of related to the thing we were talking about. she asks me the same questions repeatedly, although this might be loneliness and her trying to keep me on the phone. she makes really weird decisions and gets super defensive when you ask about them. this year she started taking out large sums of cash and carrying it around on her. she couldn't have a bag on her at work, so she'd stuff bills in her pants pockets and every time she stuck her hands in her pockets and pulled them out she'd drop money. she was dropping multiple $20 bills every week. i know there must be a reason- she's forgetting her pin or losing her wallet or something, but she gets angry and refuses to speak to me if i push the subject.she has short bursts of very petulant, childlike behavior and paranoia. they usually only last a few minutes, but they are very different from her normal behavior. this is what concerns me the most, she has a different look in her eyes, like she's confused and frightened.this week she left a tap running for hours and flooded her bathroom.i've looked up early dementia signs online, but most of them assume the parent previously had the ability to perform essential self care tasks, which my mother never has. she lost most of her teeth by 40 because she wouldn't brush them or go to the dentist. she has never been able to feed herself regularly, pay her bills often enough to not have services cut off, etc. she has always been bad at looking after herself, which makes it really hard for me to tell if this is cognitive decline or just her norm + aging. my sister has mentioned a few moments when she seemed ""off"" to her, but doesn't believe there is anything majorly wrong. she was working full time up until the pandemic. she seemed to be performing fine at work, her coworkers speak highly of her abilities when i interact with them.i feel like i should suggest she see a doctor to be assessed, but it may cause her to become angry and secretive. she would rather lie than have people worry about her. she once purchased a second kindle because i asked to borrow her kindle and she didn't want to tell me she didn't know where it was. if this is fairly normal for a 72 year old and she's probably going to be stable at this level of functioning for a while i don't want to push her and cut off any truthful communication. if this is actually concerning behavior i'd like to talk to my sister about  how we should approach it with my mom."," you should definitely not ignore this. make an appointment with her primary to discuss what you are seeing and what she is experiencing. if they discount what you have noticed it is time to switch doctors and find someone who has a better understanding of dementia. in the meantime, contact your local chapter of the alzheimer's association for guidance. you do not need a diagnosis to get help. they will be able to provide a lot of guidance and education for you as you figure out what is going on. they also have lots of support groups for caregivers and for those with dementia or alzheimer's. find your local chapter here:  [ hope that helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gf0bam/how_worried_should_i_be/,,How worried should I be?
"i’m not sure if this is a rant or a call for advice. basically my grandfather and his wife had a workplace affair in the 60s, and one day decided to walk out on their spouses and children to be together. i say “walk out on” but she left, while he kicked my grandmother and their four children out of their home with a few days notice. they’ve lived a purposefully isolated and reclusive life ever since. my mother and i are the only ones who ever came around and she was very clear that she would rather we didn’t, and only put up with us because he made her. i hadn’t been around in a couple years due to distance, but recently moved a bit closer (2 hour drive). my grandfather passed away last week. apparently, she’s been living with dementia for a few years. she should have been placed in an assisted care home long ago as she cannot even be left alone, let alone care for herself in any capacity. we found out she hadn’t showered or changed her clothes in 3 months. she won’t eat unless you put a cooked meal in front of her. most of her day is spent sitting at their small kitchen table, and going in the bathroom every 10 minutes to smoke. mom and i are taking turns staying with her and everyone involved hates it. mom is power of attorney/proxy, and i am the alternate. her children made it clear they want nothing to do with the situation or to help in any way. she has about a 10 minute “reset” time as we’ve been calling it. following the doctors advice we initially planned to tell her he died once, and then remain vague. but she’s so mean (was when she didn’t have dementia) and keeps telling us to leave her alone. my mom lost her patience and started telling her over and over that he died. now i can’t go back to the vague answers because while she can’t quite remember, she’s been told enough that she has a vague idea (saying things like “no...something else happened”) and getting combative until we tell her. she’s convinced that we just need to leave and that she can handle their house, their 7 cats, and her own care by herself. it’s clear that she can’t because she doesn’t even think to feed the cats or do anything for herself. we’ve been in contact with a few nursing homes and one seemed like they’d take her. we even had an appointment on monday where we took her there and they talked and they said they’d give us a decision in 24-48 hours but now they’ve just been ghosting us even though they have 12 open rooms. we’re in a pretty rural area so that was pretty much our only nearby option. my mom is now under the impression that at the first sign that somethings wrong with her (she’s been complaining of a pain in her head for a few days) that she’s going to take her to the hospital, where we can hopefully get adult protective services involved since we also can’t get them on the phone. it’s making us physically sick to be in that house since they both smoked inside of it for half a century. my mom has to do the bulk of staying there since i’m still working and like i said, live two hours away. my mom and i are both so exhausted from caring for this woman that always hated us and to be honest we never cared for her much either, that i’m worried for my mom’s sanity and my own safety. i’m just so exhausted and i drive all day for work on top of the drive there all the time (on top of my job which is very high stakes and stressful because of covid-19) that i feel like i’m constantly on the edge of falling asleep or passing out. i know my mom isn’t the type to do anything rash but if you make someone suffer physically, put them on the end of verbal abuse from their “stepmom” 24/7 all while trying to process the death of a parent, i’m worried she will do something in the spur of the moment. we’re both just so angry with the situation, that he put this on us, and that it’s all happening during a pandemic which makes everything 100x harder. we don’t even have death certificates yet to access his bank account so everything for her and his cats has been coming from us, and we both struggle to support ourselves too.", wow that's really hard.  you and your mom are good souls for taking care of her despite the fact that i kind of feel like she's not really your problem. have you considered getting any county or state agencies involved since her family doesn't really seem to want to take care of her?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/gbhwca/grandfather_passed_his_wife_has_dementia_and/,,"Grandfather passed, his wife has dementia and hated us when she didn’t.

"apologies for posting so much, things are crapping out here. i will be calling his doc tomorrow and if she wont callback i guess ill have a caretaker out for a few hours. and cal social services. my dad (93) stroke dementia and parkinsons, tied to a walker on his good days and lucky to get around on his bad days hes also a narcissist so everything he says or does is god.  he has horrible balance issues. getting up from his chair to his walker is often an ordeal that involves struggling to get up and falling back into his chair. ive picked him up off the floor a few times and this morning he was callig cause he was weak and couldnt use his walker. tbh i never quite know if hes telling me the truth or hes running a game. even at his age and condition he still tries to manipulate.there is no one else to take care of him and he cant do anything. all i ask is he do things safely. but he doesnt use proper judgement. i see hime struggling to stand and ffer a hand and he gets belligerant. tonight he was hanging between his chair and walker, barely balancing and looked stuck, so i genty placed my hand on his back and he made it, then was pissed. i explained to him hos this is done and tgat if he had a nurse or caretaker here thgey would chew his ass for being unsafe and then give him a hand. he just spits venom. he was calling for help this morning but then tonight its 'i dont fucking need your help'. on the one hand i want to just say 'ok, fuck you, if you fall you fall'. if that happens im not waiting in him, he'll have to hire in someone. aight, sorry, but am i just being a idiot wanting to help him since he always complains of weakness and has horrible balance issues?  what i see when he tries to get up is he sticks his butt way back and that pulls his center of gravity back. ive told him that but of course he knows all. should i just let him alone and when hes trying to get up say goodnight and walk away?at tgis point i will try and talk to his doctor and if that fails social services or a carenurse. as far as i know fro someone like him he should not be allowed to do what hes doing but im damn tired of the belligerence and idiocy. he expects that he can jut tell me whatever and ill just go...huh? gosh ok well i guess i let you fall then, have fun.tbh im alone in this, will be searching for a caregiver supoort group, probaby online, cause at this point it feels like im lsoing the fight to mr knowitall.  i moved back to go back to school. lost my job and decided to study for a career change. mom passed and dads been going steadily downhill. he has 2-3 bad days then hopefully 5-7 good days. these last two down cycles were hell. if it gets any worse then i cant  take care of him. but despite all the crap it has been beneficial in that i do the chores and i get a place to stay and food. but here lately i can get anything done and it seems like im upset every night. hes starting to gaslight and thats not acceptable. unfortuantely i wouldnt find a jhob in this economy so i think im fucked. but am i correct to try and keep him safe or should i just let him struggle and walk away."," my papaw had the exact same issues you describe with standing, especially when getting out of his recliner. i got him a set of grab bars with handles that he could use to push himself up easier. (they are on amazon, under able life universal stand assist.) all of the physical therapists with home health who came to see him were impressed; none of them had ever seen anything like it and most asked me what they were called and where i got them so they could tell their other patients. they might be worth looking into for your dad.my grandmother is the narcissist in our family, and i am fairly sure she has dementia now too, but it is so hard to tell what is dementia and what is her usual  personality. she complains over literally everything; even if she loves something to begin with, she will complain later. (for example, i bought her new cordless phones a few months ago, and every time i’d ask if she liked them she would say yes, they were perfect. two nights ago she sends me a text asking if i still have her old phones because she doesn’t care for these.)it’s really hard not to let her attitude get to me, but i try to remind myself that she is making a choice to be miserable, but i don’t have to let her make me miserable too. if she’s in a mood i don’t indulge it, i carry on as normal and leave her alone as soon as i can. one way you might be able to tell what is dementia vs. narcissism with your dad would be to have someone else come in to help him. sometimes dementia patients are difficult with family but not with strangers, and will be perfect angels when a nurse tells them what to do. if your dad is hateful to strangers too, well, at least then you know that it’s nothing personal towards you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g9he21/when_to_know_they_need_help/,,when to know they need help
"hello world of aging parents. i have a challenge to overcome. i’ve been taking care of my mother. my husband and i have lived with her (in tight quarters) for over a year now. she’s on a dementia medication which improved her condition greatly. she has refused to take any medications recently, so she’s no longer on her anxiety/mood medication. the only diagnosis i ever heard for her, psychologically speaking, is borderline personality disorder, which appears to fit.my feelings oscillate wildly. often i think it’s not so bad. and then i go to places where i think the plan to move and leave her with an aid (to make sure she’s covered, needs wise) is all she deserves. she can be incredibly mean and also incredibly supportive and that’s her struggle. but i’ve felt that she let the worst parts of her get the better of herself. so i’m having a hard time biting the bullet and signing off for a lawyer to get her on medicaid and get her at-home care and disconnecting myself from the responsibility. my mom is against having her finances interrupted and having ‘a stranger’ help her with anything. this would mean both of those things. i also signed on to work out of state at the end of the summer, and my husband and i agreed that we should take some time to ourselves out there to get a foothold before having her come out, around 6 months of time. that means it is imperative to get that care set up for her. so there’s really “no option”.questions, comments, words of constructive criticism and/or support are all welcome."," the adjustment will be hard, but it sounds like it is what is best for all involved. reassure her that you are not disappearing forever, but want to go back to enjoying the role of daughter. it will be a good thing for all of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/g4w5oj/support_needed_afraid_to_sign_papers_send_check/,,"Support Needed: Afraid to sign papers, send check for retainer to get mom community care"

"my mother will be 68 in july.  i'm 30 and an only child.  my father is 76 with alzheimers and starting to slow down severely.   ever since she married my father she never really had to pay bills.  she always had an obsession/addiction with spending money and shopping since i can remember.  she has been on social security for the last 6 or 7 years.&amp;#x200b;i have another post describing my backstory in more detail, but the main issue is that she is absolutely obsessed and fixated on attempting to get a 'loan' by any means necessary.  my parents still have a mortgage of around 190k on their home, which is in somewhat rough shape, and probably $50-150k in credit card debt for the two of them combined.   last year she started doing gift card scams and basically throwing her social security check away every other month to these scammers.  she continued on through the rest of the year and even convinced (and one month straight up took money from him) my father to give him money so she could get her big payday, totaling to $4300 (in 3 months time) and they missed 3 mortgage payments.  i feel awful for my parents because these people now call their home phone all day, every day, according to my elderly father with dementia; he is very fed up with it.  and they call mom's cell phone non stop it seems like.  everytime i am with her these people are calling her.&amp;#x200b;i have control of my father's ss benefits now ($\~1600), they go to my bank account and i have control, and we can slowly catch up on the mortgage ($1050).  but the problem is that she is getting \~$800 a month that she has been throwing away.  in january she gave it all away, in february the scammers cashed a check for around 500 and she closed her account with that bank and got $200 out and then immediately bought a gift card, and this past march she sent her whole check away in a money order to some guy.&amp;#x200b;i have durable power of attorney and healthcare power of attorney for both parents. i have sent my healthcare poa to her doctor and now have the ability to talk to him about her medical stuff, but when i called last week the nurse wouldn't let me speak directly to him and the only option i had was to make an appointment.  i think this week i'm going to call back to the hospital where he doctor works and just tell the nurse everything i was hoping to tell the doctor over the phone in hopes they understand how dire the situation is.  because i have asked my mom the past few days if she will go with me to talk to her doctor and she is very hesitant because i think she knows where that path will lead.    she also wanted me to put the payment for her timeshare \[that i'm not even sure she will be able to go to\] on my credit card ($900) and at one point told me to 'just do it' and i knew i had to put my foot down, so i didn't pay it.  i told her i would pay it if she signed over her ss benefits but she refused.&amp;#x200b;what the fuck can i do?   i'm almost certain she has some form of mental regression or mental cognition issues, i don't know what to call it really.  she has been on ambien for at least 10 years and i think that has caused some issues.  she has a terrible memory and often tries to tell me that things i know are true, aren't (like her taking $4300 from my dad for her scams).&amp;#x200b;the only other option i know of is contacting adult protective services (social services) and hoping they create a case for her.  she told me about 2 weeks ago that someone had already contacted her from social services because someone else had called in about her anonymously but i don't know if that gained any traction.  if you met her you wouldn't think she is that bad but she is 110% obsessed with these scams and it is making my life so much more stressful and difficult.&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;i am covering their electric bill, groceries, car insurance, health insurance, and other things here and there for my parents, with a high interest credit card.  i know this is a terrible choice financially, and the interest is starting to kick my ass, but its my only option unless i go no contact and go back to social security and tell them i can no longer manage my father's funds.&amp;#x200b;i may also have to take out another loan to purchase them a new car at some point. they both drive older cars and i'm not sure how much longer they will last.  my mom drives about 25 minutes to take care of her elderly mother (98) once a week for two nights).&amp;#x200b;lastly, they always talk about how they need to 'sell this house' and pay off the mortgage to then move and have some money to work with, but the house is 4k square feet, needs about $50k in repairs roughly, and they can't even get it clean enough to a point to have it shown. they're home almost every day but both so depressed i think they never get anything done. the house is pretty disgusting by most peoples standards.&amp;#x200b;can i go to a lawyer and try to have her declared as incompetent or something?

"my parents are both their early 70’s.  my mom has early stage dementia.  both are relatively healthy physically.  because of what’s going on, i’ve severely limited my visits.  before this i visited with my mom several times a week.  i call daily, or sometimes several times a day.  i bring over things that they need so they don’t have to go out in public too much.  i have two older sisters.  they hardly ever call.  they don’t help at all.  this isn’t new to the situation, but because of the situation the lack of communication for my mom has made my mom an emotional wreck who calls me crying that she wished she had just died last summer (she had a small stroke and spent 17 days in the hospital) and asking why they let her live, that she feels useless and that no one loves her, etc.  i asked my one sister if she could call mom once a week and let her know she is ok.  my sister works in a hospital, so my mom is sick with worry.  my sister lashed out at me and told me that with all the pressure she is under she doesn’t need a guilt trip too.  she got nasty, so i ended the conversation.  i called my other sister and asked if she could call mom or at least answer the phone when mom calls or respond to a message and i got a load of excuses and false promises.  my mom was a good mom to us, so there isn’t any reason to be like this.  no bad family history or anything like that.  i will say that my moms filter has dissolved quite a bit and she has a tendency to “say what she’s thinking” a lot.  i’ve learned to basically ignore that or change the subject.  but it’s the dementia talking.  last week my mom called to wish my nephew a happy birthday, but she was a day early.  she got her dates mixed up.  my sister said “it’s not his birthday, it’s tomorrow” and my mom said “oh, i’m sorry, i’ve got my dates mixed up.  i’m having a hard time remembering what day it is” and asked to wish him a happy early birthday.  my sister said “i’m done with this conversation” and hung the phone up on her.  my mom called me sobbing,  my dad confirmed this conversation.  i’m taking all the emotional load here, and soon it will be a lot more, as you don’t recover from growing old.  i need help, i need someone to occasionally tap in so i can tap out.  i can’t just ignore my mom as i wouldn’t do that to her.  how do i get my sisters to help?  i know some of you will do the “not my job to facilitate a relationship”.  i’m not trying to, i want them to take their share of the care of our aging parents."," i'm in the same boat. i have a sister and two brothers who do nothing to help. my dad (88) moved in with my husband and i last year (hubby is awesome for this imo). my sister lives about 5 hours away and is currently battling lung cancer so i give her a pass, although she could call occasionally. oldest brother is a jerk. enough said about that. other brother lives an hour away but is so self-absorbed he can't be bothered. it's like my siblings think ""dad is with deb now so we can get back to life"". thankfully i don't work outside my home. the downside is the reason i don't work...i have had anxiety and depression my entire adult life and was forced to retire 15 years ago due to it.why don't my siblings understand? why don't yours? i don't know. i wish i had help but i'm not going to beg. it's just a shame for all of us who have to do this with no help. especially from people who should help. i definitely feel you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fsp90i/siblings_that_wont_help_how_do_i_handle_this/,,"Siblings that won’t help, how do I handle this?"

"i know ive posted more than my share but one more, because things are strange. i know its probably because i dont understand. from my perspective...i havent been living near any close relative who passed away. then a couple years after i moved back my mom passed. she was 93 and always very energetoc until the two weeks before she went. i think she somehow knew her time was short. the last week she napped all afternoon every afternoon. i didnt see any of the signs. my dad is 93, had a stroke a few years ago and started going downhill which has increased . he has parkinsons and dementia and is a narcissist. which i mention because it means he thinks he knows everything and better than anyone, even the doctors. thats part of why he is where he is. he walks now with a walker on good days and a wheelchair now on bad days. he insists on being over his own meds and gets offended if i try and help with anything. that said i have caught it a few times before he has mistook his meds. we made a trip to his doc a couple weeks ago and the walk to the garage had him gasping for air. halfway down the hallway to the office he had to sit on his walker and rest, i pushed him the rest of the way, all very abnormal for him. normally he sleeps til 11ish, watches tv all afternoon and crashes after the 10pm news. there was one day, maybe friday that he tooks a bunch of his meds rt before dinner on an all but empty stomach. messed him up bad. his tremors were the worst id seen em and he was very weak. the next day he was normal again and told me what hed done. he wont be doing that again. sunday and monday he was so weak he couldnt roll over or get out of bed. good that we had his wheelchair. he also didnt have bladder control. and he had pronounced brainfog. no fever or throwing up .  i talked to the er doctor and she set up a urinalysis for next day at his docs. took me 3 hours to get a urine sample from him and then got him a rush appt, urine and blood no issues, we then did a lung xray and it was clean. tuesday he was better. i walked thru his morning and evening routines and he was ok. buthes sleeping almost all day. sun-wed only awake for meals and get ready for bed. sun/mon he also either had a couple very lucid dreams or hes startin g to hallucinate. this morning he swears he was in the bathroom and he got a call from a house maintenance company he uses. no voicemail so i have no clue how he heard anything. tues and wed progressively stronger. today stayed awake all afternoon, i think, and walked across the house on his own, went and sat on the porch. is now at 8:30 snoozing. bad thing is i have no idea if hes taken any meds.  and standing rule since he does have trouble sleeping is dont wake him up. i dont understand why sun/mon he took a deepdive on his health and his brain went loopy, tests were all good. a few days later he was the strongest ive seen him in a long time. i know life/health is all ups and downs but the swing is bizarre. im afraid of another downswing where hes incapable . and im afraid that since they found nothing else that his heart is wearing out, im afraid that since hes is suddenly sleeping so much he is about to pass. i went thru all this with his doc but since his tests were all ok she is satisfied.one other question....my dad has had throat issues since the 4 years ive been back. he does cough alot, claims drainage, has allergies. when he eats or drinks he often will cough and at times choke and he passed it off as drainage. he will not admit to a weakness or problem. ever. i always notice he doesnt drink enough water, his neurologist says it could contribute to his weakness. then says hes just old. i am beginning to think that the prevailing attitude of medicine in us as regards seniors is not to care. theyre just old. anyway, he may get 2 glasses of water a day, needs 4. when i took his urine sample in it was dark yellowy brown. def dehydrated bad. we talked about that monday night, he was really out of it so i think he told me the truth but i can never tell with him. he said he drinks water until hes full. i asked how he knew he was full. he said he drinks until hes full and he knows cause if he drinks any more it comes out.couldnt quite understand cause thats not how things work. he said if he leaned over right then water would come out. thats when i put it all together. he has swallowing issues. he drinks and eats but it may not always go down. but where is it going? hes not coughing and choking on phlegm, hes coughing and choking because the food and water didnt get swallowed and pass down into his stomach. it gets caught somewhere. but where. this also could explain why he wheezes alot and sometimes makes gurgling noises when he breathes. even his doctor noticed and wondered yet that all she did. but the problem is he wont admit he may have an issue. ive brought it up and suggested he get it checked out but as he doesnt understand how that could be then its false and he wont see about it.he also has sleep issues and with the sounds he makes when he breathes i thought maybe this interferes with his sleep or he has apnea. he wont get that looked at either. anyway, sorry for this mess. am kinda numb after this week, really dont understand. but will see if he sleeps on thru the night and how he is when he wakes up. one thing i can guess, he didnt change his adult undies so will be doing laundry tomorrow. ok i will stfu now. you folks take good care and stay healthy."," i also had a parent who suffered with parkinson's for many years before passing away. the swallowing became a big problem in my dad's last year of life, he would choke and get food down into his lungs as others have described below; turns out that more parkinson's patients die of aspirational pneumonia than anything else. anyhow, once the swallowing problem became more pronounced my mother had to add this thickener to everything he drank, and mash up all of his food. he hated it, hated living like that, it really took away a big pleasure of his life, one of the last things left, eating and drinking!  i felt terrible for him but told him that it was unrealistic to think that any of us were going to stand there and watch him choke to death because he couldn't swallow his food, so he was just going to have to accept it. with parkinson's, people have to give up one thing after another in a humiliating cascade, and it's really heartbreaking to watch. i still tear up thinking about all my poor dad went through in those last couple of years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/fpoi6w/confused_and_fearful/,,Confused and fearful

"hi, i want to apologize for the wall of text but i truly am lost, i am drowning and struggling to keep my head above water. (trigger warning for death.)i grew up with my grandparents, they took me in as a newborn because my mother didn't care to take care of me/was responsible enough to take care of me. they were in their 50s by then. growing up was fine and things were easy until my grandpa got a blood cancer diagnosis in 2011. it was manageable since he was in his 60s by then; i was still in high school but this is when i started taking my first steps into caretaking. i had to watch out for temperature spikes, i had to watch out for signs of pneumonia, blood clots, and other general things the more his disease progressed. in 2017, things took a turn for the worst and his health decreased more and more. 2018, i was officially in full caretaker mode; i didn't go back to school to finish the handful of credits i had left, i left the comfortable job i had there in order to be there to make sure he was okay which i never minded. my grandpa and i were closer than anyone in my family, so i felt like it was only right that i do this for him. in october 2018, i went on a short trip out of town without knowing how unwell my grandpa was, and he told me i should go, even though i desperately wanted to stay. but i bought the plane tickets and the person i was going to see in not so many words didn't want me to cancel the trip. four days into my trip, my grandpa went to the hospital and died of kidney failure as a result of his cancer. i feel guilt over this every day and it's hard to forgive myself; what do you do when a seemingly routine hospitalization turns into the last time you'll see them? this is where my grandma comes in. we've never been close, and she's been mildly abusive to me my entire life (verbal, emotional and sometimes physical) but the death of my grandpa made me feel as if i needed to reconcile and put the past behind us in order to make sure she was okay. she's turning 80 this december, and while i love her things have gotten exceptionally hard, even harder than it was dealing with my grandpa's frequent hospitalizations and incontinence. she went into the hospital august 2019 very sick, and i didn't know with exactly what until the doctors told us she needed to have emergency gallbladder removal. after her surgery, they moved her to physical therapy rehab to help her regain her movement since she was in a hospital bed for almost a month. it's at the rehab/long term care facility that the doctors told me she's in the early stages of dementia.while in the rehab, i tried to help the doctors and physical therapists with making sure she did the exercises (physical and mental) that she was supposed to be doing; but if she wasn't ignoring and yelling at the doctors, she was ignoring and yelling at me and it reminds me too much of my childhood. they wanted to send home help in the form of weekly physical therapists and cognitive therapy and medication except once she was home, she yelled and ignored them to the point they stopped coming with no notice all together. i felt too guilty after that to make her take the pills; i regret this, because maybe things would've been better. so now, it's just me taking care of things like cooking her meals, making sure her medicines and doctor's appointments are tended to, making sure she's keeping herself busy instead of staring at the television except she still fights me. she refuses to eat when she's upset with something i've said, she doesn't sleep normal hours, she won't let me ask the other family for help because it's gotten to the point where my health is finally plummeting. i've dealt with depression and anxiety since i was 11, and living with her without my grandpa around to talk to has made my mental health worse. i can't see a therapist or make appointments for my health as often as i'd like because she has separation anxiety when i'm gone, and i can't talk to her about how i'm feeling because she takes it as personal attacks, calls me crazy or sometimes downright turns her head away from me in an obvious show of ignoring me. we argue more and more until it's gotten to the point i can barely get out of bed for fear of what she'll say that day to make me feel terrible or to make me cry, but it's the guilt of my grandpa and knowing he'd want me to take care of her that keeps me here. i feel guilty that i don't want to do this. i'm 24, i was only two years into my degree and now i'm not sure if i can even go back because i've forgotten almost everything in the midst of death and grief. i don't have any friends, and the only people i can talk to are people on twitter but. no one wants to hear about something so depressing all the time so i slap on a mask and pretend i am coping but i'm not. i haven't felt this unwell since depression first stepped into my life and not since my first suicide attempt (that my grandma initiated). i have two aunts, a mother and even an adult cousin that all have more resources than me except they're the ones taking trips, going to work and living their lives without any regards to us. they only call her to make sure she's not dead, they never call me. i've never gotten along with them either, except for one of my aunts but it still feels so unfair that this is all my responsibility. i hate the bitterness i feel, because you're supposed to do this for family, right? except i feel like a shadow of myself, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't recognize myself anymore. i don't feel pretty anymore, i don't feel like i have worth anymore. and it's hard trying to take care of someone else when it feels like they hate you every single day but cry and say they need you when you want just an inch of space. i'm not sure what to do anymore. i need help but we don't have the income for home help i don't think. any advice would desperately be appreciated because i feel like i'm failing her and my grandpa, and myself. thank you to anyone listening, not many do lately.", danghey tell your family she's their grandma too they fucking better step upguilt them into ityou did right by your grandpa you were present as much as possiblenowwwww it's a bit much. got to get a caregiver to hang out sometimes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/fh5i36/taking_care_of_my_grandparents_fell_on_my/,,"taking care of my grandparents fell on my shoulders, except i'm getting crushed under the weight of loss and grief."

"i graduated my bsn with a minor in gerontology in december 2018. i have had my cna for over 7 years by that point that i figured i should just study for my nclex in the coming months. living in the bay area in ca became too expensive i had to move back in with my folks in the greater la area. health issues flared again and money ran out, so of course my procrastination kicked in. i had to pick up another cna job. no hospital would hire me despite all my experience!! maybe my recent degree scared them as i would only be there for short period of time. so nursing facility it is... but then the cna license expired last summer. only other jobs available were home health. took the first one... woman running the agency said “oh she’s a sweet lady but has vascular dementia and alzheimer’s with recent stroke in june 2019 but is in a outpatient rehab recovering but she’s a catholic nun that’s starting to hit.” nothing against them. their community has been great. long story short new blood clots formed in her legs and she stopped being able to walk, so now she’s home hospice and bed bound now. this was back in august 2019.i am still here. i was working 12 hour shifts with her 3-4 day’s a week with her but her aggression and agitation was just becoming so bad i hated going to work. i burned out. i now just so 6 hour shifts a couple of times a week. my first cna job was hospice but at least we kept our residents comfortable. they don’t do anything for this poor woman. tylenol that’s it for her pain! she’s got severe arthritis/inflammation in her knees you can feel the warmth radiate when your hand just hovers over her. she screams every time i reposition her (no pressure ulcers yet. she still eats 3 meals a day with my help).i don’t take things personal. i worked in a major county general hospital ed with an interesting population and was told every degrading word in the book. she tells me to go to hell and shut up all the time. she tells me she’s going to kill herself and she wants my foot to kick her in the head. and she tells me she’s in pain her legs and back hurts. i tell her “main” nun/sister all this stuff but she says “oh that’s just part of the disease.” ummm no shit? i went to nursing school and worked in multiple units of a hospital... i know what i’m working with but just because she can’t tell you doesn’t mean she isn’t in pain. she grimaces all the time and she’s been literally laying in bed since august so i have no doubt she is very sore and in pain. the pressure on her pelvis and back must be so terrible. i do rom often but she is soooo stiff. i have yet to see the doctor come to do an assessment on her. only an lvn comes out. i voiced my concerns but he doesn’t listen. i reminded him 3 times to get me dicloflenac gel for her arthritic knee. she is prescribed 1mg xanax but of course the nun in control of her medication cuts in half so she doesn’t get her full dose. she claims it works for her but i’m the one with her most of the day and i’m the one that gets the lashing all day by this poor frustrated catholic nun. i need to get my nclex asap so i get out of this place but it’s just so hard to watch this lady essentially suffer. i’ve worked in a phenomenal hospice/palliative care facility and i feel we are failing at providing comfort to this women. i come home so agitated and helpless. i’m in no mood to study. the agitation, restlessness, loud vocalizations is just getting worse and the nuns that live in the house with her just close the doors. she apparently had a possible small tonic clonic seizure before my shift started this morning but i do see any signs of post ictal or high bp. though i know she’s very risk for it. sorry for the long post. i actually go on and on! i’ve been trying to watch teepa snow’s videos for some more resources.", why don't you take the test already??????,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/f2xels/so_overwhelmed_with_my_11_demented_nun/,,So overwhelmed with my 1:1 Demented Nun
"i want to start this off by introducing myself and explaining my situation.i have been a caregiver for members of my family since i was 20? or so years old.it started with my grandma, then both of my grandparents until my grandfather died. i went on to help my grandma until she was eventually placed in a home where she currently resides. they both have/had severe alzheimers/dementia and my grandma is a diabetic. i would cook, clean, and administer meds for them both. because of my experience with this, it was naturally expected of me to be there to help my mom adjust to taking care of my dad after his 3rd stroke. his first was in 2015 and his third and final was in march of 2016.i had been living with a friend for the past year and would occasionally visit my parents. up until the 3rd stroke, they were doing great on their own and they actually had a healthy dynamic. now some backstory: my parents have an extremely toxic relationship. my mom was a lifelong alcoholic until last year (explain later in post) and my dad was almost never home while i grew up. i am the oldest of 4, 3 girls and 1 boy as the youngest. i was expected to take on many responsibilities from an early age because of my mom's alcoholism. i constantly got into verbal fights with my mom while trying to defend myself. i would get in trouble for stuff my siblings did, i would fight back about how unfair it was that my youngest brother and sister were never made to do chores or clean. this affects their adult lives, with my brother only learning how to do basic things from his gf and my sister turning into an unchecked ego. ithere was a lot of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse that happened pretty much my entire life. my parents constantly fought and would refuse to divorce because they wanted to stick together for my brother. long story short about my brother: he is the christ child and can do no wrong. they worship him. standard sexism in the family unit stuff. my mom would bend over backwards to make sure my dad and brother got everything they ever wanted, while myself and my closest sister were treated like the help. i was the only one that was ever hit and anytime i did something that upset my dad, he would spank me and blame the pain on me, saying stuff like this hurts me more than it does you. i would get my behind shredded for making a b in 3rd grade. stuff like that. the one time i told a teacher about it, she contacted my parents and told them everything. i was having trouble sitting at school because my dad had beat my behind the night before for not cleaning my room in a timely manner.anyways, i will move on to the current situation. a few months after i moved back in with my parents to help out, my mom broke her back. burst fracture if her l1. turns out if you have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis, and you drink heavily every day for 30 years, you make your bones so brittle that a sneeze could break your ribs.who knew right?so i was suddenly not just helping, i was taking care of both of them.now keep in mind the emotional abuse i had experienced in the past.my dad's emotional filter in his brain was basically destroyed. he lost his left side to paralysis. he would verbally lash out at me and my mom for little shit and on a few occasions he tried to hit us with his cane.he could have actually killed my mom if he had hit her but thankfully that did not happen.fast forward to now. i have become their full time caretaker and take care of literally everything.i could go on and on about all the shit that has happened in the last 4 years but this post is already too long. now i am completely burnt out. i can't be around my dad without being triggered violently and i have to stop myself from blowing up. my mom is a narcissistic guilt trip master and i literally cannot leave the house unless it's to take them to doc appts or to buy groceries. the few and far between times that i can leave the house, they both guilt me and make me feel terrible and treat me like a child. i'm gonna be 30 this year. i have no life. i have one friend. i almost never leave the house. we are living off of my dad's social security disability check which isn't enough to actually survive on. my mom is waiting to get on disability but they are taking their dear sweet time. we haven't paid rent in the last 2 months because if we did wouldn't have any money for food or for medicine and that's a whole other bag of dicks right there. both of their meds together cost roughly 800 a month. and that's even with my dad now being on humana and medicare.i don't know what to do. i desperately want to escape and get on with my life. literally everyone i talk to tells me to get out and i know i need to.but here's the thing...i would feel so guilty, despite everything. i would feel like i'm abandoning them. i have tried to reach out for help. nothing is working.both of my parents are technically capable of taking care of some things themselves but they won't do it and when i try to explain how it would help me greatly, it turns into a ""you're so ungrateful and selfish"" argument.i have to make phone calls for them that they could make themselves. fill out paperwork they could do themselves. i even have to talk to their docs for them because if i didn't, they wouldn't care and wouldn't advocate for themselves. there is an extremely unhealthy attachment going on here and i just wanna hear from anyone who is or has experienced something similar. i just need help. i am so fucking tired and i'm scared that i will send myself into a cardiac episode or worse because i'm under so much constant stress. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'm sorry if i have posted in the wrong area. this is my first ever post."," this is a truly terrible situation. wish i had better ideas for how to get you out of it, but someone already suggested calling adult protective services, which i

"when your mom or dad’s [dementia]( or [alzheimer’s]( care requires more than you can reasonably provide, it might be time to start thinking about transitioning to a [memory care]( community. [a variety of memory care levels]( exist, from providing simple medication reminders to full care communities assisting residents with bathing, dining, and ensuring they won’t get lost. before considering a move like this, be sure to verify your loved one matches behavior associated with [the early signs of alzheimer's and dementia,]( and consult a trusted physician.## transitioning to a memory care communitythe first thirty days can be the most difficult as you and your parent work through the shift from independent living to a memory care community. in many cases, your loved one may not always remember why the move is a good idea and might become upset or argumentative. being patient but firm, and leaning on the staff and administration at your chosen community for help, can aid you through this process and make your mom or dad feel at home.## explore before the movetaking your mom or dad to enjoy lunch or recreational activity at their chosen memory care community can help give them familiarity with the building, grounds, staff, and other members of the residence. associating positive feelings and memories with the community can make it easier for them to feel at home once they move in. you can also discuss various alzheimer’s care options with the staff, and see how other residents enjoy their lives in the community setting.## share information with staffthe caregivers at your loved one’s chosen senior living community should have as many questions for you as you do for them. be prepared to tell them as much as you can about your parent’s life and interests. knowing which foods they like and dislike, what things they were passionate about when they were young, and other personal pieces of information about your mom or dad can help staff personalize your parent’s care.## initiating the actual movethe chaos of moving can be even more confusing and disorienting to a loved one living with dementia or alzheimer’s. having one friend or family member spend the day with your parent while the rest of you arrange the setup of their new room can help.choose belongings carefully to create a space that feels familiar as well as offering staff insight into your parent’s personality and interests. focus on items with personal value and sensory input, like a soft quilt or family photos.## take time to visit frequentlyyears ago, the standard recommendation was for family and friends to stay away for the first week or after transitioning to a memory care community. at the kensington falls church, we encourage family members to visit our[ memory care communities]( frequently, and even have a pet-friendly policy so you can enjoy time with the entire family while your loved one adjusts.by planning visits for a specific time of day, you can create a defined routine helping your mom or dad get used to the idea of you coming, leaving, and reliably coming again.## adapt your interactionsunderstanding memory loss can help you learn how [alzheimer’s]( and [dementia]( affect behavior.you may need to adapt the way you interact with your loved one. if they insist an impossible event took place, or that a fact (like the year) is different than what you know to be true, realize that this is their reality. arguing may only lead to unnecessary unhappiness. instead, enjoy listening to their stories and find small, meaningful activities to do together, such as sharing a meal or going for a walk around the grounds.## practice self-careit’s important to take care of yourself to make the most out of your time together. if you are experiencing grief or frustration, there is a good chance they will also pick up on your emotions and become upset. you may want to consider talking with a friend or therapy professional about your feelings as a way to work through your role in the transition.the better you care for yourself, the better you’ll be able to help take care of your mom or dad.## know that it gets easierthe initial transition into a memory care community can be challenging, and at times your loved one may say or do things that are hurtful. but remember, it isn’t personal.they are coming from a place of uncertainty, confusion, and frustration. accept that their unhappiness is temporary. they will have good days and difficult days.by attending to their care with compassion and love, you are ensuring that they are safe and will continue to have every opportunity for a fulfilling life beyond dementia.find out more about how the kensington falls church can help your mom or dad transition to the highest level of independence without compromising their safety.## recommended additional reading:* [how to pay for assisted living](* [dancing does an older body good](* [meet me at the memory

"i genuinely don't know what on earth to do anymore. before i get into everything, let me give you a little background on myself. i'm 18 years old living in a household with my mother, my father, four cats, and recently my grandmother. i'm in my last year of highschool so i've been super busy with school and basically getting ready for college. but besides that, i'm having a problem that i literally have no clue how to fix. my grandmother has been diagnosed alzheimer's for a little over 5 years now, and she's only been living with us for about 9 months. she hasn't been too bad or anything, she actually has been doing amazing lately, but my dad sees her as this burden. he always makes it seem like my mother and i never help him out with her (even though he leaves me for a day or two while he's hanging out with a friend at a brewery or something) and he constantly says how he is frustrated with life. the worst part is that it is now influencing my grandmother, having her say ""i want to die"" and ""no one wants me around"". what am i supposed to do in this situation? i know i'll be leaving for college soon, but i don't want to leave my mother in a toxic environment like that. how do i make him see that he is effecting the whole house with his attitude?", i suggest you contact the alzheimer’s association. they will be able to direct you to support groups in your area as well as what services are available for your grandmother.i hope this is helpful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/dqbmt6/my_dad_is_making_everything_worse/,,My Dad is making everything worse.
"typing this out just to vent. it's been a hell of a day. quick background. my dad died suddenly almost 2 years ago and we found out mom was farther along with alzheimer's than we'd known. i've spent the last two years helping as best as i can, and we finally got her moved into assisted living a month ago. but i feel terrible. i've taken here out of a familiar house (~45 years), taken her dogs away (she really couldn't care for them properly) and the new place is great with awesome staff and good food, but it's just not what she's used to. the transition is not going well. today we've been called by nursing staff twice. first time, i was already on my way up with her dog and we had a great afternoon. she seemed in great spirits and we walked the dog, talked, everything seemed good. late tonight we got a call again. she's upset, bad headache, talking about wanting to kill herself. i feel like i had to get her out of a 'living alone' situation. but i can't help feeling like i've messed everything up. we've sunk like 15k into the assisted living so far. i'm trying to sell her house to help fund things for the next several years. but if it's not working then i have no idea what to do. part time home care, live in home care, moving in with me or siblings, me or siblings moving in with her... all these options were weighed and i thought we made the best choice.how do you stop yourself from despair when the plans you make don't seem to work out? i feel like i've messed everything up and there is no hope. what a terrible disease. it just eats up everything and everyone. i can't believe how few options there seem to be and how bloody expensive it all is. most days all she wants to do is end it all and we can't even help her go out on her own terms. i feel like i've tried my hardest and failed spectacularly. how do you all do it?", i don’t know but perhaps at the two month mark things will be better? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlzheimersSupport/comments/a6lyhr/what_a_rough_day/,,what a rough day

"hello, i just found this subreddit and was looking for support. i posted in r/offmychest my story then looked for help. just quickly, i am a 31f that is caring for my grandmother with dementia. i am mostly alone doing this as my dad does help but he lives in another state and has a wife with breast cancer he now is caring for. only 2 of my cousins help from time to time with paperwork and mental support but outside of that no else helps. i have been doing this since my grandfather's second stroke about 6 or 7 years ago. i am now 31 and feel like i can't really date, go out with friends often, and that i'm going to miss my chance to get married and start my own family because it feels like i will always be taking care of my grandmother.  she has an aide but the aide is so limited in what she can do that i still have to do so much. these last few days have been extremely difficult because my grandmother got covid from someone at her church and the aide can't come until she is covid free so now i'm all alone caring for her. it's been 5 days and i want to just burst into tears. i'm so scared for my future because i'm scared no man will want me if it means he will probably have to become at least a part time caregiver too. is anyone else dealing with this or have dealt with this? did you find love?"," how is the aide limited in what they can do? the only limitations i can think of are if your grandmother refuses to cooperate with her, so the aide can't force her to do anything.  or the aide is too small/weak to perform the necessary duties.  you may want to look into hiring someone new if it's the latter.  i am always surprised when people have aides who can barely perform the tasks, because that signals they're not right for the position.  as for your situation, i can totally relate.  i am 32 and take full care of my mother after my dad died.  i am married, but my husband works and is gone most of the time, so i feel alone too.  i am lucky in the sense that i have an incredibly understanding husband who is fine with our unique living situation, but i know many guys wouldn't be.  can the state pay an aide for ft help? my two cents, if a guy can't accept your life circumstances, it's probably a sign it won't work out in the long term anyway.  people who are unable to adapt/accommodate for people they love generally don't make the best partners.  i would try to still find a way to date and get out of the house.  i know it's not easy, but it's doable.  get to know people and have them get to know you before you put all your cards on the table.  it's also hard to know what the future entails, pretty much anything is possible! everytime i have worried about the future, i have found that once the future becomes the present, it has a weird way of working out.  things end of being not nearly as complicated or as hard as you might anticipate.  hold tight op!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/w2y1jd/how_do_you_deal_with_being_a_young_woman_and_a/,,how do you deal with being a young woman and a caregiver

"hey yall, i’m gonna try to summarize my current circumstances and explain what’s going on because i’ve found myself in a heck of a situation very suddenly and i need support/advice/whatever. i’m 18 (19 on july 30) and my nana is 79 (80 on august 31). nana has been having severe and ongoing health issues for as long as i can remember, but about 4-5 years ago, our family built an apartment connected to our house to be closer to both of my grandparents. they moved out of their beautiful house 45 minutes away into their little apartment, and the stress of moving must have aged them like 10 years because things are bad. my gumpa (83 on august 8) got diagnosed with dementia a couple years ago, and he is literally completely unable to help out my nana anymore &amp; needs help of his own. this is really bad because my nana has severe scoliosis, osteoporosis, awful circulation, basically everything under the sun that could have gone wrong has gone wrong and she needs a hip replacement now. she can barely walk on her own. a few nights ago, nana fell and broke her wrist. like shattered it. so yesterday i was with her at the hospital all day waiting for surgery. surgery went well, she’s back at home now, and i stayed overnight to make sure she had everything she needed and i’m going to be staying all day today too. this is going to be a looooong recovery process because she needs to completely rest her wrist for 5 weeks and then needs to go to physical therapy for a couple months after that. like i said, she also can’t really walk anymore and doesn’t have any help from my gumpa, so taking care of her has all fallen on me. they’re both my mom’s parents and she spends a lot of time over at the apartment helping them out, but she also works a full time job and can’t be there as much as someone needs to be there… so considering i’m currently unemployed and not in college, but i drive a car and am generally responsible, i’m the perfect candidate for the job. i was actively interviewing with a potential employer immediately before this happened, but this is way more important. caregiving is challenging enough work as it is, but there’s more important context to this; my nana is a very difficult person to be around for extended periods of time. she has so much completely unhealed trauma and untreated mental illness- her entire existence these days is suffering, because she’s completely trapped in her own head. it’s not her fault obviously, but she is literally the most obsessive, anxious, and pessimistic person i have ever met in my entire life. this is particularly heavy on me because i have the same hereditary mental illness as she does, but i’ve been treating it all in therapy since i was like 11. i still struggle plenty on my own. fortunately, my presence seems to lighten my nana’s mood a lot and she is really appreciative of having me around and having my help, but oh my god. this is getting draining and i’ve only been doing it for a couple days. i love her dearly and i will help her with anything she needs ever for the rest of her life, and she keeps trying to compensate me with money and whatever because she feels so guilty, but like… i’m not doing this so she rewards me, i’m doing this because i love her and she needs someone to take care of her right now. my parents and my brother have been awesome in terms of being supportive and getting me off the hook when i need it these past couple days. i’m just anxious about the fact that i’m gonna be doing this nonstop for a while. i know my nana feels so bad about stopping me from living my life and taking care of her, but her guilt really isn’t helping me out here. basically, i just want to know what some of you guys have done and how you felt in situations like this that were out of your control. i feel like i got thrown in the deep end, but i really need to keep myself and both of my grandparents afloat, preferably without any of us losing our marbles. i want to be able to do my best but i’m very new at this and i need help from pretty much anywhere i can receive it. tl;dr my elderly grandmother destroyed her wrist but she also can’t walk and my grandfather has dementia and can’t do literally anything, so i’m suddenly taking care of them pretty much full time until my grandmother gains some independence back, and i’m afraid i’m gonna actually go insane. pls for the love of god send me some encouragement or advice or literally anything that could possibly help bc i need it", it is an insane situation to care for 2 people at the same time. one is already hard.   you definitely need to ask your parents n your brother to help or hire someone.   you are young n i'm sure very capable. but it's alot emotionally to be this responsible for 2 people's lives at your age.  just bc you're free doesn't mean you're it.   definitely speak up.. get a schedule made where you get time off.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vzmmoa/suddenly_thrown_into_caregiving_situation/,,suddenly thrown into caregiving situation??
"not sure where to post but i just need to talk...my dad is a caregiver for my grandmother who has dementia. he currently has some health problems but is having trouble getting care for himself because he's a caregiver. my grandmother had an aid but the company has been terrible and the last aid gave them covid and that was the last straw. he had made some progress but had to reschedule because of the covid. now he has to either wait months to get care because everything medical is delayed due to covid (and probably other ""events"") effects in the country or get admitted to the hospital asap for the same care by the same doctors that can treat him immediately. this was a last resort because he will have to put my grandmother into temporary hospice and he will need help from family while he's in the hospital.fast forward to now, he is starting to get plans in place but i'm nervous, scared, and frustrated because the only family that can help is me, my sister, and a cousin and we all live in other states.  this will be financially tough for all of us. i'm a last resort because i'm farthest away but i still don't know how i'm going to get through this. what if my dad finds out he will need more care which means more help? what if my grandmother is neglected while shes away? travel is expensive. also i can only imagine how expensive my dad's medical bills will be if he needs more care and just for the hospital bill in general. even with insurance, my dad already doesn't have alot of money.  i'm frustrated with us healthcare and i'm overwhelmed and scared for my family and myself. how has anyone gotten through this kind of situation?"," idk what kind of medical procedure your dad needs but, in general, hospital stays, even for major surgeries is surprisingly short. you could consider taking care of both gma & dad at home. with 3 possible caregivers, maybe y’all can take turns, say 2 week shifts to care for both. you could hire a temp caregiver to come in 2-3 times per week to help with showers. i took care of both my parents and sister post op recently (3 people) by myself this a few months back. my parents’ caregiver walked out for 4 days, my sister, the primary caregiver, had knee replacement surgery, and my brother died from covid. i was there for 2 weeks but it wasn’t too bad if you plan for everything in advance. the 4 days without the other caregiver where i took care of all 3 people and made burial plans for my brother were pretty crazy. but i survived and so will you.personally, i’d keep gma at home bc short term environmental changes are really hard in dementia patients. y’all three possible caregivers can take turns taking care of gma or gma & dad. this should give them almost 6 weeks. (i’d stagger it where each caregiver stays 2 weeks, with 1-2 days overlap to get errands done.)my sister’s surgery was outpatient and came home that afternoon.here are some tips:1) whoever is doing the grocery shopping now, presumably your dad, have him give you a list of weekly groceries and find out if you can have them delivered to the house. or, stock up on non perishables. plan on not being able to leave the house very much, if at all. if possible, ask a friend or neighbor to pick up fresh groceries weekly. non grocery stuff were ordered from amazon for delivery to our front door.2) cook as much food as you can before your dad goes into the hospital. freeze a lot of cooked proteins & veg. pasta & rice can be cooked daily as needed. meals should be kept simple. you might have to eat the exact same thing for days on end for simplicity’s sake. you can also order meals from rest for delivery, if your budget allows.3) showers are the biggest issue, requiring 2 caregivers. for this reason, we only shower my parents once per week, up they’re feeling up to it. in the winter, they’re usually too cold and we towel bathe them. we usually towel bathe them every other day or so. my sister’s surgeon said that she’d be moving around well within 10 days and i was skeptical but his estimate was accurate. she was able to go for a walk down the block and back before i left. so your dad would probably recover quicker than you think. ask his doctor.so no worries, it’s doable if you plan ahead. good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vz0el9/frustrated_and_scared/,,Frustrated and scared
"over the past 3 years, my gf has been a caregiver for a 91 year old grandmother with dementia. she has been very passionate, has gone above and beyond, and sees her as family. her employer, the daughter of the patient is a doctor and has always paid in cash. i can attest that my gf truly loves the grandmother like family. she has spent weekends there before watching her overnights. last wednesday, the employer said she needs my gf to watch her mother friday-monday. told her she could come and go as she pleases and that she will pay her $900. this was all agreed upon over a phone call. in order to make these accommodations, my gf paid $200 to board her dog for the weekend as she couldn’t bring her dog to the house. she canceled plans to go to a concert with her best friend that lives out of town and was coming in town for her birthday. she got there at 8:00 am. she first left the house at 9:00 pm to get food with me. we were gone for 2 hours and came back to the house to sleep. her employer does not like me, so i remained in the living room and never left the couch. the next morning, she cared for the patient until 4:00 pm, doordashed food using her own money. we briefly left for 30 min to run to get food. in that 30 min, a family friend came over and panicked when nobody was there. instead of contacting anybody, he rushed and woke up the patient who had just laid down to nap and gave her an extra breathing treatment which she had just received an hour prior. he called the employer to report what happened and said that an unknown car was there. the employer then calls my gf accusing her of negligence and putting her house at risk by my being there. for the rest of the weekend, my gf didn’t leave a single time. come tuesday, the employer began texting my gf making a slue of baseless and untrue accusations. made many claims saying she was negligent and that she had her dog there. we all know she was really just mad that i was there. sure my gf was wrong by bringing me there, but there were no problems that came from my presence. she now made a facebook post saying that her mother’s health is declining due to “a negligent caretaker”. she is now making increasingly baseless claims and accusations and is really bullying/gaslighting my gf. with each conversation, my gf fears that her employer isn’t going to pay the $900. regardless if the employer is upset that i was there for 12 hours, my gf still performed all her duties that they had agreed upon. my gf is heartbroken at the treatment she’s receiving from those she saw as family. but she spent roughly $350 to make that $900, so she’d be out $1250. the details were discussed by phone, so nothing is in writing. she is a fresh graduate in student debt and can’t afford a lawyer, especially considering her employer is a well off doctor. is there anything that she can do to make sure she gets paid the $900 that had been agreed upon?"," she can tell the ""employer"" that she will report her for tax fraud.  pretty sure ""paying in cash"" means that employer is not contributing to social security, paying unemployment and workers comp taxes.  employer may let her go but she sure as shit will cough up the $900.having a loved one in dire straits does play crazy games on people's emotions, i will say.  it is easy to get irrationally irate at caregivers for any slight.  your gf should only take the steps recommended above if the $900 is not forthcoming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vyz7xp/is_my_girlfriend_entitled_to_her_compensation/,,Is my girlfriend entitled to her compensation?
"i'm sorry this is going to be pretty long, i just need somewhere to release it all. i've (32f) have been a caregiver since i was 16 years old. litterally half my life. my mother was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's my freshman year of high school, by sophomore year she had already forgotten my name. junior year i quit school and started to take care of her full time. my father had left us (my mom and my siblings) because she cheated on him before she got diagnosed but i know that, it was probably caused by her mental illness. in 30 years of marriage not once did she even look at someone else. i became the new defacto mother. taking care of my sisters (who are the same age we're triplets) and my mother. i found a job that would pay me under the table, and i was lucky we were already in government housing.by 17 my mother was a total care, couldn't speak, couldn't feed herself but damn could she excape from anywhere. she went wondering for the first time on my 18th birthday, it was a very cold, snowy december 1st. i spent hours outside looking for her with neighbors, i can't even remember how long it was when we finally found her. i do remember crying in my bed that night unable to sleep listening to the lightest noise that she may be getting out of her bed.my sisters and i grew up, me being everyone's mom, and them i let them grow up, finish school. they eventually got married and moved out leaving me and my mother completely alone for the first time. that's when my father came back gone for 4 years leaving basically children to fend for themselves and their mother. but he was hurt, a broken foot and needed someone to take care of him. i don't know why i agreed but i did. adding yet another who required my care. my sisters come around... but are already busy with new family. old doesn't matter anymore. by 21, i had gotten my ged and attempted to go to college online, while working from home, and taking care of both my parents at the same time. i was doing great until my father got really sick. he couldn't keep food down, and was swelling up like a balloon. doctors appointments later kidney failure. he'd have to be on dialysis for the rest of his life. his doctor chose a newer method called peritoneal dialysis. it would just require me to set him up on a machine every night. which i agreed to. 28 years old and i've never held a job for longer than 6 months, something always came up. i've had loved ones leave me because i had too much responsibility, not enough free time. i didn't and don't want kids because i've been taking care of someone else my whole life already. mom's no longer eating anything i make, she'll chew it up and spit it right back out. her doctors make the decision to put in a peg tube and teach me how to feed her. the second week feeding my mother through her belly, she coughs, and coughs, and then can't breathe. she vomits and gasps for air. i call the ambulance and in less than an hour i'm told.... she might survive the night. i call my family. my sisters show up and so does my brother. they come in for a couple minutes then leave after the doctor says it won't happen for a while. less than 5 minutes after they leave and it's just her and i again, and she's gone. i listen to her ragged, rattle and then the final sigh. i feel... light... a weight is lifted from my chest and i could breathe for the first time in years. 29 years old and everything is going great for the first time in a long time. i've been in school for a year, and working at the same place for just as long. i still have to hook my dad up at night, but i've got free time in the mornings for just me. i had been going to the gym and lost the 60lbs i gained after my mom passed away, and was looking forward to the vacation i had lined up. it was just a staycation at a local hotel but it was more freedom than i had ever tasted.on march 6th, 2019, i got a call from my father. he's frantic saying he fell and he couldn't get his legs under himself. i call the ambulance and rush home, he's lying on the ground can't even lift his head up, his speech slurred and left side limp. i'm comforting him waiting for the parametics, but in my head i'm just screaming not again. it was a stroke, one that he might not recover physically from. days in the hospital they bring him back home... incontinent, unable to feed himself, and unable to walk. but still all there mentally. i call my siblings... and they come and see him.. and just as quickly leave again. alone again, with my father.once again unemployed, quit school. a full-time caregiver once again.july 12, 2022, my fathers amputated toes, from a wound that wouldn't heal, legs like a skeleton. mentality he's gone, i've known it for months. nothing of his 6'3 233lbs left on him. hasn't ate in weeks and now refusing a ng tube. a peg tube on his dnr as a never. tomorrow i find out if i take him home and watch him go just like my mother, or if he qualifies for hospise (which he won't.)i now sit... in bed again wondering who i'll be once he's gone too. if you read this... thank you for letting me share my thoughts with you. tldr: caregiver for

"so i have been caregiving for my dad for 7+ years, he has parkinson’s, psychosis and dementia. over the past 8 or 9 months he has rapidly declined. 9 months ago he was getting around relatively well on his own, only using a walker. recently we had to make the decision to put him into a long term care facility as he had lost the ability to walk and required assistance to use his wheelchair/dress/toilet/eat. it was all too much for us to handle as we all have full time jobs/school. that was about 1 &amp; 1/2 months ago. i’ll be honest it was a relief in the sense that taking care of him was like working another full time job and time to take care of ourselves or even just relax was extremely limited. that said, it was still a very hard decision to make and we cried when it was made. we all love him so much.now, in the last few weeks he has gone completely down hill. he has lost so much weight as he has lost the ability to swallow and lacks an appetite and the last few days he has become non-verbal and now today completely unconscious. i don’t even know what to say. i’m certain the end is near and i just want his suffering to end. i can’t sleep at night, i keep waking up with anxiety thinking about him. all day i cry. i don’t want him to die, but i also don’t want him to be in pain any longer. this isn’t a life anyone should have to live. my dad is a good man, he doesn’t deserve this.does anyone have experience with this? how long is someone in this state expected to live? he’s slowly starving to death, its horrible. i’m not religious but if you could pray for my dad and my family i would be eternally grateful."," i am so sorry for your loss but just know he is no longer suffering.  if he believed in god then rest assured, he is in heaven.  having faith in jesus christ as i do, is an individual decision for every person to make.  once faith/belief in christ starts in a person, salvation becomes eternal as it is the gift from god no one can take away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vrt7xn/nearing_the_end_and_im_scared/,,Nearing the end and I’m scared

(plus they don't call me anyway)  i decided to stop discussing or venting to my bf because he can't be bothered with hearing about this everyday too and i actively talk to him, but only see each other sometimes. finding therapists around here is kinda tough and there's zero availability at my docs office. our relationship is shit now, but that's for a different thread. i don't need any advice. i just needed to vent and throw myself out there to still feel alive. but i'm almost sure i won't be for very long at this rate. realistically, i hope she wakes up one day and realizes how screwed up she is and that she better get it together or she will end up in a home. maybe with walls and floors that won't hurt when she feels like standing all day long... stupid.", hugs. i feel you. dad is end stage diabetic with chf and wants ice cream.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vivhh6/why_do_you_constantly_lie_that_you_have_been/,,Why do you constantly lie that you have been asleep?

some background on this. i am 34 and i lost my mom almost 2 years ago. she was 75 and my dad is turning 80 this year. dad had said if something happened to mom that he wanted to see more of the world. then last year we were having trouble with my uncle. he hit end stage dementia and my aunt so had dementia. we had to help get him in a rest home and her in assisted living. my aunt had begged to live with dad instead but dad had took care of mom for so many years and i felt like it was time for dad to live for his own. he took care of enough people throughout his life. dad is in really good shape for almost 80. he insisted he didn't wanna just sit around until he died. at 80 you never know when you could go. so last year he wanted to take a mini vacation to somewhere in south carolina. he drove off but only made it barely into south carolina and called me and said he was just gonna come back. i thought okay fair because car rides that long irritate me too even in my mid 20s so fair enough. we also had my aunt and uncle to deal with so i just put it off as all because of that. this year he started talking about going to vegas. i said go for it. my uncle had died in january due to end stage dimentia. aunt loretta was settled in her new home. i helped him book the flight and the car. the closer he got he started talking about he didn't know if he would feel well down there and might just end up setting in the hotel room. i was like what? surely he isn't gonna pay all that and get on a plane and then get the car just to sit in a hotel in vegas....... the day came and i helped him to the airport. my wife said maybe i should have went but i dismissed it because dad does everything by himself without needing help. he got on and got down there. he called me and i was optimistic he was going to have a good memory of this trip and i felt good helping him do something he wanted to do before it was too late. then i called him today ...... he tells me he hasn't went anywhere and that he is afraid to leave the strip because he doesn't know how to get back. my dad is old school he has a flip phone with no internet. he has always relied on paper maps. he took some with him. so i started to doubt but then he started talking about taking an atv tour in the desert with people. so i was optimistic again. i just got off the phone with him again tonight and he said he did nothing but sit in the hotel room and that he might not do nothing until he gets back on the plane to go home. now i don't know what to do or how to motivate him. can you really say you been to vegas without leaving the hotel??? i want him to atleast have 1 experience or memory besides cable tv and restaurants.  i just don't know how to motivate him. he has 2 days until he flys back., my first thought - he doesn't want to go alone. i wouldn't either. go with him or find a travel group for seniors. they are out there. i hope he has a way to have some fun.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vhxuhw/dont_know_what_to_do/,,Don't know what to do.

"i’m 19, i basically got kicked out by my mom after a misunderstanding and sent to live with my grandma. my grandma is deteriorating fast, i quickly became her caregiver when she starting making herself overtired to the point of dementia because she only drinks coffee and diet coke. im so tired.last time it happened, my aunts had to come over to watch her so i could sleep for a few hours and they sorted out her uti medication on the phone because aside from her never sleeping, she also had a uti which was making it worse. my oldest aunt doesn’t understand that her mom isn’t as mentally sound as she was a year or two ago, she only sees her once a month or so and my grandma always cleans her act up. she’s always asking me about getting a job somewhere even though my mom never cared to get me my liscense and sort of took all my money from me under the guise of paying her rent and buying her groceries and ubers home from the bar.my younger aunt doesn’t want me to get a job because she understands how my grandma is, but i just like. why me? why can’t one of you take care of her so i can learn how to drive and so i can get a job, i can’t stay here forever, and i don’t know what i’m going to do with my life after my grandma dies even though i know she probably has ten or fifteen more years left in her. i had to move 800 miles away when i got kicked out, i don’t have any friends, i barely know any of my family, my younger cousin is being influenced by her mom (the rude aunt) and making fun of me for not being able to drive or being to anxious to het a job because i don’t want to leave my grandma alone for too long.i love my grandma, she and my (late) grandpa made my childhood worth having between the issues with my mom and not having a father. i want to go out and have fun, i want friends, i want to get a license and a car. i want to go to cosmetology school. i feel like i’m missing out and i’m so anxious all the time just anticipating her next nonsensical episode where she makes just enough sense for the emts to refuse to take her to the hospital. i just want someone to talk to who doesn’t diminish how hard this is and acts like my grandma is perfectly fine. she’s always totally fine for a few months and then she has an episode."," first of all, you are so so very young. if i had been thrown into your position at 19 i’m positive i would have run away and changed my name. the strength that you are showing here is impressive, and will serve you well in life. but you gotta set boundaries and take care of yourself. people who aren’t willing to make sacrifices because they care, love to take advantage of those that are. your aunts are not doing their job. they are using you so that they don’t have to deal with it. they are not thinking about you or your grandma, they are thinking only about themselves. it seems to me that you’re torn because you want to be there for your grandma but you also want what all 19 year olds want, a life of your own. you are entitled to have a life of your own. this situation is not fair or right. you should not be the person carrying this burden. you certainly cannot do this alone. sooner or later, you will break. this is not sustainable. does your grandma have a relationship with any nearby neighbors? does she go to any regular gatherings such as a church? if she has any friends nearby, reach out to them and find out if they can offer any assistance or advice for your situation. find a local support group online for you. there are caregivers everywhere, and just because your family won’t help doesn’t mean there isn’t someone else out there who will. there may be programs in your area that you can take advantage of. if you’re in the us you can check out  and see if there’s anything there that can help you. you need help. you can not do this alone. grown ass adults can’t do this alone, even with a car and a job and their younger days well behind them. you could also leave and tell your aunts that it’s their turn to be the grown up. that may feel harsh but it is a completely valid decision that you should not carry any guilt for. if that’s the route you choose, find a local support group for young adults, and start looking for aide for yourself. again, there are assistance programs for this, you may be able to get help with transport, housing, jobs. you don’t have to figure it all out alone.good luck and i’m so sorry you have to deal with this. you deserve better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/vf22sb/i_just_want_someone_to_talk_to/,,I just want someone to talk to

"yesterday i took my uncle to see his disabled daughter, which is my cousin. bad idea it turns out.  my uncle has some sort of dementia or alzheimer's and has to always have someone with him.  he tends to get physically agitated and pace around, sometimes eloping.  most of the time he is pleasant to be around.  his daughter (age 46) has had 2 strokes on each hemisphere.  thus, she's partially paralyzed on each side.  she's my best friend.  she lives independently with the help of me, home health, and then recently her 21 y/o daughter moved in. we got there and all was fine until the home health aid and the daughter left.  i had gotten everyone dinner and we were about to leave and then my cousin said abruptly she had to go to the bathroom.  no big deal, i could stay a bit longer and make sure she ambulated to the bathroom fine. she hollered for me to pull her pants up. somehow, she then lost her balance and collapsed to the side of the toilet with the toilet seat pinching her ass. she started screaming and saying the most disturbing things like ""why is god doing this to me?!"", ""i hate god!"", ""i want to die"", ""i want my mom"" (her mom is deceased).  it was horrible and i felt helpless.  she is dead weight and when in that state of mind she can offer no help to get up.  she's 250lbs and i'm sorta petite so am of no help.  i just tried to comfort her with words but it was hard staying in there with her piercing screams and cursing and disturbing statements.  meanwhile, her dad is meandering around the house, getting into stuff like a curious raccoon.  omg, it was hell and it really made me think she might need to go to an assisted living center.  i've been against it since she owns her home and has home health but shit, it's horrible when she falls and has a freakout.  it seems to happen about twice a week.  i was freaking out inside while trying to remain calm for her benefit.  does anyone have similar experiences?  how do you cope with it?  i was a fucking nervous wreck for hours afterwards.  eventually, the daughter and her gf arrived and are strong enough to get her up.  just needing to know i'm not alone in these caregiver struggles."," i wouldn't worry about the things she said. she may have been in a huff or legitimately feels that way, but that's her choice. being disabled is no fun and she may feel disappointed the way her life has gone. many people blame god because they were raised to think if they were ""good"" that nothing bad would happen. it causes resentment.or she was just upset and embarrassed and sad.  i wouldn't judge her for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/va7niv/horrible_caregiving_experience_yesterday/,,Horrible Caregiving Experience Yesterday

"my mom is the primary caregiver for my grandmother who lives with us. when my grandma first came here about 6 years ago, she was mobile and active and still pretty “with it.” over the years she’s become practically bed bound (partially by choice she often refuses to walk) and her conditions have become much more advanced. my mom is…unraveling and is honestly extremely unpleasant to be around. and i know it’s my grandma because she was never like this before. we’ve had our issues like any other family but i’ve never found her straight up unpleasant. how can i support her so i can get my family back on track? some context:-my grandma has dementia, lung issues (she’s supposed to be on oxygen but refuses to use it), diabetes, mobility issues-my mom had a rocky childhood and i suspect that dealing with my grandmas woes everyday brings her back to that place. she’s in therapy but…i dunno.-my grandma is not a very grateful patient. when she moved in it was because my great grandma died, and she couldn’t afford the house they lived in anymore. so she was grateful for a place to stay, but now as she’s gotten worse, she’s bordering on ungrateful. my dad and i try to assure my mom that if she doesn’t like something (for ex a dinner) it’s ok and no big deal in the end but it’s not going well.-i’m in school full time and plan on going back to work at least part time once i can find a new job. my dad works full time but hybrid so 3 days he’s in the office and 2 he’s at home. -we’re black. if you get it you get it if you don’t you don’t. if you don’t get it i will not be taking questions.-we’re trying to get approved for a home health aid, the process is slow as molasses. according to whatever government medical assistance program/her pcp she’s not eligible for a nursing home because she’s not bad enough yet and even less eligible for a even a brief respite stint in a rehab because she’s non-compliant. i can’t think of much else to add but i do really want to get things back to “normal” i know that they will probably never be normal again but something close would be nice."," do anything you can to help out. if your mom is still shouldering all the responsibilities of cooking and cleaning and caregiving, take over those responsibilities (cooking and cleaning) as much as you can. offer to sit with grandma so your mom can get away or just take a nap. burn out is real and is filled with guilt and resentment. dementia patients often get mean and ungrateful because their brains don’t work right anymore.  keep after her pcp. make sure he knows of every de line and get her approved for a nursing home as early on as you can.  also, our local hospice provides respite for caregivers. you might check with the one in your area and see if they offer it. dementia is one of the toughest diagnosis because the decline is so slow and heartbreaking for everyone. and it takes so long to qualify for assistance. i’m sorry you all are going through this but good for you for stepping up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/v8qk9o/how_to_support_the_caregiver/,,How to support the caregiver?
"hello to all caregivers. i have an issue that left me baffled and scrambling to find solutions.i have an elderly grandmother who currently lives with my parents and i and have been living with us for a few months. she has been diagnosed with dementia when she first arrived and is a diabetic and has to go to dialysis every other day. as of last week, she has been getting somewhat combative and a bit agitated. it had gotten bad to the point where she refused to go to her dialysis treatment and was admant on wanting to go back to her own home (however with the help of my dad's powerful convicing, reassurance and clarity, she did end up going). the thing is, she can't go back. she is weak, barely able to walk, and all of her services that she recieved there have been transferred here where i live. it's a comfortable home that we live in, my parents sacrificed their office room and turned it into a bedroom just for her. we feed her, help her go to the restroom and help her take her medication on time as prescribed, so on and so forth to keep her comfortable.and this is where my issue lies. just this evening, i went to go give my grandmother her blood pressure medicine which consists of three pills. i handed her a cup of water and gave her the medicine one by one. i'm somewhat blind, even with glasses on sometimes, but i was extremely flabbergasted to see/watch my grandmother 'sneakily' slip the first pill down her bra, thinking i wouldn't catch it. i just stood there in disbelief, really and i walked away for a moment to tell my mother what had just occured.my mother was skeptical at first, but she knew me and how serious i am about my grandmothers health that she sighed and asked if i had given her all the pills. i still had two remaining out of three. my mom told me to give my grandmother the two remaining pills and to watch what she does with them.so, i did. i went back to my grandmother and gave her the second pill, she pretended to slip the pill into her mouth while drinking(?) but allowed it to slip into her shirt once again. i was stunned. i thought, no way. i gave her the third just to make sure what was happening was actually happening and she did the same thing again, only this time, i turned away from her briefly and when i was out of her peripherial, i quickly snapped my head to look down at her and she stuffed the pill knowingly into her shirt!i told my mom about this and she rolled her eyes and said, ""so that's why her blood pressure is so messed up."" i don't know how long my grandmother has been doing this, but now we have to really out smart her. it's also extremely difficult for us because according to my mother, my grandmother has a track record for being manipulative. on top of that, i can't tell if it's just her dementia creating some sort of distrust with us in regards to her medication. we didn't confront my grandmother, because we knew that it would lead to a probably not so great episode of pointed fingers and what not. my grandmother is very smiley with me, but there are moments when i would see my mom and grandmother alone together, the room is extremely tense. in any of your expierences with a loved one slipping pills down their shirt or not actually taking their medication behind your back, what can i do?tl;dr: my grandmother who has dementia is slipping her medication pills down her shirt thinking i won't notice. i just need help on how i can actually get her to take her medication which is important."," update!thanks to all who commented, your expierences and tips helps out tremendously! today was a better day. i was starting to think that maybe her behaviors had to do with sundowning, but i dont think so. she took all her medications, but this time, my mom was administering them to her. my mom kept eye contact with her, eye level at all times. thankfully, my grandmother took them with out question, just like it was any other normal day.now, it could be just an episodic moment of distrust from the situation of the main post, or maybe she didnt trust me at the time giving them to her (even though i had give her the medicactions before) or what, but i will now be noting her behaviors and reactions to enviornmental factors throughout the day!thank you guys, again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/v5639o/i_caught_my_grandmother_slipping_her_pills_down/,,I caught my grandmother slipping her pills down her shirt!

(i’m currently a caregiver for my wife.)1. when you sense he needs to talk, don’t ask if he wants to talk. rather, narrow down the possible topics. it’s all way too much to talk about, like when a teacher assigns an essay but tells you to pick your own topic. consciously narrow the scope of the “how are you doing” or “do you need to talk” questions, otherwise you’re likely to get minimal answers because it’s just too much. 2. figure out how to help him offload the 20,000,000 things he needs to remember. make and share digital grocery lists, pharmacy lists, errand lists, etc, if he doesn’t mind.3. keep in mind that we all only have so much energy to get through the day. a lot of people might ask that you help him relax; i would say, instead, be deliberate about when you need time for you, schedule it with him, and do as much of prep for that time as you can handle. and also, try to be supportive when he just doesn’t have the energy. 4. try not to waste his time. if you have something to do at 4pm, be ready at 4pm. there’s so much to be done, so much to remember, so much to think about, that doing nothing almost feels like a crime. even sitting down for 10 minutes can make a fella not want to stand back up again for a few hours. again, this list is more about me than about your partner, but it’s the best advice i have to answer your question.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/uoxibd/how_to_be_a_more_helpfulsupportive_partner_to/,,How to be a more helpful/supportive partner to someone who is a caregiver?

"hi you heroes, so i ran across an article that left me feeling encouraged in such a dark time. (i don't know if it is behind a paywall. if it is, let me know and i'll copy and paste.)but if you care for someone with dementia (my mother has slight cognitive decline), you may find it comforting. i certainly did. it's from yesterday's ny times and finds, what i would say, is an almost impossible silver lining in such a devastating illness. if you need me to copy and paste, let me know, it may be behind a paywall. i read and reread it and have felt better every time i did. [dementia is a place where my mother lives. it is not who she is.](  excerpt: dementia is a land where my mother lives. it is not who she is. i think of it as an actual place, like the acropolis or yonkers. a place where beloved and ancient queens and kings retire, where linear time doesn’t exist and the rules of society are laid aside. whenever i go to my parents’ double-wide in hayward, calif., i am really traveling to dementia.thinking of it this way allows for magic to happen — for her to remember my name suddenly and to know my husband — and for there to be a boundary between me and the treacherous drop of despair. each time i go to see her, it’s different. i’ve learned to set expectations aside, like an umbrella on a sunny morning."," thank you for sharing this, i've been looking to read articles like this that describe what it's like to experience dementia rather than make it who that person is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ultjnj/a_different_take_on_dementia/,,A different take on dementia...

"please allow me this rant. i have to cyber scream. here goes....i care for my 99 year old bedbound, dementia ridden mother. her vitals continue to be stable, and she eats well. but otherwise when she's awake she just stares into space and makes unintelligible noises. it isn't pretty. i'm with her 8-6 daily. my brother works out of her house during the day and stays with her at night. i'm 69. my brother is 61. we have been at this for two years without a day off. my house is nearby and i have a husband at home who is completely unsupportive and could not care less about my mom or what my caregiving entails. he just ignores the whole thing and lives his life. his take on it, and i quote is, ""why shouldn't i have fun just because you have a burden."" you read that right.  i also have a married daughter, age 29, who thinks i'm nuts. her advice is to put mom in a ""home"" to the tune of 10 grand or more a month. not happening. mom doesn't qualify for medicaid. her ss, a small pension, and  some savings rule that out. my brother is beyond adament that we alone must care for mom. his motives are part altruism and part ""hell, no, no nursing home or home health agency is getting its paws on mom's money."" we signed mom up for in home hospice care, but it isn't nearly enough. i have been doing my best to navigate this situation, but i'm spent, depressed, suffer from insomnia, and just feel like i can't take much more of this. today my brother started acting standoffish and when i asked him what was the matter, he informed me that he doesn't like it when i ""sulk"" and that i need to be in a better, cheerier frame of mind for his sake. i'm pretty strong, but that sent me over the edge. i simply can't fake it any more and i don't think i should have to. i've pretty much accepted my shitty lot in life and the last thing i need is for my one ally to give me grief. we have no friends, neighbors, or relatives willing to help, and i really wouldn't expect them to. there's only us, and i'm just tired of being everybody's favorite punching bag. i am obviously not looking for advice, just sympathetic ears. the stories of those posting here are heartbreaking, and i know my situation doesn't even begin to compare with what many of you are going through. i'm just glad this sub exists. i needed to vent and it's good cost effective therapy."," i know i have lost it. so many bad things happened in too short of a time. my mom died, but now i am left with my dad. i don’t think i can help him. i keep trying, but i am getting it wrong, and i am not good at paperwork. it’s like maybe we are too much alike. i appear to annoy him. i don’t see a future at all and i am younger than you, single, and childless. i feel alone with my thoughts all too often. i think i have failed. since my mom is gone, i don’t know what i am suppose to do, besides a bunch of stuff that i am too depressed, too anxious, too exhausted, and just not good at for my dad. i rarely get to my stuff.  i can’t commit to making a dentist appointment. sometimes i shop too much online for a fantasy life. it makes me feel worse in the end. i asked for a recommendation on reddit for my family, and some guy jumped down my throat. i am too depressed to stay on the internet. i hope i feel better on monday. mother’s day is killing me. i want to go to the cemetery, but i am afraid to because i think i let her down. plus, i would have to go alone. i think i am just broken. i don’t know how to pull myself out of this hole when i don’t see the point of my life. i am sorry that you are having a bad time. i think i feel the same way. i sort of thought maybe it would be better when my mom died. people shouldn’t suffer the way she did, but it’s a black hole without her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/uk6d6c/i_need_to_vent/,,I Need to Vent

"my 79 year old father moved in with me almost 2 months ago. i coordinated care for him in a new city as he was post heart attack, covid, kidney failure, blood transfusion. his dementia gets worse and worse everyday and has been for the past 2 weeks coming on aggressively (and in turn makes him aggressive toward me). he won’t shower. he uses everything but the toilet to go to the bathroom (sinks, floors, shower, cups, himself). he gets angry &amp; reactive when i ask him to do anything related to taking care of himself- the exercises home health gives him each week, showering, now frightening enough refuses to take his meds. i posted a while back as he wouldn’t give poa let alone let me see finances. i’ve asked for help with rent, groceries, ubers to and from hospital/doctor visits, diapers, co pays etc. he just balks and says “i’m sick i shouldn’t have to pay.”i have tried various low income “supportive living” facilities throughout the city that a hospital social worker gave me and most won’t even begin to look at an application unless he qualifies and receives a state (il) benefit. last week, i got the call he was declined since his ss is more than $900 a month (~1900/mo) and when i asked for suggestions after explaining the situation all the person could say “i’m sorry that’s it”. he’s on medicaid but how is someone supposed to afford living in a home or getting extra care with that? he doesn’t want to live anymore, and frankly any father daughter relationship we had is completely torn and almost gone. i recently cancelled a trip to mexico to celebrate a friend of over 20 years wedding because i can’t even find in home respite care to be here with him. i just feel stuck; trying to go through every resource someone gives me on top of working full time and barely having enough money for rent or dog food given all that i am suddenly responsible for; every avenue seems to be a door slammed in my face.  as terrible as it sounds the thought of some sort of shelter sounds like he would get more aid than what i am able to get him qualified for; unfortunately no supportive living place i’ve found that will accept outside of those receiving aid will take him unless there’s 2 years of assets (~200k) paid up front. i’m at my wits end; am i just “stuck” living like this and watching him die until the time comes? does anyone else share these feelings or am i some complaining b**** of a daughter for thinking this?"," don't attach negative labels to yourself.  (b etc) no, you are not morally weak.are you sure there are no other social service supports for him?  i had to work though an aging and disability resource center but he did get care, and makes a fair bit more than your dad between social security and workplace pensions.  he's on medicare (in a managed care organization) plus medicaid.  they have special provisions for vulnerable seniors.  maybe you went in the wrong way.  i made that mistake too, at first.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/uctk1x/am_i_just_stuck_here/,,Am I just “stuck” here?

"my (44f) mom (75f) had a massive stroke in 2017, one that went unattended to for four days as my dad wouldn't take her to the emergency department. he later told her it was because he was scared to hear something was wrong, even though she was telling him at the time she felt like she was dying and was very upset. the stroke was a big one, and left her with permanent physical and cognitive issues. we suspect he has dementia, based on some behavioral and cognitive clues of his own. but he refuses any tests. additionally, and this is important - they are cat hoarders. there are close to 40 cats within the house, with about 15 or so living in their direct living space. the others live in what used to be the living room and are almost as feral as indoor cats can be. because of this, at the time, they made the decision to not pursue any sort of home health for my mom, as the hired caregiver would be a mandatory reporter and the living conditions are poor. i moved back to a place near home about two years ago, with the express goal of being closer to help and to take on a caregiving role. it's been an exercise in frustration. dad resents any and all help, and mom eventually gives in to that. but i've been trying my best, and we've made small gains. her health has steadily declined, and she's now got both a watchman and a pacemaker, both of which have helped but not too much. her last procedure was about two months ago. thursday morning, after extensive pressure from my sister and i, he took her to the emergency department as she was having extreme cognitive issues, including complete amnesia about the day before. this isn't new, though, as these moments have happened before and he's pushed against taking her to the ed, stating we were overreacting, that he's her caregiver, and that we are just panicking. he even asked her to no longer tell us what was going on with her health as we make mountains out of molehills. turns out she's had a series of shower embolisms that now cover her brain. after about 24 hours in the ed, she was discharged. she underwent multiple tests and even though blood thinners have caused internal bleeding before, she's been given a protocol of blood thinners before. she also has a collapsed vein in her left arm that is causing her to have no pulse in that arm. also, most everyone in the ed felt certain more strokes were coming. despite multiple requests for her to come back to my house or to my sister's, she went back home, where she's covered in about 15 cats at any given time. she barely sleeps because of them, and she's fallen because of them before too. of course, they are just general hoarders past cats, and the house is fully packed with stuff, causing even more fall risk. none of this even speaks to the smell. today, my uncle and aunt came to help clean the house, take care of the yard, and to generally provide support. after just a couple of minutes, my dad forced them from the house. he won't accept their help and now none of us are allowed over unless just to visit (and i suspect that's going to be taken away soon too). he told her she's not to ask anyone for any support without clearing it with him first. she's been in tears off and on, but is so exhausted she's given up. that just about sums it in general - giving up. there's lots of ""i wish it would just end"" statements. i am here to help and am prepared to help take on a caregiver role. so is my sister. but he just won't let us. we don't know what to do. we're pursuing powers of attorney for her health (and have them for finances, that's a whole other story), but past that, we're at a loss, and know that even having that won't stop him. we know he's scared, and that when he's scared, he gets angry. but we're going to lose her if this doesn't stop. please, we'll take any advice that doesn't completely rip our family apart. thank you!"," call adult protective services.your mother must not have a mentally ill, possibly cognitively impaired, person making her health care decisions.i'm not even softening this message.  this is literally a matter of life and death.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/uaiu2a/advice_solicited_mom_continuing_to_have_strokes/,,"Advice solicited - Mom continuing to have strokes, dad responding in not good way"

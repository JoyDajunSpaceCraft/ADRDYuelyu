"i'd like to take a moment to share some information about dementia and head injuries.  as the spouse of a combat veteran, this is very important to me that we validate and support those with head injury dementia and not discredit or invalidate their concerns.  please know that the word *dementia doesn't always describe a progressive disease.*  according to the [cdc:]( dementia is not a specific disease but is rather a general term for the impaired ability to remember, think, or make decisions that interferes with doing everyday activities.  [webmd's]( definition is very similar:  [dementia]( is a broad term that describes a loss of thinking ability, memory, and other mental abilities.when someone experiences dementia as a result of head injury the way it will present will be different.  [webmd further describes head injury]( related dementia as follows:  &gt;[dementia]( after a [head injury]( is a significant public health problem.     &gt;  &gt;in the united states, roughly 2 per 1,000 people each year have some kind of head injury. many do not seek medical care.    &gt;  &gt;between 400,000 and 500,000 people are hospitalized in the u.s. every year for head injury.    &gt;  &gt;younger people are more likely to have a head injury than older people. head injury is the third most common cause of dementia, after infection and [alcoholism]( in people younger than 50 years.    &gt;  &gt;older people with head injury are more likely to have complications such as dementia. children are likely to have more severe complications.    &gt;  &gt;men, especially younger men, are more likely than women to have a head injury.  &gt;  &gt;the nature of [dementia]( in head-injured persons varies greatly by type and location of head injury and the person's characteristics before the head injury.  &gt;  &gt;the dementia that follows a head injury differs from other [types of dementia]( many types of dementia, such as [alzheimer's disease]( get steadily worse over time. **dementia from head injury usually does not get worse over time. it may even improve somewhat over time. the improvement usually is slow and gradual and takes months or years.**so you see here, the way a person with dementia from a head injury will talk about the problems they're facing will be very different than someone with alz, vascular, ftd, etc. dementia. please keep this in mind when responding to people who come here looking for help."," this is a very different perspective for me to consider. throughout my entire education, employment and volunteer work i’ve been taught that, aside from delirium, dementia is progressive. my own research has always encouraged the applying and embracing new perspectives, however, so i look forward to reading more about this. dementia is still a relatively new topic of study in the way that we understand it now and there’s plenty of room for our understanding to evolve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jqpaqu/dementia_can_be_caused_by_head_injury_and_isnt/,Dementia can be caused by head injury and isn't necessarily progressive

"hi everyone- so my mother is 77 and is coping with dementia currently. she’s been healthy all her life, but last week was rushed to the hospital after being unable to breathe. so they’ve got her stabilized, her vital signs coming back to normal range. the issue i’m having is how medication professionals treat- or don’t treat dementia patients. my mother basically has no short term memory lately. she knows us, she enjoys life, she can tell you her birthday and address, but can’t comprehend that she’s in the hospital and doesn’t realize that she’s sick.today, mom was supposed to get a cardiac catheterization. her heart is currently functioning at about half of what it should. last minute the surgeon decided he didn’t want to perform it due to her dementia. they opted to do a stress test instead, which revealed several blockages. so now there are two options: medication or surgery. medication can be managed at home, and so far she’s responding well to it. but if it stops working- surgery could be the only way to save her life. the medical team said they can refuse to do this procedure on a dementia patient, which to me is horrifying. my mother might have dementia, but she’s still so full of life and doesn’t look or act like someone frail or at death’s door!!!! should we get a second opinion? honestly, i was very disheartened to have medical professionals asking us about lifesaving measures and such, because she’s still very much enjoying life! it just seems unfair.", if she has surgery it could take months for her current baseline to come back. it will be scary but with love and patience it will. people are not nice. my grandma got a pace maker while having dementia but i think if it had been in her chart she might not have gotten it.  77 is not old and she can have many good years. don’t listen do what you think is right.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jmwror/dementia_and_heart_condition_options/,Dementia and heart condition: options

"this is my first post, and i am filled with guilt. please bear with me. it is long for context.my dad has been diagnosed with dementia, and i have long suspected that he is a narcissist. i had a very superficial relationship with him prior to his formal diagnosis due to his narcissistic traits. his other children do not speak to him much because of this, and they have not been willing to help. i have been his sole caretaker since 2020. this is the hardest thing i have ever done as he is verbally and psychologically abusive.today, the pharmacy delayed a prescription that my dad started in my absence. he stated that he had gone to the doctor and spoke with a pa, who switched him back to one of his former heart medications. this would be the second refill of the renewed prescription. i thought about it for a while, and i started to wonder if the prescription was delayed because my dad is not supposed to be taking this medication at all. this would not be a surprise. my father has stopped and started medications randomly as well as created scenarios around why he started/stopped the meds in the past. i went to him and told him that the refill may have been delayed due to a possible drug interaction, and that i would ask the pharmacist tomorrow. this led to a long conversation where he asserted that he had already been taking this medication for 30 days and that it wouldn't make sense for the pharmacy to take issue now. i disagreed. i said that i was here 30 days ago, and that he did not have that medication in his medication bag. he argued a bit, so i asked for the empty bottle. he said he must have thrown it away. i abruptly ended the conversation, as i felt like i was falling into the ""reasoning"" trap that caregivers are told to avoid so that the patient doesn't get agitated.i thought about it alone some more, and suddenly remembered that i did see the new medication 30 days ago. i had asked him about it then, and he told me who refilled it. his story didn't line up in a few ways, so i checked the refill date and it was indeed recent. so it did not seem like he just randomly opened one of his old pill bottles and start taking it. i had been relieved and forgot all about it.upon realizing i was wrong, i felt awful. i had been so stern with him and suggested that what he was saying about having taken the medication for a month already was wrong. i weighed telling him. i need him to trust me, so i felt it really important to be honest. but i also worried that this would make him more adamant about being correct when he truly does mess up his meds. the need for him to trust me won out, and i went to him and told him that i was mistaken, and that i do remember seeing the medication in his bag.he gave me a sort of sly smile that i have never seen before. he said, ""do you see i'm not senile?"" i never said he was senile, but he does have dementia and it manifests quite a bit in sometimes serious ways. i just said ""i never said that. i just want to make sure you're not taking medications that interact."" i turned to go and then he said, ""i don't play with my medications. i take those right."" that stopped me in my tracks. crap. he *doesn't* take his medications right. he takes the wrongs one/takes them improperly quite a bit, and his mixing up of medications was the chief concern of his doctors when he was discharged from the hospital. it was the reason why they said he needed a caretaker in the first place. i know caregivers make mistakes, but i think this one was particularly disastrous. i tried to let him no that he has occasionally been mistaken about his medications, and i just try to double check things now. this led to a really, really, bad argument that i had to walk away from. he does not agree that he ever suddenly stopped meds. (he has, and it scared me.)i feel guilty and like i do not know what i am doing. i have probably just destroyed my chance at him cooperating with me regarding his medications long terms. it was so hard to even get him to stick to a medication schedule, use his pill box, and not take whichever meds he feels like.sorry for the length. i just feel so disappointed in myself and worried about how this will impact the future. i don't even know what i am asking for here. maybe i just needed to share."," sounds like my dad. i could tell ya stories but will save it. dementia and narcissism is wicked.  they can work together pretty well. best to not admit youre wrong. they dont have compassion and understanding. they see it as weakness and a way to hook into you.  never show emotion, be a rock. act like its no big deal. like you could care less. pick your battles. use persuasion instead of going head on. and the slope is slippery and dark and murky. trust yourself always, always.best of luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jlsrd8/i_admitted_i_was_wrong_to_my_dad_i_regret_it/,"I admitted I was wrong to my Dad, I regret it."

"nana is in her early 70s and was semi-recently diagnosed with lbd after some severe issues with hallucinations. she saw tarantulas, turtles, small floating puff ball-like animals, and even me when i wasn't there. in addition, she has memory issues and panic problems.    before, she was a very strong woman. she was an accountant for a very large company in our city. she worked there for 35 years, only leaving after her memory started failing her and caused several mishaps with her job. she raised 3 children on her own, worked endlessly to support their every need, and continued doing so for her two grandchildren (my cousin and me.).   after she left work, it seemed like everything with her disease decided to move at light speed. the hallucinations are more frequent, her panic/anxiety has exploded, and she's just losing herself.   i started working for the same company she did a few years back, in a different department. on top of all the times i had to leave my desk to go to her department to help with whatever issue, now that she's retired she still just keeps showing up randomly. once or twice a week i get a phone call saying nana is there, yelling at the poor soul who took over her office, and freaking out. so, i'll have to go get her, calm her down, explain that she's retired and the guy in her old office actually works there now, and take her home. usually bringing coffee and treats back to the accounting department as an apology.   this morning she called mid-panic attack because she thought the microwave was going to burn her house down. she refused to unplug it because she thought it would severely shock her and she would die. she insisted that i come over right that very second and unplug it for her. i told her i couldn't, i was due in a meeting in 15 minutes. she flipped and started fussing, crying, and yelling. i apologized so many times, and told her i'd call her after my meeting and i could come by at lunch.   i just called her and she has no recollection of that previous call. however now she has completely fabricated an event that happened yesterday where she believes i came to her house and cried because my husband was leaving me. she says i cried and yelled for hours. once she finished telling me that she was concerned about my ""mental break down yesterday"" i explained to her that none of that happened. i'm not even married!! i worked all day yesterday, i spoke to nana on the phone twice, and then did yard work til sundown. telling her that just made things worse. she is so convinced that what she thinks happened, actually happened.   none of this is unusual. this is a weekly thing for us. and i'm the only one who deals with it. my mother has passed, my cousin is utterly useless, his mother is chronically ill and already is in an assisted living place, and our uncle is 400lbs living on family money. so it all fell on me. i've tried talking with her doctor about moving her to a facility (locally) that can handle her. but he says she's fine living on her own right now, and to maybe just limit her driving. i list all the things that continuously happen, and gave him a run down of the three accidents she's been in while driving in the last couple months. two were at her own house (crashed into the garage, and drove off the short retaining wall in her front yard) and the third was a literal hit and run. she ran a red light, got side swiped by someone turning who had the right-of-way, pulled over to swap insurance, but then decided to just drive away before she got out of her car. i've explained how i'm not a care giver, i can't do everything for her. i'm doing groceries, house work, doctor visits, and everything else she needs and i'm so tired. her doctor said he understood, but that's what families do - they take care of each other.    i just don't know what to do anymore. i feel so upset at myself when i get frustrated with her. i know it's not her fault. she doesn't do these things or say them to hurt me. but i can't help it. when i'm arguing with her on why she can't skip her meds, or why she has to wear a mask when we go out, or even when i tell her she can't keep coming to work because she's retired, i just lose sight of the fact that this is a disease and there is no point arguing with her over it.   i feel like i'm just ranting and i don't have a purpose for this post. but i'm hoping someone here understands and maybe knows a way to combat this fatigue i'm feeling. i honestly dread every single phone call from her. i almost feel sick when i have to go get her out of accounting because she acting out. i can feel myself spacing out when she starts rambling about things that have never happened, and occasionally throwing in a ""oh wow"" or ""mhmm"" to somewhat participate. then i end up feeling terrible, because as i said earlier - it's not her fault. goodness me. any advice would be greatly appreciated"," hey - before anything else: this shouldn't be your burden alone and i'm so sorry that you've been shouldered with it. it's hard. it's so so hard. i have a few small suggestions based on what i think you've said here, that she needs more care. first, it has been my experience and something i've read about often: family doctors aren't always the best equipped to manage dementia. my mum's family doctor administered her care but was always kind of understating how bad things were. i'm not sure why he did... but it did make it harder to get my mum the care she needed. to remedy this, i have two suggestions. first, ask for a referral to a neurologist or gerontologist. when my mum started seeing a gerontologist, he immediately adjusted her meds and she responded almost as quickly. family doctors are not experts about older bodies... second, if you are able to do so, consider documenting your nana's more difficult moments. my mum's family doctor only really clued in to how difficult things had been when i shared (heartbreaking) video of her shaking in terror about a shadow and another of her casually trying to light things on fire. i hate that this seems to be true more often than not, but whenever you can, you'll get further if you can show, not tell what's going on.about your relationship with her, and managing her hallucinations... it is *so* easy to become frustrated with a person who is dealing with dementia. i know i did, often, with my mum. one of the best things i learned how to do is called a ""therapeutic fib."" at the core of this practice is the knowledge that whatever truth your loved one is living... that is their absolute truth. it's not like if you or eye see a deer on the side of the road, only to discover later that it was a stack of lumber... we're able to look at evidence and kind of course correct our relationship to objective truth. folks with dementia cannot do that. your nana will likely never be able to take in your objective truth and make it her own. so, when she tells you about an argument you had with your spouse, consider rolling with it. ""you're so sweet, nana, to worry about me. i'm fine now."" or when she shows up to work and becomes belligerent about someone in her office, try: ""oh nana! this is james and he's just here to update your computer. let's go get coffee while he works?"" folks with dementia absolutely lose track of facts, but the way they feel about things is very real. if you can validate their feelings and redirect them to different circumstances, you'll usually be able to side step the escalation that can make things better difficult. (i'm not sure i've done a very good job, here, of explaining the therapeutic fib... i'd encourage you to google it!)finally, and most specifically, my mum shared a similar paranoia about the microwave that your nana seems to have. the microwave was going to burn down the house. with lots of trial and error, it seemed like she kind of... super perceived the digital display. the light itself made her anxious. we very carefully and cleanly covered the display with black electrical tape and her anxiety about the microwave melted away. i'm not saying this will 100% work for your nana, but maybe pay attention to the things that emit light in her home... see if she seems light sensitive. figuring out how to hide lights might help her too...",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jjq7bo/struggling_on_day_to_day_things_with_nana_lbd/,Struggling on day to day things with Nana (LBD)

"hi, i’m a teenager in the us and my grandma who has dementia/aphasia has recently forgotten me. this really hurt because i would make an effort to facetime her every day, and she is one of my earliest memories of my life from when i visited her in the uk when i was 2. i told some close friends about my experience but it seems they don’t understand the pain i’m going through. they promised to take me somewhere fun on the weekends to get my mind off the pain, and be there to check in on me everyday. as of now they have not done anything to help, putting me into a depressive state. so i seek help here, and ask, when faced with difficulty with family members who have dementia, how do you get others to understand your pain!"," i am so sorry for what you are going through.  i wish i had a good answer because at times i feel the same as you.  i feel like i am mourning my mother although she is still alive.  it is and never will be the same.  my advice to you is to speak to someone that you trust.  someone that has some knowledge, will listen, and leads with empathy. for me, this was seeing a licensed counselor for some time.  the other person has been my english professor in college this year.  i have talked with her after class (virtually) and have emailed her.  this all began because i needed a letter of recommendation to transfer.  she asked for my life story.  it felt really nice to have someone listen to my experience with my mom.  she cares a lot and has given me good advice about my circumstances.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jigrb5/overseas_dementiaseeking_help/,Overseas Dementia/Seeking help
"my grandmother is 76 years old and suffering from lewy body dementia. if you don't know what that is, it's basically like schizophrenia and dementia had a demon baby. she suffers from delusions, hallucinations, and is starting to get parkinson-ish symptoms that are associated with lewy body. she lives across the country (us) from me, and because of covid i havent seen her in over a year. actually, the last time i saw her was when we had a big (huge) family reunion for her before she forgets everyone or her disease makes it too complicated to do so. i miss my grandmother. she was so strong and independent not that long ago, and now she's a shell of her former self, spending every day in confusion, anxiety, and fear. she live with her husband and my aunt in the middle of nowhere, and frankly, neither of them are really able to give her the care she needs. they have their own medical issues going on and don't seem to fully understand the nature of her disease. the worst part is, she has a long term care plan so she can afford to hire in-home care, but for absolutely no reason at all my grandma's husband just refuses to look into it or acknowledge that they really need outside help.. i'm a home caregiver who works with dementia clients every day, and it hurts me so badly that i can't help my grandma. i can't be there to give her the care she needs. i cant even talk on the phone with her anymore to tell her how much i love her and miss her and to comfort her. she deserves so much better than this.i feel like i've lost her already, even though she's technically not gone yet.", oooof.  that is a rough situation and i am so sorry you are in it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ji8itf/i_miss_my_grandma_and_shes_not_even_gone_yet/,I miss my grandma and she's not even gone yet

"so... let me preface this with that i was activity director for a skilled nursing, assisted living, and memory unit for 15 years. i absolutely loved my job. loved the people and stories i heard. and the dementia part was natural for me-i could flow with their situations, had so much fun with them, and got to know them on a deep level.  fast forward to the present.  i'm a stay at home mom of three living in georgia for 5 years. my parents retired to the country, and at the same time we moved here. since then my father especially-who had the greatest memory ever- has declined majorly.  i went to""assess"" the situation last week. for 7 days with my daughter! and i called them tonight and he didn't remember we were there!!! i honestly don't even know why i'm writing this, but i don't know what to do!  i did this for a living for 15 years and i cannot deal or even think what to do.  my siblings are useless. he just started aricept. but any advice for me? i'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around this.  so hard!"," i don't think you're alone to struggle when it's someone you love, even after years of working in the field. even when you know precisely what needs doing. i am not a professional carer, but maybe this will resonate with you... one thing that i was eventually able to recognize in myself is that i often struggled to live in the moment with my mum. while she was in her moment, trying to figure out the washing machine (for instance), i would know exactly how i should help her. however, i was frozen because i would simultaneously be mourning the person she had been and dreading the loss that would come next. these very complicated feelings of frustration, fear, grief, anger, and resentment (and likely more!) often emerged. as i got better at caring i got better shutting off my relationship to my past and future mums. i had to recognize that while my feelings were really valid, they were keeping me from being the person i needed to be with her in the present. reaching out to set up my own network of caregivers (peer groups like this one on reddit were actually very helpful for me, as were my husband and some close family) was important because i would go to them in those moments that my mum was taken care of and i could let go of what i was holding on to. with my support network, i cried, i laughed, i wrote my feelings... just dumped it all out. then, when i was with my mum, if i felt those crippling feelings burbling up, i would remind myself: am i responding in this moment to her? to who she used to be? or to what this might mean about her future. anyway. if you're feeling frozen, long story short, you might find you can move again if you can compartmentalize the past, present, and future so that you are better able to be in the moment with your loved one.

"i have a relative who i strongly suspect has early dementia and it’s getting gradually worse. they are strongly resistant to seeing their doctor and clearly afraid of the idea.is there any reason to push for diagnosis now? as far as i understand it, there’s no real treatment for dementia (or at least, nothing that slows the progression). am i wrong?"," i think early diagnosis is crucial for the patient and their family. i was diagnose one year ago, and still have enough wherewithal to contribuate and help plan for the future. i have had time to process and understand the changes that happen and make sure each day contains quality time with those i love. i truly hope your relative does not have dementia, but other way, they should see a doc to figure out what is happening. my thots are with y'all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jfy4vt/how_important_is_early_diagnosis/,How important is early diagnosis?
"hi. my mother 57, was diagnosed with dementia. she has been having problems for the past 3 years but there were signs even when i (24m) was a child. i have a one year old daughter and a fiance. part of me does not what to know my chances and the other half wants to be responsible and make plans for my own family. where do i even begin to see through genetic testing if i have the gene? thank you."," i'm no doctor, but this sounds mostly like anxiety. a good calm mind is key in avoiding future problems. exercise, diet and sleep are key! i realize you've probably heard these things before, but it's true. i would start with your doctor... hopefully you have a good one that is not dismissive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jfqj1i/my_mother_has_early_onset_dementia_where_do_i/,"My mother has early onset dementia, where do I start to predict my future?"
"i'm a doctor that diagnoses and manages the medical aspects of dementia at a memory clinic in the us. i've really valued reading your experiences. there is so much more than what i see at the visit. i often wonder about how my patients and their caregivers are really doing, what we could be doing to help them that we're not, what we do/say that is irritating, etc. what should dementia doctors know that we don't? how can we better help our patients?"," my great aunt had been a teacher all her life.when a doctor came to assess her cognitive state, he asked her who the president was.""young man,"" she said, ""if you dont know who the president is, you shouldn't be practicing medicine!""i say that to point out that people often have a way to cover up their symptoms. my mother does the same thing. she gives the witty riposte and doesn't answer the question. she also goes to the doctor on her best behavior, and lies her ass off. also, it usually takes wild horses to get her in the shower, but she somehow snaps out of it when she knows she has a doctor's appointment and really gets dolled up.this lying, and putting the best foot forward means you are not getting the whole picture. i agree with other posters who say that you really need to have a back channel with caregivers. i might also add that we are all mostly tethered to our loved ones and we know them better than anyone, so you might find that we can give you valuable insights into their world, just by hearing our tales. this is how new discoveries and observations are made",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jfoaeu/things_id_never_tell_my_doctor/,[deleted by user]
"hey folks! sorry if this has been asked a ton, but wanted to crowdsource some ideas for responding to violence as a result of paranoia and hallucinations.my grandma generally is paranoid about thievery and the like, which isn’t the biggest deal, but as she’s progressed, she’s recently had problems with missing people.she mostly has been scared that me(as a child) has a gone missing and can’t find us, and thinks my mother has kidnapped me.we’ve lied enough for her to believe that child version of me is in korea, but now she thinks her daughter(my mother) has gone missing.when she gets frantic there’s really no calming her down, and more recently she’s been starting to get aggressive and started to hit people. it doesn’t help trying the normal tactics of speaking gently and acknowledging her problem since the problem is something as drastic as a missing person. really at a loss on how we can calm her down when she gets in a state like this and would love to get everyone’s ideas/thoughts if possible.", does her doctor know she has hallucinations and gets violent on occasion? my friend’s aunt had lewy body dementia-her neurologist prescribed meds which reduced her hallucinations & calmed her sometimes violent outbursts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jfmks6/dealing_with_violent_behaviors_as_a_result_of/,Dealing with violent behaviors as a result of hallucinations
my elderly mother will at least once a month poop on the floor in the bathroom or in her room.  does anyone have a suggestion or experience on how to clean this up better than what i've been doing?  i was thinking of getting a dog pooper scooper to pick up most of the poop and then wipe down what is left over.  currently i am using chlorox wipes to pick up the poop and disposing it.  i would wear tons of gloves and face masks.  i would prefer not to get so close to it if possible.," industrial-grade rubber gloves, cheap plastic bags, a rag, and toilet paper. you can use toilet paper to pick it all up and\\or wipe it somewhat, and put it all in the plastic bag. then wash with disposable rag, soaked in whatever cleaning solution you prefer. of cource, wash the gloves too. worked for me.dunno about pooper scooper, the stool can be too soft and\\or sticky, so i have doubts. never tried it, so cant say.smooth floor surface is preferable, no carpets.whatever method you choose, you still will have to wash it up afterwards, always.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/jfes9o/good_method_of_picking_up_poop_off_the_floor/,Good method of picking up poop off the floor.

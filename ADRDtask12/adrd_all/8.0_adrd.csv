[removed]," call your local bar association and ask for a referral to your state‚Äôs legal aid network. you need a family law attorney, possibly someone that specializes in elder abuse and estate law. it sounds like a lot of what he‚Äôs doing (giving away her stuff, trying to change her will) is not in her best interest, and a court will be very interested in that. double check‚Ä¶ but i think poa gives him full ability to manage her affairs, but doesn‚Äôt supersede her will in terms of appointing him executor of her estate in the event of her incapacitation or her death. it‚Äôs complicated. it might all come down to if he‚Äôs acting in her best interest. best of luck!edit- if he got her to sign poa after her diagnosis you can point out to the court that his poa is invalid because she signed after being diagnosed with a degenerative disease that affects her mental capacity. shame on that lawyer and those witnesses for allowing this if they had knowledge of her diagnosis. the proper process should have been to take medical documentation of her disease to the court and petition for guardianship or conservatorship. not convince her to sign poa hello she can no longer understand or appreciate what she‚Äôs signing and that is super shady. ugh this makes me so angry for you and your mom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/rk8icn/oklahoma_alzheimers_patient_signs_power_of/,OKLAHOMA Alzheimer's Patient Signs Power of Attorney - legal??

"my step dad has been in my life since i was 16. i would not describe our relationship as close but also wouldn‚Äôt describe it negatively. we never had a ton in common and he wasn‚Äôt the kind of man to have a heart to heart with me as i was finding my way but he was always very generous and in his way that was how he showed love. in the last couple months my step dad‚Äôs condition seems to have advanced. constant delusions and inability to follow moment to moment seems to be his baseline now. good days are when he isn‚Äôt angry but the man he was seems like it‚Äôs mostly gone.about two months ago he was coming over with my mom for trick or treating with my kids and approached me as i was taking garbage out to the garage. he asked me how i felt about taking his last name and hyphenating it with mine (my late fathers). i was caught pretty off guard and more or less dismissed the idea without thinking.he got mad - not at me in that moment - but expressed to my mother. they both left the house pretty quick because he didn‚Äôt want to be there any more.from that point on, it seems like he has associated me with a very negative feeling. up till last night that manifested itself as him not really wanting to be at my house. sometime to an extreme where he ran away from a visit to my house and we needed to get the police involved to find him. last night, however, he took me aside and quietly told me:‚Äúif i ever see you with an unshaven face again i‚Äôm going to punch you in the fucking face‚Äù and went on to say more along those lines.he was aggressive and threatening and insulting. for a brief moment i tried to reason with him then when that was making things worse quickly pivoted to deescalating and apologizing and telling him i was sorry that my beard offended him.later that night he refused to say goodbye to me as a sort of show of defiance. the whole night was very awkward because of this tension.all this obviously upsets my mother who can‚Äôt help but try and reason with him in these moments. that‚Äôs not helping and just makes him entrench in his anger. he‚Äôs beyond ration and reasoning.i guess i‚Äôm reaching out for any advice for how i might turn the situation around? also i guess i‚Äôm just expressing and getting this off my chest."," during covid our daughter moved back home, to work from home here and help me with mom. my wife‚Äôs anger and belligerence associated with her hallucinations and conspiracy theories started getting out of control. one of her many conspiracies she would constantly talk about was that our daughter and i were having sex. one night my wife went out into the front yard and screamed this to the neighbors in the most graphic terms imaginable. if i wasn‚Äôt stronger than her i would had to call the cops that night. a psychiatrist prescribed common antipsychotics to address her behavior, she is now under control with little to no side effects.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/r8uqwd/step_dad_with_alzheimers_seems_to_have_a_negative/,[deleted by user]

[removed]," there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here.first, people do not need to wear masks if they have a cold sore. herpes is spread by direct physical contact and contaminated surfaces or objects), not by aerosolized or droplet particles. a person experiencing an outbreak should take precautions like not kissing anyone else, not sharing toothbrushes or drinking glasses, and using an antiviral cream or pill to shorten the outbreak duration.second, herpes is for life. the virus infects nerve cells, which the immune system does not attack. the virus resides in the nerve cells and then becomes active, causing an outbreak and then going dormant again. it is always there. you did not have herpes very often as a kid and still get it 2-3 times a year. you caught the herpes simplex virus type 1 as a child and suffered frequent outbreaks until your immune system matured and was better able to suppress it. if you‚Äôre still having 2-3 outbreaks a year, you need to talk to your doctor about taking a prophylactic daily dose of acyclovir or valacyclovir to prevent future outbreaks.third, the herpes-alzheimer‚Äôs hypothesis is not proven. it is currently being tested, but they are in the beginning stages of determining whether they are looking at correlation instead of causation or some other more complex interplay of factors. this hypothesis does not, for instance, address the role of diet, genetics, stress, trauma, environmental causes, or other infectious diseases. it doesn‚Äôt even address whether it‚Äôs the type of herpes (type 1, which is associated with oral herpes, or type 2, which is associated with genital herpes, or another related virus like chickenpox (same viral family and it also causes shingles)) or the location of the infection (you can get oral herpes caused by hsv-2 and genital herpes caused by hsv-1).fourth, this study was not an experiment testing or proving anything. it was a preliminary exploration of some of the aspects of viral behavior which may be responsible for processes which researchers believe are part of accumulation of damage and changes in brain cell activity and architecture which occur in alzheimer‚Äôs. it is vitally important to note that no one has ever shown that all alzheimer‚Äôs patients have hsv-1 or even that people with hsv-1 have higher rates of alzheimer‚Äôs. more than half the population at large contract hsv-1 at some point in their lives, and about half of all alzheimer‚Äôs patients have hsv-1. in short, while this study may evoke fear and feelings of doom, there is nothing - absolutely nothing - to show a direct link between herpes type 1 and alzheimer‚Äôs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/qzi91h/study_connects_herpes_to_biological_risk_for/,Study Connects Herpes to Biological Risk for Alzheimer‚Äôs

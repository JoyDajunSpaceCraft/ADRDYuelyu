"i have so far worked with 3 dementia patients. one was an easy one, the other ones were verbally abusive, but not physically.i wonder if dementia patients can get physical too, like throwing punches and objects at me, spit...thank you.", my friend’s mom has now gotten physically abusive. has been verbally abusive for a few years but recently lashed out hitting her husband with a thin belt. it’s so sad. this is not the woman who was in many ways like a second mom to me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kh4z1s/can_dementia_patients_get_physically_abusive/,can dementia patients get physically abusive?
"hi all, i hope you read this and are well! i (f23) live at home with my sister (f29), parents (f,m61), and grandmother (f86) who has dementia. my grandmother's dementia is in the moderate stages--her memory is mostly spotty and her cognition is starting to go. she is my mom's mother and she's lived with us for about 5 years, since my grandfather passed.to try to make a long story shorter, my mom has put herself through a lot of stress trying to take care of her. my dad has very reluctantly been supportive (which is worsened by the fact that he and my grandma never had a great relationship) and i generally find him to be more stress-inducing to my mom than supportive. my aunt has been a c u next tuesday (this includes having tried to financially abuse my grandmother in recent years by taking money from her) and is an additional stress. my mom also has a full time job (but will hopefully be retiring soon).in recent months, i feel like i've been noticing my mom's memory become spotty. sometimes we'll have full conversations about something and then hours later she'll bring something up as if we never talked about it. she'll also ask me certain things repeatedly over the span of hours/days as if she completely doesn't remember. one of the biggest things is that it gets really bad with alcohol. she behaves the exact same way that my grandmother does and will completely derail a conversation and tell the same story 3-5 times with complete cluelessness as to how she's commandeering the conversation.i'm worried that the stress of caregiving and the fact that dementia runs on my mother's side will be all the factors for her to start developing dementia.i guess i'm wondering--has anyone else experienced or seen this happen with caregivers? is this something i might just be overly sensitive to because of my grandma? if this is likely to be happening, are there any things i can do to talk to my mom about this concern and see how we can try to alleviate some stress? i hope she can do things for less stress but also don't want to make her overly self conscious or stress her out more for no reason.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kh1hfb/caregivers_developing_dementia/,Caregivers developing dementia?
"hello, there. the title says it all. my mother (70) is showing a number of alarming signs of something being wrong. memory, confusion, poor decision making, using the wrong words for things. both short and long term. she refuses to see a physician or have a physical. she also lives quite aways from her, and because of the pandemic, i try and check in via video call often. a number of family also know about these concerns and check in. i was told by professionals in both mental health crisis and elder care in her area that there’s nothing that can be done. i would like to somehow convince her to get help. i don’t know if i can. any input from someone in this situation would be very appreciated.", can any type of home health care person like a nurse practitioner provide an in home assessment?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kh19h0/what_to_do_if_someone_with_dementia_symptoms/,[deleted by user]
"i am becoming increasingly worried about my mom, she is turning 60 soon and is showing some drastic behavioral changes. she is often confused and cannot remember what she said, did, or where she put things. but the other main symptom is she becomes so confused she gets extremely angry and throws fits out of nowhere. she lashes out and throws things and demands answers and it usually ends with her crying out of frustration, disappointment, or both.are these leading signs to dementia or maybe another neurological disorder?", could also be hyperthyroidism. usually one of the first things to be ruled out on the road to a diagnosis of dementia. she needs bloods done with thyroid levels requested.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kgzh7a/are_these_early_signs_of_dementia/,Are these early signs of dementia?
"yesterday morning, my grandpa collapsed in his bathroom and an ambulance was called. he was submitted to the hospital and the doctor in charge of his care allowed family members to see him and explain the situation to him. the hospital decided to keep him overnight to see if he would improve and be released.this morning, dad calls the hospital, but the doctor tells him that grandpa's heart gave out during the night and he had to be shocked. so it's possible he would have to stay an extra night. my parents and i will drop in to see grandma and bring dinner for her. i am hoping he would come home in time for christmas. as i mentioned in an earlier post, christmases have never been easy for us with grandpa's dementia. he can get agitated with loud noises and little kids running around. this year, we will see if he is up to just having my parents and i bringing dinner for him and grandma on christmas eve, instead of having an zoom meet. it's still undetermined for all of us. i appreciate all the well wishes everyone has been sending. really need them at this time of year.", i am so sorry to hear your update. i hope that you all get to enjoy christmas together.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kgvuvm/update_on_grandfather_with_dementia_being_alone/,Update on Grandfather with dementia being alone in the hospital
"hi all,i am looking for some suggestions or advice regarding transitioning my dearly loved elderly mother into full time care. she has had a series of recent falls and the last one was major and has left her about 90 % immobile &amp; she has plunged head first into the later stages of dementia. in the space of about a month and half she has moved quickly from ""moderate dementia"" where she was just moderately and harmlessly forgetful to having lost all her independence, wandering at night and moving into constant hallucinations, full confusion most of the time, not knowing where she is, how she got here, now requiring  full 24/7 mobility assistance, full bathing, feeding and personal hygiene assistance and most difficult is now  she is no longer recognizing who we, her family are anymore. she thinks my husband and i are nurses and only occasionally is she showing glimpses of the normality. she has been checked and cleared for utis weekly but still we are up taking her to the bathroom 10-15 times per night and she  usually sleeps only for a 1/12 hours at the most even with dr prescribed melatonin to help her sleep ( which it clearly has no effect) . she is in good general health overall.all this aside however before the onset of this dementia she has been strongly opposed even to the point of being fearful, of going into fulltime care at all. this has been an ongoing concern for her over the years as she had witnessed her own family many years ago be treated badly in care.in hindsight (naively), i promised that we would take care of her and i sincerely meant this at the time however now that her mobility is nearly non existent and she requires so much physical help, the 24/7 care has become too much for my husband and i as i have sustained an injury to my back and my husband has run out of both compassionate and vacation time off and needs to go back to work soon. my issue how can i get her into care knowing full well she was so opposed to it. i feel so terribly deceitful and that i am going back on my word. she still has moments during the day when she seems somewhat lucid and back in our world again and it is in these moments that i feel guilt ridden even just contemplating the thought about how i could do this to her however i know in my head that we cant sustain this current situation much longer.  i have spoken to a few fulltime care homes about her moving in however i am still wrestling with how logically i could even do this without causing great upset and turmoil for her and us. if anyone has any logical helpful advice or has been through this type of situation and how i could even make the transition happen in the future - i would be be very grateful.  if you got to this point --thanks for reading my long winded post.", thank you each and every one of you that responded to my post and for sharing your personal experience. your responses and advice certainly do make me feel  stronger and give me great hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel - so to speak. we are gradually becoming more comfortable with the decision to move her into fulltime memory care facility as we know we have exhausted our capacity and in the long term she will be better off in the proper equipped environment.  again sincerest thanks for replying and giving me hope and much needed emotional strength to get through this journey.  thank you all for your kindness and support.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kgtx5t/advice_needed_on_transitioning_elderly_parent/,Advice needed on Transitioning elderly parent into Fulltime Care

"i put up the christmas tree recently in my grandma's house where i live with her and take care of her.  she keeps pulling the little glass lights out of the plastic housing, breaking the wires that complete the circuit so all the lights go out.  then she takes the little plastic bulb, turns it upside down and sticks it back into the plastic housing still in the socket.  i'm totally out of replacement bulbs now!  once i caught her in the act and she said it was because all the lights are upside down.    i also had a brand new lit garland that i put around the mantle.  i didn't think she'd mess with it because it's not next to where she sits like the tree is, but it wasn't even up for a day before she broke 3 bulbs.  she didn't turn these bulbs upside down, so i spent way too long trying to find the ones she broke by pulling on each light!!  after she started doing this i decided to not have the lights on unless i'm watching her carefully, but it's so hard to remember.  i stepped out to do some dishes and didn't remember to turn off the garland and sure enough the next time i looked it was dark and another bulb was broken.    why!?  how!

"earlier this morning, my aunt sent various texts that my grandpa collapsed in the bathroom. my grandma had called my aunt in a panic, so she had to run over there to see if he was all right, but called an ambulance as he had an elevated heart rate. because of covid, the hospital isn't allowing family members to visit him, which really scares us because grandpa can become agitated if a close family member isn't there to help him explain what happened. for a long time, due to his dementia i believe, he doesn't trust strangers, so i'm hoping the hospital lets a family member come see him. we haven't received word on his condition or what caused him to collapse. this is the second time that this has happened before christmas. about two years ago, he collapsed and it was discovered his pace maker needed to be replaced. christmases with grandpa can be difficult as he wants to keep hosting, per tradition, but with his advanced age and fragile mind, we tried to offer solutions to make christmas easier for him as he does get agitated with loud noises and little kids running around. with covid this year, we had thought of hosting a zoom meet, with my aunt helping my grandparents with the computer and such, but now that's up in the air with grandpa in the hospital.  will update as soon as i hear anything!"," i'm glad your grandfather will be allowed visitor (s). last month, i was told to take my grandmother to er after an ultrasound showed her gallbladder to be inflamed. i was with her and explained she had dementia. i was allowed to remain with her!

"this is my first post here. my father turned 85 in october. his memory issues had been getting worse and worse over the last few years, but became very clear to me when i moved into the downstairs apartment of his home earlier this year. things were still relatively mild until this past sunday when the odd behaviors began and the vacant look in his eyes was it. he was gone.like all of our situations, mine is complicated. my father wasn’t abusive to us, but he was extremely emotionally neglectful and transactional with his affection; to this day he has never uttered the words “i love you” to any of us, or shown any type of emotion at all. fast forward 37 years and i’m back in my childhood home after being newly diagnosed with ptsd; it’s been 6 months since the trauma-inducing event, but i still struggle to bathe and feed myself daily, and the flashbacks are debilitating when they occur. since the behaviors began on sunday i have not left the house even to walk my dog, because dad is fixated on reading my journals and “cleaning” my room and will come in and start throwing away my things as soon as i leave. i’m trying to cope as best as i can, but i am in no way, shape, or form able to care for him (or anyone). honestly, i can’t even be around him without getting activated and terrified. i’ve cooked him breakfast and dinner each day, but i only drop them off and never visit. last night i heard a loud bang above me and fainted upon standing to investigate. sigh. i wish that i was more strong mentally, but i’m just not. how do i manage the guilt here? should i be doing more?edit: have an appointment with his dr on tuesday. sister should be here by monday to help."," i am so sorry you're going through this, but reading this is beyond helpful. i have ptsd from abuse growing up but love my parents. my father has lewy body dementia. i call him at least a few times a week and visit when i can (i am a full time online graduate student and work full time). i have felt unbelievable levels of guilt over still being triggered at times when engaging with him, particularly when i'm not feeling well. my siblings don't have as much going on and can help more, but in anger my mother has used this against me when i brought up concerns about his situation being unsafe. i've been projecting a lot of my own anxieties and guilt onto him potentially not being properly cared for, and i want to be able to tell myself i'm doing what i can and it's good enough and to not feel awful. he can still get angry and violent and it takes me right back. i'm so sorry you're struggling and i hope you're doing okay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kg8i60/unfit_to_care_for_my_fathers_dementia_due_to_ptsd/,Unfit to care for my father’s dementia due to ptsd.

"i'll take all kinds of advice, tips, words of comfort i can get. because i'm just overwhelmed and exhausted and out of ideas.my grandma had some sort of neurological issues from childhood on (i think brain damage?) which get worse over time and possibly even a form of mental disability/learning disability.well, and additionally dementia. i think you can imagine all those things combined are a little messy.however, the main problem is she isn't in a state where she really forgets a lot of things yet. she's still mentally 'there'.but her cognitive abilities are noticably declining.she logically doesn't understand a lot of things anymore which can cause a lot of problems.you can tell her a, she will understand b and go on to tell everyone c. basically how small-town-gossip works, but.. the entire town in just one person. luckily by now all of our family members became aware of that, so if anyone gets a call where she tells a super dramatic story how one of us had an injury at home or had something horrible happen, we will ask someone else about it before we take it seriously.i also had a short discussion with her today about me moving out for work somewhere next year and i had to notice, she doesn't understand what ""moving out from home"" really means. she pictures it like a boarding school kinda thing, where i'll be there on weekdays but come home every weekend and through the holidays. and that it's just a temporary thing. she was also shocked by the fact i'm taking my pets with me.so once that comes near, it's gonna hella messy. often times she will also tell you about something, but she lacks the words to describe it, so you will have zero idea what she's even talking about.obviously we try to make her describe it in different ways, so we can kinda figure it out, but usually that doesn't work either. in the end you just stand there and try to act like you're totally on board. which can also become problematic, because sometimes it's actually something rather important but you just won't know.i just ran out of ideas how to deal with her.i feel bad for becoming more distant, but i can't handle being around her for too long. at least not when my grandpa isn't there as well.he's the only one who can make sense of her behavior sometimes and knows how to put a stop on it if she's taken away by her thoughts.you can't really have a normal conversation with her. 15 minutes and i got a huge headache. but you also can't treat her differently than any other person because she still picks up on that. she still does most of her tasks around the house which is obviously important because of consistency and just keeping her busy, but it's hard to tell when it's time to step in and how much is safe for her to do on her own. especially because she also has physical health problems, including rheumatism.we try to include her in everything going on.we also gave her an iphone because typing on a normal phone was too painful (and took too long if there was ever an emergency) and included her in our family group on whatsapp. she has an ipad to play games and read the news on. (obviously without access to any bank accounts, email,... anything important)that works well for the most part, but it starts to get a little more complicated. i remember one time she found an article online about how ladybugs start eating humans at night... and she believed it.... she also doesn't understand when a text message is clearly a joke and when to take it seriously. a while ago my brother sent a photo of his girlfriend digging a hole on their yard with the caption ""if anyone has some bodies left to hide.... now is your time😁"". she didn't actually think they were hiding corpses, but she also didn't fully understand it's just a stupid joke.and those things keep getting worse.if her state was already more severe, we could restrain her access to the internet, whatsapp etc., but for now that would be an overstep. and she absolutely needs a phone for emergencies.so we're currently caught in this weird in-between state where we can't take a lot of safety measures with her or do basically anything; where you can't treat her differently, but treating her the same as anyone else doesn't quite work anymore; where you see more and more problems coming up, but there's not much you can do yet. neither for her, nor to make it easier for yourself.it's just exhausting.and it's hard to balance between being there for them and making sure you're not sacrificing your own sanity."," if you have time, check out teepa snow on youtube. she got us through a lot of the early stages of my mom's dementia and made it understandable for my siblings who weren't around for my grandmother's as much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kg831m/grandmother_with_earlymid_state_dementia_im/,Grandmother with early/mid state dementia.

"i have been in a month-long battle now with several doctors, nurses, caregivers and other health professionals, who all can't seem to agree on what my mother is suffering from and what the best course of action is, and i am both exhuasted and frustrated.the whole thing began on the 20th of november. my mother, a 71 year old woman is handicapped due to a bone marrow disease, but she had no issues getting around the house, using a combination og wheelchair and crutches.during the early weeks of november, her disease started to affect her legs, and she had a harder time moving herself from wheelchair to bathroom.then it happened, she fell in the bathroom and hurt her shoulder. nothing serious happened other than a nasty bump, but she became afraid of going to and from the bathroom.instead of accepting the help that caretakers offered her, she decided the best strategy would be to stop eating, only drink minimal fluids and only go to the bathroom once a day. this of course made her even weaker, and she had a second fall. this time i had her sent to the hospital (under protest), and the hospital decided to send her to a rehabilitation center, where they could help her manage her leg problems and maybe get her some more help around the house.this is where her mind cracked. she had no previously had any problems with her brain. in fact, she was always the one who had to remind me where they keys where, what time she should have her medicin etc. but when she woke up on the first day in rehab, she didn't know where she lived, she didn't know what year it was, or even what my name was.as days passed by it got rapidly worse, as she began talking to dead relatives and see things that weren't there.she had a brain scan. nothing looked out of the ordinary.the first conclusion was. ""no one gets dementia in 1 night. it must be delirium"".they found that she had a uti, and they blamed that as the cause for her sudden change, and said that once she had finished taking antibiotics and returned home, she would recover.after she returned home things got even worse. she started seeing snakes on the floor, demons near her bed and knives sticking out of the walls. on some days she would scream ""help me"" for hours until she passed out.now a month after the second fall, no one can explain her behaviour. one doctor said it could be a psychosis. one said it is still delirum, and a third said it is ""acute dementia"".i have reached the point where i don't care what it is, but is frustrating that no one seems to know how to care for her, because the care needed for a psychosis is very different from caring for a person with dementia.does anyone here have any experience with this ""acute dementia"" thing. what can cause it? and is it normal that people are hallucinating this badly? i can kinda deal with her memory loss, but it is almost impossible to take care of her when she is seeing things, because she basically thinks that everything and everyone in the room is a monster trying to kill her. it is heartbreaking."," my mom went through this with alzheimer’s, a lot of these things can co-occur with dementia, and falls/trauma and other loss of control (my mother after she could no longer drive) can also co-occur.  my mother fell a lot, and it triggered worsening symptoms.  they can hide symptoms often for a long time and compensate, but eventually their brains no longer can.  talk to the docs about moving her to a care facility full-time.  the easiest transition is to do from a hospital visit or rehab facility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kfijau/dementia_delirium_psychosis_doctors_cant_figure/,"Dementia, delirium, psychosis...

"i (60m) was diagnosed with early onset dementia of the frontal lobe 4 1/2 years ago. i never went back to work and started drawing 60% disability (it ain’t great, our bills didn’t go down by 40%). i had the mechanical test and repeated the test 1 year later. there was little change but the phd psychologist said it was because i had “exposure” to the test material. kind of strange since the first thing you do is read everything you can when you are told you are not going to live to old age. i had a mri about a year ago after a fall where i struck my head. my neurologist compared the mri to the one i had when they first were diagnosing me and saw little change. metlife wanted to have me tested again so i went back to psychologist and ran through some of the same set of test, just a few less test. she called my wife today to tell her their was little change from my test ~3 years ago (i am mad at my wife for not conferencing me in since i had a load of questions for the dr and she was going on vacation). my question is, has anyone gone from being given a 4-7 year life expectancy 4 years ago to being told there has been basically no change? i’m sitting here waiting for some other shoe to drop. thanks for any answers."," have you had a pet scan? there’s a pretty good chance your insurance won’t cover it, so if you haven’t had one, that is likely why. if you have medicare, i think a pet scan will be covered. ask your doctor about this because our neurologist told us a pet scan makes an ftd diagnosis easier to confirm but most insurance will not cover it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kfdo8p/no_change_in_test_results/,No Change in Test Results?
my mother who has parkinson's and dementia is having oral surgery tomorrow for tooth extraction. i'm not sure if they're going to use local anesthetic (including epinephrine) and or general anesthesia. my mother can't keep her jaw open for too long (less than 15 seconds). i just wanted to know what to expect. how will the anesthetic affect her dementia? she is already taking medication for it and rarely gets her episodes.," my dad recently had a minor gallbladder stone removal procedure. he was not good in the days immediately following (many episodes, some very bad). but, as he healed he got much better. it’s one of those situations where whatever is ailing them is probably making alz/dementia symptoms worse, so you have to determine if a temporary regression is worth the benefit of the procedure. in my dad’s case it definitely was. tooth issues can cause a lot of systematic issues, so i’d venture to say (on very limited info) it’ll be worth it for your mom. i’d expect a spike in symptoms the few days following, but it should get better as she heals. not just from the anesthesia, but the procedure. i’m basing this on general, not local anesthesia. local anesthesia shouldn’t have much of an impact, if any.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kfavl3/dementia_in_oral_surgery_with_anesthetic/,Dementia in oral surgery with anesthetic

"i don't know if this is the best place to post here, but i have never dealt with dementia before and i have no idea what to do. i seem to be one of the only ones aware of what's going on with her, but i don't know how to help her, or even if i can at this point in time. my grandma has been acting very rude and strange lately, and her facebook posts have been getting more and more incoherent. she has always been politically minded, but she used to be coherent and mindful of people's different perspectives.  i have been avoiding her for the most part because we don't really click well to begin with, but i checked my emails and noticed she has been sending me strange political conspiracy nonsense in all caps lock (which is very unlike her). it's not even the usual q-anon conspiracies we are all likely familiar with, although i think she has been influenced by that, it's a mix of her own strange delusional thoughts. if she were around my age, i'd honestly think she was a disorganized schizophrenic. her typing is starting to remind me of my own mental illness. of course, this led to an argument because i thought it was very distasteful of her to bombard my emails (and my facebook too) with such presumptuous, inflammatory nonsense. it led to a number of other things, basically her saying vague statements throughout that had no relevance whatsoever to the conversation and didn't prove any points she so adamantly insisted on having. she also wasn't respectful of me saying that i don't appreciate having political or religious talk shoved down my throat like that, i would rather talk about other things because i don't agree with any of her points. she dismissed all that and made it out like it was my fault for being not being receptive, but she's always been a narcissist, making everything about her.  she used to be more socially aware though. she had the nerve to tell me i'm not mentally ill (i'm on the schizophrenic spectrum!) and it hurt my feelings so bad i lashed out at her pretty sharply. but then i reflected on our argument and realized that she is tangential (worse than me), incoherent and is rapidly losing her sharpness. sadly, she doesn't believe that mental health is a real thing so i unfortunately think she's in total denial for now. it's still early in the symptomatic stage and i don't want to assume that it's dementia when it could be other things, but she is reluctant about getting help. i can't even use my schizophrenia as a coaxing mechanism (""see grandma, i got help"") because she does not believe that i am mentally ill.what is strange is that my father is a low functioning schizophrenic, and when she was younger she was willing to call the mental institution and get him help multiple times, so she recognized he was crazy, though she always dismissed psychology as a subject and said it ""wasn't a science"" (rolls eyes). i know dementia is a brain disease and not exactly a mental disorder, but her lack of insight into any mental health issues is allowing her to be cognitively dissonant and in complete denial that she needs help herself. i know after reading through the symptoms of dementia that no matter what happens, i need to understand her point of view and understand that it is her brain malfunctioning, it's not her will to behave like this. that being said, it is very hurtful because it puts my mental health at a serious compromise.  i'm not exactly known for being emotionally fluent and supportive myself, especially when i feel like i'm blatantly being disrespected. we have always had different opinions on politics and religion and her randomly, sporadically lashing out disturbing nonsense at me is terrifying, and triggering me to have positive symptoms. it reminds me of how my dad verbally abused me during his schizophrenic episodes; i now need therapy again and have been disassociating something awful. it reminds me of my own mental illness, but at least i have the self awareness to know something is wrong with me, and to try to be nice and respectful in spite of it. i'm worried the rest of our family won't catch on until it's too late because many of them are in denial of mental illness and even 'like' some of her word salad posts. to be fair, she has always been abrasive and opinionated, so it's not like a completely new personality, just her behaving and saying strange things. she also used to respect science and health experts but of course covid19 changed all of that. she keeps calling it the ""flu"". i explained multiple times this isn't the same viral strain as the flu - it's as if she's not capable of taking in new information. she also started talking about sex extremely graphically around an 8 year old girl doing homework the other day, which is completely unlike her. she would have never done that around me or my friends when we were 13, let alone 8. the girls stepdad snapped at her and told her to stop.anyways, i know i'm not the best person to be her caregiver considering with her (potential) dementia and my schizophrenia, we are both so blatantly honest towards each other in rude ways. it just doesn't work. i'm trying to get other family members to keep an eye on her and i will do a welfare check on her if i have to, but i honestly don't know what else to do. i can't live with her, last time i did i was running naked in the woods because i thought the planes in the sky were government drones she was using to spy on me; that's how much she makes me nuts. i love her because she's my grandmother, but, damn me, i just don't have much respect for her as a person. but i still want her to get the help she needs despite everything. and yes, i have told her i think she has dementia though i wasn't polite about it, i was still hurt at her dismissing my schizophrenia and i don't know if i can forgive her for that. of course everything i say is one ear out the other. she's still driving and shopping and stuff, and she has a husband but he's slowly dying of diabetes, and he's just as ignorant as she is in a lot of ways so he is no help. neither is my schizophrenic dad, hence my need to potentially call a welfare check on her.   sigh.if anybody has any suggestions, i would greatly appreciate it - and i'm sorry for rambling."," wow, that sounds really tough, so sorry!  oxforddictionary said tons of great points, i could only add - have you checked out the dementia .orgs and alzheimers .orgs?  all the english-language speaking countries orgs (where-ever you are), have lot of great info & resources & telephone help-lines.  we have some double-triple-whammys going on in our family too, so i feel for you!  for sure, no sense throwing yourself under a bus for somebody else, good on you to take care of yourself first!  i wish you best of luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ke158s/grandma_might_have_dementia_isnt_self_aware_and/,"Grandma might have dementia, isn't self aware and won't get help."

"i just got off the phone with my grandma and i was just at a true loss for words. it’s 8:30am and she is upset that they’re out of chocolate milk-at least i think that’s the issue. she hates my grandpa because he has the audacity to sometimes disagree with her she has, in the last few months, come to believe he is just a caregiver who is on the verge of being fired, is stealing from her and apparently as of this morning is denying her food. she calls me to fix these issues for her, to calm her down. today nothing i said worked and she didn’t understand 80% of the words i was saying. i said, “maybe he needs to go to the store for more milk” and she said, “i’ve been to four stores and they told me to go to that one and he doesn’t even work there!” i tried explaining it was early in the morning and to let him wake up and said insisted no one lives there, i don’t understand mixed with a whole bunch of jumbled stuff. i usually can pacify her by just agreeing with anything she says and understanding “mhmm”s and “okay”s but when she directly asks me questions and doesn’t understand the words that i answer with-i’m at a loss. my grandpa and i are the only ones who she interacts with and i have 5 small children at home so, unfortunately, i can’t be there more than 2x a week. it’s hard to take her 3/4/5am phone calls and i feel terrible for my 80 year old frail grandpa who deals with this 24/7. grandma has always been more narcissistic and the dementia has ramped this up to 100. she can do no wrong and fully grandpa/“that man” is out to get her anyway he can. even he caught her plunging the toilet because she’s flushed a sanitary pad and had to snake it at 5am, that wasn’t her, it was him just being nasty and trying to kill her! ugh. we’re at the point of her needing more care but i have to figure out how that works. she has no formal diagnosis and her doctor won’t see her. he said she has to go through the er for an mri and that would stress her out to the point of death during covid times. i don’t know how to move her while still financially protecting my grandpa who is still able to live alone. my mom carried all of this but she passed away last year and like i said, no one else in the family is involved. i came with a question and this became a diary entry/rant but sometimes i just feel like i need to “talk” to someone who actually gets it."," this sounds a lot like my dad, who has lewy body dementia. lewy body is characterized by hallucinations/delusions early on - they tend to lose their memory later, and lose their grip on reality earlier. it's also unfortunately underdiagnosed, even though it's not that uncommon - many doctors just don't know much about it. the word salad thing is also a pretty common symptom of lewy body. some days i feel helpless to even do anything for my dad because, when he tries to communicate, all that comes out is nonsense, so i don't even know what he wants/needs.i'd strongly recommend, if possible, having your mother evaluated by a neurologist, preferably one who's familiar with both alzheimer's and other types of dementia like lewy body. i know that's likely to be hard, given how non-compliant she is, and i don't have a lot of great advice on how to deal with that. :/ i just know that having a diagnosis and a medical team will open up doors for potential treatment or help, and without it, you're kind of up the creek.in-home care might take the heat off your poor grandpa, at least for a few hours a week. if nothing else it'll give your grandma someone else to be angry at. :p what kinds of finances or long term care insurance do they have, if any? talk to your local (state/county) council on aging and find out what options are available for in-home care.i'd also strongly recommend looking for a memory care facility. when you look, ask specifically how they deal with problem behavior: in cases where a dementia patient gets disruptive/aggressive, some facilities will evict the patient, so given how your grandma is behaving, you'll want a place which is prepared to handle unruly residents.i'm sorry. i feel terrible for you and your family. my dad is often defiant and/or paranoid, and it's incredibly rough to deal with, especially when he decides that we're trying to hurt/kill him by asking him to take his meds or eat or bathe. i can't imagine how much worse it must be for your grandpa, who's 80 years old and has to handle her care alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kcy025/how_do_you_handle_the_insanity_a_rant/,How do you handle the insanity? /a rant

(he also isn't great at sensing what his body is realistically capable of doing without hurting himself, which has been an ongoing source of stress) he said he wanted to go for a walk. i explained that my fiance or i could go with him, but i personally do not feel up to it, and can't speak for if my fiance does. he was okay with, but not thrilled with, the idea. so my dad said ""well i'll just go by myself"" which led to a whooole discussion about how he might not recall where the airbnb is, i don't want him getting lost, or losing track of time - there's times he'll be walking around all day without being aware of it. then he got stuck on this as me taking away his independence, and keeps saying in a loop ""all you want me to do is sit and watch tv"" (which yes, would be so much easier, and usually satistifes him when he realizes he wore himself out) he ended up leaving for a walk. we set conditions; if he wasn't back in 30 minutes, my fiance would look for him. since i was so frustrated, i forgot to make sure he had a mask and the address of the airbnb. immediately i realized this, wrote down the address, and had my fiance bring it to him. he had to walk pretty far; apparently he was walking fast - he asked someone if they'd recently ""seen someone who looks just like me"" - they said ""yeah, the guy not wearing a mask?"" :( :( (side note - we live in the bay area, where we've had a mask mandate since march, this has been an ongoing source of difficulty for him to remember and comply with consistently)my dad came back in better spirits not long after, but felt insulted that i needed to make sure he had the address. i had apologized and de-escalated, and was ready to let everything go, then he kept trying to argue with me. so i said ""i'm going to listen to music and work on house stuff and not engage in this conversation anymore"", and stopped. i gave him some time before talking to him again and offering to make some tea for us. he accepted and we talked for a few minutes, somehow the subject of me singing came up. he said ""i've never heard you sing"" - he has. i was extremely into choir in high school, i remember singing to him songs in german and italian that i knew at the time, and played guitar/sang for him too. at the time he was never impressed and would talk about other singers he liked more. but since he insisted, i let him know i had some songs that i wrote available to listen to on youtube, and agreed to play one (with the caveat that they were like 8-10 years old, i was a teenager, not highly skilled, etc). my fiance at least had nice things to say. i noticed it had a lot more views than i remembered when i was younger so that was a boost to my self-esteem! then my dad says ""don't quit your day job!"" ... i really have been wanting to get back into singing/playing guitar, i stopped due to lack of confidence in myself, i really don't need my art to be insulted by anyone right now, especially not my dad.i know his distorted perception of reality could very well apply to my singing, and that he never got to be around when i was a child to understand that's not something you ever say to your child, no matter how old they are, when they show you their art. i don't know if he said that to intentionally try to get a rise out of me, or if he really thinks that's an acceptable thing to say.  my fiance understanably also got upset seeing my own father insult my music (he's a musician too and 100% gets how hard it is) and we all ended up arguing again :( i was able to de-escalate by focusing on the nice things my fiance said to me, and his offer to give me constructive feedback in the future, and by disregarding my dad continually insisting that he did not insult me. i just want to have some peace and calm and not have our relationship be so tumultous. the whole reason i'm selling the house is to be able to pay for his care; he definitely needs in-home help, or to be put in a facility (which is our long term goal). i also am going to be stuck financially relying on him as we move to a lower cost of living area; i have poa so logistically i can handle it, but i am so not looking forward to him dangling that over my head and saying that means he can say or do whatever he wants with no repurcussions.   i know this is a lot. does anyone have tips for coping with stressful situations like this, or how to set boundaries that i be treated with respect in a way that doesn't further escalate the situation?"," just say ""that was cruel and i don't talk with cruel people"" and leave.   he didn't need any actual care, there's no reason to be in a conversation with someone who's mean.now that is boundaries.  you might benefit from reading up on the difference between guess culture and ask culture people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kbztu0/guess_i_shouldnt_quit_my_day_job_or_advocate_for/,Guess I shouldn't quit my day job ... or advocate for myself.

"i'm not sure what the intent of this post is. just wanted to get this out somewhere. my grandfather who turned 93 this year is now in advanced stage of his dementia (which was diagnosed 2-3 years back). today my parents took him to the hospital because he was dehydrated, not eating, and non-cooperative. i'm afraid he is not going to make it and i can't stop crying even though we knew for a while that this is what it's going to look like. to give some background, i live in another country, far away from my family. my grandfather has lived with us his whole life (and my whole life since i was born). he looked after me my whole childhood when my parents would go to work, from wiping my butt to cooking me emergency meals, to solving my exams and helping me study he was always there. my mom retired from her job few years back and i moved to another country about 3 years ago. his dementia symptoms were sort of always there (forgetfulness, anger, etc) but we always attributed that to general ageing. when it got worse, my parents had him diagnosed as we found out he has dementia. my parents have been caring for him 24/7 and i have so much love and respect for my family seeing the way they have been handling it. he's my dad's father but my mom has been the primary caretaker for him and she cares for him like she would for a baby, she even says he's her baby now. it's incredible and very humbling to look at my parents dealing with this even though they are themselves getting older (mid fifties and sixty). their entire lives for last 2 years have been revolving around him. my mom feeds him, cleans him, takes care of his daily medications, entertains him and now even sleeps in his room so he doesn't accidentally hurt himself. my dad is still working a job but mostly from home now so he helps a lot as well and together my parents couldn't have done a better job. i feel horrible that they have to deal with this but i haven't seen them complain a bit about it ever. even when my grandfather throws fits (sometimes even hitting them, though it's more like a baby's fit) they take it sportingly because they know that he's not doing it intentionally and it's out of his control. i'm just so proud of my parents and i love them so much but it kills me to see how demanding this is for them and i can't go there now because of the complications from the pandemic. even now as he's in the hospital, my mom told me she misses him because she is so used to having him around and now that he's not there she doesn't have much to do. my dad is with him in the hospital now but i'm way too scared to ask for updates. no outcome looks like a good one. although this is so painful for me, i am only grateful that i have such amazing parents who are sticking up for their parent in the hardest of times. i  just came here to rant that i cannot imagine my life without my grandpa because he's always been there (even right in the next room for most of my life), but it might soon be time to let him go :("," update: on december 16th at 4:44 pm ist, my grandfather passed away from multiple organ failure. he was heavily sedated and my father said he was breathing calmly and evenly all the way till the end so we believe he didn't feel any pain. he was surrounded by family and had his last rites performed shortly after. he is loved by his family forever and we will always cherish his memories.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kbusn9/grandfather_in_advanced_stage/,Grandfather in advanced stage

"hi all,my dad was diagnosed with mci (pre-dementia?) early in 2019. things are going well, but i could use some advice on one set of symptoms: a lack of interest in things he used to enjoy and a generally passive attitude toward physical decline.  brief history: he used to go to the gym if not every day, every other day. he was chatty. he walked the dog. he ran errands and loved keeping track of appointments on the house calendar. he worked part-time.this is pre-2019. early in the diagnosis there was a period where things were very dire. suicide attempt, manic episodes, hospitalization. things have improved incredibly since then and i am so grateful. now, the only concern is how we (mom and i) should react to the stabilized ""new"" way of life. most of the day he spends watching tv. whatever's on, pretty much from morning to night. he doesn't like leaving the house. he declines offers to go on walks. he declined the idea of getting an exercise bike. he drinks beer and forgets how many he's had, he forgets to eat. physically, has rapidly started showing his age and losing muscle mass. mentally, his long-term memory is stable but his short-term memory (what did you have for lunch?) is gone. he often admits he's just passing time. he has resisted and declined therapy.does this sound familiar to anyone? what's the best way to respond? one thing i've come to realize as i type is that the ""approach"" so far has been to try and coerce him back to his old way of life: chores, walks, phone calls to friends. this strikes me as very unempathetic and i am embarrassed to admit it. not surprisingly, it has generated more fights than anything else. ultimately if this lifestyle makes him happy, and he chooses it, i can make myself comfortable. i just don't get the sense that he is happy. i worry he's wasting away on purpose. if there are resources you've found helpful or terms i should research i would really appreciate that. any kind of response is welcome as this is a new and pretty painful dimension of my life right now. thank you."," qigong ie ultra-simplified taichi could be a solution. it's not pumping iron but the willingness still has to be there.i paid top dollar for a spring forest course and with the magic of internet, it's free. look how easy it is for this one exercise:do you think your father would be willing? i should get back to qigong too now that i mention it! it's been a while since i practiced it myself! thanks selfishly for the reminder! 👍🙏🙇‍♂️",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kbi1t9/father_has_become_sedentary_actively_avoids/,"Father has become sedentary, actively avoids change: how to respond?"

"so my mother-in-law has vascular dementia. my husband and i are her caretakers and we have a 2 month old as well.my mother-in-law suffers from delusions about owning/purchasing her own house and moving all of us into it or moving out herself depending on the day. it's a very specific delusion and it's constant. she often wants to go look at ""her house"" and once tried to leave on her own to go do that. when we try to ""play along"" with the delusion and say that we'll go to the house tomorrow she usually remembers that interaction and is even more upset the next day when we don't go to the house. my husband and i think these delusions are in response to feeling powerless in her situation, but we're not sure. for some background, before our daughter was born the delusion episodes became more common as i became more visibly pregnant and seemed to stem from the belief that we would need another room for the baby. they went away for a month or so after the baby was born, but are back now. they usually happen after we have to scold her for picking up the baby while standing or trying to touch her without washing her hands first. both things she is not allowed to do. what i would like to know is anyone else's loved one experiencing delusions like this? most of the things i read online are about paranoid delusions. like, ""there is someone outside"" or ""you're not my family and are trying to hurt me"". my mother-in-law's issue doesn't seem to fit the bill and the advise of trying to be empathetic and reassuring them doesn't work in this case. it's a specific recurring delusion and she'll only let it go when we show her facts about how she doesn't have this money or property. which is exactly the opposite of what they suggest online. please advise and thank you."," my father does not recognize me. even when he does, tomorrow i am always that guy who he doesnt know but for some reason do usual everyday stuff with. he sometimes come to me and says i (me 30y old) am missing and am been taken hostage. he is looking for some 10 year old kid even when l am 30.in my experience, i at first played along. i said you dont have a 10 year old but ok he exists. he is with his family. that really backfired. at the end, he was hostile and demanding to go to 'his' house and bring him (me) back. i managed to lie that his father is in army and he and his family has been deployed over seas to get that story to an end.point is, in my opinion, generally you want to not agree or disagree. it is simple if they wont remember tomorrow but if they do, be aware of possbility when you legitemise a situation, realities will be built upon them and possibly acted on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kalta7/please_help_looking_for_advise_on_how_to_deal/,Please help- Looking for advise on how to deal with uncommon delusions

"hi. i just joined this group but i have to be honest, i’m a skeptic. i feel like nobody can help me or offer me advice that is good enough. i’ve got a huge chip on my shoulder about support groups and have stopped going to any i’ve attended in the past. in short- i’m angry. i feel so alone in regards to my story with my dad....my dad is a young 65, handsome, hardly grey, funny and fit guy. our family on his side is hella italian and he’s proudly from brooklyn. he moved to upstate ny for college, loved it and raised me near the adirondacks where he also loves to fly fish and ride around in his little sports car. my sister and i noticed something was wrong with him when he began to lose directions. that spiraled into general confusion about anything and everythinglike when bills came in and what to do with them, how to execute transactions at the bank or claiming someone was trying to steal his truck he had just impulse bought. he hasn’t held a job in years and my stepmom left him about 6 years ago now. i live in tennessee and would visit as often as i could. i noticed some changes over the years but nothing super alarming and he managed to keep a girlfriend for a few years at a time and i felt like he was being taken care of. when my grandmother died he spiraled hard and the confusion was at an all time high. the girlfriend he had was so frustrated and confused too (she eventually disappeared).  we decided to go with him to the doctor. this was just after christmas 2018. finally in the fall of 2019 after the usual tests (physically all clear except for the neuro psych exam which sealed the deal) he was diagnosed with eoa. (...and i could go off on a whole other topic about what kind of dementia he actually has b/c do doctors even know anything helpful about this disease!?!?...is another topic for another day.)my partner and i (he’s 35 i’m 33) had also just decide to buy a house and move in together. my dad moved in with us at almost the same time. there have been so many ups and downs but the worst blow for us has obviously been covid. we have struggled to find for him a solid and engaging routine, connection and most importantly purpose. and not only that but he still wants a partner 🥺. so dear readers if you’re still with me...does this sound like you? i’m looking to talk to someone in myexact same situation. i respect everybody’s process and grief. i know how absolutely horrible and unfair this disease is but i just can’t relate to someone who’s grandparent is going through this same thing and is in a memory care center or who’s parent has a spouse. i have a sister in another state and all of our other family has more or less ghosted us."," well, we're a little bit older but yea, essentially i had to move my once very independent dad in with myself and my partner (we're in our 50's, dad is early 80's) after his current girlfriend kicked him out due to his apparent issues.dad has so far refused to be even diagnosed, he wouldn't go to the neurologist because it embarassed him and so we just go along with the fact that he's got \*something\* and in the last 3 years has gotten worse and worse.it's caused a strain in my marriage, sure, because we'd just managed to get the kids out of the house and independent, looking forward to our time finally and i had no choice really but to bring my dad to live with us. you've got to have a partner who is willing to take a backseat for a bit, and to understand that the family bond sometimes is very powerful and that there is a lot of guilt involved in this kind of situation.we even moved with my dad back to his home country so he could spend his final years among family, and so that they could support us. luckily, here where we are it is relatively easy to find caregivers and the plan is that we are actually going to find him his own apartment and pay someone to live with him full-time and take care of him, instead of me. he's got a medical condition that requires nursing care, too. i made a promise to my partner that it's been long enough and we can afford it, guilt or not, he needs more than i'm able to give him and it's time to let go.it's hard, he was a very independent guy, a dad's dad, his entire life was his ability to provide and be the leader. it's tough seeing all that diminish and have him turn into someone different. but we have to avail ourselves of resources that are out there to help us and not feel like we need to be martyrs. i dread the feeling of abandonment that's coming, but having family support in this decision is key. i don't know what other kind of advice you are looking for, but you aren't alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/kaa2sw/unique_situation_under_40_caregiver_sorry_its_a/,"Unique Situation?

"hey, i'm a high schooler, and ever since i was a kid watching those cheesy kdramas where the mom gets dementia and can't recognize their sons, it's been my biggest fear ever since. i saw a study done a while ago on amyloid-beta, how it drastically increases when there's not enough sleep or not enough deep sleep to let the glymphatic system remove the toxic protein. so obviously, i became worried because my mom, who is like 54, sleeps 4 hours a day, and she wakes up in-between every single time. when she doesn't go to work, she ""makes up for it"" in her words by ""falling asleep"" with her ipad on, listening to a kdrama. she's in a very, very light form of sleep (i could even argue she's essentially just closing her eyes) because she can be woken up by the slightest of noises. so i approached her about it, and she basically told me that she ""already knows"" and to shut up and worry about my own problems(in a nicer korean way). and my dad said something along the lines of ""it's up to her body; i'm sure her body will adapt."" then he proceeded to lecture me on how ""your body is amazingly complex and that if somethings wrong like your sleep, it'll fix itself. like no, you f'ing ______, that's not how it works. my first thought is, how can someone be so ignorant, dumb, idiotic, and selfish? i could tell she really didn't care and either put it off cause she believes i'm just a kid or something.. lmao. or that she thinks what she's doing right now is healthy. she's so f'ing selfish i find it unbelievable. if she eventually does get dementia she will never understand the pain of having your mom that you love, forget about you.i'm sorry to all the people that have actually experienced their parent have dementia watching me talk as if i've experienced their pain. and i'm sorry if i come off as super condescending and disrespectful; i care a lot about this topic.what should i do now? i asked mom to get a sleep checkup thing, and as i said above, she refused and told me to ""worry about my own health."" am i overreacting?? should i get an oura ring and show her??", magnesium and weed really help my sleep. maybe try getting her some magnesium or melatonin to start with? my dad started having dementia symptoms in his late fifties so i don’t think your being irrational in your concerns. he died when his youngest daughter was 17 and he was 73.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ka7crc/help_my_momrantish/,Help my mom(rant-ish)
"hey, all  my mom was diagnosed with dementia a year ago, i am her caretaker. as you can imagine it's been very difficult.  mom has her annual follow-up with her neurologist tomorrow, and it's been really trying for the both of us. she doesn't remember having the mri that lead to her diagnosis, and some days she accepts and knows she has dementia, and others she denies that anything is wrong.  she doesn't understand why she must see a neurologist, nor does she like him.  she sees him as ""the man who took away her driver's license"" and feels everyone is against her. it's heartbreaking.   i do my best to explain in simple terms what lead to her getting an mri, that she did, in fact,  have one done, and why her license was taken from her (i don't blame anyone, i blame the 'system' since then no one person is the bad guy). if i let it, it could turn into a circular argument, but i switch to empathy and letting her know that it must be very hard for her to go through.   the only thing that has been a relief is that it's a phone appointment and not in-person because of covid, and though she doesn't love the idea, she's glad she doesn't have to go in person. she's really agitated about the whole neurologist situation.   does anyone have any pointers for this? god, i hate this disease. :("," i’m so sorry you’re going through this. what has worked for me is to associate the doctors with something else that is positive. my mom was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer’s. most of the time she is cooperative for her appointments, but even more so if i say “let’s make a day of this!” after her appointment we always plan to grab a milkshake or lunch to go, and do something else simple she might like to do. it seems to help. i wish you all the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ka2ng1/tomorrow_is_moms_neurologist_appointment/,Tomorrow is Mom's Neurologist Appointment

"hi everyone,i am concerned my mum is showing signs of mild cognitive impairment or early dementia, but i'm just not sure. i am currently training to be a psychologist (albeit not a neuropsychologist), and the issue first came to my attention approximately six months ago when i was practicing the wais-iv on my mum for a university assessment. her digit span (repeating numbers to me), in particular, was particularly poor. mum explains this by saying that she has always been terrible with numbers.there have been various other incidents since. for example, i organised to pick up my mum once, and when i arrived, she wasn't there. when i called, she was already home, because she had forgotten about my offer and caught a taxi. there are times when i wonder if i am being paranoid - for instance, when she forgets about \*my\* appointments, or the names of \*my\* friends (friends she doesn't know). once, she had forgotten that we had been shopping a couple of weeks prior. sometimes she will forget to include an ingredient, but otherwise her cooking and daily activities are unaffected, as far as i can tell. she sometimes forgets details, or aspects of conversations. for example, i was talking about a friend's younger sister, and while we were out walking, she asked how old she was. when we got home, she asked how old she was again. the other evening, she asked me if i'd like a drink twice.i have tried to gently ask her about these incidents, but she gets very defensive and upset, and blames it on disrupted sleep. this evening i administered the addenbrooke's cognitive examination-iii. she was agitated and upset to begin, and was unable to repeat an address to me immediately (i.e., no delay in recall). she also said it was the 14th of december. once she calmed down, we recommenced the test using a different version, and she scored 98/100. she remembered an address even at the end of the test. she remembered three words throughout the test, and was even able to recall them two hours later. you can access the survey here: [i know i am upsetting my mum, but i am also terrified at the thought of losing her, because i don't have much other family.what are your thoughts based on this information?many thanks!", i advise supplementing with turmeric and cutting out inflammatory foods. i also recommend meditation and sunlight.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k9rk1c/should_i_30f_be_concerned_my_mum_68f_has_mci_or/,Should I [30/F] be concerned my Mum [68/F] has MCI or is developing dementia?

"my grandmother (72) was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (ftd) about a year ago, though we suspect she's been suffering from it for quite some time. ftd is different than typical dementia/alzheimer's - she has a pretty good memory, but her impulse control and social skills have diminished significantly. she frequently says and does lewd and inappropriate things that she would never have done 10 years ago. she was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes around the same time, though i also think she's had that for much longer. here's my main issue. my grandma's husband is a conspiracy theorist. he recently confessed that he believes that aliens will destroy the world within the next 2.5 years. he says this is why he isn't worried about controlling their spending (they're both retired and have fixed income yet spend frivolously) or saving or getting her help or anything. i'm worried about what his beliefs will lead him to do or not do in terms of taking care of her. their relationship has gotten pretty nasty over the last year, because he can't/doesn't understand why she does or says the things she does. they bicker frequently and call each other names and make very rude comments about each other to anyone that will listen, even me. mostly i'm posting to ask if y'all think this warrants a call to aps or if anyone has any other suggestions. my biggest struggle is that they can both put on a show of sanity for a short amount of time, so i'm not sure if anyone would believe me. but i'm kind of at a loss. they both think they're doing just fine, even though they have no plans for care for her as she continues to decline, she eats a diet of pretty much only processed sugar and carbs, she doesn't bathe or change clothes frequently and has been having incontinence issues, etc."," oh i feel for you!!  aliens, nice, should have thought of that one.  they definitely need social services and home care, sounds like nursing care too.  the hard part is getting it and then paying for it, especially if he is spending any of it that could help with some of those costs.  my mom did no planning either and completely denied any possibility she would not be able to care for herself at some point.  most of us live longer and we will not be able to often in the best of cases. i am not sure where you live but there are some really incredible offices of the aging and independent living groups out there.  i would really happy to send you some contacts (just private message me and let me know, can look for you tomorrow.  we were so lost going through this and desperate for help, so i would be happy to do for you.  it is difficult to get some immediately but you should not hesitate to call.  edit: typos from head going faster than thumb.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/k9eriq/grandmas_husband_is_a_conspiracy_theorist/,Grandma's husband is a conspiracy theorist

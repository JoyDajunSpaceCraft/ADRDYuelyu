"i've never posted here before but i need to ask someone and i want to know what people have experienced.i'm about to lose my grandmother. she has pneumonia, her second lung infection in two months, and has been admitted. i don't think, nor does anyone, that she'll make it through this. what i want to know is if anyone feels the way i do. maybe this is just me coping, but i don't know if i'll be losing my baba when the woman in the hospital bed dies. i think i lost her a while ago. i don't know exactly when i had the final conversation with her, but i feel like my last couple of conversations have been with alzheimer's and not my baba. i think she disappeared a long time ago and this tired old woman is all that's left. is it true, or is she in there still, just unable to cry out? to me, i don't know how much i want her to keep 'living', if you can call it that. i think my baba died a while ago. is this just me coping?"," i ask myself the same question every day. my mother has dementia and she is so different that i don't know if she's still there somewhere, if she is trying to express herself but no longer can. i really wonder whether my mother is dead or not...and i also wonder if she would be better off actually dead or not. sorry i can't really give you advice but i can relate and i know it is a very difficult situation. and i think even, if it's way easier said than done, that the best thing to do is to accept the situation and focus on the chance you had to know her and love her as she was before. i wish you all the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/catiym/is_she_still_there/,Is she still there?
"we're in uk.  my mil is 92, has alzheimer's, managed to fall and break her leg. somebody was with her at the time, somebody we trust absolutely, and they say she just leaned forward to put something on a table and overbalanced.  she's in hospital and has had the operation to put (and pin) everything back in place. thing is that she doesn't know why she's in hospital, doesn't remember falling, doesn't recall having an operation, doesn't understand why her upper leg is tender. we tell her each time she asks but none of it is sinking in. we realise that some of this may be to do with a general anaesthetic, but it hints that her alzheimer's may have taken a rather massive step downwards.  she's going to be in this hospital for a fortnight and, so we've been told, will then move to a rehab unit for a week or so. she'll have been away from her own home for at least a month.she's going to need to use a walking frame rather than a walking stick. she will presumably be discharged from the rehab unit into our care, but she doesn't live with us.  she lives alone but with visiting carers and has her meals delivered. it's worked fine up to now because she goes out three days a week, the other four days she has people visiting and also has time to rest.  we're concerned that this is no longer safe because, if/when she wants to get out of her chair and go into the kitchen to get a drink or go to the bathroom, she may completely forget she should use a frame and will be even more unstable on her feet than before.  what are your thoughts?"," might be time to put her in a facility.   unfortunately, most residents who end up in an assisted care facility make a pit stop first: the er.  they have fallen.  very common.everyone has to make that decision sooner or later but we say, ""remember this is for you, not so much for them"".i am recommending  placement for a patient now.  she is in a similar situation as your mil but she has no friends or family here (us).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/cat5tf/alzheimers_a_broken_leg_lengthy_hospital_care/,"Alzheimer's, a broken leg, lengthy hospital care.

"as the title says, my grandma suffered a stroke about 2 months ago which left her paralyzed on the left side and with psdem... its my turn to help my grandma take care of her and i dont know what to do. my grandma tried to stay chill and support her properly in the first month, but recently the only words exchanged between her and her mother are shouts and arguments. basically my grat grandma is convinced that everyone hates her and we are trying to get rid of her - sometimes hearing 'between the lines' and accusing my grandma of saying stuff she didn't, just so 10 minutes later she forgets everything and denies it. to be noted that mt grandma also has heart problems and diabetes and stress isn't helping her.  now, those being said, im supposed to help take care of her, and that means do everything except take her to the bathroom, which my grandma handles.  how am i supposed to do all of this, considering i never dealt with such things before and i have no idea on what to do except guard her so she doesn't fall out of bed and helping her move the paralized side from time to time?", i can only speak about the alzheimer’s as i’m not familiar with paralysis. the dementia makes your great grandmother accuse people of things. when they can’t figure things out or understand it is easiest for them to blame someone else rather than admit they don’t remember or understand. you need to remember that it is the disease being like. when they get in to an argument distract your great grandmother with something else. ask her about things she likes to talk about. listen to music. or does she have any favorite tv shows?  coloring is relaxing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/caib0o/great_grandma_85_has_psdemalzheimer_and_is_left/,"Great Grandma, 85, has PSDem/Alzheimer and is Left Side paralized."
"my family is visiting my grandmother who’s at a relatively severe stage of dementia. it’s in a different country than we live in, and her primary caretaker is her husband who is approaching 90 years old. they refuse to seek any outside help, which might partly be a cultural thing. anyways my grandma is very very attached to me. she doesn’t really know who i am most of the time but she feels a sense of closeness and always looks for me around the house. whenever someone reminds me that i’m the little kid she always talks about, she asks why they didn’t tell her before. she’s at a point where our conversations are just about 5 of the same repeated questions over and over again, and there is no lasting short term memory. she even has photos of me covering her entire bedroom but when i’m sitting there with her, she points them out to me and tells me about the little girl in the pictures. sometimes she thinks i’m a boy too. that being said, my sister was here before i was and had to leave early. when my sister left, my grandma took it very hard. she didn’t understand why no one told her she was leaving because she forgot every few minutes, and then after she left she cried for hours but couldn’t really remember why until someone reminded her. i’ve suggested not asking her to remember things or reminding her of specific events but i don’t know if that’s a good idea either. we aren’t really familiar with what to do in this scenario because the culture in this country is a bit against admitting the need for help and my grandparents are very old fashioned and strong headed. i’m going to be leaving in a couple days. she’s been asking everyday when i’m leaving and is shocked that it’s coming so soon, to the point where she does cry or get so upset she can’t eat. my mother and i are relatively positive that this will be the last time we see her alive, because her condition has deteriorated so quickly and she has days where it seems like she’s pretty close to the end. she has a rocky relationship with my mom and pretty often accuses her of really really weird things and thinks she is here as a spy or a kidnapper, which is really hard on my mom too. on the other hand, she is completely obsessed with me but kinda doesn’t really know who i am at the same time, if that makes any sense at all. long story short, i really really need advice. i’m scared of leaving and making my grandma feel terrible and then not remember why she’s feeling that way. i don’t want to put this burden exclusively on my grandfather, who is very very clearly worn out as it is. when i’m out of the house doing other things for a couple hours, my grandma notices that there’s an empty space and asks when i’m going to be back (sort of) but when my sister left, she completely forgot about it a day later. i do feel as though my grandmother is more deeply attached to me though, honestly speaking. how do i leave to go home without putting anyone through any pain and suffering? i’ve been here for a couple weeks already but she has no memory of it. i don’t want her to feel a sense of loss without understanding why, but i’m scared it’s inevitable. any suggestions or advice??"," it might be a good idea to just go and say, ""see you later"" as if you''re only going to the shops. if she asks where you are they can say you'll be back soon. if she's as advanced as you say she'll soon forget to keep asking, but won't have the emotional baggage of an upsetting goodbye in her mind.sometimes little lies are kinder than the truth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/ca8v87/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_leave_my_grandma/,Looking for advice on how to leave my grandma without hurting her
"hi folks, as the title says i'm looking for some advice with caring for my father who has alzheimer's.my father got his diagnosis a little over four years ago when he was 74 and i guess for someone four years after diagnosis he is doing about as well as can be expected. i live with my parents and help out as best i can when i'm not in work myself and for the most part we get by but then there's some things he does which i struggle to deal with which leads me to posting here. in addition to having alzheimer's my father is type 2 diabetic and lately has been managing it poorly. frequently he will complain of feeling tired and sleep for much of the day and yet when a meal is prepared for him he often prods at it half heartedly before becoming disinterested and leaving the table after eating hardly anything. of course this means his blood sugar levels tank and then he will complain about feeling exhausted. do any of my fellow carers out there have any suggestions of how i can mitigate this? he keeps a stock of chocolate bars in the house for when his sugars are low but obviously this is a poor substitute for getting an actual meal. he's not overweight and in fact lately has lost a lot of what little weight he had, to the point where he seems frail.the other thing that has really gotten to me is the way he has begun to treat my mother. it seems like nothing she does is good enough for him nowadays and he frequently verbally lashes out at her. he's always had a short fuse but these days he will flip his lid over the most minor and insignificant things and she seems to be the one on whom he dumps his frustrations. i've confronted him about this previously but this only seems to make things worse. i don't really have the slightest idea of what i can do to change this behaviour and it's really becoming a problem.any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated", i'll second the cbd oil. not just the calming but seems to improve cognition.put on some music or his favorite tv shows.never confront but distract.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/c9z4cn/looking_for_a_little_advice/,Looking for a little advice
"my grandmother just turned 80. over the past year and a half her memory has significantly deteriorated, but she has not been diagnosed officially with anything. some days are better than others, but her previously occasional ""bad days"" are becoming more and more frequent. she doesn't remember who my dad (her son) is most of the time now. she barely remembers her grandchildren and great grandchildren, and if you talk to or ask her about one of them she says she's not sure who we're referring to. she will repeat questions and doesn't remember responses. the past two weeks she has steadily had more trouble remembering who my grandfather is, even though he is her primary caregiver and has not left her alone in months. she will wake up multiple times in the night and try to pack a suitcase and tell him she is ""ready to go home"" even though they have lived in their house upwards of 12 years. she has paranoia about money and people stealing from them (which has happened in the past, but anyone who has stolen from them is long dead). she will dig through paperwork and find old doctor or hospital bill statements and cry to my grandfather that they can't afford such expensive medical bills even though they have no debt, a lot of savings, and very good insurance. two days ago she called my dad and worriedly asked him to come over to ""meet someone"" and wouldn't answer my dad when he asked if my grandpa was home. he went over there, and it turns out she was scared because she didn't know who my grandpa was and called my dad out of fear when my grandpa went to make them dinner in another room. my dad is worried that one day she will call the police or something on my grandpa because she doesn't know who he is. my grandpa is a proud man who refuses in home help, and my grandmother's downward spiral is going to kill him. he is convinced that when she gets ""worse"" that a memory care facility will take both of them, even though he has no memory issues whatsoever. my dad has attempted to explain to him that that is unlikely but he won't listen. the other issue is that she absolutely refuses to go to the doctor or get in a car. she hasn't been in over two years, and my grandpa both can't and won't force her to go. she's never been combative. she doesn't have any major health issues; she is slightly overweight and has knee problems and uses a cane (so she is not a flight risk). we can tell she is getting more frustrated daily, but because we can't get her to a doctor for a diagnosis, we are at a loss at what to do. both of them have never really trusted doctors, and i think this is a major factor in the lack of urgency regarding this situations. i know to even be considered for a memory care facility she needs an official diagnosis. my main worry is that this is going to literally kill my grandpa because he has lung problems. he is so tired and frustrated. i guess i'm looking for any advice that might not be the obvious ""take her to a doctor."" or any tips and tricks would be appreciated. thanks."," i also encourage you to call the [alzheimer's association](  you'd be surprised at how many chapters they have in so many places.  a support group for your grandfather may help convince him to get help by letting him see that there is no shame in letting someone help you.  it took my mil being told by a counselor that having your diapers changed by your wife was deeply humiliating for her to agree to have caregivers come in for a few hours daily.  also, with caregivers, they will be able to stay in their own home longer.  perhaps you could convince him that having a lady in to help her get dressed and do her hair in the morning as well as make breakfast may be a good entry-level introduction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/c9yyer/looking_for_advice/,Looking for advice

(this is because he lost his keys twice this week.) so everything is going to be on me from here on out, or me and whatever professionals or support available on the public system. i don’t live with him, i’m about an hour away. how do i cope?? i want to help him, i also want to have a life..."," have you considered hiring help?my mother was in another state, and my only sibling was unable to assist. i hired someone for a few hours a day a couple days per week. that bought me a year, until i finally moved her in with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/c7957l/sibs_wont_help/,Sibs won’t help

"my mother in law (who is 72) 45 days ago was in bad shape when we took the decision of moving her to our house (she was living alone with a helper during the day).  by then she would wander around the house at nights after some cats she had, would  tell neighbors she hadn't eating for days. not remember having grandkids or children, call my wife mom.  years of horrible diet, bad sleeping habits, bad marriage took her told.when at my house that first week she  would call my son young man, my daughter nice girl, some nights would wake up crying, asking to go home, or just plain asking to die. we would barely sleep and dispair during the day, even with a nurse around during the day. after the first week i was regretting my decision, was stress, couldn't sleep, or work, biking was the only thing keeping me sane.but all started to change by week two, a mix of better diet (no sugar or  coca cola from the get go, less carbs, more proteins kind of a keto diet), she seemed a bit more here.  i was relaying on music, having her sit in front of a large aquarium, sit her with our lovely rescued pitbull (that dog is a gift from heaven), take her on a ride in the car to pick my wife at work , avoid loud noises. it was way more than i was ready for. but i kept reading more to understand what i had gotten into and what kind of meds she was on.by week 3 i was removing meds, the side effects were clear to see, and the benefits few. so we decided that was not the way to go.by week 4 she was more aware, lots less wandering at nights, she would apologize for waking me and just one episode that put me on edge one morning (woke up historical, unsure of where she was). took a while to calm her.by this time, i had  read more and said  there is little to lose, so i got myself a bottle of cbd oil (which may or may not be legal here). it was a friday night and i gave her a dose, that night she got up, but was calmer, just to go to bathroom (she still forgets where it is). by sunday knee pain (screw from broken leg is out of position), back pain were gone and she was lucid and here, we had a decent conversation first win a long time.by now she was off all those meds and we had switch to vitamins, spirulina and coconut oil that sunday. fast forward next friday (tonight) she is sitting watching dr martin on netflix, calls my kids by their names, asked questions about news on tv in the morning. she has gained a few pounds, read a few pages of books, was very aware of things in supermarket, told me about some 40s musician in spotify. last night i heard her go to the toilet and go back to bed with no issues (on tuesday night i heard her say: ""damn! which way is my room? oh that way)all this changes are incredible and give me hope, maybe this could work for others.she still not all back, maybe never will, but what i'm seeing now vs a month ago is a leap forward i wasn't expecting.have a good weekend.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/c6slno/ray_of_hope_by_going_against_the_current/,Ray of hope by going against the current

"greetings, we are three students from the mit launchx program and we are creating a mobile app that helps caregivers of alzheimer’s and dementia patients in their daily lives. the app would be made so that the caregiver would use the app, and the affected loved one does not have to open the app in order to use the features.currently, the main features of the app are:1. adding reminders on the affected loved one’s phone via the app. the caregiver can set the date and time of the reminder, as well as a pre-recorded voice message if needed. the affected loved one will receive the reminder through notifications on his/her phone.2. allowing the caregiver to set a safety perimeter around the affected loved one’s home. when the affected loved one leaves the safety perimeter, the caregiver will receive an alert on their phone.we would truly appreciate your feedback on our app and some of the ways you think we could improve its features and overall experience. we are attaching a prototype of our app at  and a feedback survey at  we request if you could please try using the prototype at the above link and then fill out the feedback survey. if possible, we would appreciate it if you could send us photos or a phone screen recording of you using the prototype at the link above (we truly care about the lives of caregivers, and your feedback will be of immense help to us. please feel free to ask us any questions about this anytime.thanksmax feliciano, royce moon, and maanav khaitanstudents, mit launchx", the app works if the affect knows how to handle a phone (my 72 year old mother in law  doesn't). leaving the phone at home is to easy when the person already forgets stuff.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/c5fny3/user_testing_for_alzheimersdementia_support_app/,User Testing For Alzheimer's/Dementia Support App

"i don’t post often, but today was a really hard day and i feel lonely. today we spent the afternoon with my husband’s mom so his dad could get a round of golf in after his support group. it's been a long time coming, but we are elated because dad is feeling more comfortable asking for help with mom. this is my husband's second week helping with respite care. he said the morning went really well. they had breakfast and then drove to our house with mom’s dog, p, so that she could play with our two dogs, t and k. when i got home, i immediately noticed that mom was quite focused on our older dog, k. it seemed harmless, my husband lived at home with k for a few years after college so i was honestly quite touched that she having a connection. she hasn’t been able to remember our pups in a long, long time. mom and dad’s dog is a fuzzy little doodle-something puppy with limitless energy. t is a 9-year-old pug that still acts like a doodle-something puppy. when they get together, there’s lots of barking and playing and wrestling. it warms my heart… but drives mom insane. i don’t think she likes the loud barks and how unpredictably they move, so she gets *really* irritated when they romp. we tried our best to limit the fun (actual torture for any dog lover ;-) ) with the hopes of making the afternoon as pleasant for mom as possible. things seemed to be going well.and then it was time to go home.at some point, *without my husband or me realizing it*, mom had concluded that p was no longer hers and that she was taking k home. and boy, she was adamant. when we put p in the car and shut the door, mom said **fine** she would just walk home with k, then. if we tried to put our foot down, there were tears and desperate pleading. my heart was breaking over and over, both seeing mom so sad and upset and seeing my husband watch his mom struggle so much. he’s only recently started helping dad out with respite, and it couldn’t have been easy for him. it was a long afternoon. we brought all three dogs to mom's hoping that if we just had more time we could somehow maneuver a smoother transition... but we eventually had to rip off the bandaid anyway. i keep telling myself we did the very best that we could. my husband was rattled, and will likely have more feelings after he processes it… in about a month. i’m just lonely and tired, wishing that i had more answers, wishing that i could have done something to make her day better, and wondering how in the hell we got here so quickly. has anyone found the pause button yet??phew. i feel better after writing this, so i really appreciate the audience &lt;3 thank you"," that's so great your father in law gets to get out with your help. i'm sure he appreciated the break. it's always a learning process and adjusting how to react. depending on how long her memory lasts you could sit outside with her with a distraction like a snack, looking at pictures, music, etc. then after a little you could take her home and place the doggie in the back seat without drawing attention. she might go along. trial and error is all you can do. you are both trying and that is the most important thing. we all make mistakes or think we didn't do right but as long as you care with your heart never doubt yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/c2c2av/today_was_hard/,Today was hard.

"six months ago my father (age 76) was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe alzheimer's.  the guy was a brilliant man with a master's degree in biology, who spent a really successful career as a real estate agent for an oil company.  he gifted me with a great head for math and a love of science -- some of my best memories of him were when he showed me jupiter and saturn through his back yard telescope.that man literally gave me the universe, and he also gave me a sense of my own place in the working world.  important context, my biological parents divorced when i was two years old, and i was raised by my mother and stepfather.  the most significant time i spent with my bio father was a summer that i worked as an intern at his company in another state, and that's when i kind of sensed that i had a future in the corporate world.  and it's worked out exactly that way.  he worked 35 years in his company, surviving a spinoff and a buyout that had him moving states more than once, but by the end of his career he was literally the only person left from his original department from 35 years before.  i've always felt that was something to aspire to, and as of this writing i've made it through 17 years, 4 promotions, a merger and a reorganization at my own company, where i recently survived a layoff.  i credit my father for showing what that kind of work ethic looks like in the corporate world.so i knew something was off over the holidays last year when he started inventing memories that i knew never existed.  like for example, i mentioned that i'd been called for jury duty, and he started talking about his own jury duty experiences, in places i know he's never lived.  he's brought up celebrities from the 60s and 70s who he shared a beer with -- people like elvis, and the bee gees, and willie nelson -- all those stories are false but they are based on a true story he told me years ago, when he really *did* share a beer with harry belafonte.  so that was the beginning when i knew things were wrong.he got diagnosed and the whole family is adjusting to the new reality.  but this weekend there was an escalation.for the last three years, he and my stepmother have been the owners of a jack russell terrier.  one of the ways we've been trying to support him during the development of his condition is that we've allowed him to take the dog on walks.  most of the time he's ""present"" enough to stay within his neighborhood, but twice now he's gotten lost and wandered several miles away from home before being found and brought back.we've made arrangements to keep him tracked through geofencing on his phone, and for the most part that's worked.until saturday when he forgot to take his phone with him.  he ended up about 4 miles away from home, lost and confused, at which point the dog keeled over from heatstroke.the police found him, looking confused, not really sure where he was and not knowing how to deal with the situation.  he didn't have his id on him and he didn't remember his address, but he was present enough to direct the police back to his house.  they also took the dog in to the local humane society, but it wasn't enough.  the dog died.the dog's death is everybody's wake-up call.  he now needs more help than we can give him where he's at now.i don't know why i'm writing this, necessarily, except just looking for a support system of random reddit strangers.  i'm heartbroken at what the world is losing in this process, and i hope i can find a way to help make his transition better."," sorry to hear that, same boat here, just my mother in law. i fooled myself to think we had things running smoothly... until this morning.not sure where will be in 6 months, but i'm sure i need to find a way to release the stress now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/c1s5tc/holding_vigil_for_my_father/,Holding vigil for my father

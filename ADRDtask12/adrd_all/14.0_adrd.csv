[removed]," hello. my dad was diagnosed when he was 57. he is going on 60 and a lot has changed, but he still laughs, has fun, travels (pre-covid), and exercises. i would say that what helped me is spending time with him. when im away from him, thats when my mind wanders and i panic. when im with him, its almost as if it were back to normal. i try to speak slower, elaborate more clearly, and just be patient. its easier for me to adjust for those things than for him to try and act like his old self. when i speak slower, it gives him a chance to process what im saying. also, dont google things lol. everyone is different. i was so afraid that by this time, it’d be worse than what it is now. in the beginning, it was bad. i was crying every waking minute of every day.  then gradually you deal with it better.  read the “ball in the box” analogy for grief. we are in a horrible position because we grieve for someone who is still alive. it hurts so much. in the beginning, my dad kept saying “why me?”  one day something clicked and he started saying “why not me?” i dont even know if that helps. but it is something that makes sense to him i suppose. sorry if this post was all over the place. it accurately describes my thought process lol. much love to you. you can do this. for her♥️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/nqdzwl/advice_please/,Advice please?

[removed]," my grandmother was in her mid-late 80s when she first started showing symptoms. the most obvious was repeating the same things verbatim every few minutes. here are the less obvious symptoms in her case:1. she started buying weird things, like blankets, a rug, and a painting because she kept thinking someone was coming over (they weren’t.)2. she forgot how to put gas in her car. she would always ask us to “show her how to use that gas pump”. at the time i assumed she was just confused by the technology, but in reality she had forgotten how to put gas in a car.3. one thing that sticks out the most to me is that she would stick her fingers in food. like sticking her finger in cake icing and licking it. this isn’t necessarily weird, but it was out of character for her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/np35nz/can_you_all_give_me_the_signs_in_your_experience/,can you all give me the signs in your experience of the early stages ?

[removed]," i was 24 when my mother got diagnosed and she was 44. i was 10 hours away at school - i ended up coming home. i would like to say it was because of her - a part of it (i was burned out & i just left my fiancé). that was 21 years ago - we went to the best drs. - it was so rare back then.  my mother passed away at 51. i chose to stay home & help take care of her before we had to put her in a home. my brother wanted nothing to do with it, he was married & starting a family of his own. he took her to 1 breakfast & watched her 1 time alone. i asked him how  he could just detach emotionally & physically? he told me seeing mom like that made him sad & he wanted to remember her before she got sick. i resented him for years, for completely checking out! it wasn’t until i was a little older, that i was able to see the situation differently. we all deal with grief differently - me choosing to be her caregiver didn’t make me a better child. the bottom line for me is ... i have to make decisions i can live with and so did he. **my brother & i were 4 years apart & never got along- we never liked each other or respected each other - he was a stranger and one i didn’t want to know. 5 years ago when my brother was 44, he was recently divorced & moved in with my father. my dad told me he started seeing signs that my brother could be sick. we took him to a dr & got him genetically tested. our family carries psen1 gene it’s autosomal dominant (meaning there is 50% chance with each offspring). my father couldn’t handle it & so my brother came & lived with me. here is the silver lining - we were strangers - my boyfriend didn’t even want him in the house because he had treated me so poorly - however we both noticed a change in his personality. he was a different person - kind, loving and decent. i spent those last few years getting to know my brother - loving him. what was the most difficult to see — his children, they didn’t come around, didn’t call, his ex-wife not helpful - they said they wanted to remember my brother how he used to be - not when he was sick. my brother died at 47. ** when i was with my mother & brother i had to learn to live for the moments. :) if you ever want to talk - please email me, i am also in some good facebook groups.**what was helpful for me was meeting people my age, that had a loved one with early onset. i can’t tell u how many 50 plus year olds would talk about loosing someone in their 70-80’s. i sympathize with anyone losing a loved one at any age. all i could do is just stare at them and wish i was loosing someone in there 70-80’s. i was jealous of the almost additional 30-40 years. i grateful i found support",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/nnbap8/mother_has_early_onset/,mother has early onset

[removed]," nal, but recently had to have my mom sign her will and here’s what we experienced-i have two brothers and a sister, my father passed a few years ago without a will. my mom didn’t have one, so we spoke with her elder care atty to set one up. the attorney suggested we do a standard will splitting my mom’s assets four ways between her kids. my younger brother hasn’t helped care for my mom financially or otherwise, he hasn’t even seen her in two years now, despite living just 20 minutes away. i told the lawyer this, and asked if there was any way for us to adjust the will accordingly, and the answer was basically yes, and no- if my mom stated that those were her wishes and signed the will to that effect, fine- but because of her diminished state, my younger brother could sue and claim that we coerced her into leaving him out, especially since she lives with me. they said it’s possible the court could rule in his favor in cases like this, so we left the will split 4 ways. we did the signing with the lawyer over zoom, and i wasn’t allowed to be in the same room during the signing, which makes sense. we had a family friend sit with her to guide her through it. i have power of attorney for her, and i don’t pretend to understand it completely, but i can easily see how if i went and changed her will (if that’s even possible) it could definitely be contested in court. i know right and wrong, and i definitely believe my brother at the very least should lose a portion of his inheritance equal to what should have been his share of caring for here these past few years- but legally, this is her will, not mine- and she just doesn’t have the presence of mind to navigate how she’d like her will broken down. i don’t know if any of this info helps you, the only thing i can think to suggest is have your mom sign a separate will for her own wishes, which would cover only whatever assets she’s legally entitled to. trying to change the will of someone with alzheimer’s would absolutely require consulting an attorney- i’m sure you could find one who would give you a consultation free of charge",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/nlzdpc/alzheimers_and_wills/,Alzheimer's and wills

[removed]," you have described my mother, who i care for. full time since the covid lockdown. it is incredibly hard.first, i would strongly suggest that you learn about dementia. alzheimer’s association. they have a one page, 2 sided doc worth it’s weight in gold. i believe it is titled “compassionate communication”. i will see if i can find and link to it. my mother may distract me from it. second, find a daycare. your mother needs the attention. my mother dances and is quite the social butterfly. she hates that the doors are locked and she can’t get out. she was evicted from 2 senior homes and the family would not pay the increased costs of her care. on thing about caring for a dementia patient is routine, routine, routine. routine is hard to establish with someone stubborn, as i am assuming your grandmother is. changing routine can cause issues. my mother now paces incessantly, i can’t change her i can only adapt mine. i am building a pacing path in the backyard. hopefully it will keep the floors in the house cleaner. third, when my mother goes off the rails i can always trace it to my behavior. dementia patients are always scared, always. they react more to emotion/feelings. you can’t reason with them. you are right to remain calm, but questioning, explaining, all forms of “reasoning” are no longer tools you can use. i feel for your mother. it is said that the personality of dementia patients do not change. who they were just get bigger. your grandmother is the person your mother grew up with. i don’t know it for sure, but i am guessing type a personalities are extra difficult as dementia patients.[alzheimer’s compassionate care doc ](",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/njm150/how_do_you_handle_a_dementia_relative_who_gets/,How do you handle a dementia relative who gets angry when given help

[removed]," there are not officially sanctioned/recommended treatments for mci (mild cognitive impairment) other than neuro-feedback, cognitive therapies, health/diet and fitness for body and mind.  believe me i know! some doctor’s do prescribe medications for dementia but most will not unless they have either diagnosed it (normally occurring at a later stage) or they believe that — despite no true medical evidence — these meds may help given a large number of those with mci do go on to develop dementia. i would ask his doctor if he was diagnosed (sometimes they will tell family and sometimes not, often they do not based on hipaa).  honestly, he may already have been diagnosed with one form — there are six or seven.  with vascular, frontal-temporal lobe, alzheimer’s and  other forms there can be definitive behavioral changes too.  the difference between mci and dementia’s are not very defined for diagnosis.  over time monitoring is key.  many doctors do ask family members to provide input via evidence-based questionnaires when evaluating a patient.  i would ask his doctor.  i included a link below to more informative for you.  i hope you are doing okay and are finding the other support and resources you and your mom need!

[removed]," hi, i am a nurse at a hospital where we end up getting a lot of patients in acute agitation and who are combative at their nursing homes. they are sent to us because the staff cannot handle them. this might help shed some light for you: the hospital floor is not memory care and is no more equipped to handle this, other than we are allowed to use restraints. i just got off a shift where my physically fine and super strong patient was in 4 point restraints for the entire time. that means that his wrists and ankles were tied to the bed frame. still, he managed to pinch, grab, scratch, and punch at staff. the family does not want injections. my opinion as a nurse is this: at this stage of the disease (which doesn’t necessarily happen for every dementia case, and doesn’t last) there are often only 2 options: chemical or physical restraints. and sometimes a combination is needed. which would you rather? your loved one will hurt people, and try to escape, and likely hurt himself without proper medication or restraints. now, if it was me, i would rather be chemically calmed than tied to the bed like an animal. it’s truly an awful site, and due to covid, families are not seeing what it looks like to make an informed decision. my opinion is that improperly and insufficiently medicating is cruel to the patient. now, once the patient’s behavior is controlled by medication, there should be efforts made every so often to reduce the amount of meds and see how they do, because they are not likely to stay in this agitated stage of dementia for the rest of their lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/n4be5u/moms_not_eating/,Moms not eating

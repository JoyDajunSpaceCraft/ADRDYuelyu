"my dad (65) was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia about one year ago.  his worst symptom is the way he has acted with me a good few times now....sexually inappropriate. i know it's not 'him', he is completly absolved of any responsibility for his actions. he was the most wonderful father and it breaks my heart that the dad i had a few years ago is gradually disappearing more and more. my heart bleeds for my mum who has to deal with, not only his decline but the knowledge that her daughter seems to be a 'target' for his disinhibition. can i say he is still the most gentle of souls...just want to find anyone that has went through the same thing with their parent? did it stop affecting you as badly as time went on? thank you for reading.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/88txf7/dealing_with_ftd_sexual_disinhibition/,Dealing with FTD sexual disinhibition
i'm unemployed which is bad enough. but on top of that my parents are old. i'm up most the night and my dad will come downstairs open the living room door and say 'oh your still up are you mate' - he does this most nights - at first i thought he just wanted to talk to me. now i realise maybe he forgets and comes down to turn the light off?i have also be slowly losing my patience with not having any personal space at all. i had a big talk to my dad about it the other day. how whenever he leaves the house he asks if i want to go with him and mum. - every week he asks me to go shopping.  i used to go now and then but it's the only time i get the house to myself. and i've been slowly losing my patience with my dad asking me all the time. i told him this. and yet he still does it. all the ducking time. at first i thought it was because i had a breakup with a girlfriend and was a little bit down and he was trying to get me out the house. but now i realise it's not that at all. and he can't seem to remember that i don't want to go shopping with him and mum all the time.i mean - maybe i should be a good son and do it. but i need to keep my mind healthy as well. and if i don't keep boundaries it never stops with him asking me to do stuff with or for him. we have conversations and i feel like i'm explaining myself over and over. and i'm realising some points in the day he seems like himself and others it's like a ghost sitting next to me. i thought it was old age before and maybe it is but either way it's fucking hard. he was the stongest man i know just 10-15 years back and it's like i have lost him already. i feel like i never got a chance to be fully young. but now i'm realising maybe i did and this sort of thing will happen to most people at some points in their life. it's just a shame i am young and before i got my feet off the ground it is happening. it's fucking heartbreaking honestly because i had more going for me then anyone else i know but my entire life has slowly crumbled around me. home hasn't really felt that way for 10+ years anymore and i'm so lost. people see me as this shell i have become but nobody really knows what i'm going through. i would have moved out at 18-19 i had a great social group and i was pretty much the leader of it but i have had to let it all go and slow down to be patient with my dad at home. i could fuckoff and do my own thing but what kind of son would that make me?but saying that my sex life and social life have comepletely gone as i never brought my friends or girls home because i feel so trapped at home.10 years back i had the life i wanted. the girlfriend and mates i wanted. it's all gone. my ex went on to be a tattooist. mates have all moved on with their lives and i feel utterly powerless and vulnerable.  i'm kicking myself for not taking oppotunities i had but with vulnerable parents what am i to do? do my priorities lie with what i want out of life or being there for those that sacrificed so much for me? it feels a waste not getting the life i want after all they did for me but it feels just as equally selfish and it would be to leave my mum on her own as my dad gets older _ but the thing is my mum is 15 years younger then my dad so if i don't do what's right for me i might be sacrificing myself another 30 or so years until they are both dead and in which case i will then be 56? i don't really know why i am venting here i just feel like the bottom has well and truly fallen out of my life and it's not gonna get any easier," have  you discussed this with your mother? she's 71 and your dad's primary caregiver, as things go. she may be struggling with some of the same thoughts you are. the two of you should tackle this together.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/88o51a/im_26_my_dads_86_dont_know_if_onset_of/,Im 26- my dads 86 - don't know if onset of dentist/alzeimerz or just old?

"so, this old woman (80 years old) in my family has had a few health problems recently. a long time ago, she said that she had a problem with her blood vessels being blocked/obstructed around her neck. the generalist practicioner told her that she should get an operation for that, unfortunately she decided to not to anything.some time later, she fell unconscious out of the blue. she didn't think it was anything serious, and just ignored the incident.a month ago i was informed that something happened to her. her son (my uncle) claimed that she had went completely crazy, and that she was saying bad stuff about everyone in her family.only today were we able to visit her. i was worried that she would not recognize us and/or kick us out/insult us, luckily it was not the case. she was calm and extremely happy to see me, my sister and my grandmother. she performs 99,9% of daily activities normally: she goes to the store on her own (except for today, i wanted to go with her), she still makes delicious food and she can lead a normal conversation. she does look a bit physically weaker.everything is normal, except for one detail: she talks alone. she says that she sees members of her family (some of which are deceased) and that they are talking to her. this seems to upset her, as she tells them to stop lying and insults them. as an example, she said that a man who lived in the village where she was born told her that we would not come to visit her, even though we informed our uncle yesterday that we would come to visit. she also claims that in the building where she lives, there are two sorcerers who cast bad spells on her. according to my uncle, she sometimes also gets angry when a family member visits her and doesn't recognize them.sorry if i sound uneducated about dementia, truth is i do not know that much about this disease, but from some quick searches and conversations with family members i concluded that she most likely suffers from vascular dementia (due to the fact that blood vessels around her neck were blocked/obstructed).but i've come here to ask, since i think people on this subreddit are more reliable and informated than me and google. doctors said that she would need to wait a long time before she can be diagnosed, which is another reason for my post.the person who i'm talking about in this post is very nice and generous person who has not only helped me in hard times, but many other people aswell, so any information that you can give is appreciated. thanks in advance for your replies.", look into possible schizophrenia.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/88mlfy/is_this_dementia/,Is this dementia?

"a little bit of background, my mother is 61 now, and has been diagnosed for about 5 years. ftd is a very rapid onset form of dementia, that many carers and people are just not comfortable understanding, as it rapidly takes away the persons ability to communicate, comprehend, and address their own needs. my mother would literally sit in a fire, and not realize it. terrifying.anyways, decades ago my mother had a partial denture made. like any severe dementia patient, she does not allow brushing or oral care very easily. my father is her primary carer - while working a 10hr plus job to support, with supplemental care during the day. there is no full time care. supplemental care shows up every 3 hours while he is at work to feed, clean, bathroom break, etc..anyways - flash forward to the question. i live far away, so i have not seen this behavior directly, i speak with my father 3-4 times a week, and he mentioned she seems to drool a bit, and her teeth are bothering her. so he took her in for a checkup. he has no dental insurance.during the checkup, they said many of her teeth are severely chipped. they did not do xrays, and i am not sure if she reacted to any pain from probing, but in my experience when i visit, she does not react much any more. so there is no knowledge of her being in pain, just the assumption from the drooling (which is very occasional).anyways, they recommended pulling her remaining teeth (even though they said there appears to be no inflammation), and fitting her for a denture. they estimate the cost upwards to $3-5,000. my father would pay it, if it meant he ate saw dust for a year, and taking money from me would be a front to his character - and he would never do it - i have tried on many occasions. i on the other hand want to look at this rationally. we do not know, nor can we know if she is or is not in pain, and i fear the outcome of the recovery. the dentist said ""they have dealt with many alzheimers patients before, and it should not be a problem."" they would want to put her out under gas to do the treatment.my mother is a high risk patient. she had been overweight her whole life, and due to sedentary behavior now, even with reduced intake, she is not exactly light weight. she is 61. she cannot indicate any directions, or feedback to any doctor. putting her under, and then having her recovering from a full anesthetic scares the piss out of me, because while she is non functioning in many ways - my dad works with her, and she almost feeds herself (automatic action when spoon in hand type of behavior), and he almost retrains this daily. what i have read is just the recovery from being under can disorient a person for weeks. she reacts poorly to stress scenarios (like new carers coming that she does not know, will change her outward abilities for days on end).now i also think back to my time getting wisdom teeth removed. dry socket, no straws, careful eating... these are all things that would have to be monitored for upwards to 2-6 months depending on the rate of healing, and any complications. after all of this heals, she would then have to be fit for dentures.in the end, my question is this - is it worth it? if there is pain due to a tooth ache, which we are guessing at, is it more appropriate to handle it with an anti-inflammatory like children's tylenol, and focus on seeing a gp instead, to monitor for infection, and other issues. my gut tells me that recovery and the quality of life impact would just not be worth the risk, the pain, and the challenge if we can mitigate symptoms instead.i would love thoughts, advice, experiences, anything to help us come to an appropriate decision. thank you in advance, and fuck this disease!(edited spacing of paragraphs)"," i’m so sorry you all are in this predicament. we were there too, except my father was a dentist. and a perfectionist. despite his best efforts, after falling to ftd, my mother’s oral health deteriorated. a little back story...my dad went to great lengths for us to have perfect teeth. i had major jaw/facial surgery, braces four times, countless retainers and lastly, invisalign (plus bleaching trays, cleanings whenever, no cavities ever)—my mouth is painstakingly perfect. when my mother needed her front teeth fixed, we all went to another state to learn the latest technique for porcelain veneers from an expert (i was his assistant for this procedure). so, the sky wasn’t even the limit in terms of what my dad would have/could have done for my mother’s teeth. he ended up not doing much. he didn’t want to put her through the pain and discomfort in all that work. he cleaned her teeth twice a day, he filed down the chipped teeth so she wouldn’t get hurt. he pulled a tooth that broke off. he swallowed his pride and lovingly accepted his wife of 50 years now had a messed up mouth.  i’d say go to another dentist for a second opinion. that’s a lot of money for dentures that may not be in her best interest. i can see it being difficult for someone with ftd to put in correctly, clean and even use consistently. good luck and i wish you peace as you navigate life with this horrible disease.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/82oqo7/advice_needed_ftd_dental_surgery/,Advice Needed - FTD / Dental Surgery

"i’m here looking for some advice.my family is currently facing a stressful situation, as my 93-year-old maternal grandmother has been suffering from dementia. the dementia is the result of her having thrown a few pes in the past, rather than her age. this means, her loss of memory/filters has been a relatively gradual process. in many ways this has been a blessing – my grandmother lives alone, in another state. she is a very independent, and a very, very stubborn individual, who is adamant that she will never accept help from a caregiver (outside the family) and will certainly never leave her house.as her memory loss has been a slow process, she has been able to stay in her home by herself. my mother calls to check on her multiple times a day and flies out to check up on her every few months, and remotely handles her medical/financial needs. in addition, she is driven to appointments/stores by a neighbor, who also helps her out physically (taking her trash out, and the like), and she is in relatively close proximity to her sisters and a niece. though she is on medication to slow the progression of the disease, there are many times she forgets to take her pills, which as a result negates any help they may have otherwise supplied. in the past few months, we are seeing more and more signs of decline. names and dates have begun to slip, and her short-term memory too is declining. at the moment, she is still able to more or less take care of her daily basic needs – food, chores, bathing. but, she is not able to rationalize things – for instance, she hordes things, keeps expired food, will sit in the dark on occasion (though this is clearly a tripping hazard). my mother has been working with adult services, who has been keeping track of my grandmother’s decline. the last contact they had with my mother, was a call to inform her that they had done a home check on my grandmother and found there to be no issue (as in she did not yet pose a danger to herself). they ended up closing her case file.so where does that leave my mother/us? it leaves us in a holding pattern – a very stressful one. though my grandmother’s disease is heavily documented, there is not yet any legal recourse for us to transfer her to assisted living. basically, we have to leave her to decline some more, before such action can be taken. in the meantime, my grandmother’s personality has become more and more volatile. her personality from her childhood onward, has one of stubbornness. i’m not sure if this was the result of various familial tragedies she’s had to endure, or if this is simply her natural personality. despite the helpful neighbor and the various family member who will occasionally call her, my mother is really her sole caretaker (her father and only sibling are both long since deceased). as such, the relationship between my mother and grandmother has declined to a point where my mother can no longer remember a time when her mother behaved as such. she has begun to question whether my grandmother ever even loved her.the pinnacle of this came tonight – my parents are currently at my grandmother’s house checking up on her. my mother was in the process of throwing out expired food in a basement pantry, when she stumbled upon decades old food. not only had the food and surrounding shelving begun to blacken and dissolve, but my mother had cause for concern that she was exposed to some very harmful mold.shaken by this, she relayed her worry and finding to my grandmother, and was met with only anger and denial – no sympathy/empathy was given despite my mother’s proffered fears (that she had been exposed to a toxin). my mother has been attending some group therapy sessions in regard to caring for someone with dementia and is aware that the disease takes a way a person’s ability to rationalize and perhaps even empathize. though she is aware of this logic, i see her having trouble internalizing it. the decline in the relationship between mother and daughter is taking a very large toll on my mother emotionally.i know this post is a long ramble, and i'm not sure if any one will even read it in its entirety, but i guess my purpose here is to figure out a way to help my mother. i can’t (nor can my siblings) be there physically to help (at least at the moment). i try to offer assistance emotionally, reassuring her about things, letting her know that we know she is doing all she can, etc. however, there are times when i find myself at a loss for words (on how she may be able to make suggestions or have positive interactions with my grandmother). what can you tell someone who is going through such a difficult thing that will make them feel better or will be useful to them?though we are all here to support her in any way we can, i know there are many times when she feels as if she is carrying the burden alone. any advice would be much appreciated. thank you.", try adult protective servicesmaybe literal piles of mold is enough to have them take action ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/811cnm/looking_for_advice_on_supporting_a_caretaker/,Looking for Advice (on supporting a caretaker)

"my grandmother has some form of dementia. she is also legally blind. she is only 67 years old about to turn 68. long story short, she is not eligible for medicaid right now and therefor we cannot afford nursing home care or in home health care or adult day care. i am only 25 and have been caring for her for three going on four years.  she is wrecking my life. i know that is probably a selfish thing to say but i cannot have anything materialistic, i can’t have friends over, i can’t go on vacations, and she is a huge stressor on any relationship that i try to have. she gets into everything. i can’t afford to not work, so i have a full time job and she is usually left alone while i am at work. between when i am sleeping and when i am at work, she causes chaos. i can’t let her have toilet paper or access to paper towels or any kind of cloth because she will cram it in the toilet and flush until i overflows down the hall. she gets into any food or drinks in the house and can not determine when she has had enough. she will eat an entire pizza in a sitting or drink a twelve pack of sodas in a day. i have to hide all food. sometimes she gets into things that aren’t food. she used my cross stitch dolly as toilet paper and flushed it, she tried to drink cooking oil and poured it all over the floor, she ate a lavender scented exfoliating foot sponge. i have put a lock on my fridge but she still searches the cabinets and pantry. she goes through my bags, lunchboxes, and bedroom.  she will drink my coffee off the coffee table in the time it takes me to go to the bathroom. she has started getting aggressive too, threatening to bite people if they take something away from her, threatening to leave if she doesn’t get her way. i am at my wits end.  i have no idea what to do with her or how to make my quality of life better. i want to be able to come home and relax instead of dealing with messes and catastrophe every day. it is really weighing on my mental health. does anyone have any ideas of how i can keep her from getting into things or what i can do about her aggression?"," short-term solution: can you leave something around specifically for her to find and keep occupied? like, she goes through the cabinets, right? what about locking all of them but one, full of stuff that won't be harmful or a pain in the ass to clean up, where she can scoop around as much as she likes? same goes for everything else.i agree with the others, though. especially since she's becoming violent, day care at least is definitely on your urgent goals list.edit: spelling",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/80e87u/please_help_me_think_of_something/,Please help me think of something

"hello, i just recently found this sub and i was wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions about how to speak to my mother about some odd things we've been noticing concerning her behaviour. sorry if this is long.my mom turned 70 in december and we've been noticing that she's becoming forgetful about things. my siblings and i have been passing it off and in denial because she's always been absentminded, but lately it's been getting worse. we noticed it with small things like forgetting someone's name, and what not but the last few months it's been a bit more noticeable.in december i took her to a paint night with my girlfriends and their mom's and she couldn't follow simple directions to paint a snowman. i had to help her the whole time and explain to her what she had to do. she does wear a hearing aid and she said she had difficulty hearing, but she could see what the rest of us were painting. her painting ended up looking completely different than everyone else's.my mother is very attractive for a 70 year old woman and is always dressed to the nine's. she doesn't leave the house without her hair and make up done and she always dresses very nice. i had my baby shower yesterday and when i saw her my heart just sunk. her hair was really unkempt, she had no make up on, and she was wearing a pair of jeans with a t shirt. just not how my mother usually is. my cousins told me that she got confused a few times when they were speaking to her and she kept referring to bread as ""flour"". when we were cleaning up, she was looking for the cover to a butter container and i found it and let her know. a few minutes later i saw her walking around, looking for something. i asked her what she was doing and she told me that she was looking for the top of the butter. i had to explain to her again that i had found it. my sister spoke to my dad and asked him if he noticed her behaviors changing and my dad said he had. he gave an example of how she was boiling potatoes for supper and he mentioned that it might be nice to have some gravy with them, and she agreed and put the gravy package into the boiling pot of potatoes.i'm just really worried about her and i'd like for her to see someone and be tested, but i know she isn't going to be receptive. she's very stubborn and we can't get her to see a doctor about anything. just looking for some help on how to speak to her about our worries.tldr: my mom is showing some behvaioural changes and my siblings and i are worried she may be showing some early signs of dementia. looking for advice on how to broach the subject with her."," we did something similar with my dad to what u/myfeelingsarehurt described. i had carefully documented all of the most alarming symptoms and communicated those to his primary care physician in writing, which prompted a phone call from her nurse and the scheduling of an appointment. for dad, this was just another periodic checkup, but the doc performed the brief montreal assessment during the visit and got enough info to make the referral to a neurologist. i should mention that i was already my dad’s primary medical advocate and listed with all his providers as medical poa with hipaa release, so they were able to speak directly to me about my dad’s condition and care plan. in your case, your father may need to do the background coordinating with her health providers, as he would have legal standing to do so. this is such a hard process. wishing you and your family strength in the times ahead.

"my dad is 67 years old and has been living with what's in my opinion the very worst disease humanity has ever known- aphasia- for about four years now. the word aphasia might not be familiar to some of you, so let me enlighten you: it renders a person unable to communicate. what exactly does that entail? besides mixing up words, forgetting them, flipping them around, turning them inside-out and using them the wrong way, your ability to gesture (and respond to gestures) dissipates. observing him on a daily basis, the best analogy i can make for his situation is that of an astronaut who went for a spacewalk, but his tether broke loose and he was left floating in space for a long time before arriving on an alien planet where means of communication are completely beyond his comprehension. you can tell looking in his eyes how damn scared he is and it kills me. the man who raised me and who i loved more than anything in this world has been crumbling in front of me. the man who moved mountains and parted seas so that i could have a good life is going downhill at an exponential rate and there's not a thing i can do to stop it. his dreams-- our shared dreams-- will now never be realized... there's so much i wanted to do with him still that i'll never get to. with this disease you really do mourn the person while they're still alive. even knowing there's no cure for this, i can't accept it and have been taking it devastatingly hard from the very beginning... i just can't accept that one of the two pillars i stand on is crumbling so fast. had his diagnosis remained at 'just' your garden-variety dementia, coping would have been much easier on my mother and i... alzheimers would of been a walk in the park... but this aphasia... it rendered his ability to communicate with us-- even if just in a heavily fragmented fashion-- completely and utterly useless. he's completely unwilling to cooperate with my mother and i when we try to help him with any of a multitude of tasks... and if we're so lucky as to get him to come in the car for a trip to the doctors office he absolutely never gets out once we're there. the very few words that've stayed with him are merely profanities which he throws at anyone/anything. of course anyone would be infuriated living with this sickness so i understand it, but these words aren't descriptive ones meant to show how he feels... they just happen to be all he's been left with. the only homes designed to handle someone with a case this severe is completely out of our reach at around $11,000/month and there's no insurance that covers it or anything. frankly, i completely understand why they charge what they do as dealing with this disease is a living hell- they deserve every penny. the past few days he's been eating and drinking less than usual and exhibiting some signs of pain, but he simply won't work with us by getting in the car and letting us take him to the hospital. the paramedics downright gave up after seeing how difficult/resilient he was and suggested we get his doctor to put in order for sedatives, which seems to be the last avenue left for us to explore. it's tragic that it's come to this point just to get him to a hospital."," i'm so sorry for you and your family, it seems astonishingly tough. i wish i could offer more than sympathy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7v46l7/advice_on_how_to_deal_with_an_impossible/,advice on how to deal with an impossible situation? my father has aphasia...

"my mum has early onset dementia they think it is a hybrid of both alzheimers and vascular,  she gets both the slow curve degradation and the big drops.her voice was the first thing to go (became unintelligible early on) and luckily even though she was completely delusional she spent most of her time in her own world talking to mirrors and was happy, the local nurse thinks she is in stage 7 (the last stages she has lots of the symptoms but is still mobile wandering about) and still has body strength (64).my mum lives next door with her partner, we bought the house next to them so we could help (i have a lot of experience caring due to being primary carer for my wife over the last 20 years), we did all the normal stuff locked down the front gate last year so she could wander and clean (back then she liked to clean the frond door and windows every day) then as she got worse we restricted her to the back yard and her garden she loved, although this is when she spent a lot of time talking to her reflection friends in the shed window.but this last 3 months she has had some real drops and as of last month spends all her time upstairs in her room but she was happy chattering away to her memories her childhood (we know that because of the odd word like mum), she became completely incontinent and we had help from the nurses and visits (her partner cleaned her morning and night and nurse came afternoon and helped).coping quite well and supporting each other.now a week ago she had another ""drop"" something in her brain drastically changed, not the normal sometimes happy sometimes sad sometimes angry sometimes weepy, she went full on anger and what i would call hysterical strength, destroyed the room and furniture (we got rid of everything she could use as a weapon).biting and pinching is now a thing, before this happened the nurse could do her hair or brush her teeth now its a challenge to even change the diaper.tonight she pulled off a radiator then the tiles and proceeded to try and eat tiling cement (we stopped her) i think she is exhausted now.tomorrow we will be talking to social services (we have a great person) and out (admiral nurse) we really wanted to look after her at home but she is acting like a wild animal now ""feral"" is a good word for it and even though she is down to 45k in weight she still has some strength.problem is i do not think a normal care home can handle her and she would be sent back to us, we planned on looking after her till the end at home (her partner does not work and i am available we were also going to increase the nurse visits to 2-3 times a day) but the concern isn't the damage to the house that we can deal with and even the harm to me and her partner we can handle that its the harm to herself she seems to have little or no feeling of pain.edit:does not seem to be any pattern to it, no trigger event, she refuses to take medication (that does make her angry if she is happy) she eats finger food (grazing) biscuits mainly, eats very little, we already have a dnr in place and have decided in family that no forcing of fluid or food will happen, no iv or stomach tube see no point to any of that.we go in and talk to her but while like this we give her as much space as possible and just repair the bedroom 2-3 times a day."," if you are interested, there is an occupational therapist in the us named teepa snow. she gives talks/educational conferences all over the country to train professional caregivers how to better understand and manage dementia and it's difficult behaviors.  she gives invaluable insight into what may be causing various behaviors based on what is happening in their brain.  she also gives different ways to approach or address difficult behaviors.  if you search teepa snow on youtube you will find a ton of videos of her. she also has her own youtube channel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/7twvki/how_do_you_deal_with_the_violence_in_late_stage_uk/,How do you deal with the violence in late stage ?

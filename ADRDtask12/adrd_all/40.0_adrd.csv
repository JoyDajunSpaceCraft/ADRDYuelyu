"a friend of mine's father is fairly late stage alzheimers. he has recently entered hospice care. i would like to get her something for father's day, a little something for support.i am not very good with gift ideas, i could use some ideas. if there is something that would maybe be good for someone with late stage alzheimers, and maybe i could get her a card or write a note?"," any gift will make her feel cared for.  i would suggest something that would make her leave home for a short time.  i have a feeling she needs a break, but takes few.  perhaps a gift certificate for a movie, salon, restaurant that she likes?  if you want to include something for the father, fuzzy non constricting socks can be a great gift.  making sure his feet are warm will give her a feeling of accomplishment when surrounded by so much that she can not change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6h0srp/gifts_for_alzheimers_caregiver_daughter/,Gifts for Alzheimers caregiver / daughter
"mom (over the top the best one ever - three masters degrees while raising 3 kids under the age of 7 and putting husband through law school- was awesome through all crazy ness - somehow...she was so great...) - was diagnosed with dementia years ago -and alzheimers a year ago.  it doesn't usually happen, because the onset is so slow, but tonight - i really miss her.  she was a mom that was fantastic (not the cool mom,but a great mom) through teenage years.  she was smart. when i talk with with my sisters about her -  who are also working with kids -we can't figure out how she did what she did. woke up at 3am to feed horses. wake us up at 5a to get to school (and her to work). all back home / ride/ feed/ muck / homework - and she as a teacher - had homework too...she probably slept 4 hours a night.  i miss her insight. i miss my friend. i miss my mom.  she is happy - i know this deep in my soul ... she is so joyful still...and this makes it somehow easier i think...but tonight...tonight i'm sad. i miss sharing life my life with her. tonight i'm sad."," i know how you feel.. i cried so much when i realized i was losing my best friend. but then i realize the new person she became with someone that was wonderful in a different way and i loved her also. it made it easier for me to think of it that way.  sorta like the opposite of watching your children grow.  you love your 5 year old as much as when he was 2, but he is very different. she is probably now on the her fifth different personality, and i love this one too. i was also caregiver of her youngest brother who passed from alzheimer's first. at end , though he didn't know who she was, her company was a great source of comfort for them both . i hope at the end she will appreciate my holding her hand also.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6gwdat/its_a_hard_night/,It's a hard night

"hey there! so as i was watching a new lecture on alzheimers this morning, i decided to look what kind of comments and reaction there was on dr bredeson's research. i was amazed to find not one mention of dale bredeson anywhere on reddit, since my family has been following his research (hopefully) for quite a while now. i realize it is cutting edge stuff, and probably not near as popular as the idea of some 'magic drug' that can fix anything. is this because the community is not aware, or because his research is being rejected?anyways, thought i'd go ahead and link a couple of articles, journals and presentations along with his basic tenants of treatment.if there's one video you should watch to get a good overview, it's this: [video](some of his beliefs:1) beta-amaloid plaques/ tangles are not the cause of alzheimer's but are simply a symptom and possibly the body's defense against alzheimer's. using drugs to treat plaques are like giving someone tylenol to treat a fever coming from a leg infection. it won't help, it's not the root cause.2) alzheimer's is caused by multiple factors. hundreds of years ago when people died, their cause of death was that they had 'the fever'. now a days, we would of course ask, ""well okay they had a fever, but what caused the fever? was it the flu, chicken pox ect."" he argues that alzheimer's is the same way, and in the future they will ask, ""sure they have alzheimer's, but what caused alzheimers?"" 3) diet/lifestyle changes are currently the only ways to influence all/most of the factors that cause alzheimer's. image a roof that has 40 leaks in it. currently, just taking a drug will patch one or two of the holes, but the rest of the holes are left open. 3a) a summary of the bredeson protocol: ·       eliminate all simple carbohydrates·       eliminate gluten &amp; processed foods·       increase vegetables, fruits, and non-farmed fish·       reduce stress with yoga &amp; meditation·       increase sleep from 4-5 hours per night to 7-8 hours per night·       taking methylcobalamin (methyl b12), vitamin d, coq10, and fish oil each day·       optimize oral hygiene using an electric flosser &amp; electric toothbrush·       fasting for minimum of 12 hours between dinner and breakfast·       exercising for a minimum of 30 minutes, 4-6 days per week.3b) more details - the first 25 interventions used in the bredesen protocol to reverse mild alzheimer's1. optimize diet2. enhance autophagy, ketogenesis3. reduce stress4. optimize sleep5. exercise6. brain stimulation7. homocysteine less than 6 (earlier version of the protocol was &lt; 7)8. serum b12 greater than 5009. crp less than 1.0; a/g greater than 1.8 (earlier version of the protocol was &gt; 1.5)10. fasting insulin less than 5; hgba1c less than 5.6 (earlier version of the protocol was fasting insulin &lt;7; hgba1c &lt;5.5)11. hormone balance12. gi health13. reduction of aß14. cognitive enhancement15. 25oh-d3 = 50-80ng/ml (earlier version of the protocol was 50-100)16. increase ngf17. provide synaptic structural components18. optimize antioxidants19. optimize zn:fcu ratio20. ensure nocturnal oxygenation21. optimize mitochondrial function22. increase focus23. increase sirt1 function24. exclude heavy metal toxicity25. mct effects26. inhalational alzheimer's[memory reversal](anyways, you can see that the bredeson protocol is not easy. it's not a simple drug that you can take every morning and you're magically cured. thoughts on this? does anyone else follow his research and have any insights?"," hi all,my mother was diagnosed with early onset about a year ago. after the initial shock and tears we start looking what really could be done. we tried to enroll to couple of trials but some of them were not available where we live and some others  just didn't work out.we have read dr. bredeson's research with a lot of reservation. if you read from his published paper, you can see it really seems over optimistic given the whole statement is made based on a study with 10 people and no control group. we discussed with my mothers doctor and decided to adopt some of the recommendations from dr. bredenson and keep her regular medication. i don't wanna say my mother is cured or anything but we did notice (at least noticeable to us) that some improvement has occurred.my advise for anybody who find the research interesting is to talk to the persons doctor and sees what make sense to apply. don't expect magic but for sure there are some good points in this research.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6efknc/dr_bredesons_research_the_first_reversal_of/,Dr. Bredeson's Research- The First Reversal of Alzheimer's

"i'll try to keep it short.   tl;dr i am curious to know if alzheimer's is at fault in anyway for what appears to be our grandma feigning serious illness for three weeks in an attempt to guilt and coerce her daughter into staying home and caring for her - forcing daughter to miss a major trip/vacation. could she have been ill and alzheimer's made her appear lucid/healthy. or do you think it was a guilt/manipulation?grandmother recently fainted and fell. it wasn't major. doctor sent her home with simple instructions that she only needed two days to recover. however for the three weeks since, grandma won't eat, can't walk to the bathroom, needs help sitting on the toilet, help wiping, help washing and bathing, help into and out of bed, needs meals in bed, moans and groans from pain - ""i want to die, i want to die"" etc. three weeks...in this time, her daughter has been 100% on call. she herself is ill, and is being driven to exhaustion taking care of grandma. she wipes her butt, does the cleaning, lifting, everything. since january, this daughter has planned to take a trip to another family-member's house, which she did yesterday.   grandma is insistent throughout the three weeks that the daughter has to stay to care for her. she's complaining, begging, even offering to pay everyone who will be impacted by the trip cancellation the money they will lose ($5,000 usd) if her daughter doesn't take the trip. daughter says she can't stay and arranges professional care for grandma for the trip. --this is where i need help, please--the night daughter leaves, grandma freaks the f out. she starts shouting about being abandoned, crying, screaming, threatening to throw herself down the stairs again and again. she won't take medicine, won't calm down. curses the entire family (in this culture cursing is not foul language but actually putting a curse of sorts on people - you are wishing them personal harm. grandma is old school like that, it's the worst thing people her age can say to another person). she takes the medicine only when threatened with hospitalization.this continues for 3 hours. finally, they have to get the other adult daughter to come take her. when the other daughter arrives, grandma hops out of bed, carries her own belongings, and walks downstairs unassisted and into the waiting car. ... hours before this she was bed-ridden, needing help to wipe her own butt. on the way out, grandma is still cursing everyone and says to the son in law, ""sorry about earlier my mind was crazy."" she was still yelling about being abandoned, so we believe she was talking about being so ill for the last few weeks??is alzheimer's at play here? was she always healthier and able to move like this and just faking it? did the alzheimer's cause her to go into a fit that led to the aggression and the extra mobility/strength? knowing this grandma and the chain of events, everyone's conclusion is that she was trying to manipulate everyone since the accident to get the daughter to stay and would have probably suddenly made a speedy recovery when the daughter missed her trip. does it sound like alzheimer's is the culprit here?thank you, sorry for the long message."," > on the way out, grandma is still cursing everyone and says to the son in law, ""sorry about earlier my mind was crazy."" imo, a person with alzheimer's will pretty much never say this (maybe if they're super super early stage, but then they'd be able to wipe their own butt, etc.).  this is because they don't remember ""earlier.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6dabnp/grandmother_with_alzheimers_health_rapidly/,"Grandmother with Alzheimer's health rapidly degenerated in recent weeks.

"hello all,thank you for reading. i'm really hoping for a bit of advice on how to get care for my dad. his condition is getting worse (suffering for 8 years, aged 67), and was locked out the house the other day and the police needed to help get him in again; just forgot how to work the door, and he's lived there for 25 years, but remembered nothing from it, minutes later.he did have a companion to go on walks with, but said ""he can go out on his own"", and didn't want/need that person. my mum works in the mornings, and sometimes has other things to do in the afternoon. she doesn't want to give up working. so i'm wondering how to get some care and support to him when she's out, without making him feel watched. my mum isn't really proactive and i feel she just won't actually do anything about this. they used to have gp support at the start, but that's stopped for some reason. but i'm having a telephone chat with the gps on fri to voice my concerns. i'm really rather worried that he's going to step out in front of a bus/car/van, or get lost in the city (we live in a big-ish city) and not come home one day. he has a simple mobile, but cannot remember how to use it or what it's for.but help.....how can i help him without making him feel more like crap? my mum already belittles him constantly and just gets angry at his behaviour, i know it's tough, but it hurts me when she hurts him. i've put up with her shit all my life and it's a shame that he's getting the worst of her now.thank you :-)"," we're in uk too. the main problem has been, in all honesty, our denial. we effectively painted over the cracks which meant that those carrying out assessments didn't see the true picture, or the real extend of my mil's problems - e.g. we cleaned and tidied her place before an assessment rather than letting them see she was happy to live with a pile of clothes on the settee.we've learned that we will only get support if we know what to ask for, but it's utterly frustrating when we get things in place only to find that my mil has sent stuff back (equipment to help her with day to day stuff) and refuses to let carers help her bathe etc. but the carers still go in each day and, as this is her new normal, she is gradually letting them do things to help.i think you should start to get social services involved and maybe your local community mental health team. it takes a loooong time for things to kick into gear, but they will give advice and support over the phone whilst the referral and making assessment appointments etc is happening. check online for local services, including age concern and dementia action.if your dad needs a carer, or somebody to sit with him or take him for a walk, then he may be eligible for care allowance. the forms are a nightmare but there are local support groups that can help you fill them in - specially trained people, with a lot of experience.my mil goes to a day centre twice a week, there are some men there too. it's run by age concern. maybe there's one in your area that he could go to? she's collected in the morning, has a cup of tea on arrival, lunch and then more tea before being taken back home. there are various activities throughout each day, but we never know what they are - and we never know what she had for lunch either. sometimes they go out for lunch, sometimes they go out for a day trip, sometimes they have entertainers in. it's all quite low key and very friendly, almost like a playgroup for grown-ups.your mum needs support too, she's in the firing line and it's exhausting to have to be a carer, try to run a home, and keep down a job. it's no wonder she's short tempered. she probably needs a shoulder to cry on too.good luck*edit: removed 'short because i haven't got time' and added some more, now i've got more time*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/6b9tyo/how_to_provide_care_when_the_sufferer_doesnt/,How to provide care when the sufferer doesn't think they need it?

"i'm 24, currently live with just my grandparents, and my grandma is at the beginning stages of alzheimer's. she's in her mid 70s, repeats questions/statements, forgets what she's talking about mid-sentence, illogical conversations, walks into rooms and doesn't remember why, and worst of all has very frequent mood swings and outbursts. very likely sundowners as she will start yelling and throwing things around sunset. she always had depression and has a terrible habit of blaming and nagging my grandfather about everything. she was diagnosed about two years ago and takes aricept but i don't think it has any effect. &amp;nbsp;just today she broke her first bowl by throwing it against the sink, and for the first time refused to take her medication. she used to cook dinner for the whole family for decades but since last year, my grandfather has been taking care of everything. she will still go into the kitchen and start yelling and nitpicking at him for very minor and sometimes nonsensical reasons. for example, not wiping the stove while he's cooking at the same time or for using the wrong type of napkin. she literally looks for things to nitpick or makes something up to yell at him about. this behavior is normal though, as i've witnessed it my entire life, but it's several times worse now that she repeatedly verbally abuses my grandfather over the same thing multiple times a day/every day and completely lacks the cognition to reason through any conversation.&amp;nbsp;today, she picked up a pot lid and handed it to my grandfather for no reason while he was cooking. he didn't see or hear her so she throws it against the stove, frightening everyone. i removed her from the kitchen. she comes back and starts washing the dishes on her own and starts yelling about how she has to do everything in the house (we tell her frequently not to do many things around the house including washing the dishes, taking out the trash, etc), and breaks the bowl. after dinner i handed her some stomach medication and she threw it down the sink, saying she's almost going to die anyway. &amp;nbsp;anyway, tonight's episode was the worst and that's why i wanted to let it out and make a post. **my goal right now is to start a conversation with the rest of the family about what to do going forward and what sort of topics or options we need to explore in that conversation.** the question that comes to mind is - what are the next steps in preparation for long term care? i'm talking about legal things like wills, power of attorney?, anything that may need to be done while she is still ""there"". and i think we'll need a caretaker later on since my job keeps me out of the house 12 hours a day and my grandfather is getting old himself, though still mentally sharp. he's not going to be able to take care of her if she goes into the advanced stages. what are some options - in-home nurse? long-term care facility? at what point will she need to go under their care? she's still able to take care of herself right now, but i'm planning several years down the line and i'm totally clueless about where to begin. i'd like to do as much as i can to help, but since i'm at the start of my career and the lack of family availability in the area, it doesn't seem to be a feasible thing to do when she progresses into the advanced stages. i know it's a full-time job to be a caregiver and i wouldn't know what to do if it gets to that point. also any advice on these emotional outbursts would be appreciated. her whole life she was the caretaker of the family and refused to let anyone help her, but now i know she means well but she simply can't do it and she is reacting badly to that. thank you"," we have been taking care of my partners 78 year old mother for 6 years now. she's on year 13 of a very slow progression of alzheimer's. i just posted several of the tricks we use to make things easier on my post at the top of the sub. i hope that helps. probably the best advice i could give you at this point is not to argue with her. logic doesn't work with alzheimer's patients. you have to go to their world. if she asks you the same question over and over, don't remind her that she just asked you that. in her mind it's the very first time.  just go along with it and answer. at first it will drive you nuts but you'll get used to it.  the loss of independence can be very frustrating for the patient and it's important to let them feel like they are making some decisions. when your grandmother says she's doing everything in the house. just agree with her and offer to help her so she doesn't have to do everything.  going into her world will ease so much stress for everyone involved. i promise!!!

"because of unfortunate circumstances, 1.5 years ago my brother (now27m) and i (now22f) became the primary caretakers of my mother (now58f) with early onset alzheimer's. she's currently towards the end of stage 4. she lives with us full time and we have a hired caregiver who comes in and assists her when we're at school/work. the issue: mom loves sugar and anything unhealthy for her. since mom has moved in with us she's definitely gained a bit of weight (nothing drastic, just enough to be noticeable). this is likely because she's now in a situation where she can afford to eat out or stop for ice cream, whatever. we are happy to make mom happy. after all, it is the little things, right? the thing is, at first she had a good balance. we kept a veggie and fruit tray fully stocked in the fridge and she would eat as much of that as she would anything else. but now she's gotten to the point where it's the same each day. breakfast: sugar filled coffee, pop tarts or a different sugary pastry. one time i came in to find her dipping oreos in her coffee. lunch: a local sandwich shop. she gets one loaded with beef and cheese and dressing and requests and second one for dinner. dinner: second greasy sandwich from earlier. she drinks 3+ cokes a day. lots of sweet tea too. we'll try and encourage her to drink water but she gets mad at us and says she drinks it constantly and we don't know what we're talking about, so most days we just leave it be. my concern: her bad eating is going to create more health problems that will ultimately cause her more stress. my question: how hard do we push? is it worth trying to create healthy eating habits at this point or do we just let her enjoy her time?"," >my concern: her bad eating is going to create more health problems that will ultimately cause her more stress.probably, especially if you let this pattern continue because it's easier all round for it to continue.i wouldn't, for example, ever dip an oreo into coffee because i don't like oreos, but i might dip a different biscuit into a drink because i like the taste. there's nothing wrong with that, but eating too many biscuits one after the other won't do any good in the longer term.a little question - does she have problems with her teeth, is this why she seems to be preferring to eat softer food?>my question: how hard do we push? is it worth trying to create healthy eating habits at this point or do we just let her enjoy her time? of course it's worth it. do you have a family meal in the evening? if so, then why let her have just a sandwich when the rest of you are eating something that's both more nourishing and also nicer.drinks? if somebody offered me either a fizzy drink or water i'd probably take the fizzy drink because it tastes nicer. there's more to drinking than quenching a thirst. maybe offer fruit juices, or have a bit more choice - and reduce the number of fizzy drinks in the cupboard. somebody who drinks a lot of liquid will be filling themselves up with empty calories and 'feeling full' for a short time, but will soon feel hungry again - so will drink more, because it's the easiest way to feel full.diet in general is quite important, so is enjoying food. can you get the carer to take your mother to a different place for lunch, or at least to vary where she goes, so she has to choose something different?my mother in law is a lot older than your mother, and she has her meals delivered. her lunch is a hot meal, every day, and with a dessert. she really enjoys this. along with her lunch she has her 'tea' delivered. it's a sandwich, a savoury pastry, a cake, a piece of fruit, a yogurt or similar. all in all it's a fairly balanced diet, along with her toast and marmalade for breakfast, in fact it's a better diet than she was eating before because she was reluctant (unable) to prepare a decent cooked meal and often forgot to eat - part of her condition that she tried to hide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/68a83a/healthy_eating/,Healthy eating?

"hi all,to keep it short and simple...my godmother (63) for about three years has been slowly showing symptoms of alzheimers/dementia. her mother died from it and it runs in her family. it started out small with forgetfulness, but then got bigger very recently (last 4 months) with forgetting passwords, how to use facebook, (she's a computer whiz), as well as getting lost while driving. she also could not recall conversations and from further talking with new people in our life, she had been asking some bizarre questions like: ""did you know my dog when he was a puppy?""

"hey guys! i'm not sure if any of you can help, but i'm worried for my mom. i think she might be showing signs of alzheimers, but i'm not exactly sure.she is currently 52 years old and has fibromyalgia which, by the way, i have researched and it seems like it's still unknown whether it's real or not. lately she's been forgetting things. they're little, but i've been noticing it. whenever she forgets something she just blames ""fibro fog"". it's basically her scapegoat at this point for when she can't think of something right away.anyways, just a bit of back story. i am one of 3 siblings, and my parents are divorced. so as of right now, it's me, my mom, and my brother and sister living in a house together. my two siblings have jobs, and my mom does not as she was recently fired in january. i'm with her all day as i graduated from high school early and are waiting to go to college in the fall.now on to why i might think she has alzheimers. one of the first examples that is the most prevalent is that she frequently gets me and my siblings' names mixed up. she gets it after a second or two like she just misspoke, but i think this is worth mentioning just in case.in addition to this, i'm repeating my conversations with her quite a bit. i'll tell her something in the morning, then by night time i'll be telling her again. then again the next day.another small thing i noticed. our mom does all of our laundry because she doesn't trust us not to mess something up. because of this, she ends up sorting our clothes for us and has been doing this all our lives. she is also there whenever we buy clothes, and she is often the one to just buy clothes for us on her own. lately though she's been mixing up our clothing and asking me what's mine and what isn't. she's never done this before, so it raised a red flag.she also can never remember times or days no matter how much you repeat them. for instance, my brother has had the same work schedule for about a year and she still can't remember it. she also has to pick him up from work every single day, because she is the nobly one with a car in my family.just a specific example that has happened just this past week involves movie titles. she's been looking for a certain couple of movies for about a month now but can never remember the title correctly. we've told her the correct title every time, but she can never remember.she also will often not be able to finish her sentences. she'll have to wait a couple seconds before she gets her bearings again, and even then her sentences are full of mistakes and she mispronounces simple words occasionally. keep in mind the only language we speak is english. but all she ever says for all of these instances is ""it's my fibro fog"".if it matters, he father had alzheimers before he passed away about a year ago. i'm not sure if that gives her a predisposition to it or not!i'd bring it up to her, but i think it's a sensitive topic for her since her father passed fairly recently and also around the same time as her mom. i also feel like she might laugh and just tell me she's fine and that it's fibro fog, yet again.we are also not a family that goes to the doctor for a regular check up or anything. we normally only go if something is wrong, so she probably won't be going anytime soon.thank you for reading and helping! sorry for the long post, i'm just worried and wanted to include as much as possible."," my mom has alzheimer's and she has had it since she was 52, but diagnosed at 54. my sister was in hs at the time and i was just graduating college. my mom's dad died from it in his late 70's so i don't know how she got it so early.  i would definitely get her into a neurologist.  my mom kept denying anything was wrong so it will take a while to get her in, but you all have to keep pushing the issue. again, it could be something with her fibromyalgia, but i would rule out alzheimers as soon as possible.also, let me know if you ever want to talk about it! it's tough to go through especially at your age.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/62cr8t/worried_for_my_mother/,Worried for my mother

"i hope it's ok that i made a new account to post here.my husband is 61 and we've been married almost 35 years -- a good marriage, we've always said. i started noticing changes a couple years ago, but he's always been the scatterbrained professor type so i didn't really think anything of it (until i look back now)...and he attributed things to work stress, being tired, etc. about a year ago i began voicing my concerns and asking him to see a neurologist. he flat-out refused -- too busy, too much money, there's nothing wrong, etc. for what it's worth, we do ok financially and he *is* busy with work, but still. in the last six months or so, his demeanor has changed drastically. he has become paranoid, easily angered and frustrated, hostile and hateful towards me. he's accused me of ""scheming"" against him, trying to ""exploit"" him and steal ""his"" money, and gather ""ammunition"" to divorce him. this is *not* his mo at all and is nothing short of crazy talk. no amount of my trying to reassure him that i'm genuinely worried and that my concerns are coming from a place of love has made any difference. i tried reasoning with him, i tried humor and, yes, i even got downright insistent and belligerent about it. all to no avail.  i finally called our two sons and asked if they would try to convince him to get evaluated (which felt like betrayal, but at that point i didn't care). they did and he agreed (vehemently denying the things he said to me above), but he never said anything to me about it (and had previously said that if he went to the dr., he would not allow me to go with him). i found out the name of the dr. and called her to share my concerns. i told her my husband said that i couldn't go with him, but that i told him i would be calling her and didn't have a problem with her telling him i did so (so as to not feed further into the paranoia). she told me that he filled out their on-line forms and listed me as the emergency contact, but specifically said that she was not to share his medical information with me. i found out (through the oldest son) that an mri has been ordered. i also found out that the dr. deemed my husband competent to make his own medical decisions. other than that, i have no idea what transpired and when i ask my husband, i get a blank stare in response.my husband still works full-time in a very technical and high-pressure job. i can't believe they haven't noticed changes, too, but i don't really know his co-workers and certainly none of them have called me to express any concern. he still drives (and has gotten turned around a couple times on a familiar route when i've been with him). again, excuses: he was tired, it was dark, it was foggy, etc.maybe i'm putting the cart before the horse because a diagnosis hasn't been made yet, but i feel in my gut that there's definitely something very wrong here. i think i know dementia when i see it, yet i'm still hoping against hope that i'm wrong. i suppose it could be a brain tumor or something else much less sinister, but i'm trying to wrap my head around this and be proactive. at this point, i feel like my hands are tied and i'm at a total loss. whatever ""it"" is, it looks and sounds like alzheimers to me...so i ask: can anyone offer any suggestions to open the lines of communication? some approach i haven't thought of? something (anything!) to convince my husband that i'm on his side and i only want to help?? if this is ad, then i get it that i may be expecting too much. i just want to try everything possible to advocate for my husband in any way i can. i appreciate your reading this and i will be so grateful for any advice you may have to offer. thank you."," late to this topic, but he needs a thorough workup.  many things can present this way.  a few include b12 deficiency, thyroid disease, uti, depression & normal pressure hydrocephalus (water on the brain).  point being, he needs to have all these treatable conditions ruled out so whatever it is can be addressed.  there are a few dementias that can also present with primarily psychiatric symptoms, including frontotemporal dementia & lewy body dementia.  both of these can cause the paranoia and moodiness you describe.  but again, these are just possibilities in a long list.  best of luck to you both.

"my father is 75 and my mother is 73. my mother has mid to late stage alzheimers. she is in remission stage 4 breast cancer in 2012. unrelated to her cancer care she has a very serious fear of hospitals and doctors and will not get a checkup. they live together and my father is the sole caregiver. the problem is my father had a mild stroke in september last year and was in the hospital for five days. it turns out he is doing well now with mild post stroke symptoms. he has since returned to work four hours a day monday thru friday. anyway, my fathers stroke was a wake up call for my family to have to rush to pick up the pieces at thier home. my father is private person and refuses to accept any help regardless of situation. my father was not able to refuse our help. me and my brother and sister spent two weeks at thier home cleaning, fixing, installing new dishwasher, refrigerator.my mother does not recognise my father as her husband, doesnt recognise her home of 30 years. she does not stay in the same room and has declared her room off limits we found my mother is not well taken care of. he leaves her alone in the house for 4-5 hours every weekday. she is prepared food ,whatever​ my father makes. he washes some of her clothes and cleans around the kitchen if he can. back in september 2016 we all found out my mother had not  been showered or bathed in many weeks or if at all. her room was not cleaned, sheets not changed regularly and she had a pile of garbage next to her bed. she had rodents. she is not heathy, likely diabetic, likey high blood pressure, signs of asthma or allergy to dust/mold. she has swollen painful legs and feet, fungus on bottom of her feet. my father was pressured by family to find a doctor and get an appointment for my mother. he had her assessed by a visiting nurse in november but did not follow thru with a doctor.  my mother gets verbally and physically violent when she is told she is to see a doctor. he did get his estate in order, create power of attorney of my mother, hipa, wills and a irrevocable trust.my father had agreed to hire a cleaning service to visit but never arranged. he said he doesnt trust people coming in the house. he said he would hire an aid for mom but didnt arrange that either.my mother should be in 24-7 care. my brother, sister and i are wondering what to do. what can we do?", not sure if this is state specific but adult protective services or elder services can be called. i know it doesn't seem fair to your father but its necessary at this point. your father cannot take care of her and she should be on medication to help with the violent outbursts. any facility she goes to will put her on something to help stabilize moods. it must be very hard for him and some emotional therapy may help although it doesn't sound like he would be receptive. this sucks and i hate this disease. so sorry you and your family have to go through this. good luck. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5xeulv/75_year_old_husband_is_sole_caregiver_for_73_year/,75 year old Husband is Sole caregiver for 73 year old wife

"sometimes it's good to vent and let off steam, which is really all i'm doing in this post. i can't scream out loud, it'd wake the neighbours.please feel free to add your own gripes - get those complaints off your chest.when my mil moved to be nearer us it was because the relationship with one of her children (the one she was living near) had broken down. she moved into 'independent living' accommodation, same as she was in before, but in retrospect it was all a terrible mistake.the 'child' she was living near may have had some inkling of her problems but they didn't share anything because, well, the siblings don't share much at all thanks to their toxic 'play them off against each other' upbringing. all we had from her were complaints about being neglected and, in the end, that she couldn't do any shopping (so had no food), hated the people she was living amongst (they're rude and mean, bang on her door when they know she would be in the bathroom) and she desperately wanted to move.when we visited her (which was often, despite the distance) she seemed okay but a bit frail - understandable due to her age - we had no real idea that she was such a good liar. it seems so callous to say this about an old lady (old ladies are meant to be sweet and to smell of roses) but she is, and always has been, manipulative and has always, up until now, been able to get exactly what she wants.i wish to goodness we had known the truth and/or that the 'child' she was living near had spoken to us a bit more, because within days of helping her move we realised that something was very wrong and, when she was taken to register with gp and he gave her a mini- mental-state assessment, it became clear that she had serious memory problems. we tried to tell ourselves it wasn't true, but those scales fell from our eyes very quickly.the first year we just about coped, in between work commitments etc, then there was a crisis that meant she had to have company almost all day, every day, for months and months whilst the 'authorities' got their act together. it was utterly exhausting, and we had not a single shoulder to cry on thanks to the way she has always played her children and other relatives off against each other.she was seen quite quickly by one group who made recommendations and gave her things to use, but it took almost half a year before we got a social worker to see her and before we could get the adult mental health team involved. during that time she got to 'feel better' because her diet dramatically improved - because we were taking her plated meals etc. every day. because of this she rejected all the assistance aids that the first group had given her, and made us get rid of them.almost overnight she let us know, vociferously, that she didn't trust us, that there were people in the complex who were rude to her so she refused to even attempt to socialise - even though, for example, she had paid for the christmas entertainment. in short she was back in exactly the situation she had moved from except now she was in our care rather than somebody else's - and my goodness, weren't the others delighted. they were so delighted that it took them two years to bother to visit her, and then they only managed to stay for three hours.we've reached the stage where she will no longer accept any support from us, in fact she doesn't even want to see us - although she isn't shy of making toxic phone calls at random times during the day; calls that are so toxic they make my other-half cry.she tells other members of the family how unpleasant we are to her - thank goodness they don't believe her because they are now aware of her condition, but it is hard to take.she has meals delivered daily; there are visiting carers to make sure she takes her medication and who should help with personal care but she rejects it. recent assessment, during which she was compus mentis enough to tell lies, has resulted in her being put at the bottom of the list for moving to a place with on-site support. she told the assessor she bathes daily, does her own laundry, is content, never bored, never lonely, sleeps fine etc etc - and that's what got written down - with the result that it's been concluded that she is 'safe' where she is and doesn't need additional care.you'd think, wouldn't you, that these so-called experts would be able to see through the charade and chip away at the scripted conversation. you'd think that they would stay long enough to hear the repetition, the raised voice and clenched fists and swinging arms when things don't go as planned and they might even check things like a new bathroom to see that some facilities still have their protective film, so have never been used - even though she says otherwise. but no, they walk in and write a few things down on a bit of paper and walk out again. paper goes into a file and will only ever get looked at if they have to see this 'client' again.so here we have an old lady who has alzheimer's who is now telling everybody she is moving to a nice new place, yet she's scuppered her chances because she can still tell lies, and we're even more evil than before because it's us who must have said something to 'the man' who came to talk about moving - because she was sure she would be in the new place by now yet she isn't.it does make me want to scream!", this was my grandmother. it's so hard. thank you for sharing. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5x7wu2/letting_off_steam_thread/,"""Letting off Steam"" thread ..."

"my sister and i are struggling with what to do for or about  our father, who we believe has early dementia, and is far away.first, it is important to note that his mother had alzheimers and i, his son, are at medium risk according to a 23andme test.here is a brief description of his symptoms as we see them:1) we suspect he has a porn addiction based on what we've seen on his computer and ipad, and that his ""interests"" have gone in some very disturbing directions 2) he fell for the scam where a beautiful, young women he met online from ghana wants to come live with him, and just needs $7,000 to get a ticket...he sent the money3) his public facebook posts to beautiful, young, scantily clad women that are a bit embarassing and have resulted in many of his closest friends and family unfriending himin all cases, the dementia comes in in the state of denial. when confronted about number one and three above, he says we have misunderstood him, and that his ""interactions"" with these women on facebook and the porn websites are part of his research for a new book. when we ask him to please explain, he tries but can never really get to his point.the situation is complicated by the fact that our father lives very far away from us (he's on the east coast, and we are in europe and the west coast).so my real question is what can we do to help him from afar? he says his doctors say he is fine, but i don't know whether to believe him. should i tell his physician about our suspicions? can the physician tell us anything about it due to confidentiality? do we have any legal rights if we need to use them?any help is much appreciated."," please take all of this with a grain of salt, but my father has fairly advanced alzheimers and i understand how hard it is to deal with. this sounds closer to symptoms of getting older and more senile than symptoms of alzheimers. i'm obviously not a doctor, but the best way to describe my disagreements with an alzheimer's parent is that the world's most straightforward task is now an incredibly puzzling, frustrating and embarrassing endeavor. my dad wanted to call the fire department because he forgot how to change a lightbulb...that was working. due to the embarrassment, he's usually adamant about his viewpoint even if proven wrong - in their mind, they really are right because they've convinced themselves of it.i know ""senile"" and ""alzheimers"" tend to be interchangeable sometimes, but the key difference here is that you aren't legally allowed to make decisions for your dad if he's not deemed to be far enough along on the memory loss spectrum (in my experience...he needs to get about 80-90% there; to the point where daily hygiene is confusing). it is incredibly hard to get legal rights to manage the next steps for your parent. i'm running into that now.the best advice i got for these circumstances is to ask people in the area to drop by and say hello. literally anybody. friend, family, church, whatever. given that there's a monetary risk with him being online, i'd also alert his caretaker and see if you can be put as the account holder for his credit cards (only works if you have shared accounts). as for facebook...i've seen that a lot. try and figure out his password and change his privacy settings so that stuff doesn't get published. this sounds sad, but in a few years he may be at a point where you can just lock him out of the account and he won't notice.i'm saddened to hear about what you're going through and hope you and your sister find a good way to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5wbsof/request_for_advice_on_helping_potentially/,Request for advice on helping potentially demented father from afar

"do you ever lie to person with alzheimers you are caring for? i do. not all the time, and not just to make my life easier. but if it's a choice between my mom's well being and telling her the truth, i will always choose the former. my mom is in the early to mid stage of her disease, and can be extremely obstinate - especially when it comes to issues around her independence (highly relatable i am sure). she is now at the stage where she is no longer safe to drive - and i know her doctor will take her license away the next time she visits him. i don't want this to happen. it's already hard enough to get her to go see the doctor and i know that if he's the one that takes this piece of independence from her that her co-operation with her care will break down even further.but also cannot, in good conscience, allow her to continue to drive...so i told her that her car had to go in for repairs and left it at a neighbours to see what would happen. she's barely missed it, and only asks after it occasionally (i've been stringing her along for months with tales of waiting for parts). friends have picked up the slack with rides to activities and she's started using the shuttle bus at the assisted living facility she lives in for grocery and bank runs. so i told her yesterday that there was bad news about the car and that it will be very expensive to fix. she thought about it and her response was very positive, 'don't worry, i don't really need it anymore anyway - let's just get rid of it'. result! or you would think so...my aunt is very upset with me. she's angry that i've been lying to my mother and that i've 'put her in it' by sharing that with her. i explained to my aunt that her sister simply is not capable of taking certain things in, and engaging in battles of will over things like driving is counterproductive. i also explained that it's important to me that i can be honest with family about what is going on so that there can never be any question about my motives. the last thing i want people thinking is that i am somehow scamming my mother out of her car. i can understand where my aunt is coming from, but i also can't help but see it as being selfish. she doesn't want to be a ""liar"" - fair enough. but for me, my mother's well being is more important. and my mom no longer has the cognitive ability to understand her own condition or process information well. why torture and humiliate her by engaging in a conflict that she can only loose? we lie to children when we know that there are certain truths they are not ready to hear. and unlike a child, my mother's ability to understand and accept is only going to go down. obviously this is a search for validation on my part. but i would also really like to hear some other perspectives on this, and whether there are other ways i could be approaching issues like this. thanks!"," my mother-in-law is in moderate stage, with signs of being close to late stage. i initially wanted to say we lie to her all the time, but that's not exactly true. we do change the subject often, and have had to stretch the truth and lie on occasion. part of alzheimer's is they just can't reason anymore, and even if you do convince them, they will forget.on driving, for instance: her vision has been affected by the disease and she can barely find the bathroom by herself, but every so often she'll bring up wanting to drive again. she's convinced at this point that there's nothing wrong with her. we just change the subject. as for your aunt, wanting to have a confrontation. like i said, we've convinced her of things being in her best interest, but time goes by and she'll just go back to her original opinion. it's really not worth the argument.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5vupgz/am_i_wrong_to_lie_to_my_mother/,Am I wrong to lie to my Mother?
"wasn't sure how to ask this. but my 60 year old father recently brought up to me that he's been watching dr. who on his computer, and he prefers watching it at a slightly slower speed setting (almost unnoticeably slow, but still). and he's worried that this change in his perception preference might just be getting old, or if it has something to do with alzheimer's, which we have a family history of (his mother and one of his brothers). is, this, a common thing for alzheimer's sufferers to prefer? or just something weird that he has no reason to worry about? i do notice he has very minor memory problems, but given his age, i don't know if i need to be worried about him just yet."," this alone - i wouldn't worry about.  if he suddenly lost interest in watching it without explanation - maybe that.  but if there is a history, keep an eye out for more of a pattern.  i actually clicked on this thread because i thought you were asking about something i noticed with my mom...well, only in retrospect do i see this as part of the alz coming on.  not perceiving speed correctly, as well as distance/direction of other vehicles.  i was driving her through a city we were visiting and made a semi-fast but nowhere near dangerous left turn (everyone was going around 40mph maybe).  there was a car a safe distance away from us but approaching.  my mom had a very very out of proportion reaction: shouting, throwing her arms up in the air and lifting up her outside leg as if to try to avoid a massive impact.  we were, of course, always safe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5vu1uy/perception_of_speed_and_alzheimers/,[deleted by user]
"my father, who has fairly late stage alzheimers, had a stroke on sunday. my mother decided to wait two days to tell me because she didn't know the details. just as well because i was out of state at a drunken irish birthday party and wouldn't have been much use anyways. he's relatively okay despite everything and is still able to speak and just numb on his right side. he should have gotten out of the hospital yesterday if all went as planned.to be honest, i too feel numb. it just depresses me watching my father, who is almost 90, fade away like this. he's pretty well taken care of and i'm just the secondary guardian. but this just *sucks*. (no response is really necessary. i'm just venting i suppose.)"," oh man, i'm so sorry to hear this. we each are watching our loved ones fade away, but it's heartbreaking to hear of such events happen in such a shocking way.i genuinely hope your father recovers without too much damage. still, it breaks my heart to hear such news.stay strong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5vlbym/dad_had_a_stroke_this_past_weekend/,Dad had a stroke this past weekend...
"last night, my wife and i made an apple pie.together, we peeled the apples. she helped put the sugar, flour, cinnamon into the bowl of apples. i prepared the pie-pan with the dough, and she poured the apple mix into it. she then used the fork to prepare the edges of the pie.we then together slathered *manteca* (butter) on the top of the pie, and she tossed sugar and cinnamon on top.when we eat the pie together, she is *so proud* that she made the pie.what are other things folks can do together to make the sufferer to be proud of things done?"," great idea to do baking! are there more baking/cooking projects you could do? there are also man simple craft projects you could do as gifts for people. silk flower arrangement, painting bird feeders etc. try visiting a crafts store and asking suggestions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/5vi7rj/things_to_do_together/,Things to do together?

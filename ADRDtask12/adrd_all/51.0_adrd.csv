"after a long day of napping, my grandmother woke up and decided to curse the sitter out for not doing anything all day (how could she, her client was alseep). i gave her some options for dinner, she picked one, i got it, she ate 3 bites and insisted she would eat more of it later (she says this every meal and never wants it later).about an hour later i asked if she was ready for her evening medicine and she said she wanted dinner so i asked if she wanted me to reheat it. which came with a long lecture about how awful the food was and how she couldn't understand why i would bring her something so terrible (she asked for it). i offered to go buy another dinner and she ate 3 more bites of that one.fast forward 2 hours, we spend 30 minutes arguing about medicine and i tell her i'm going to bed. about 15 minutes later she asks me to bring her a coke. i get the coke and she says ""i guess that's all i can get since the kitchen is closed because the cook was too tired,"" so i asked her if she was hungry.that's when the wheels fell off. if i was ""too stupid to know that somebody talking about food was hungry then i'm just as stupid as these lazy n**** you keep sending over here to vex me."" etc, etc. all for simply asking if she was hungry. i realize it was obvious, but she was talking at the air and not to me so i asked rather than jump right to what do you want. i wish i just stayed in bed.i try not to take it personally, it's just the disease, etc. but it's so freaking hard to have insults rained on you out of no where after jumping through hoops of fire to get exactly what someone wants. i spent over $25 on two dinners that barely got eaten and got called stupid to boot! there is no winning. ever. everything i say is wrong. the sitters are all lazy. the doctor's don't know what they're doing. it is exhausting."," with my dad his memory loss was profound, but his personality has never really changed. with my grandma her memory is holding on decently most days, but it is bringing out worst of her worst personality traits. just one of those odd things about the disease.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/urffqa/can_i_vent/,Can I vent?
"i know it’s the dementia or idk if part of it is dementia or if most of it is really him? he gets insanely jealous when my mom leaves his sight for longer than 3 mins. she could be sitting right next to him, but if he doesn’t see her he starts calling then he makes up excuses to keep her there or he’ll say he’s hungry, but when she leaves to fix his food, he forgets and then thinks she’s outside talking to another man. today, i pushed her to get out of the house and have lunch with an aunt because mom really needed a break from him. well, an hour in and he started again. he says “she’s been gone all day” when she barely just left. from then on he says i should call everyone that mom was with the other night (a family dinner we all attended) to confirm if she was there. 5 mins later he demands i get in the car, call my siblings and go together to hunt down my mom. just a few mins ago he called mom a “whore” and i corrected him. also reminded him mom was with aunty x and he called aunty x a whore too, then called their whole family a bunch of whores. i didn’t know whether to laugh or throw him with something. 🙄😆anyway, he is trying to get up now and make his own way outside even though he can’t walk. i’m so fucking annoyed right now and wanna just be a little violent with him (i won’t ofc). wishing i had some nyquil to knock him tf out. what do y’all do when your person is agitated and behaves like a violent monster?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ure0ny/my_dad_is_being_a_real_jack_ass_and_its_pissing/,My dad is being a real jack ass and it’s pissing me off.

"i don't even know where to begin. my dad (76) has dementia. i finally made the hardest decision to place him in memory care. i researched facilities, visited and looked for signs of abuse, got a list of questions to ask, and got a new job to afford to supplement his savings. i thought i found the perfect fit. the nurse that came to do his assessment agreed that they would be a good fit. i moved him in and started a three-month-long nightmare. **tldr**: the people who were supposed to help me and give my dad the care that i could not provide kicked him out with no notice, and now he has nowhere safe to live. he was baker acted (in fl) for behavior issues within the first month. the police took him to a facility that didn't know how to manage dementia patients and that facility dropped him off in the er after the mandatory 72hrs. he was in the hospital for days, drugged up and nonresponsive because no medical information was shared with the hospital, and i was not told he was admitted.by the second month, they started complaining about his hygiene. he was not bathing and refused to let them bathe him. they ""tried everything."" by the third month, they were calling me daily, at all hours, complaining about his ""violent"" and ""aggressive"" behaviors. i became anxious every time my phone rang (11pm, 1am, 3am, 6am, 8am). they also sent him to the er multiple times for a ""time out"" and so that the hospital could verify it wasn't a uti. the medical bills are still rolling in. (side note, who the f\*ck in the united states sends people to the er as a time out??? that's not sustainable or affordable for anyone! and three visits in one month at that?!)on may 11th, i got a phone call at 10am that they were discharging my dad and i had three days to remove him and his belongings, which is usually a 45-day notice. they would also not be refunding the remainder of the month, they would not be returning my community fee, and we are blackballed from moving to any of their sister properties in our city (there are 7 of them, and 5 of them have memory care). the amount of fear, anger, stress, anxiety, frustration, and all the other negative feelings i have? i am distraught and am not medicated enough for this. the facility was supposed to help me find a new home for him, and every place they recommended has no availability. i reached out to my eap through work, and they found some facilities. i also reached out to ""a place for mom"" to get more help. i reached out to prior facilities that i toured, and they either have no availability, or he needs to be admitted into the hospital to be medicated. i don't know where i'm going with this post. i guess i just want to let you all know that memory care facilities will sell you a dream and give you a nightmare. i thought my biggest issues would be elder abuse and covid-19. turns out, it's a lack of training, sharing resources between assisted living and memory care with no additional training, resource shortages in caregiving, and no psychiatrists on site. now my poor, miserable, ""violent"" father doesn't know what is going on, has been manhandled by police and staff more times than i could possibly know, and has no place safe to go. i can't help but feel like this was all my fault. maybe he would have been better at home? maybe i should tell my husband adios and live with my dad full time? maybe i should have vetted the organization more? maybe i needed to spend $7000 a month or more instead of the ""deal"" of $5000? my dad turned 76 on may 14th. instead of spending his birthday surrounded by family and friends, he spent it in a geriatric psych ward that i placed him in. the hospital staff says he's so gentle and kind. i hate this."," i would love to know where you are located & which facility this was as i am searching right now. if you can pm someday, please do. i’m so sorry you and your dad had to go through this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/urae1v/memory_care_has_failed_me/,Memory Care has failed me

"hey all,my mom has started keeping spoiled food and she yells at me and has a fit when i tell her i'm throwing it out. she has been drinking milk that went sour on 5/9 according to the label (and smell, obviously)...i told her it was expired and she said no it isn't, i just opened it today (5/16) so i showed her the label as said ""yes it is, you're drinking spoiled milk"" and then dumped it out. clearly this wasn't the best tactic on my part and i feel guilty but i don't want her getting sick. she got mad and went back to the tv.would it cause her more distress if i threw things out without her knowledge? i want to keep her in the loop because she is semi-independent but i've been working nights and even though i pay a cna to come a couple times a week to just spend time with her, i'm worried she may eat something moldy eventually if i'm not there. the cna says in her experience elderly people tend to keep old food ""just in case"".another issue is that she will make a dish one day, forget she did, eat something else, then i'll find her cooking that and dish again the next day. i tell her ""you just made that yesterday, why are you making it again"" and she'll just say ""no i didn't"" so then i show her the container from the fridge and she gets frustrated and says ""i never made that"". again, poor tactics on my end but i don't know how else to show her. plus it's a massive waste of food.i know it's my responsibility to monitor this stuff but i need the extra money as a financial stop gap measure until i get back into my professional career. the food waste is one thing, but her getting food poisoning is worse. i know as her primary caretaker i should be on top of this better, and i have been but with this job it's harder. have any of you experienced this food issue?"," one thing you will learn is that logic has no place here (dementia word). it’s hard to let go of that, i know. trying to be logical or debate with a loved one with dementia gets you nowhere and makes them agitated. you have to come to grips with kind lying. it took me a while to see that. just clean out the fridge regularly..preferably when she’s not around to see you doing it to avoid arguments. knowing she’s not keeping track means you’ll have to keep a closer eye on things. but just do it. trying to get into a discussion using logic is a waste of time. their brains don’t work that way anymore. with making the same thing over and over…let it go. you have to pick you battles. a little food waste is probably not worth getting her all agitated and upset.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ur3m63/spoiled_food/,Spoiled Food?

"my grandpa (80yo) has alzheimer’s and recently got disability. the family dog of 11 years recently was euthanized (by recently i mean in march), he was really sick and had tumors all over his body. at first when my grandma told him the dog has passed away he cried a lot but at least accepted it. now he frequently blames my grandma for kicking the dog out, wants the front doors to be unlocked because he believes that the dog will come back, everytime we’re out somewhere, he says that he needs to go home to feed the dog and take it on a walk. this has impacted my grandma greatly because she gets all the blame for literally anything, he would shout and curse at her, at some times threatening to beat her. we are not putting him in a home, he’s already seen a psychiatrist and is on meds. is there anything else we can do? i know it’s hard on him, but it breaks my heart to see my grandma suffer from it as they live alone and we don’t have the space to take them in (a two bedroom apartment)."," 1. maybe say the dog moved to live somewhere else, think what you might tell a small child whose pet dies. well you should probably teach your kid what death is but you know what i mean. 2. distract and redirect him. talk about something else he’s passionate about. 3. this is going to sound silly but give him a plush dog toy he can keep with him. it might help to fill the hole in his heart and calm him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uq8t4r/my_grandpa_doesnt_remember_his_dog_dying_and/,My grandpa doesn’t remember his dog dying and keeps shouting at my grandma for kicking the dog out

(her own mother has dementia) she told me that it may be due to lack of sodium. then later diverted the topic saying she might just be under too much stress due the family conditions. additionally my mother has knee problems which is being treated by physiotherapy. if not treatable she would have to undergo surgery which would involve full body anesthesia, i've heard that it only accelerates dementia. she also has varicose veins in knee (dont know if it helps), she is relatively very young, and i don't really know whether it really is dementia.any advice on how to prepare my mind for upcoming events would be appreciated. i am hoping it this might just not be related to dementia.", w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uq3jo6/i_am_scared/,I am scared.

"my dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate alzheimers in december 2021 after memory clinic assessment and review of brain scans from sept 2021. we informed the dvla of this in december 2021 and have received a holding letter to apologise for the delay in their reaction to whether it’s okay for my father to continue driving. my mother and i do not feel her is safe to drive, he had an accident in august 2021 which was entirely his fault, his reactions are not what they were and the mobility in his legs is effected (he shuffles a lot and gets cramps in his leg muscles) and of course we informed the memory clinic nurse of our worries discreetly. as i’m sure is the case with a lot of men in their mid/late seventies who have just received this diagnosis, he says he feels no different at all and gets very defensive when we try to discuss his diagnosis and we think he hasn’t got a full grasp on what his diagnosis means (due to the condition, no doubt). today, he received a letter from the consultant at the same memory clinic to say that he will be having a telephone assessment (due to covid) regarding his ability to continue driving. has this been the case for other people, he is of course going to tell the consultant and the memory clinic that he feels that he is fine to drive?! does anyone uk based know if this is normal? he was just starting to get used to my mother being the driver and we’re desperately worried that if the nhs/dvla tell him that he’s okay to continue driving based upon a telephone (how can they make this assessment on the phone?) it was become a huge source of conflict if we try to stop him. any uk based experience similar to this with dvla/nhs would be greatly appreciated."," we’re sort of going through this at the moment with my grandad. he’s 93 (i think? or maybe 92) and if we’re completely honest shouldn’t have been driving for several years but no one ever took the plunge. he fell at the start of lockdown in 2020 and has fallen several times since then, each time making the dementia worse and his mobility now is at the point where he can barely walk 5 meters with a walking frame.i finally but the bullet and reported him to the dvla a couple of months back, although no one in my family knows i did it. i felt very strongly that i shouldn’t have to be the one to make that call given my dad and my aunt are both around and more involved but they both stuck to the line of thinking that he couldn’t get out ti the car so why did it matter.nana has now received a letter with a form to fill out to renew his license but he refuses to even accept the idea of not insuring the car this year, despite it costing over £500 (assuming he could even get insurance) and he is totally convinced that he will drive it again any day. i think nana is leaning towards just not filling it in and not telling him, with the proviso of hiding the keys etc.as far as i know the form includes needing a doctor to certify they are safe to drive? would it be an option for you to talk to his doctor about your concerns?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/upffi2/dvlanhs_in_the_uk_what_has_been_your_experience/,DVLA/NHS IN THE UK?

"my dad's memory has been failing for several years, and he often repeats stories, fixates on specific things, and other usual early-stage dementia stuff.his initial diagnosis was alzheimers + lewy body. my sister is a dementia care coach and has worked with seniors with dementia for decades (and lives with my parents!), so this was a hard diagnosis for us. we know well the alzheimers journey, and the added complications of lewy body.as things have settled down a bit after the initial diagnosis (and a stress-induced hallucinatory episode that was very scary), and my dad is still the sweet, kind, generous man he has always been ... just with a lot of frustration over his diminished intellectual capacity and memory loss.a week ago we did a follow up meeting with his brain doctors, and they have altered his diagnosis to alzheimers with evidence of minor vascular dementia, but no lewy body.while vascular dementia is no cakewalk, it is a major relief over the lewy body diagnosis!! this is a big win, a relief, and a diagnosis that is not as scary. the potential personality changes possible with lewy were very concerning, since my dad has always been a hugely loving, kind, and generous man.there are not a lot of ""high points"" in the dementia journey, but today, this is a win for us.", every win matters. i’m so happy for you and wish you all well! cheers! 🤗,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uo6b65/some_earlystage_dementia_reliefgood_news/,Some early-stage dementia relief/good news

"hi friends,i am caring for my 71yo father who has been diagnosed with lewy body dementia. he was taking seroquel for about two weeks while waiting for insurance approval for nuplazid. he hated the side effects — said it made him physically slow and exhausted. we switched to the nuplazid a week ago and he says it makes him feel “crazy.” can anyone share any person anecdotes about their loved one’s experience taking nuplazid? more back information for those interested: he has been having “cognitive issues” for about two years, worsening significantly in times of stress (like when my mom was having surgery for example, but has otherwise been manageable). after my mom died suddenly in december things really took a turn for the worst and he has been declining rapidly. finally convinced him to see a neurologist twomonths ago who diagnosed him. he lives by himself in our family home which is across the country from where i live. i have no siblings, so i’ve been traveling back and forth frequently to get things in order for him but it’s becoming rapidly apparent that he is not capable of living alone nor is the isolation good for him. vivid hallucinations started maybe three weeks ago and he went from understanding they were hallucinations to now being insistent that the people living in his house are real. (i have very much stepped inside his world with him, but other family members are still trying to correct him, which is upsetting for both of us.)"," bearing in mind that this is my personal anecdote, sure. my dad had ldb and we found that nuplazid did a far better job of controlling the delusions and hallucinations than seroquel. we tried seroquel for the month his neuropsych recommended, but it didn't seem to affect the psychotic symptoms. it just made him sleepy, and then he napped, and then he woke up crazier.ymmv. obviously the symptoms and responses are very individual. i feel like i should warn you that the nuplazid eventually stopped working - i think the brain damage progressed past where the meds could do anything. but it bought us a good eight months of relative peace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uns6i9/nuplazid/,Nuplazid
"friday i got a call from my cousin that my uncle (70) was admitted to the small local hospital this week and then was transported to our state university hospital in their brain and spine division. this was because my cousin noticed very unusual behavior from him during a phone call (saying he didnt reply to the text because he didnt know how to text.... which he has texted for years among other things) pending results of several tests, we believe this is the start of dementia. it seems fairly rapid because he didn't show signs 3 months ago. i am very close with my uncle after his wife passed about 4 years ago. i drove down and visited him and spent several hours with him in the hospital.  i would say about 85% of the conversation was normal. the few unusual things i noticed:1. he struggled with numbers. he confused my address, some quantity of things, was confused when i was talking money numbers, ect.2. he told the nurse that he and i fished together all the time, but we never have (we have planned on doing it soon  but we didn't get to because of this)3. he would tell stories or express violence in the story, which wasn't like him (example: ""i just wanted to choke him like this""so far this has been difficult and i know the road ahead is even more so. where do i begin really? i don't know what is appropriate for me to say. do we let him know he might be having memory issues? do i never correct him if he gets things wrong? what do i do to help? what should i prepare myself for emotionally?any good advice or resources? thank you"," it’s not an easy conversation and it’s natural that he may be defensive, angry or even in denial that anything is wrong.here is the best way to let him know you have concerns:• firstly, plan when you are going to have the conversation. timing is key. make sure it’s when you’re both at your best.• choose the right environment. somewhere quiet and comfortable is key.• decide in advance what you are going to say.• gently express that you are concerned about them because he hasn't been himself lately. don’t say it in a critical or accusing way – otherwise he may become defensive. use a gentle tone of voice.• be aware of your body language when having the conversation.• you can start by saying that you are worried about his memory and ask if he has the same concerns. he may deny that anything is wrong. if this happens, don’t argue with him but give specific examples of things that have happened lately to cause concern.• be ready for any reaction. he may be angry, upset, confused or frightened. he may be pleased or relieved, or he may be embarrassed. if he reacts angrily, leave it and try again another day.• let him know you are there to help and that you want to make sure he is ok.• if he does open up about concerns he has, ask him what he has been finding difficult lately and where he thinks he needs help.• try to put yourself in his shoes.• don’t be prescriptive and say you think he has dementia.this resource may be helpful to you as well: [guide to understanding dementia behaviors](",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uns1af/where_do_i_begin_to_help_my_uncle_and_to_help_me/,Where do I begin to help my uncle and to help me through this process?

"i need to vent - please do your best to not judge me. i promise i'm trying...i (30m) have been taking care of my mom (69 - nice) since march of 2021. i love my mom, but i've never really liked her as a person. she is very quick to anger, has no patience, has no understanding of most things in life. she's very loud, obnoxious, no understanding of privacy, rude to strangers, etc.. i moved out of her house at the ripe age of 15 because her and i just didn't get along. constant fighting and screaming. i moved to a different city at 19 (she followed me) and got married at 21. during my marriage my now ex wife and her never really got along. due to that my mother and i didn't spend much time together. since my divorce(2020), i knew she (my mom) was lonely and could tell her health was declining, so i offered her to move in with me. i sold my house a little over a month ago because the housing market was so hot, and purchased some land out in the country and am building a house. i already bought her a tiny home that will also be going on my property because the goal is for me to still be readily available to her, but i need my own space, as does she.we are currently staying in the tiny house together on the property of the people who sold it to us (very thankful for them or we would be in a much rougher situation). its her, me, and 5 cats... in a 500 sq ft house. i have no one. i have 2 friends but they are long distance. i have 0 relatives. it's just me and her.  over the passed few months her lack of memory has worsened substantially. i answer the same questions 30 to 50 times a day. i have to do literally everything and everything is my fault. internet going slow? let's scream and throw laptops and blame me for putting her in this situation.i wanted to get moved before her condition got to a point to where i couldn't manage it alone, make it to where we didnt have a mortage and our over all expenses were almost non existent so i could focus on her. i thought i was doing the right thing. but everyday for the passed month it's just all my fault. i can't do anything right. i of course know this isn't true, but man is it affecting me. i have untreated bi polar depression which makes it a little tougher but i manage it myself. i try my best to stay strong but sometimes i leave the house to go do laundry and just sit and cry. we are only in the beginning stages of this and it's already unbearable. idk how i can continue like this. i know my circumstances will improve once my house is built and we each have our own space.i understand what she is going through is terrible, and i know she's afraid, but dude... im just one guy and i'm doing my best to remain patient, positive, and helpful but my motivation is quickly fading. i'm building a resentment inside me that feels so unfair to her. i'm starting to snap back at her and frankly, my patience tank is on empty. she just was never really that good of a person or a loving mom, and this disease is making it so much worse, but shes still my mom. i'm a good person and a good son. i want to be. i aim to be. but this situation is making me feel like a pos and idk what i'm doing. i don't have kids. i would never want them because i'm not made for that... and this is like having a giant kid, but the future isn't them growing up and doing their own thing... the future is dark, scary, lonely, and hollow. the entire reason im doing any of this is because i want to spend time with her. i know our time together is limited and i want to make memories since we never really got to when i was younger. i want to take her fishing, i want to take her sight seeing and go for walks around the lake. i want to make her smile and laugh. but there isnt much of that happening... its just complaints, demands, and negativity.i promise i'm trying...if you made it to the end of this, thank you for taking the time to read it. advice is welcome, but i mostly just needed to get that off my chest."," i completely understand what you are going thru.  my mom was never the loving parent that my friends had to support them.  my mom was more interested in going out with her friends to the local dance hall to see what man would show interest in her.  i was last on her priority list.  as an only child, i had no siblings to help me thru those lonely years.  my mom was extremely selfish.  i took a vow right then that as i became an adult and if i ever became a mom, i would be there for my children.  i also vowed that i would never be so co-dependent that i had to have a partner in my life.  i lived by the motto ""if it has to be it's up to me"" and became a very strong woman.  fast forward to the year 20\`15 and my mom was living alone after the break-up of an abusive marriage in 2000.   after the break-up, she moved across country to live near me and did so successfully for at least a decade.   i get a call from her landlord that she is driving the neighbors nuts.  she is always knocking on their doors at all hours of the day and night.  i invited my mom to live with me and my husband and that is when the difficulties began.mom would never give us any privacy.  she demanded to be not only in our house but if we were watching a television show, she had to be right there on the sofa with us.  we could never go out to dinner without her.  oh don't get me wrong, we tried to be inclusive for many years but then felt a twinge of resentfulness when we could not even go out alone without her.  she would call all the neighbors and tell them that we abandoned her and she had no idea where we went or when we would be back.  this was clearly the start of the path of dementia.    my mom's co-dependent nature was back stronger than ever with no ""man"" in her life and only the two of us to keep her company.  this goes on for the next six years!  yes, six long years.  i have a saint for a husband!!!  she berated him whenever and wherever she could including in front of our friends.  fast forward to this year (2022) and i am diagnosed with a non-cancerous brain tumor.  my surgeon made it very clear that i could not possibly take care of myself and a dementia patient.  my husband and i found a local ""extended care facility"" that does have care for dementia patients.  we placed my mom in this facility three days before i had to go to another city for my surgery.  she went kicking and screaming as she said she didn't need this type of care and could stay home by herself.  at this point in time, she could not cook a meal, cannot take her medicine on schedule, does not drive so she could not go to the store, and we transport her everywhere to all medical appointments, etc.    as soon as i returned home from the surgery, my days were filled with peace and serenity. my husband and i resumed our marriage.  we started to enjoy life again.my mom has been in the extended care facility for almost four (4) months now.  she is adapting although there are good days and bad days.  her dementia is moderate to severe as diagnosed by several doctors.  do yourself a big favor and find a suitable home for your mom.  don't continue to live under her tyranny as my husband and i did for almost seven years.  start investigating those local facilities around your town, city or state.  go to your local elder care, social security (medicare), medicaid experts and let them guide you thru the process.  even the nursing home you choose knows the paperwork that is involved in getting your mom into a suitable environment.  these homes have experts who are trained in dementia care.  my mom is in a home that is staffed by angels!  i could never care for her at this stage and they do so with love and grace.bless you and remember ""put on your own oxygen mask before you take care of those around you"" and you deserve to live your life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/unowrd/im_struggling/,I'm struggling...

tl;dr: items from my past makes my dad talk about those things as if they're from his past. i tried goggling to see if i could find anything about this but didn't have much luck. my father has early to mid stage dementia and is definitely acting more strange as the days go on. i have found that when telling stories he tends to say things from my past as if they were his own memories. for example he took me to karate when i was a kid and when moving home he was helping me with some boxes. anything vaguely karate related from those days caused him to stop in his tracks and talk about how he used to do it and that the training equipment was good stuff of his. has anyone had any experience with a relative acting like that? it's not distressing so i don't correct him. it's just been happening more often with other things so i'm just curious if it's part of a bigger behaviour that could be forming. i think he remmebers taking me to the lessons but the lines are being blurred as to what his role in those memories are., your last sentence make sense. the memories are near and dear to his heart but he doesn’t remember the details. that makes sense with dementia i think. his way of integrating it being the son rather than the father is interesting but fits i think. also maybe your roles have switched. maybe he feels like the kid sometimes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/umgr9y/father_with_dementia_confusing_my_life/,Father with dementia confusing my life experiences with his own.

," where i live there's a 2-4 year waiting list for a state social worker, we had no choice but to go the private route.  because my mother's legal work wasn't in order (psa: get power of attorney done) we hired one for $1k within a week we had appointments set up, she also put pressure on her doctor to get shit done, and is dealing with the lawyers for us. she also hand delivers all documents because shit always ends up going missing in the mail or offices.this person has been a godsend for our family.  i feel for the families that can't afford a social worker or the homes dementia patients have to be in here.  state run homes are 2k a month which have a horrible reputation, and private ones start at 4500 a month.  the sad part is that her home she was so proud to leave behind for us is going to be spent taking care of her own needs for the rest of her life.so the answer is hell yes, hella helpful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/ukv7tu/has_anyone_used_a_social_worker_was_it_helpful/,Has anyone used a social worker?

"tldr: last two paragraphs for current sitaution. severe decline in past month. unable to provide care because not a first world country. wish i could type everything but the post will only get longer and discouraging to readhe is 92 and lost his wife to covid last year. he was physically able to move with some help but in the past one month his health has gone worse and has shown a very rapid decline in both mental and physical capabilities. we have an in house attendant during the day and he takes great care of him. we as a family are also present with him and try to keep him engaged and distracted. his mental decline has been too fast for us to handle. two months ago he started having short term memory loss and would repeatedly ask same questions over and over. he was also confused. taking him to poo was a hassle but we would manage it. also started to eat way less than what i would imagine would be healthy for him.however, last week or two, he pooped in his diapers and refused to get cleaned up. he never urinates or poos in diapers as he is not used to it and doesn't want to accept it but he wears one for emergencies. 3 days of trying to convince him lead to nothing. we also got him a wheelchair so he could move around but he got physically weaker to the point where we couldn't get him to sit on it from the bed. we hired an attendant for the day and he somehow didn't resist much to the idea of getting a bathe. anyways we get him cleaned and back on the bed. but since then he is completely immobile and doesn't even move at all in the bed. where we live it is very hard to take him to a doctor and he is afraid of going to hospitals. doctors have refused in-home visit and give some covid protocol bs as an excuse. we have been trying to get one since a month. anyways, back to 2-3 days back, he says he is in a lot of physical pain and would fight on any attempt to move him on the bed. he got a huge bed sore on his lower back as a result. we then had to just force ourselves to keep changing his position in bed while he screams and tries to hit us and the attendant because he is scared he will fall down (and the physical pain). he is on a huge double bed and we always try to reassure him and hold him. the attendant did warn us and insisted on us to help with changing his positions but we didn't know any better to deal with his unwillingness to be moved at all.anyways, yesterday, we were making some progress with everything. he got up and sat on the bed, had his hair combed, didn't forget much and kept talking. however, later in the day he kept hallucinating and was convinced he is not at home and kept telling me to pack our stuff and that we're going home. i tried distracting him with visuals and music but he didn't give up on this idea. we are also barely able to attend to him at night since it is very hard to sacrifice our sleep and function properly the next day. (the attendant was originally hired to help with tasks like cleaning and feeding which is for the day time.) i believe he has been unable to fall asleep at all in the past 2 days. so i wake up the next morning and he is screaming in his room and is talking loudly to the walls. i enter his room and he thinks the police have stolen something from him and also locked him up. he is mad at the hallucinations for not answering to him and letting him leave. i help him to pee and now i am too scared to go back because he is fuming. the attendant will be here soon but i don't know what to do at all."," he may have a urinary tract infection, which can cause these symptoms suddenly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uksutc/grandfather_is_convinced_he_is_locked_up_in_a/,Grandfather is convinced he is locked up in a police station and is very angry.

"hi all! as the title says, my sister and i bought my mother an animatronic dog for mothers day as a comforting sort of companion for her and she thinks it's real. the dog is especially designed for dementia patients and has pretty good reviews. normally i wouldn't be too concerned if she were to think it's real, however my father is saying she has become focused on needing to feed it, protect it (she was worried it might fall off the furniture), and was worried it might suffocate when he placed it in the box it came in while they were at dinner. my dad isn't always the best at responding in these situations. he keeps trying to convince her the dog isn't real, that it's  just a toy. i'm thinking we go along with her belief that it's real provided that it doesn't start interfering with her functioning in some way. what do you guys think?"," often a wonderful thing, but can be a problem when the person with dementia may want to continually feed or water their ""pet"".  some go thru the grief process because obviously their pet must be ill or dying.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/uksse9/we_bought_my_mother_an_animatronic_dog_and_now/,we bought my mother an animatronic dog and now she thinks it's real.

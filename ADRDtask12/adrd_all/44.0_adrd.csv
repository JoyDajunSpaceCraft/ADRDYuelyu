i'm considering taking this route instead of paying $1000s for genetic tests out of pocket. thoughts? is it reliable / accurate?," i used promethease for this. my mother passed last april at the age of 92. she developed dementia in her late 80's. she had multiple possible causes: 5 major surgeries starting in her mid-eighties (being put under is a possible cause of dementia in the elderly), her vitamin b12 bottomed out, which can cause irreversible dementia, and stress. nevertheless i worried about a genetic cause and sure enough, i have one apoe-e4 and one e3. promethease gives the e4 allele a badness score of 3.5. fortunately i have another gene that mitigates it somewhat: rs5882(g;g) lowers the risk of alzheimer's and has a goodness score of 2.1. so... i'm not sure how worried i should be at this point.

"hello everyone. i have a problem that i'm not sure how to approach. my future mother in law is showing a lot of signs for early onset alzheimer's. she falls down a lot, she forgets where she puts things a few moments prior, she repeats herself in conversations multiple times, she has problems following conversations and instructions, she pulled away from most contact (she quit her job and doesn't visit anyone anymore), she has horrible judgment, especially with money (she would forget to pay bills, but would spend hundreds on furniture, just to throw it away a few weeks later to buy more furniture), she often makes weird and unexplainable decisions (for example, when the garbage is full, she will take the bag out and throw it outside, in random places, sometimes outside the bathroom window, sometimes on the front lawn, yesterday it was behind the garage, which is actually farther to go than to the dumpster) and she frequently changes her mood, from happy and content to yelling at family, blaming them for things she caused. i know she has been (and possibly currently is) depressed, and i have read that depression can increase the chance of getting alzheimer's.i want to get her to go to the doctor and get checked out. alzheimer's runs in her family for multiple generations on both sides, but i don't know how to bring it up. lately she has been very combative with anyone bringing up any opinion that doesn't match her own. can i call her doctor and request a check up when she goes next time? i have no idea as to how to go about this. thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide."," depending on your future mother-in-laws age, would depend on early onset or just dementia/alz. if she is 65 or older that is considered dementia/alz. if as she is younger than 65 it would considered early onset. anyway, i agree with you 100%. she is showing signs of dementia. actually, to a pretty high degree. she badly needs to see her general practitioner to start with, then her gp will make recommendations from there. as a new in-law this can put you in a awkward situation. the immediately family (husband, children) need to get involved. your future mother-in-law can be in denial, for whatever reason, or just unaware because of the dementia, and that can put the family in a situation of forcing or tricking her to go see the doctor. either way can be a very unpleasant experience for everyone involved. but, no matter what it takes, they need to get her to her doctors before she gets hurt.my suggestion would is to talk to your fiancé. if your fiancé has brothers, or sisters, they should talk and get involved. if not, and your fiancé is the only child, then it would be up to you and your fiancé. but your fiancé need to be on board. good resource:www.alz.orgalso contact the alzheimer's association in your area. they can give you advise on where/how to start.

"day one of hospice, things were confusing, as the medical director from the sub acute facility said one thing and did another. looking back, i think my husband was already beginning to die. the first night i had to call the hospice nurse since he became more restless and spiked a fever. she told me what to do then said she'd come in the morning.her initial assessment was 6-8 weeks, then he'd slip into a coma. that first night i slept squeezed between the bed railing and his thin body, stroking his hair, singing amazing grace and swing low sweet chariot until i lost my voice and fell asleep for four hours.day two of hospice, while one son had to go to philadelphia for business, the nurse re-assessed my husband and said he had already started the transition, and had possibly 24-48 hours. she changed his meds, and said to administer more of some, every two hours. my daughter took the day off from work, quietly sitting on the sofa in front of the wood stove, with firewood delivered by her husband's brother. an aide arrived to bathe and clean him, even though i had taken several hours the night before to trim his fingernails and his beard.day three of hospice, after the nurse left at 2pm, a chaplain arrived. she asked a lot of questions about how we met, family members, and what his job had been prior to retirement. both she and the nurse said that even though he'd been almost deaf for years, in their experience, towards the end of life hearing seems to heighten. the chaplain put one hand on his leg; i had one hand on his feverish forehead and the other on one of his hands. she began by saying, ""so, paul, i hear you're an atheist but i want you to know god's arms are open wide, already embracing you as you begin a new journey.""she went on, saying that his work on earth was done, that he had been a good steward, a good son and brother, a good husband, a good father and grandfather, a kind and gentle spirit. i was surprised that instead of crying, i felt overcome by a swirling energy that started at my feet and circled my husband, then the chaplain. later, i told her this and she said she had felt [god's presence]( as soon as i opened the door, not so much from ""that room, where your cats are freaking out, but from you.""the chaplain left; the aide hugged me and left. i checked on my husband at 4pm, was slightly annoyed the aide had completely shaved off his beard and mustache, but happy she had put on a fire engine red collared shirt my father bought for him years ago. i was on the phone with someone who had me on hold when our younger son urgently called me to my husband's bed. i remember thinking, oh, fuck, i missed the timing of his pain meds. my son was attempting to take his father's pulse and he calmly said, ""i think dad died.""my son-in-law and two of the three grandsons had just arrived. [he came back]( and said yes, hugging me with tears in his eyes. he's seen death before. i called the hospice nurse back and said he just passed. she seemed oddly surprised, but said she'd be here in 10 minutes. she very efficiently checked him, and with a catch in her voice, pronounced the time of death at 4:53pm february 3, 2016.the eldest grandson came directly from an afternoon college class, striding past all of us standing clumped in the kitchen, and headed to the former dining room. after that, the youngest made some excuse to look for one of the cats ""under grandpa's bed"", then after pretzels and potato chips, the middle one slipped quietly into the room.i may not have recorded this exactly in linear order, but there was a point at which it all became surreal. dealing with his two sisters went alright, but the two daughters was beyond the pale, and may god forgive them until i can. maybe in the future i will write about all of the ridiculous red tape, but for now, i'm going to put another log in the wood stove. thank you all for listening by reading what i've been writing since his diagnosis of alzheimer's.paul carl becker ii (4/5/1939-2/3/2016). there are no goodbyes. i miss him already. i feel him everywhere.--i originally posted this [on everything2]( but i wanted to share it here on reddit as my first contribution.", thank you for sharing. <3 ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/44elo9/dying_in_new_jersey/,dying in New Jersey

"my father was diagnosed with alzheimer's 2 years ago (the first symptoms started a year before, so 3 years total), but only now the problems are starting to really grow in strength, mostly because of his state of denial, shifting the blame of his problems to us.he continuously picks fights (nothing physical, just hard discussions for now) against everyone, for ""restricting him too much""; he still wants to drive his car, go to work, and basically do a lot of things he is not really capable of doing anymore. he still has no motor/physical problems, but he cannot remember any instructions given to him or the details of conversations; and when told that he forgot something, he flips out, accusing anybody of ""not saying/asking anything in first place"". so whenever he goes out, somebody has to go with him and he resents this a lot. he flat out refuses that he did or does anything wrong and won't be taken to any more doctors.i feel like i can't explain it very well, so maybe it's better to give an example.before (when he still was driving alone, before the diagnose) we would call and ask him to buy some bread on his way home. upon arrival and asked ""where is the bread?"" he would deny being asked, or receiving the call at all, even if shown the phone log. nowadays, he still denies doing anything wrong, or forgetting things... for example, he goes out to walk with the dog (still inside the building area, not on the streets proper) and when comes back, he lost the apartment keys. he completely denies taking it with him. when asked how did he lock the door on his way out, he says that we did it. this is one of the parts that we don't understand, is he lying to protect his pride (he is pretty heavy on the ""i never do anything wrong"" thing), or inside his head he created another whole world and he truly believes in these illusions?what i really would like to know is how to make/take him to go see a psychoanalyst, psychologist, anything really... on the last couple weeks his childish tantrums (""i didn't do it! why do you keep doubting!"") are getting more aggressive, with him punching walls and throwing things on the floor. it's not like we can throw a net over and drag him to the doctor. at best we could let him hear we talking about ""since he won't go to a psychologist, maybe we should talk to dmv, ask about his driver licence""; he really likes to drive, maybe this could scare him into go see a doctor, but we really don't want to resort to that."," the thing to remember is that if he can't remember doing something, then, in his mind, he didn't do it.  and because of the cognitive losses, he can't look at the phone log and make the jump from ""oh here's a call from you' to ...i must have forgotten. it's not possible for them to do that. we had to learn to quit trying to convince my mother - because she is incapable of changing her mind.  it's so hard to deal with these changes in a person. but eventually, they stop arguing and just repeat themselves endlessly.  i visited mom yesterday and for 45 minutes she repeated the same 5 sentences on the same 4 topics over and over and over. there is no conversation - she doesn't want to hear me talk - she just needs to hear herself repeat these things over and over.hard going.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/41f0ks/family_member_with_alzheimers_but_he_refuses_to/,"Family member with Alzheimer's, but he refuses to acknowledge/submit to the changes.

"nearly three years ago, my dad passed away. mom had been showing signs of dementia/alzheimer's disease prior to his passing; but afterward, the signs became demonstrable. they say that when a spouse dies, 1/2 the person with alzheimer's memory goes with them. for mom, it was more profound. she lost her best friend, her ""hubby,"" and the one who she also leaned on to complete her thoughts and sentences.for her children, it became increasingly obvious that mom's situation had become untenable. she was going to need help with her daily tasks.my brother, who had been providing care for both parents, took on the more difficult task of dealing with a parent with alzheimer's. he really shielded us from a lot of the daily heartache. with him by her side, we were able to really optimize our visits and spend quality time with mom. we also had honest appraisals of her care and were kept informed of her situation. those who could deal with the truth of the matter.alzheimer's is a bitch. it takes a lovely life of memories and diminishes them to small actions and words. her vocabulary, once rich and layered, became a series of gutteral responses and expressions. i remember one occasion, where she pointed to the sky and said, ""oh, you know the fluffy things up there,"" referring to clouds.i don't know why i am posting. i guess, just to get some anger and sadness off my chest. i am so sad that a women, who devoted her life to loving children, the church and prayer, was reduced to a state of babble. she became incoherent. it was very humiliating for her, on some levels; when she was able to differentiate present from past.i want to offer some hope, too. my mother was a lifelong nurse. she began as a candy-striper in the maternity ward, and ended an illustrious career spanning 62 years of providing care (yes, 16 to to 78!), as a hospice care nurse. also, ironic that the spectrum of her life in the medical profession spanned from birth to death in her own natural sequence.our mother had decided that her end of life care would be minimal. she wanted no intervention with a dnr. my brother, who managed her care made the ultimate decision that i think was one of the biggest gifts we could have been given. instead of opting for hospice, which provides morphine for pain relief, he polled the siblings to offer a different approach. for pain relief, he decided to use medical grade marijuana, with low levels of thc. because of this, my mother's pain was well managed, but she was also able to be cognizant  and aware (in snippets, as alzheimers will allow).so, long story short: alzheimer's sucks, also consider medical marijuana for end of life care.", thank you for sharing your story.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/40dcab/me_and_mom/,Me and Mom

"my paternal grandfather had alzheimers and i've always been afraid that just, genetically i would get it eventually. i guess i've just been afraid to look anything up. i first heard of minor cognitive impairment today and i think i might have symptoms. i'm 35 and i've had a high stress job most of my adult life and extreme trauma/stress over a failed marriage which caused a lot of weight gain, major depressive disorder requiring antidepressants.  over the last 5-10 years i feel like my short term memory, ability to answer questions, recall recent events, appointments, information and communicate effectively, my overall ""spaciness"" have increased so much that it's been noticeable by my spouse and myself. i'm not sure where to go really, who would i make an appointment with? is it expensive? it was really just spontaneity that made me come here and post to reddit as opposed to say, seeing my pcp, but i guess i'm just reaching out."," hi.  i work in a neurology dept.  we have an alzheimer's prevention clinic.  part of my job is to read  the medical literature on a daily basis to ensure we stay current.  large studies show (check out david bennetts work at rush hospital chicago) that brains of people with genetic predisposition (apoe 4/4) often have normal cognition until death even though they are riddled with amyloid and tau, and people without apoe 4 can have cognitive decline.  genes may only account for 1/3rd of cases.  the rest is based on modifiable factors (early menopause without estrogen replacement, mid life obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, concussion, depression, standard american diet, lack of exercise).  near daily strenuous exercise (just get the heart rate up!) and adopting the mediterranean diet (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, white meat, 4 tbl olive oil a day, fish 3-4 times a week, way less white bread, way less red meat, coffee, dark chocolate, red wine) can cut your risk by at least 50%.  the way most of us eat leads to a state of chronic inflammation. at your age you have plenty of time to alter your genetic ""destiny"".  also... learn a new language, a new skill, a new instrument.  and stay mindful... try to keep your mind on the task you're doing instead of thinking about other things.  listen intently to others.  if you want more information... email me at amfwork@gmail.com.  if you live in the area you can come to the center :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/3x2bx7/i_think_i_might_have_an_mci/,I think I might have an MCI?

"my mother, who was an amazing and inspiring woman, has just passed away this week and with tears in my eyes and pain in my heart, i thought i could share my family's personal story to help some people out there know that they're not alone when dealing with this case. i ask not for sympathy, only for the eyes and ears of people to help spread awareness about early-onset alzheimers.my mother was diagnosed when i turned the age of 15 years old. i also had a brother at the age of 18 at this time. my mother was only the age of 46 years old and had a genetic test done to confirm what was our worst nightmares. with this news, i not only lost my mother, my best friend and partner in crime that i knew so well and loved with all of my heart; i also lost myself, my brother and my father. my father vowed all of his time and effort to the care my mother deserved and needed, it was very understandable for me now, but at the age of 15 i thought it was cruel that i lose my mother mentally, especially when i felt like i needed her the most as a 15 year-old girl, and then with that immediately feel like i lose my father. with her diagnosis, she was also no longer allowed to drive, so she was trapped in the house unless somebody took her somewhere.over the years, i felt myself changing; i gained weight, i never felt happy and i distanced myself from social interaction which lost me a lot of my friends. i didn't really go outside much unless i took my mom, but i felt everybody watching me and my mother whenever we went outside. i of course had a few very amazing friends that stuck by my side until the end, they thought the world of my mother, she could make anybody laugh after all. even in her state, she was a very happy woman, it was almost impossible for her to get mad at somebody. she was always a goofy joy to be around, but every time i took her out, i was always reminded and shown how bad her condition has gotten since last time. i noticed her starting to be unable to do the normal things she used to, like washing the dishes, talking on the phone, or even changing the tv channels. she also had a job at an elementary school and loved it dearly, she was a health aid that guides the students with disabilities around and helps them with their homework. she also had many friends at the school she loved, the school made accomodations for her to continue working there. my dad picked her up from work and dropped her off at work, but one day the school said she was too bad to work anymore. she was completely devistated, the teachers she worked with avoided her like the plague any time they saw her in the store; all of her ""close friends"" stopped contacting her. i then began to isolate myself from my family and started watching anime and chatting with random strangers to find more people to talk with about my interests because i felt lonely all of the time and depressed, through this i met a boy that i talked to all of the time that helped me get through this and turned into my current boyfriend of 3 years that couldn't have helped me more. the problem is, i was only 15, he was 18, the situation didn't ring with my parents very well and it was heavily frowned upon, especially since he was in another country. despite this, i ended up moving with him this summer (i'm now 18)and we had an amazing time together. he helped heal the pain as much as he could. but while i was with him, my father had been going through an awful time, my mom's condition was rapidly declining, we had no idea why. she ended up going into the hospital 3 times within this last month with 2 seizures, then my father called me and told me my mother only had 3 weeks to live. he offered to pay my flight to go back to my home town to visit my mother so i could at least say good-bye, he also offered to pay my boyfriend's flight, but he had very important testing and couldn't come with me. i flew 15 hours not including layovers on monday, to get there monday night my father's time. when i arrived at the airport, with tears in his eyes, my father told me my mom had already passed while i was in flight. i had no time to say good-bye, i felt like an awful daughter for not being there for my mother in her final months. i felt like i didn't deserve her love. i thought she would hate me forever, but my father and brother made me realize, she loved me more than anything in this world. she would always randomly tell my father how much of a good girl i am, and how happy she is that i'm happy where i am. she would also leave food on her plate for me because she didn't know if i was eating well enough where i was; she wouldn't eat it until somebody told her i had enough food and that i was happy. even until the end she only worried about others rather than herself. she was a very amazing person, and i'm so blessed to have had her as my mother. alzheimers doesn't always affect only one person, it usually affects all of those around the person who help them through their journey. i would just like to spread the word that there are very early cases of alzheimers to all of the doctors that doubted my mother's diagnosis and didn't believe my father. we also had a very hard time with finding medical situations for my mother. all of the dementia homes only allowed women over age 55 or some even only over age 60. with the hospitals, they constantly tried kicking her out as well. i'm very ashamed to have to experience such madness, but the hospice nurses of our state were absolutely amazing. hospice is an amazing resourse to have to those struggling in the same position we had. thank you for your time!", thank you for sharing your experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/3vmeax/my_mother_an_earlyonset_alzheimer_fighter/,My mother.

"glutathione is often described as the brain's master antioxidant.  much indirect evidence has linked its depletion to the onset and progression of alzheimer's disease, but this is the first one to make that link directly.  if interested, please take a close look at the charts.as oxidative stress increases, levels of glutathione decline and as levels of glutatione decline the damage done by oxidants to the brain increase.the pathways leading to the formation of amyloid and tau tangles overlap with the production of oxidants, but as long as the oxidants are being scavenged a person does not develop alzheimer's disease.  children exposed to high levels of air pollution in mexico city (especially those with the apoe4 gene) have both amyloid and tau in their brains but do not have alzheimer's disease.  when administered the antioxidant cocoa there cognitive deficits were alleviated.older dogs in mexico city sometimes forget their owners and show other signs of confusion.  dogs are one of the few animals to develop a disease similar to alzheimer's disease likely because of their keen sense of smell (one of the routes to alzheimer's disease is via over-activation of olfactory receptors).  to date the only treatment that has helped canine cognitive dysfunction involves antioxidants.adults with down syndrome all have high levels of amyloid and tau tangles in their brain but not all go on to develop alzheimer's disease probably because they have high levels of hydrogen sulfide which is a peroxynitrite scavenger.in the famous nun study, several elderly nuns had high levels of amyloid and tau tangles in their brain, but did not have alzheimer's disease in part because of a strict adherence to an antioxidant diet.if you can control oxidation via antioxidants, tau and amyloid are likely irrelevant.  the only small-scale clinical trials that have produced partial reversals in alzheimer's disease have all involved antioxidants.  pursue that path and you are likely to find effective treatments for the disease.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/3ulr3x/glutathione_and_alzheimers_disease/,Glutathione and Alzheimer's disease

"myth one: alzheimer's disease is caused by amyloid and tau tangles.neither cause alzheimer's disease.  zinc that attracts amyloid oligomers and copper can increase hydrogen peroxide early in alzheimer's disease and this can do damage to brain cells.  this damage stops once copper and zinc are incorporated in amyloid plaques.  this may be what also stops alzheimer's from being a prion disease.tau tangles in and of themselves are not harmful.  nitrated tau tangles that cannot be reconstituted can interfere with neurotransmissions and the transport of nutrients in the brain.it is not a matter of starting anti-amyloid and tau strategies earlier; it is a matter of focusing on what actually causes the disease.myth two: we don't know what causes alzheimer's diseasethere are many proximate causes of alzheimer's disease and one ultimate cause.  as one researcher made the analogy there are many streams that feed into the mississippi river but it all ends up in new orleans [or close to it]. alzheimer's disease is caused by an oxidant called peroxynitrite.  peroxynitrite formation leads to nitration, oxidation, lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and dna damage.  the specific results are the lack of synthesis and release of neurotransmitters involved in short-term memory, sleep, mood, social recognition, and alertness, the restricted flow of blood and glucose transport in the brain which can leads to apathy, wandering, and delusions, the overactivation of nmda receptors which can lead to hallucinations, an end to the regeneration of neurons in the hippocampus, and the death of neurons.  many factors can lead to peroxynitrite formation.  they include but are not limited to high levels of glucose, a high sodium diet, high fructose corn syrup, psychological of physical stress, mercury, various pesticides and herbicides, various air pollutants, several industrial solvents, bisphenols in plastics, aluminum flouride, sodium fluoride, fosamax and other osteoporosis drugs, chronic acetaminophen use, presenilin gene mutations, amyloid precursor protein mutations, the apoe4 gene, down syndrome, and various chronic bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.myth three: we have no idea how to prevent or treat alzheimer's disease.we can reduce the risk of alzheimer's disease via compounds that reduce the formation of peroxynitrite.  these include polyphenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and beverages.  these same polyphenols also help to scavenge peroxynitrite and reverse part of its damage.  this is why a mediterranean diet both reduces the risk of alzheimer's disease and slows it progression.myth four: nothing has ever slowed down the progression of alzheimer's disease, let alone partially reversed it.alzheimer's disease has been partially reversed in small-scale clinical trials by powerful peroxynitrite scavengers.  this includes methoxyphenols such as eugenol in rosemary essential oil via aromatherapy and ferulic acid and syringic acid in panax ginseng.for those not consumed by the above myths, the way forward to treating alzheimer's disease is almost in plain sight."," alzheimer's is not clearly an amyloid based disease.  the amyloidist have shifted the goal post from plaques to oligomers but have not shown or proven what damage oligomers do to the brain. one possibility is that they increase levels of hydrogen peroxide, but the decline in hydrogen peroxide levels as the disease progresses is perhaps the best evidence that most oligomers are converted into plaques as the disease progresses.hydrogen peroxide is generated during the very early stages of aggregation of the amyloid peptides implicated in alzheimer disease and familial british dementia.ultrastructural studies with both peptides revealed that structures resembling ""soluble oligomers"" or ""protofibrils"" were present during this early phase of hydrogen peroxide formation. mature amyloid fibrils derived from abeta-(1-40) did not generate hydrogen peroxide. we conclude that hydrogen peroxide formation during the early stages of protein aggregation may be a common mechanism of cell death in these (and possibly other) neurodegenerative diseases.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/3ttmxf/some_myths_of_alzheimers_disease/,Some myths of Alzheimer's disease

""if she sees someone is in the room, she will go straight to sleep"" i thought. that worked for a short while. then, she started knocking on my door every short while just to ask me. so i decided to write on a white board that i work nights, am sleeping in the room, and to please not wake me up. i, also, wrote that i loved her and put a smiley face so she wouldnt feel like a burden. that didnt work. so, today i decided to put the white board on my door. i worked a 6-day work week and i'm totally pooped. she didn't even read it.i broke down. i couldn't help it. i tried hiding my tears from her, but failed at doing that, which of course caused her to freak out. i'm so tired and i love her. i know she is going through so much worse. my head feels like it's going to explode."," all theses suggestions are wonderful. i have been a private caregiver as well as a caregiver for my mom who presently suffers with alzheimer's. first of all, you are a very brave and super young women for moving back in with your mother to help care for your grandmother. i'm sure you have realized by now, until you actually are an alz. caregiver, there is no way you can understand the depth of this extremely difficult and overwhelming job. it is the most physically, mentally, and emotionally draining job, i have ever done. that's why i firmly believe, that you cannot be what a person with alzheimer's needs unless you can take care of yourself. you already work at a job and go to school. for your sake and your grandmothers sake, see if there is any way that your mom can have a/the caregiver come in at 7:00 am when your she leaves for work. on you days off, be the caregiver your grandmother needs you to be. get up when she gets up. nap when she naps. keep her engaged. make her meals, eat with her. talk with her. take her outside. take her on errands with you (if she's able). go shopping (if and for how long she is able). you are 24 years old. you need to work your job, you need to go to school, you need to study, you need a social life, and you need to take care of yourself!

"her memory has been pretty bad for a while but we thought it was just chemo brain. after a lot of tests and realizing this isn't getting better, she was finally diagnosed today. i'm in shock to say the least. thought i could post here for some help. "," hi op,my mom (now 64) was diagnosed about 2 years ago with early onset ad and i, my siblings, and father have been doing a lot of stuff trial and error that you might try out to start with. some specific things you need to think about:        *  does she understand who is calling on the telephone? we realized that my mom was (and sometimes still is) picking up phone calls from unknown numbers. going hand in hand with that, also sometimes hanging up on people who needed something from one of us in actuality, or not picking up our phone calls. you might consider changing the phone number to a google number so you can screen what calls get through. or, at the very least, make sure you have the most important numbers (yours, other family, maybe a neighbor) somewhere she will see it, even if she forgets where it is. we have a bulletin board next to the phone in the kitchen so my mom can see my dad's cell, his office, my cell, and those of my siblings.     * time might start out fine for her but it gets very jumbled as time goes on. we used to talk about things far in the future (weeks, months) but people with ad have a hard time putting events in order and we've found the most success having a one week calendar on our kitchen island where people can dry erase update the day and we have a magnet that we move to indicate what day we are on. the other members of our family share a google calendar so we can see what people are up to and we add events that we hear about that might be good to take our mom to--more on that later.  we also regularly talk with her about what we are doing the next day and what we are doing next on the current day.  * as other commenters have mentioned, you need to have a discussion with your mom while she is still lucid enough to understand about her estate and healthcare. a diagnosis of early onset ad can probably help you sign up for a social security/disability allowance for her. it is fairly easy to do on their website. here's the alz.org discussion [on the matter.]( we got our mom a compassionate allowance after her diagnosis. at first we thought we would just stockpile it for end of life care, we ended up starting to use it for 6-hour shift caregivers who now come 4 days a week to help us out.  my mom can still do most of her  every day tasks but they talk with her, go for long walks, and just spend time.   also, we had a lawyer make a new will for our parents and signed power of attorney forms for both of my parents, which gave two of us power to make financial and health care-related decisions for my mother. it's just easier to get these things done earlier rather than later.*   not sure where you are located but just try to google activities in your area, if there are any. it's a little harder for younger onset people because at the beginning, my mom didn't want to hang out with folks much older than she is but often she talks to the volunteers just as much as attendees. we've gone to zoo walks run by the alzheimer's association (weekly), cafes with music where everyone sings along, played games, and we signed her up for a support group that one of her caregivers drives her to.   it is amazing to meet up with other people who are going through what you are and the people (as well as their family or caregivers) are some of the nicest people i have ever encountered. just relentlessly positive. * this will be very hard on you and your family, not just your mom. it is important to try to do all sorts of activities to keep your mom as active as possible, both in a physical and mental sense. if she has interests like reading, see if you can find her a book club (take notes and talk about the plot and characters, etc. before she goes), if she likes dancing, sign the two of you up for a class. one thing i noticed that is pretty heartbreaking is that my mom doesn't actively think of things for herself to do, so if we don't tell her to watch an episode of criminal minds or color in her adult coloring book or chop vegetables for dinner, she will just sit and stare off into space. it is so, so important to make your mom feel needed and to try to be as patient as possible. she will forget what she went upstairs for, and then what she went downstairs for, and on and on but op, try to have a sense of humor about it all.   * make sure you keep on top of her medicinal schedule, doctor's appointments, meal schedule, etc. at the beginning, these things might go fine, but over time they will get jumbled and you need to know what she is supposed to be taking when, if there have been any changes, what she's eating, etc. you will end up having a lot of conversations with people who used to deal with your mom but  are now talking with you. (bills, house, cable, credit cards, etc.) try to learn all your mom's passwords (maybe keep a password log for her?), find out who her doctors are and keep her appointments in your calendar.     sorry this post is getting super long. if you have any questions, please ask. there are a lot of us out here going through the same thing and op, i've been where you are. we figured out a lot of it as it came and we're still learning every day. you're going to be alright. keep your mom as positive as possible and make sure you are making time for you and not letting the diagnosis consume your life. you can do this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/3k6wuk/im_26_my_mom_is_59_has_ovarian_cancer_thankfully/,"I'm 26, my mom is 59, has ovarian cancer (thankfully in remission), and was diagnosed with AD today.

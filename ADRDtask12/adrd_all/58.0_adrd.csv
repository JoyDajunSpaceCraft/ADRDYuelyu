"i’m a hca on a healthcare for older people (geriatric ward) in a hospital in the uk. i’d say around 75% of our patients have dementia at any one time. generally patients will stay for up to 2-3 weeks on average until they’re better, though currently around 1/3 of our patients have been with us for a couple of months - the wait for residential home placement is terrible.a hospital isn’t an ideal environment for a dementia patient, this we all know. i want to help make our ward more dementia friendly, and i’m on the search for suggestions big or small.we don’t have a day room - just male/female bays with bed spaces in . did you find a day room, (somewhere less clinical with soft chairs and a tv etc) was helpful for your relative? i feel for our patients, they have nowhere to go but sit by their beds or pace in the corridors all day. i can’t help but feel it doesn’t help with the agitation they experience. i want to know if it’s something truly helpful as i’ll need to put the idea to our matron and fundraise like crazy as the hospital have said they will not fund it.any other suggestions of things that helped during admission? a side note - i love this sub, it has been invaluable to see dementia from a relatives perspective. love to you all x", i think a more realistic project would be trying to get (more?) volunteers to interact with the patients.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t6eqf1/dementia_ward_improvements/,Dementia ward improvements

"hey guys, i'm currently living with my grandma with dementia. i would say mid stage. every night around 8 i tell her to go to bed, take her to her room, watch her get in bed. she usually sleeps until 11. then she get up and goes to the bathroom. after that she always wanders around the house talking for 1-2 hours. then i have to remind her to go back to bed. sometimes she will sleep the rest of the night, but usually she gets up and wanders around again. any advice to help her stay in bed?a little more info if anyone has any other advice: she doesn't remember who i am and doesn't understand everything i say. she can walk, but has back pain so i don't really take her out. she also doesn't remember to eat.she should probably be in a home or something but my dad won't allow that. for the time being i am with her. thanks for any advice.", bed alarms are a godsend and you can get rails for the bed if necessary.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t6acxx/tips_for_helping_my_grandma_stay_in_bed/,Tips for helping my grandma stay in bed?

looking to see others experiences with issues swallowing. my grandma is stage 6 (maybe now moving into 7) and has aphasia (trouble speaking) and now we think she has progressed to dysphagia. a few weeks ago she she seemed to aspirate on a french fry at dinner. luckily she seemed to cough it out (did back blows) and a few days my mom took her to urgent care to get a chest x-ray. grandma was still wheezing. it came back clear and was told she is just shallow breathing and try having her do deep breaths a few times a day. yesterday i got a call from her senior center that she choked on a pea at lunch. it involved abdominal thrusts and back blows to have her clear it and stop coughing. maybe 30 mins later her coughing had calmed and she could speak. i was just wondering how others handled it. i saw they can do a swallow test. if your lo had to change their food consistency was it a fight? we have a family of 6 (including her) and i'm not sure if she would eat if her meal appears different than what everyone has. we are on the search for a facility this year just because her care is mounting and i'm getting burned out. and this is a new decline i'm dreading.," hey, sorry to hear this. they have exercises they can do with the patient to strengthen up the dysphagia. it can help. gotta watch for aspirating food. pretty typical to get left lung pneumonia from that in the elderly. for liquids, there is a product called thickit that can help. i've noticed that it's a use it or lose it thing that can accelerate like lightning with dementia. i've switched to a timed ""ok the tv goes off now and you have to read and we talk"" once a day. it has helped some. also, best thing i've done in awhile is buy a nutribullet pro with extractor blades. it's really made eating good nutritious food so much easier. i can even toss in raw carrots and puree them with beans etc and heat it up as a soup. it's really helped. best of luckedit to.add: yes, that swallow test can help as it can give them an idea how bad it is, etc. drs and providers like test results so they can dole out more services. it can make it easier for your loved one and you taking care of them. but rem you'll still have to yell at the hospital not to give them solid food. no one listens lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t5sj5z/dysphagia_test/,Dysphagia test
"hello :)  my mother has been showing cognitive decline for about 5 years now.   they mostly manifest as short-term memory problems, loss of concentration.    however lately, she has been showing signs of deeper agitation.   she calls her sons up and says she want to divorce her husband, that he's not a warm man, etc.   this is her sweetheart of 40 years.   her caregiver in many ways.   she also has moved out of their shared bedroom.    but when i'm over the house, she acts like nothing is wrong, often.  the pandemic (and my divorce) has caused her circle to shrink.   she lost my ex-wife and my in-laws.  she has been with her husband in their small bubble.   he is going deaf and is vain about getting a hearing aid.   i've been imploring him to get one.   my mom is so intuitive and sensitive.   when she calls him cold and too focused (only in the last few weeks), i have to connect that with his lack of hearing / awareness.    anyway, i set up and appointment with her neurologist today.   the purpose is to get her into see a neuropsychiatrist and this is the first step.   perhaps there is some medication that she can take to help her depression (i know the dangers of treating dementia patients for depression).  the problem is, that we've been mostly shielding her from our thoughts about her 'delusions'.  she does know she has a bit of memory problems...but that's it.   she always resists the medications (namenda) and visits to any doctor that is connected to cognitive decline.   it's as if her pride and indignation are coming to the surface with this condition.  she thinks she's a 20 year old superstar. do you guys think it makes any sense to bring up my concerns with her in the room?   or does it makes sense just to observe her visits, and have a follow up call with the doctor.   i just know that if it was me who was the patient, i would want to have agency and awareness about it.   thanks!", a point to bring up with your dad is that not getting hearing aids will actually make dementia and cognitive loss more likely for him. not getting auditory input is bad for the brain. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t5si8c/taking_mom_to_neurologist_today_wondering_if_i/,Taking mom to neurologist today.

"yep, i'm here again. firstly, i'm going to be very transparent and divulge that about 4-5 years ago i had basically a nervous breakdown. i won't get into the reasons, but i was on medical leave from work for a year and was being treated for severe anxiety and depression.  the depression is gone now, i still have anxiety.  because of this, i am very protective of my mental health.on to the vent. i hired an elder care attorney to help sort out how to get all of our ducks in a row for when mom will need more care than i can provide for her.  facilities are expensive, as you know, and my parents have very little money, which means they will qualify for medi-cal; however, the attorney said that we should never tell a facility that she will on medi-cal because they often claim there are only 3-5 beds available for medi-cal patients. she said to say we're private pay and once she's placed then we apply for medi-cal and the facility will reimburse anything we paid out of pocket.   i had to fill out an application to get my mom on a waitlist at one of the facilities nearby.  i handed it in and they told me that this will get her on their waitlist, but that the likelihood that she'll be accepted when we've decided it's time because they don't have enough money. so how the f\*ck are we going to get her into a facility if they're going to decide she's too poor to get in? i can't tell them she'll have medi-cal, so now what? what kind of circle of hell is this? i've emailed the attorney about this and a few other concerns and i haven't heard back from her in a week. i. am. freaked.out.what if i can't get her placed?  she deserves proper care and i don't want to have another breakdown, and i will if i have to keep this up. i'm exhausted and stressed out. vent over. thank you all."," i wish i had advice for you but i don’t; i’m not yet to the point of getting my mom into a facility (though i wish i were for my own sanity). but i wanted to acknowledge your post and send you some support & love. your mental health is precious and so worth protecting, and i truly hope that you get answers and a swift resolution soon. no matter what, remember to keep on prioritizing yourself. 💗eta: i’d go ahead and give the attorney a call. keep the pressure on (if you have it in you) until you get a response.

"i and my two adult daughters live in colorado. in october my very independent, very private, father had a fall and was taken to the hospital. he had been living alone a long time in indiana. he was found to be very confused and had been diagnosed with dementia of the unspecified sort a few years prior but i did not know that because he never told anyone. we used to talk on the phone quite a bit but i hadn't seen him in person in probably the past 2 years. he never really wanted company. we had a good relationship, just didn't see each other much. when i got to indiana to the hospital where he was after his fall i realized he was going to need a lot of help. i retained an elder-care attorney firm and we did all the necessary powers of attorney. my dad understood the need for help and wanted me to help him. i did understand the enormity of what i signed up to do for him as his power of attorney for health care and his finances so i'm not complaining about that part. i'm grateful i could have time off from my job and grateful that my father trusted me to help him. when he was medically well from the hospital he was released to a rehab unit to regain stamina and steadiness and balance in walking. he went through that rehab process fairly well and was ready to be discharged after about 3 weeks. his home in indiana had deteriorated quite a bit. he was a bit of a hoarder had been confused for a few years and the plumbing did not work. i knew his home was not the proper place for him and i knew i could not take care of him by myself. i know more now about home health options but at the time i really felt i was not equipped to do even that with him in indiana. my brother lives in florida and does not travel. he had not had a good relationship with my father since our parents divorced when i was nine and my brother was six. this was painful to my father and he expressed several times he would like a better relationship with his son. i decided we should go to florida and ""see what it's like to be retired"" while we visited him over the holidays. that was how i presented it to my father but in reality it was to see if a memory care unit in florida could be a good thing for him. my reasoning was that my brother and my father would have a better chance for a stronger bond before my father passes and that i would be able to work at my job in colorado during the summers as usual and then come to florida in the winters. as i said my mother and father divorced when we were both very young so my mother who also lives in florida (close to my brother) would not have been an appropriate person to have my father stay with lol. i did ask if i could stay in her extra bedroom while we visited. my father would be in the memory care unit and i would be in her extra bedroom and we would all be able to visit during the holidays and things will be great! well not really. we got to fl dec 6th, 2021. dad was okay in the memory care unit walking fine handling his own dementia okay kind of more confused but in pretty good health and we visited often. really we visited every day just not all day long everyday. on january 4th my dad stood up too fast and fell at his memory care place. we found out that he was pretty dehydrated and that probably made him faint when he stood up like that. he was taken to a hospital to check his head since no one witnessed his fall and they wanted to make sure he wouldn't have any head trauma from the fall. in that hospital he stayed there four days because of the dehydration and was doing okay. on the day they were going to release him back to the memory care unit he tested positive for covid. luckily he ended up not having severe symptoms because he was vaccinated but unluckily he was then in an isolation unit and they would not let him get up out of the bed because they thought he was a fall risk. he laid in the bed in that hospital for more than 10 days. as most people know the longer you are bedridden the more muscle mass and strength you lose. also unbeknownst to me he was developing bed sores. he got them on the backs of his heels, on his sacrum, one on each buttock, and was developing one on his testicles as well. the hospital told me repeatedly that there was no problem and that he had no bed sores from being immobile with no one moving him or repositioning him because he was in isolation. i asked them every few days.. when he was finally cleared to leave that hospital he was released to a rehab unit to try to get his strength back. that particular rehab unit alerted me that he had these bedsores when he got to them and that the one on his sacrum was severe . however they also overly medicated him with seroquel, did not move him, did not keep him hydrated or fed either. my brother and i visited him every day but of course we weren't there all day long everyday and it never occurred to me that he might be further and further dehydrating and not getting food. on his third day there he had to go to the hospital by ambulance because of going into hypovolemic shock due to low blood volume which is directly caused by severe dehydration. he almost died. he was septic. he was in the icu two days and then spent about two more weeks in that second hospital before he was medically stable enough to be released to the rehab facility he is in now. they have him on a special bed and his sores are slowly healing thank god. he is able to eat and some days able to feed himself if his hands are not shaking too badly. he has been able to stay hydrated as well. i go everyday in the mornings until around 2 in the afternoon. my brother comes by around 2:30 or 3 but has to go back to work after about an hour. sometimes but not always i go back in the later afternoon or possibly early evening it depends on how much i can take emotionally. most of the time i think i did the right thing bringing him down here because if that memory care place had worked i think it would have been good. he was only there a little less than a month before this fall and ever since then things have been so hard for him. he was walking fine 2 months ago. never needed a walker or a cane and didn't even touch the walls as he walk down the hallways. now he just lies in the bed and even though there is rehabilitation, he won't be able to stand until the wounds on his heels heal. i find myself feeling so guilty about bringing him here instead of being brave and keeping him at his home in indiana. now the way things are i can't even take him there because he can't sit up more than a couple of hours at a time because of the sores on his fanny. i feel like i have done a bad job for my dad who trust me literally with his life. he does remember who i am most of the time but a lot of his other conversations are very confused and anxious. he still tells me thank you when i help him get his water or feed him or wipe his mouth or hold his hand and he still tells me he loves me. i love him with all my heart he's the sweetest funniest man i've ever known. i really thought i could do better for him than what i have turned out to be able to do. sometimes i don't know where the future is taking us and i don't want to be the reason that his quality of life has disappeared. i prayed so hard cuz he was in the icu. i have the faith that saint anthony worked miracles with god to save my dad. i feel guilty because i don't know if he is glad to still be with us or not. i know it was selfish of me to ask god to save him or to ask saint anthony for the miracles. i'm down second-guessing myself all the time i don't usually do that. most of the time i can handle it but tonight i feel so confused and worried and lost. all i wanted to do was help him and i feel like i haven't done that even though i know it's not really my fault. i'm sorry for posting such a long pity party story but i know if anyone understands these complicated things it would be you guys."," ohh, botherkey, nnnooooo, so sorry, i feel for you!   it's not a pity-party at all, that's hard, and sad.  you were trying your best to help yr dad out, you weren't expecting the health system was letting him down.   really, if he'd stayed home so far away from you & sibling, even with home care assistance, for sure sooner or later (probably sooner) an even worse tangle would have befallen him.  i think your plan was/is best option, you did good.  often at elderly states, when one thing happens it's just a domino reaction of following crisis & problems, and on top of that this danged pandemic - very tough.  it's wonderful that he's now pulling through!  but yeh, sadly, sometimes at hospitals/facilities one needs to also monitor the procedures & processes & treatments, just to double-triple check.my very elderly dad had a health crisis some years ago, was in icu having stomach operations, afterwards in the rehab hospital he was still so weak & confused couldn't even stand up alone, couldn't walk, couldn't understand newspaper headlines or a bar of soap - doctors said maybe that was it for him.   hospital food wasn't at all sufficient for the strength & muscle re-building after such incidents, i considered. after reserch, i was practically force-feeding him sustagen-type protein/vitamin drinks & extra vit c tabs a few times daily. i'd put him in wheelchair taking out to sunshine in the carpark garden & playing his old favourites music from his younger days on the car stereo full blast.  that seemed to perk him up quite a bit, the hospital environment was deadening.   i asked a rehab therapist & also googled, photocopied him some simple exercises to do, got him doing them a few times a day.  short bursts, and not like 10 - 20 pushups lol.   stand - sit - stand - sit - stand - sit, x 4 or 5 times a day.  sitting in chair - leg lifts, toe touches (right hand to left knee/shin/foot & viceversa) , reach for the roof, etc.  every 2 or 3 days increased the reps.  got him a pair of kids squidgee balls to squeeze in both hands as he's just sitting there watching tv.  after a few weeks he started getting stronger & better.  even ended up walking ok - slowly, albeit - and being able to return to his own apartment, with lot of home-care support visits scheduled weekly.   (in hindsight, that was a great mistake - he actually ought to have transitioned directly to residential facility, but that's another story.) i guess yr dad needs to be residential, it's time.  i hope you've brought familiar favourite items of his from his old home, he'll settle into a new place.   it can't be helped, botherkey, at some point everybody gets old, seems like it was impossible for him to be left way off in indiana, i think you've done best option, and now what happens happens.   best of luck to you all!   \* hugs \*",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t4tpm7/im_in_limbo/,I'm in limbo

"tldr: my parents live across the country. i don’t know how to assess whether keeping things that way is sustainable. in the last 6mo my mom has had rapid onset of dementia, and needs full time care. my dad tried to be the caregiver, which lead to a deep depression.  i come to stay for a few weeks, established 24h care at home. i know we’re lucky we can do that. it goes relatively smoothly - my mom is not the easiest person so there’s always the occasional period where she’s upset, and at times we have to indulge bad habits like eating les la than healthy food to keep the peace. but she’s generally accepting of care. i am managing all the scheduling and payments for care. my hope is to take the worry away from my dad so he could return to a normal life. he sleeps in a different room now. he has a local support network (family, friends) while my mom not so much.i flew back thinking we’d gotten to a good new structure. a few weeks later my dad had a nervous breakdown. he was having trouble concentrating at his job, at home he was depressed, not seeing friends, etc… even with care the whole situation is sad/stressful and the house can feel oppressive. he left the house and is in intensive therapy while staying away from the house. i had to fly back and coordinate that as well. a few weeks out and he doesn’t seem that much better. i’m worried we’ll reintroduce him, and he’ll fall apart again.but i can’t stay here forever and can’t keep flying back every few weeks on a new crisis. it would be very distributive for them and myself but one option is to move my mom to live with me and my family and find local care here. i just don’t know how to think through that option. having a working system where they live now would be a lot better for them i think. i’m not sure what’s the tipping point to make us execute on such a drastic change.have others here had similar experience or just generally have advice?"," i've helped quite a few people through this given my profession as an occupational therapist. when it gets to be unmanageable or unreasonable is usually when it is best to call it quits. i think it is best to have an honest conversation with everybody involved and try and establish some type of quality of life. hire professional help if needed to keep your loved ones safe at home, as it is often cheaper than putting somebody in a nursing home. plus, everybody has peace of mind that way as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t48q4c/when_to_pull_the_plug_and_relocate_parent_or/,When to pull the plug and relocate parent or parents

"my grandmother, mid-stage, has recently become obsessed with me eating dinner with them on a daily basis, as well as my whereabouts in general.  her and my grandfather would watch me growing up while my parents worked.  after school, i'd be at there house all afternoon.  in the summers i spent the whole day there, until my parents got out of work.  i also use to eat dinner with them mon-wed nights, to give my parents some alone time and a bit of rest after work.  this has apparently popped back into my grandmother's mind.now, i always pop in once or twice a day for 20-30 minutes at a time, to visit and check if they need any help, because i'm only a couple streets away.  my grandmother, the past month, has started to think i stay there with them still, like when i was a child.  there's been a lot of confusion on her part recently, because we can go from a conversation about the home i own, my job, etc., to her thinking i'm a child/teenager in the span of about 10 minutes.sometimes when i come over, she immediately asks, ""where have you been?"" and wants a rundown of everything i've been doing.she's also started saying, every single day, ""you're eating dinner here tonight, right?""at first, i was making excuses, which worked, but now in the past couple weeks, she's stopped accepting them.  the mind of someone with dementia truly is complicated, because despite all her memory issues, she has *picked up* on my constant excuses, and now thinks i'm lying.  she actually started getting mad at me, and insisting i was ""hiding something.""so this past week, i've just had to be honest with her and it obviously hurts and upsets her feelings.  she seems to *forget* that though by the next day.  even though she does remember and pick up on certain things still, for over a year now she has blocked out any type of ""upsetting"" information she's given.  i've basically just told her politely but firmly, ""you and grandpa are 90.  i'm 35.  i have my own house, and my own food.  my fridge is full, i can afford it, and i like to cook and eat quietly most nights.  you don't cook like you use to.  i have your recipes, and i make them sometimes, but you won't let anyone else cook dinner for you and grandpa.  plus i eat at a much later time than you both do.""she has gone between, said, hurt, angry, and every emotion in between this week when doing that.  and even though she seems to forget by the next day, my grandfather says she's been in a sad mood during dinner, and still sets a place for me ""because maybe he'll change his mind.""that honestly breaks my heart.  but i don't see any other way around this, at this point.  is there a better way to handle this?

"hi all.  maybe this is more of a vent but any advice is appreciated.  my mother's dementia is pretty advanced.  my father is her caretaker. they're both 74.  she doesn't speak in any sentences that make sense, she constantly mumbles and repeats things, yells, can't communicate any needs at all, can't feed herself, can't do anything independently basically.  she constantly wanders around the house moving items around, which my father hates since she moves things he needs.  nothing keeps her attention, nothing will make her sit down and focus on anything for any amount of time.  we've tried everything.  he is constantly following her around and he's exhausted.  it has been incredibly hard on my father.  the constant yelling and mumbling has taken a huge toll on him.  he sends myself and my brother an email today saying he hopes god takes them both soon.  i know he isn't actively suicidal and he is just venting himself, but it's very upsetting to hear this.  he refuses to bring in any sort of help, even an aide for a few hours at a time once a week, saying it won't help and he just has to come back to the stress.  he refuses even more to consider memory care, as i think he thinks all memory care and nursing homes are basically institutions.  there seems to be nothing i can do to change his mind.  i am at a loss of what to do or say to help him.   i am constantly stressed out and worried about them (yes, i am seeing a therapist for this).  i can't help someone who won't consider help.  any advice from anyone who's had a similar experience is welcome.  thank you."," i wonder if cost is a factor in your dad’s mind. home care aides are $20-30/hour and memory care is $6-10,000/mo depending on where you live and type of facility. this can be a deterrent to getting help for some people even if it seems like they can afford it. have you looked into whether there are adult daycare facilities in their area? maybe you could research this, including visiting the places and getting the application for any that might work. if you’re local, you can also suggest that you attend with your mom the first couple times while your dad has that time to himself. daycare might be around $65/day and your mom can be dropped off on a regular schedule or just when your dad needs a break. attending with her in the beginning, plus maybe some therapeutic lies (such as telling her she’s volunteering to help others) might make it easier to leave her there. but even if she doesn’t like it, as long as she’s safe and cared for, your dad has got to know it is okay to bring her anyway. you could also tell him that it is smart to get her established with both a home care aide and a day care in case of a sudden emergency. he can have the aide come 1x/wk for 4 hours just to do cooking, laundry, light housekeeping and to get to know your mom. and if there’s an emergency and he’s sick or not available he’ll already be established with the agency and can increase the hours. you are right to be concerned. i forget the percentage but a large proportion of family caregivers die before the person with dementia. it takes a major toll. and then what would happen to your mom?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/t0eodw/help_with_father_who_needs_help_but_wont_get_it/,Help with father who needs help but won't get it!

"this might be long, but ig its bc im really passionate abt it. i am an activity assistant at an assisted living community for elders with dementia, and have been for almost three years. my job is to engage them in meaningful activities basically to keep their brains awake and running and hope to slow the process. spending full days with these residents, talking to them and playing games with them among other things, they've become my family. my second set of grandparents. i love them, and they love me too, and don't ever fail to express that to me. it is so incredibly rewarding.the worst part, however, is easily when they pass away. i cry so hard. i think about them everyday, i'm almost tearing up now just thinking about them. i mourn for their families, they knew it was coming, but it always feels too soon when its a loved one. sometimes you never know when your last goodbye will be. the disease is scary, and unpredictable. but, if you have a loved one with dementia, here is some advice for you. when someone has dementia, it means their brain is decaying, and somewhat shrinking. there are certain things that can increase your risk of getting dementia, such as mental illness, alcohol abuse, etc. to care for someone with dementia, you need empathy, patience, and compassion. one thing i've noticed is that, when i ask a resident ""can you help me?"" they almost always are willing to help. they want to feel useful. sometimes they are aware of having dementia sometimes they are not, but regardless, they want to feel as though they have a purpose still. helping to fold napkins or laundry, organizing silverware, drying the clean dishes, measuring the flour when we bake cookies, they are typically willing to help out. it makes them feel good. you cannot lose your patience and take it out on them. sometimes you have to just walk away for a moment and take a deep breathe, and try again. approach them warmly with a smile. keep them occupied, books, magazines, puzzles, crosswords. step into their world and help them to reminisce. ask them about their morals and values and beliefs. ask them what their opinion is on something. compliment them. it can help to slow the decline. not many people have time for this, and then turn to nursing homes and assisted living communities. it sort of depends. families tend to be in denial quite often, and it's most likely because they don't know much about the disease itself. research helps. the takeaway, as i said before, is to have patience, and put yourself in their shoes. when they need help to be showered or toileted, they start to lose their sense of dignity. we don't know how that feels, but that doesn't mean we can't make an effort to get a better understanding of what they are going through.and if you do decide to turn to an assisted living community, really do your research fo find the place that fits best for your loved one.thanks for reading, if anyone has questions i may have an answer.", thank you for posting that.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/syyvud/for_those_dealing_with_a_loved_one_with_dementia/,for those dealing with a loved one with dementia

my grandma up until a month ago lived on her own and was mobile. she would forget things and repeat herself often but always knew who i was. a month ago she called my dad and went to the er  because she couldn’t walk anymore. she was discharged and my brother took care of her for a night . she was hallucinating badly (new symptoms) and still not mobile. she contracted covid (most likely from er trip) so she was again sent to the hospital. while there i’m almost certain she suffered from hospital delirium as none of us were able to visit. she was discharged to a rehabilitation center and while there i visited her . she knew who i was and had her spunky personality. fast forward to feb 14 she was moved into a lovely asst living . my brother and i spent the afternoon with her last friday and she didn’t know who we were and was seeing things. she was being nice and having courteous conversation with us. my aunt and my dad visit her and she is starting to get argumentative and crying a lot. i would like any advice as this is all new. i have read through posts about a possible uti? i will have my aunt get an appt for her and also the only meds she is on is bp and blood thinner. i’ll be visiting her weds and i’m going to play some familiar music for her .thanks for your time in reading this," you can get uti test strips. it’s not a culture to see which type of antibiotic she needs, but you can see whether she has a uti or not. is she usually getting worse in the evenings? this is called sundowning. additional light in the late afternoon/evening will help a lot. also herbal tea and melatonin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/syeq7m/advice_support/,[deleted by user]
"as in the title, looking for some tips to help re-settle my dad for a short term stay somewhere else. as in my post history, i am pregnant but it's looking increasingly likely that the birth will be a c-section. this, on top of several other factors, has me 100% convinced that i can't have my dad here for 6-8 weeks after the birth while baby and i recover. i won't be able to provide the care that he needs, and it isn't feasible to have strangers in and out of my home helping with him during that vulnerable time.  so he will be resettled somewhere temporarily for 6-8 weeks.  has anyone had to relocate their loved one for a short term stay? i'd really appreciate tips and hints and help on how i break the news to him and then how to make the transition as stress-free as possible. i know it'll involve meltdowns, but i'm hoping they're only minor and subside after a few days. he's pretty hung up on the idea of getting some steroids to try and help his ""auto-immune disease"" (because he's back to being in denial about it being dementia) but his gp thankfully will not prescribe them, and i've been very firm that he won't be doing illegal drugs in my house so maybe that's an angle i could suggest? unsure.  thanks in advance x"," yes, i've used respite care for 30 days and then again for 60+ days. my advice is to have minimal discussion about it and if possible, to use an excuse that he can't refute. for instance, i would not say it's because you won't have the time or energy to give him care because he may just insist he can take care of himself and it will turn into a back and forth conversation/argument.  maybe you will need his bedroom for a couple weeks for a nurse and then it gets extended... put blame on others whenever possible: ""the doctor said i'll need a nurse for 2 weeks and made me schedule it through her office."" ""the nursing agency requires.... or doesn't allow..."" etc. also, i would wait until shortly before he's going to go to the new place to mention it to him. and stress that it's only temporary.(i don't understand your idea about the steroids?)p.s. expect angry phone calls demanding that you come get him, or saying that he is leaving or walking home, etc. be prepared to block his calls with the caregiver knowing how to reach you in an emergency.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sycuqn/advice_and_strategies_to_help_resettle_loved_one/,Advice and Strategies to help resettle loved one short-term (6-8 weeks)
"hi, i’ll try to keep this short. earlier this month my sister and i took my mom to er after not eating drinking or sleeping for 3 days. her pee was basically orange and the morning before we took her into er i tested her w an at home uti test kit that came back positive. once she was admitted to hospital we were told her test results came back “dirty” but that they were going to put her on antibiotics anyway. she left hospital 5 days later with two new prescriptions: seroquel and dronabinol. everything was going okay but a couple of days ago the agitation, hallucinations, and refusing medication food or drink started again. last night she must have worn herself out and decided to drink 3 ensures and eat some jicama thankfully. does this all seem like side effects due to the new medication regimen? my sister and i don’t know what to do, we’ve tried everything and while she was in the hospital the doctors were considering a feeding tube if she didn’t start eating which she did.  i’m looking for anecdotal support if you’ve gone through something similar or open to any suggestions to help us avoid feeling like we need to take her to the er again. thank you for reading if you made it this far."," close and regular contact with a geriatric psychiatrist was most useful for my loved one. we were able to catch stuff early on and tweak, re-tweak, and tweak again the medications and dosages to get appetite, mood, and sleeping as good as possible. example: by keeping a health journal and staying in close contact with the md, we identified and stopped 2 medications that were causing a loss of appetite. in-depth knowledge and experience with dementia is crucial and so is fine-tuning meds. this isn't the forte of er docs or of most primary care physicians.  i think you and your mom need a much better support system of geriatric mds that specialize in dementia. and an office that encourages follow-up calls, check-ins, and appointments and support whenever you need it so you don't have to get to an emergency situation which makes everything worse and recovery more difficult.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sy9510/advice_help_anything/,Advice … help… anything

"last year my father died unexpectedly (may 2021) and we put mom in memory care. it was a little difficult at first and she had a severe uti but recovered but lost her mobility. she forgot who i was so i did not speak to her for a few months but would talk to the staff to keep informed about how she was doing. then she was put in the care of a wonderful nurse practitioner who worked with dementia patients. she changed mom’s medications and it was like the sun peaking through the clouds.  bits and pieces of my mom would shine through the haze of her forgotten memories. we began to talk frequently on the phone and i was able to visit once between multiple lockdowns due to covid cases in the facility. fyi, all staff and residents are fully vaccinated and staff are tested twice a week. about a month ago mom tested positive for covid but had no symptoms or discomfort. there was one more suspected uti but the trip to the er confirmed no uit but her bladder was very full and the doctor speculated this may be a very early sign of end of life. she now has an external catheter and the staff say she seems happy and is eating. she does sleep quite a bit. but the biggest change is she cannot say many words before lapsing into gibberish. she will say i love you, and sometimes respond with “i love you more…” which she knows is funny. but she calls all of the male staff russ or jeff (my dad and brother) and the female staff by my name or mom. conversations are short because i think she gets frustrated not being able to converse.question for all the caregivers, family and professional:she has had alzheimer’s and vascular dementia for 4-5 years at least. what stage would you say she is at, and how much time do you think she has? i love her so much and hate to see her like this, and i know what the end is like. i need to sit down with my brother and start preparing him for the loss of our mother. thank you all and blessings to each of you for all your care and understanding."," i’m a clinical nurse supervisor who works with many memory care residents. unfortunately there is no good timeline. it’s very frustrating and hard, but just cherish all the time you can. i’ve had residents stay in the stage your mom seems to be in for 1-2 years and i’ve had some pass in less than 3 months. each person is so different and you never really know. i would recommend getting a hospice consultation as they are a great resource.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sy3fl4/update_on_mom_and_questions/,Update on Mom and questions

"there is no easy way to tell this story. i have been married to the same man for a little over 30 years. it hasn't been a bad marriage but it has always been a very needy one, on his part. my husband's mother was also an emotionally needy person. i didn't see this quality in my husband until i was well into the thick of our marriage. we've had a good life together, but his neediness has been exhausting over the years. add to this he is not exactly a ""go-getter."" i think his mother's self-focus left him feeling alone in childhood &amp; he essentially never grew up. step in me pragmatic mary poppins. take care of everything. make things better for everyone. i'm not as nice as mary poppins though and as i get older i'm bitter.the reason i say all this is because i'm now dealing with a situation i can't handle. my husband, i'll call him winston, was diagnosed about 7 years ago with serious dementia and was told he needs to get his affairs in order soon. it was devastating news, of course. but the catch is, it was not provided by a reliable neurologist. we later found out that he was somewhat of a licensed practicing quack.  (a story for another time). long story short his diagnosis was rebuffed by many other trusted doctors and neurologists who confirmed over and over that my winston was not in cognitive decline and in fact, he was a relatively healthy man for his age and situation. so, good news, you'd think, right? well not for winston, he couldn't shake out that original diagnosis and settled himself into a funk and self-pity. he almost immediately start focusing on everyday absent-mindedness or slow recall to sure signs that he was in the mental decline the quack doctor said he was.  i was left to manage everything in our married life. income, finances, children, medical and mental care for our family and extended family. winston, in the meantime, became a couch potato, making his incorrect diagnosis a self-fulling prophecy. however, there is more to this story. winston did not like to work. he never did. he did not want any responsibility in life. he was the jovial life of the party. everyone loved winston, he was good for laughing and up for anything fun. this is part of what attracted me to him when i was young. i came from a stoic hard-working family with very little time for fun or affection, and winston showed me a world i never knew existed. he was a way out of my tough demanding family that displayed little support and caring for each other.  it was fun for a long time until it came time to really be an adult. winston could not do it. he drifted from job to job. winston often got promoted quickly because he was so charming and witty management loved him, but in a short time, they realized that was all he was and he end up getting fired, over and over. i kept us afloat all those years. i was a good worker, just as i was raised to be. i paid the bills and got us through rough times. i found winston job after job that he'd eventually lose. i took care of the house, the repairs, the care of the children all the adult work.  i had to threaten winston i'd leave him just to get him to mow the yard and take out the trash on a regular basis.i always knew when winston's current job wasn't going well because suddenly he'd be ill. he'd start calling in sick over nothing. that was usually the beginning of the end for every job. if i was ever sick, he was sicker, no matter if it was a simple headache or pneumonia. he was sicker because not to be would mean he would be in charge and have to manage things until i got better. so now winston seems to have mci and i don't know if he really does. after years of this, i think he's just trying to get out of holding down a job, helping me around the house. his job is not difficult and it provides a reasonable income and needed health insurance. he managed to keep this job for 7 years since his false diagnosis. i don't know what to do, and sadly i don't want to take care of him. he's drained the life out of me. i'm older now and not in great health. i'd like to take care of myself instead of him. our kids are grown adults, and they seldom connect with us. i understand why, we have a sad home now, with little hope of a good outcome. i dream of just leaving winston and starting a new life somewhere far away from all of this, but i know the burden of his care will fall on the children. why should they have to deal with winston when it was my choice to marry him all those years ago?i don't know if he has mci or not, but he knows i'm fed up. my compassion is running out and i'm not sure if he deserves the compassion i've given him. he does seem to be getting worse, at least when he's around me. he can't seem to manage the simplest tasks i ask him to do from holding up a curtain rod for two seconds to shoveling a short sidewalk. i'm lost and i don't know what my next step should be, but this can't go on. i've alluded to some of the problems with winston to my close family and friends, but not wanting to burden them and be the ""debbie downer,"" i keep most of these feelings to myself. if you've read this far, thanks. i don't know what i expect in terms of help or support, but i'm not able to go to support groups without winston. i work full time and in my free time, winston is there and behaves in a way that makes me feel like i can't leave him alone."," i don't know you, but i want to give you a hug and gentle pat pat pats on your back. from me to just you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sy0ff9/58_yo_husband_showing_a_significant_decline_mci/,58 yo husband showing a significant decline MCI - but is he a faker?

"i'm going to do you all a favor and preface this by saying this is gonna be long. like, really freaking long. i'll try to keep the cursing to a minimum, but i am me and i curse a crap tin in real life.also: mods, if this rant/question/seeking support isn't applicable for the subreddit, please remove or whatever.as the title states, my bio mother has dementia. whelp, she also has parkinson's, alzheimer's, high bp, diabetes, and a slew of other health concerns/conditions. my brother and i (we're really the only ones to care for her, or that she can actively depend on) have been battling her for the better part of three, maybe four years, when she was diagnosed with early onset. this last year has seen a decline in her health, mental stability, inclination to take the necessary medication, clean her apartment, the list goes on. my guess is we're watch the last year of her life. the downward spiral for the last six months has been extremely dramatic. she fights damn near everything. not physically, yet, but that time is drawing near. and, before any of you ask, she has qualified for caregivers, but only 20hrs a month, lest she, or someone else pay for more assistance. that's not gonna happen. brother doesn't have that kind of income and i just got layed off. she refuses to pay for it, saying she ""needs"" all her money. bro and i cannot keep this up. 24/7 care is fast approaching.the thing i'm struggling the most with is that her and i have never been close (at least not since i was a 16 yo kid) and i still feel obligated to take care of her.. shit happed, caused a divide, and we've never recovered. to actually say i hate the woman wouldn't be too far off the mark. and i still stop by and care for her five days out of the week. through all the yelling, the arguments, the ""get the fuck out of my house"", the disrespect, all of it. it just drains me. and it isn't fair to her, either. she's quite clearly not herself. i try very hard not to take out my frustrations on her, but i slip up occasionally. it's been our dynamic for damn near two decades. toxic, i am well aware. part of the reason why, after becoming an adult, i never visited unless it was a family gathering. neither of us are good for each other on normal conditions. less so when she is becoming a worse human due to diseases wrecking her grey matter. i feel shitty and guilty all the damn time because of how i feel towards the woman, and i'm just saturated by all the bs she puts my little brother and i through. i know it's not going to get better. i know it's going to get worse. the brother and i tell that to each other now, almost as some kind of screwed up mantra. she wasn't a kind person to us before all of this, and it's become worse, as many of you on here have experienced. but we do for her what we can because we still care. at the end of the day, she gave birth to me. physically raised me to be a healthy kid. didn't do much mentally, but hey.... the culmination of all of this is that we reached a breaking point this last week. bio mom went off on me for whatever reason, i had a really shitty day, and i lost my cool on her. i stormed out of her apartment to the sound of her, yet again, yelling at me to ""never come by again"". i have come to my limit, and i don't know how to walk away. how to tell the family that i just can't anymore. they'll shun me, but that isn't an issue. my issue is that she'll be lacking the extra couple of hour a day that i could have been there for her. that now it'll all fall upon my brother again, minus the one hour she has a caregiver around, if she doesn't fire that person like she did the two before that a year ago. i just don't know anymore.sorry for the poor grammar and punctuation. my thoughts are literally everywhere this week. there's a lot going on.", please remember: you can *feel* guilty without *being* guilty.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sxntu1/biomom_with_dementia/,Bio-mom with Dementia
"just wanted to share my experience at the end…my dad passed away last friday february 18.  he had been stuck in bed for the past couple of months.  dad became constipated and the regular routine of metamucil, colace, and senna were no longer working.  dad was 90 years old and really suffered as this big baseball was blocking his intestines for the last two weeks.  fleet enemas did not work they only made him bleed a lot!  soap suds enemas were difficult to locate.  so hospice protocol is morphine and sorry the blockage is too far up there to reach.  i’m trying not to be so angry but all they did was make him bleed and suffer.  not the end i was expecting for him.", what should they have done?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sxnnmw/hospice_care_failed/,Hospice Care Failed
"my heart breaks right now so much because my grandfather is declining so much right now. as a family, we lost my grandmother in 2019, my grandfather was her caretaker. my aunt since then had been taking care of my grandfather with his medication, etc. but he’s been very depressed since then, understandably. his short term memory maybe in the last 6 months had been declining, then my aunt passed away from liver disease at 67. my grandfather since then has been declining in his memory, ability to eat, and ability to hold his bodily functions. my mom and my uncle have been taking turns coming out to ca from their respective states to take care of him. since my aunts passing in november, my grandfather’s memory had declined to the point where he doesn’t remember what day it is, and what was just said. this past weekend, it was my moms turn to fly to ca to take care of my grandfather. my mom has been giving him ensure drinks which he has been drinking, but things took turn for the worse when my grandfather wet all the beds in the house. my mom discovered this early in the morning, stripped all the beds to wash the sheets, and found my grandfather attempting to climb into the bed she was sleeping in. he refused to wear the depends underwear provided. i’m so sorry this is happening. and, most recently, my grandfather woke up yesterday and ended up soiling his clothes. while attempting to put the clothes in the dryer instead of the washer, he ended up falling on his stomach with nothing on. my mom is witnessing all of this, trying to help him up, trying to tell him that he put the clothes in dryer instead of the washer. she called me crying her eyes out about all of this while my uncle tried to call me to ask me if o could help. my family is against putting him in a senior assisted living facility but i feel that may need to be the case. i told my my mom to call 911 if he fell, but she had excuses for not calling (they’ll put him back in bed and he’ll stay there all day again, there’s a few that may be incurred). i provided with her with local aging resources but there’s this resistance to seeking outside help. i provided her with local caregiver in-home care resources, and nothing.i have a cousin who is coming out to live in the house and take care of him but they don’t know her qualifications, she’s been wanting to move back anyway. they informed her of the situation and she’s okay to take care of my grandfather, my family’s plan was to give her money to take care of him. she doesn’t have a job, she has major health issues, and she keeps asking for money from people to help with moving expenses —my moms partner gave her $3000 and there’s a go fund me to help her move for $2000. i’m not sure why i’m posting i’m just angered by the situation, the discomfort with seeking professional help outside the family, and letting my cousin move in rent free to a house in a major southern california city. again, i’m not sure what i’m looking for. i think my grandfather needs to be evaluated for dementia but also depression too. i’m trying to stay out of it now because my mom and uncle need to decide what’s best but i’m sad, frustrated, shocked how fast his decline is. all i want is for him to receive the proper care from a professional. my family admits they can’t do this, they’re willing to let my cousin try but he needs to be evaluated by doctor, possibly anti-depressants, and provided with things like sunlight, socialization, and stimulation besides the tv. my friend recommended my family force my cousin to go through a certification course i’m caretaking before moving in but that’s not being considered. i feel like at this point, i need to step away and put my boundaries up with the situation and that it’s not my fight. :/"," it's a little worrying about your cousin coming in.  i hope her heart's in it.it's too much for any one person really.  since the decision making seems to be out of your hands i'd just try to advocate for your grandfather.  you could volunteer to take him to an appointment, or just visit, call, facetime as often as you can.  i'm sorry, take care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sxngxf/my_grandfather_is_declining_rapidly_since_my_aunt/,"My grandfather is declining rapidly since my aunt, his oldest daughter passed, who was also his caregiver."

my great grandmother always asked where my grandfather is. i don't know what to say. please help me.," do a web search on therapeutic fibbing.  anything you read will explain it so much better than i would. most important thing is to not cause more stress or agitation with your answer. the first time fibbing doesn't feel quite right, but when they react more calmly than they would to the truth, you'll see the value.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sxkcq9/what_should_i_do/,What should I do?
"hi all, i'm (20m) new to this sub (literally just joined) and could use advice about my grandfather, ash, with dementia that i care for.to start, my grandmother abruptly passed last april from aggressive lung cancer. she took care of all of ash's needs and no one in the family knew the extent of his dementia till after she died. me needing a place to live, i moved in with him to take care of meals and medication during the evenings and have been here for 8 months. this is where i need advice. for the first time last week he started asking about my grandma: where is she? her car's not here? is she out driving?... i don't know how to approach this yet he has begun asking more frequently. i try to deflect; say idk; and change the subject (usually the about the olympics rn). i'm looking for advice about how i should approach this, maybe just reassurance i'm doing the right thing? i think it unneeded if i bring up her death if he asks, it would only cause grief for the both of us. but otherwise, idk what to say. thanks in advance🙂"," turn it back on him.  if he says ""her car's not here, is she out driving?"" say ""you're right, it isn't here, where do you think she went?""  there's no pint in telling a truth that will only cause pain.  it's not like the fact of her death was hidden from him or that telling him will prevent him from asking again.  address the emotion behind the words, not the words themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sxidxl/advice_appreciated/,Advice Appreciated.
"i read about theuropeutic fibbing from the alzheimers association and it said using white lies to guide their dementia was more beneficial than going against it. although this has been quite affective with my nan, she has begun accusing my step brother (a loving and kind man) of stealing her grand daughter away from her because she never sees her anymore and hasn't for ""years"" (which is not at all the case, she saw her months ago before they had a baby prematurely and have been looking after it for 2 months/covid restrictions kept all the family from seeing them). i tried to contest this and it went somewhat well surprisingly. but only an hour later and nothing had changed (i'm not surprised at this, but i felt i had to at least try).what should we do?"," even if she accepts your response, she will likely have the same complaints again and again because she doesn't remember. if you've found something that works, just repeat it again as if it's the first time and then change the subject. if her granddaughter visited right now, she could go back to saying the same thing again in a few hours. that's the nature of dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sxicq8/how_to_handle_harsh_accusations/,How to handle harsh accusations?

""mom"" not ""daughter"" but ""mom""... i did ask my mom about this and she said sometimes people with dementia will refer to there caregivers as ""mom"" or ""dad"" which she actually referred to my brother as ""dad"" once so her grandson... the 2nd thing is the constant ""jesus please help me""... i think about her death here and there still because of the mystery surrounding it idk what happened only she was very confused and couldnt figure out her phone to call us for help.... this disease is horrible and its incredibly sad..."," i have worked in dementia wards a long time and that is sadly very common. we had this little couple who were in their 90s, and they both had dementia. they had ten kids together but she was his mom and he was her dad",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/sxi9dl/she_called_her_mom/,"She called her ""Mom"""

"my mother was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's when she was 55 and when i was 18. she's 61 now and i'm 24, so we've been living with the diagnosis for 6 years.my question is - does anyone else experience strong memory blocks when it comes to remembering their loved one with dementia... before they had the disease?i mean, my mother was diagnosed at the end of high school. i have plenty of memories of high school, middle school, and elementary school life. i remember all the great trips my family went on. i remember what my friends and my mom's partner and other family members were like at that time.however, i cannot for the life of me remember what my mother was like (or, anything about her, really) before her diagnosis. i try to recall memories of her and i together when i was younger and, although i know there are many as she was a very loving and involved parent, i just... don't have any. i can't remember anything about my mother pre-diagnosis. when i think about all the great family trips that we took when i was younger, i remember every aspect except anything involving my mother. my mother used to drive me to school every day before i got my license, and i can't remember her or picture her ever driving a car (she obviously can't drive one now as she's in the mid-late stages). i haven't told any of my friends or family this because i'm afraid they'll think i'm crazy. they like to reminisce about what a wonderful woman my mother was pre-diagnosis and i just have to nod and smile and pretend to play along.the only thing i can come up with is that this might be some sort of fucked up coping mechanism to make sure i unconsciously keep myself from getting hurt. right now i have absolutely no connection to my mother as she feels like a total stranger to me.", >does anyone elseprobably,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6rcxsa/i_literally_cant_remember_my_mother_any_other_way/,I literally can't remember my mother any other way?
"apologies for a lengthy post, but, guys, i'm at a loss. my grandma (74) has been diagnosed with vd a year and a half ago, but we suspect she showed signs from 2012. there are only a handful of things she can do on her own now, and about a half of them she isn't as good as she used to even some 6 weeks ago. she is declining very fast. myself and my family are asking ourselves how long she's got until she can't walk and talk and think no more. because we are in the part of the world where talking about death is a taboo, the doctors are being very vague about her life expectancy and are asking us to pray for her (we are closeted atheists so we just nod away). we are staying hopeful but the fear is overwhelming all of us and we think that if we knew at least an approximate number of weeks or months of how long she's got, it will help us all cope much better.she is at stage 6. i know this isn't the place to ask such a question but, if you know of someone with vd, how quickly did your loved one decline into stage 7 all things being equal? do we have a year, 6 months, or just a handful of weeks?thank you for all your advice and support."," firstly, i'm so sorry. honestly, nothing prepares you for dementia, and nothing is quite like vd. my dad has early onset vascular dementia. he is 62, and in the past two years spiraled from working/driving/conversing to requiring full-time nursing care at a facility, incapable of speaking and spending his days in a near catatonic state. the doctors say to expect another two years, tops, if the disease progresses as it has. like you, i am an atheist living in a culture which shuns the discussion of death. my beloved grandmother (dad's mother) speaks as though he is walking around his  care facility, chatting up the residents and leading bible study. he hasn't walked in months. please keep your head up through this, and know that the fear of death, especially the death of a loved one, is so difficult for many to deal with that they need to look away. the internet is your greatest guide right now. understand the disease. because small strokes kill off brain tissue exponentially, the later years tend to be the swiftest in decay.  injuries, heart attacks, infections and falls affect vd patients more severely. get ready to make large decisions like dnr orders, compassionate care and funeral prep.i'm so sorry for you and your family. please be well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6qvd0j/life_expectancy_from_vascular_dementia_in_elderly/,Life expectancy from Vascular Dementia in elderly?

"hey guys! i just needed an outlet and this is usually where i turn. i had a very productive week. i was able to get my father admitted to the a veterans home here in town. it's amazing. it took 2 years of work and fighting but i finally got him in and the people and atmosphere are just wonderful. there's a specially dementia ward with trained staff. and it's all sponsored by the va so it's affordable. it's just a wonderful feeling. if only i could've gotten him in when he was able to enjoy what it has to offer. as of now i am trying to fill out the application to get him into the local va national cemetery and i'm having to take a break. i was digging through some papers and came across a christmas card. his handwriting wrenched somewhere deep and i've been crying since. it's the unexpected moments that hit me worst. during his admission this week i knew i would get emotional and i was able to keep it at bay. when my husband and i stopped by the cemetery yesterday to see it in person i was able to bite my lip and be ok. but the unexpected moments, when the person i remember jumps off paper or pictures at me, i lose it. thankfully i'm home alone. my husband, although he tries, doesn't know what to do when i go through this. i'd rather cry it out alone. but the time is coming and i must be prepared. i want to give him in death what life took from him. his honor and his dignity. i want people to know that he was strong and good and brave. but filling out the application for his burial plot ranks pretty high on the hard shit i've had to do since i started taking care of him. so i'll drink my beer now. and have my annual cry-a-thon. and then i'll get back to what needs to be done. anyway. i just needed somewhere to vent. thanks reddit. &lt;3"," if you don't need your partner to comfort you when you cry, maybe advise him you are having a cry, it will pass, and you want him to know these things in advance. i hate to think of you trying to hold in so much natural human experience. my partner is kinda autistic so he expects me to tell him what i need. please disregard if this is unhelpful because i am mainly trying to be supportive of your ability to self-manage as you ride these rapids of loss and grief. my best to you.

"brain longevity is authored by dr. dharma singh khalsa who is the president/medical director of alz prevention and research foundation in tuscon ar. dr. dharma promotes in this book a multi-modality approach which includes proper diet, exercise, stress management, use of supplements and herbal tonics, mind/body exercises and as needed, western medicine such as certain nootropics.of course in his book he makes claims to having much success with his multi modality approach, which makes sense to me as i believe dementia is not caused by one factor but many lifestyle choices. i am posting here because my mother is in moderate to sever decline, she was depressed and suicidal at the alf she was living at for the last 6+ years. i have her in with me now since may and i am trying as best i can to increase her quality of life.i am curious if anyone has followed this brain longevity program and if so what sort of experience did you have? i tried to search for this topic but was not successful. regardless of having used dr. dharma`s approach, what have your experiences been with supplements and nootropics such deprenyl and piracetam?the book is copyright 1997 so it may be a bit dated, the alzheimersprevention.org website might be more up to date with supplement suggestion, the website actually promotes less supplementation than the book. this is important to me to get some feedback on this aspect of treatment as i am hoping it may help my mother to be able to do the more difficult aspects of the program like the mind/body exercises. she currently has issues just laying down and putting her feet up to help her cirrculation as suggested by an acupuncturist.hopefully this post will spark some discussion.dan", hi there. what seems to be your mother's main problems? i hadn't heard of this doctor but i am going to look him up.  i've been a caregiver for several years and am now working with 1 of the most difficult patients i've ever had.  i'm trying to look at different options here. up to discuss. 😊,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6qop8h/new_anyone_follow_dr_dharma_singh_khalsa_brain/,New - anyone follow Dr. Dharma Singh Khalsa Brain Longevity program?
"hi everyone,i recently wrote a post about my grandmother sundowning. i haven't been able to fully read and reply to the responses because my grandmother is currently hospitalized. however, thank you for all your answers. so, what's going on now: once again, my grandma has lewy body dementia (diagnosed 5 years ago, sudden progression 3 weeks ago). she has been sundowning for about three weeks now. she has also had several daytime ""episodes"" of agitation and sometimes aggressiveness since then (a few each week, may last hours). during this, she wants to go home (though she is home). she was able to leave twice (once she was half dressed). we had to install deadbolts. during the episodes after the deadbolts, she gets very agitated. she may bang or kick the door, take off her clothes, urinate, yell at us, etc. she has also become aggressive if we try to stop her from leaving. after a while, we were able to keep her calm most of the day (with some episodes of agitation here and there). however, this requires us to chase her around and just give her constant attention. still, it's worth it because we see signs that my grandma is still there (singing, being loving, etc.). the daytime episodes that have occurred are pretty big, but the main issue was the sundowning. on thursday, she was supposed to go to the psychiatrist (we also had a neurologist appointment) to see if we could get some help with the sundowning. however, she had a pretty major episode and my aunt ended up calling an ambulance. she was able to calm down by the time the ambulance got there, but my aunt still took her to the hospital in hopes that she would be stabilized. i think my grandma thought she was going due to her issues with constipation.at the hospital, she received a shot of ativan in order to get a ct scan done. i made sure to stress no haldol, and i told them how she does not react well to benzodiazepines. still, she got the ativan (and i thought it was the lesser evil to haldol--as that's what they wanted to give her). after that shot, she went into delirium and started freaking out. she was admitted and since then has not been lucid at all. at this point she is constantly in her sundowning state (confused, agitated, scared, hallucinating, not recognizing us). they had her on xanax every 4 hours for 2 days. i kept asking them to change the medication, explaining that i felt it was making it worse. they did not listen to me until saturday night. i was hoping she would become lucid after it was discontinued. they then put her on seroquel 25 mg twice daily and gave her a geodon shot (which i was against). she got tremors, had her eyes closed and just kept screaming/crying/moaning the entire time (with a few 30 min to 1 hour long periods of sleep). i spoke to the psychiatrist, and he discontinued the geodon (and upped the dose of seroquel to 50 mg twice a day). there are no more tremors but she remains out of it with her eyes closed most of the time (but does not appear to be sleeping). she is not calm at all and has not been lucid since thursday afternoon. i am terrified that this hospital stay has sent my grandmother in a permanent state of delirium. she's suffering (crying for her mom, dad, her kids, etc.), and it's so hard to see her this way. i'm also scared because although she's with a sitter (at all times, so that she's always with someone even if we cannot make it there), the nurses are getting annoyed. they keep trying to give her haldol, which scares me because everything i have read states that it should not be given to lbd patients. i keep telling them not to, but it has already been ordered twice. i have asked that they put no haldol in her record and have signs all over her room that say please do not administer haldol. i'm hoping this works. i've looked up other medications (before she was hospitalized she was only on metoprolol for her blood pressure and nothing else for the dementia as nothing has helped her--benzos, trazadone, depakote, etc. have all made her worse) such as exelon to see if maybe they could give her that-- but the effect is not immediate. i'm at a loss. my question is: what do we do? has anyone had an experience like this one? did your loved one regain lucidity? did this hospital stay permanently alter my grandma? please help!--------------------------------------**tl;dr: grandma is usually lucid throughout the day (still with obvious dementia) with some daytime episodes here and there and then sundowns at night. since she's been hospitalized on thursday, she has not been lucid at all. please help**", delirious? can you ask a nurse on the unit her opinion if this could be an agitated delirium. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6qklf6/grandmother_with_lewy_body_dementia_hospitalized/,"Grandmother with Lewy Body Dementia - hospitalized for 4 days now, no lucid moments (even though she's usually lucid throughout the day at home)"
"hi all, i just discovered and began browsing this group. my dad (age 68) retired last june, and he and my mom built a new house that they moved into just after the same time. it's been incredible watching him struggle to adjust to his new surroundings, and he's completely changed in the course of a year. he even helped my husband and i move into our new apartment last july, and i can't imagine him doing anything close to that amount of physical labor today. there has been significant physical, cognitive, and mood decline that i won't go into, but doctors currently think he's either in the mid stages of lewy body dementia or frontotemporal dementia. (many of his symptoms, to my understanding, fit with the lewy body diagnosis.) it's been hard for me to accept these changes, hard to have him so far away from me, and scary to think of what's to come (and when it'll come)."," this group is mainly just palliative; all about early-stage denial and then at herculean attempts at acceptance. not much about prevention, and treatment is just whatever a doctor thinks is the paradigm after adjusting for the patient's age. your post fits right in. i'm sure you'll get the support you want, but not the support you need. cheers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6qi3j1/new_to_group_intro/,New to group - intro
"hello all,i have a 60+ year old male relative that started experiencing nominal aphasia (anomia) around 6 months ago. he doesn't show any other symptom and he is lucid.he already had a couple of visits with the neurologist and they performed a ct scan with contrast this week.nothing was found in the ct scan: no stroke, no tumor, no damage. what do you think are the next steps that the doctor would recommend? he is not in the country at the moment."," **i am not a physician.** for many years i worked for a physician who was board certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation.  this makes me familiar with many ailments and treatments, but i am speaking from my past experience, not a physicians level of knowledge or experience.  i also care for a family member with aphasia.  aphasia is a broad term.  this muddies the waters when it comes to our understanding of aphasia.   as i understand it imaging does not always show the cause of anomic aphasia.  they may try an mri next for a more detailed image or may just move to a plan of care next usually involving a speech therapy.   not all damage shows up in our current imaging options so sometimes there is not defining cause. in fact we still do not know the main cause of anomic aphasia, just factors that increase the odds of having anomia, such as damage to certain parts of the brain.  study results differ when it comes to the areas effected.  again this could be because there are many different types of aphasia and many different types of anomic aphasia.  out of curiosity have they preformed any verbal testing? if so have they determined what type of anomic aphasia he has?  i hope this has helped in some way.

"hi everyone,so my grandma is 87 years old. she was diagnosed with lewy body dementia 5 years ago. aside from confusion, memory issues and trouble walking, she also gets hallucinations as well as panic attacks (often due to the belief that she's not at her house--she's constantly asking to go home. she has escaped twice and we had to install deadbolts). she is currently living at home with my grandfather and brother. about a month ago, my grandma stopped sleeping through the night. she usually wakes up between 12 am and 3 am, terrified. she is completely out of it. she wants to leave the house (it seems like she thinks we're in danger/have been kidnapped).  if you don't let her leave, she can get aggressive and violent. she calls for her mom and dad, and she seems to be hallucinating. she spends the night screaming and banging on windows. this will last until around 7 am meaning whoever has volunteered to stay the night (we have been taking shifts lately so my brother can get some sleep) does not sleep. she also does not seem to recognize us during these episodes.she has also had the aggressive episodes during the day, but those can be avoided and are usually rare. the nighttime attacks happen every night. doctors have tried different medications (valium, temazepam, trazadone, depakote, melatonin), but nothing works. due to these episodes, my grandfather's health is deteriorating (super stressful for him---we have him in another room but he can still hear her screaming) and the rest of us can't sleep and have to deal with an incredibly sad and stressful situation. we've discussed the possibility of a home, but it's heartbreaking to think about. she is pretty calm throughout the day and there are signs that the grandma we love is still there. it's tough to send that person away. we want to do everything we can to keep her home. so, i'm writing because we're desperate. does anyone have any experience with this? what can we do?"," remember that if she lives in residence , your grandfather and other family can still spend lots of time with her during good period of the day. and she will have professioncare for difficult period, reducing burden on your grandfather. one idea that works for many people is a centre with a care unit as well as autonomous living apartments, if they can afford it. that way your grandfather would be very very nearby.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6psyc4/need_advice_on_sundowning_lewy_body_dementia/,Need advice on sundowning (lewy body dementia)

"hello all, just thought to search for this sub. 'little' bit of backstory:my grandparents, grandpa is almost 90 and grandma 85, are still married (just celebrated 66 years). they have been living very independently all of their lives. they had 5 acres and a large house in a city about 30 mins away from my mom and i. they built &amp; lived in that house for 25 years and were taking care of the property/house by themselves, which as you can imagine is quite an undertaking. last march they sold their house to move closer to us, and the house/yard is much more manageable. health history - grandpa has been managing type 2 diabetes very well, thanks to grandmas strict regimen. he has chf (congestive heart failure), his eyesight is also not good at all, is deaf in one ear and the other he has semi-working hearing aides. he drew the short stick apparently. grandma is healthy as a horse. moving on - my mom worked as a rn in a hospital farther away and would stay at their previous house the night before working and started noticing little changes in grandmas behavior. well, she was officially diagnosed with dementia about a year and a half ago, right around when they sold their house. flash forward to current situation. grandpas chf has been playing havoc on his blood sugar, which has landed him in the hospital 3 times in the last year. the third time was 3 weeks ago and he's still there. now, he has been the main caregiver for grandma since they moved to their new house, as she has been steadily declining. mom also works at a closer hospital. the original schedule (before grandpas hospital visits), was my mom would be with them on her days off to give grandpa some relief and would take them grocery shopping, doctor appointments, etc. (neither are driving). her working days i would go over right after work and make dinner, get grandmas next day clothes out, make sure meds are taken, etc. now with grandpa being so weak, we are (obviously) not expecting him to be able to watch grandma and keep himself as healthy as possible. he should be released from the hospital today or tomorrow and will have surgery hopefully next thursday to replace two valves on his heart. so, now i am at their house at 6am every day my mom works to keep an eye on grandma and either take her to a senior center before work (weekdays) or hang out with her on weekends. my moms side of this, is that she is with grandma 100% of her ""free time"", which has been involving twice a day driving her to the hospital to visit grandpa. this is tiring on both of us, especially my mom. we don't know what to do when grandpa gets released, as he is still very weak and we fear for his health. he is very protective of grandma, and tends to micro-manage everything she does. this is very stressful for him and is definitely taking its toll. my mom does not want to put them in a nursing home or assisted living, as she has experience with these places (at least where we live) not giving good service to their inhabitants. we want to keep them home as long as possible. also, grandpa would probably hate both of us if we did that - his words. needless to say, we have learned a lot about how his personality in this and it's not all positive. my mom also can be very hard on people but is very very ethical and has very high morals. my questions - what can we do next? we have had a lady coming for 5 hours a day twice a week for grandma, to clean her and do activities with her. we are lost. my mom cannot quit her job to be a full caregiver and i cannot either, even if i had her medical skills. i am married and my wonderful husband has been great throughout all of this, and my dad (they've been divorced 25 years) has been helping out a bit also. that's a touchy subject. no other family to assist. can anyone give any insight on a next step for us? not involving a nursing home or assisted living facility, please. that is the absolute last choice after we have exhausted all other resources. sorry for the long post, we have a lot going on. thank you kindly for any advice."," also, i would say my grandma is mid stage, between level 5-6 on the reisberg scales seven stages of dementia.

"this is breaking my heart. my mom has had ad for 12 years now, but she started smart and has declined slowly. my dad has always been a narcissist, but as his health declines, he is getting much worse. he didn't allow any in home care for her, and instead tried to use her to be his aide so he could stay in the house, which obviously couldn't work as she couldn't remember what task she was supposed to be doing for him. now he is in the hospital on psych hold for threatening to kill her, the police and himself. it turns out that had been beating her and not feeding her. mom is helpless and after attempts to keep her in my house, i have found a great memory care unit for her. she is going today. the issue is, my dad doesn't care what happens to her anymore. he was only using her to be his aide, and now that he is in the hospital and has real aides, he has not once tried to contact her, and the one time i brought her to visit him, he barely talked to her. being around him agitates her, and she shakes and withdraws even more. she, though, doesn't remember or understand, and asks about him often. how do i deal with this? i have told her that he could move to the same facility after he is done with the hospital and rehab, which is technically true, though i don't think he would do it, or even that it would be a good idea, but it still feels terrible to know that she is likely not going to be with him anymore, and that will hurt her."," you just need a change of perspective. look at it this way, she will forget him frequently, and eventually she won't think about him nearly at all. but right now she is in a safe place and she is free of his tyranny and abuse. do not move him to the same facility. she has a chance for good quality of life, a safe place, and probably the opportunity to make friends. she will be sad and confused. and that's typical of all people who suffer from memory loss illness. but she *deserves* to live the rest of her life without him, without suffering his abuse and being hungry. confusion is hard enough but add that to it and it's just horrible. the big thing here is *you* must not fixate on her worrying about where he is. just tell her he is at a place like she is being taken care of and leave it at that. if she persists in asking redirect her as you would a child. this is probably best for all you and will be a big adjustment. there are probably free classes and group meetings for folks like you who need more info and tips on coping with big family changes like this. i wish you all the best.

"up until october 2016 my father was perfectly healthy and functioning. halfway through the month he just couldn't get up. he had no energy to move his head or even hands.  this would last 1-7 days at a time and then he would bounce back.  it very quickly turned into him having trouble chewing, swallowing, and digesting.  he shuffles as he walks off-balance and has fallen several times with the scrapes to prove it.  he spends most of his days in a recliner watching television and hating life.  he is(was) one of those popular, friends with everyone, be nice to everybody you meet kinda guys, but now most of what he says about other people is extremely negative.  a lot of what he says is lies as well, but i think unintentional.  for example, he told his friends and our family that i haven't spoken to him in a really long time, but i call 4-5 times a week and always ask to come over.  has anyone seen this fast of a progression?  i keep reading about it taking 5+ years to get to this point.  his mother died after a long long battle with lewy bodies, and i have been remarking over the last month that he reminds me of her in her final two years.  just really wondering if anyone else has seen it move this quickly.  thank you."," yes, i don't think it's very common, but lewy body disease can progress quickly. my dad was perfectly fine on father's day of last year. he drove regularly, was in a band, and had no health problems other than a bit of forgetfulness and typical old age stuff (he was 86). two weeks after father's day, he went into er due to kidney failure (that came out of the blue after taking a drug called trospium prescribed to him for frequent urination). after that it was a quick up and down (mostly down) spiral. while in the hospital, he came down with sepsis, c-dif, became incontinent, and had one uti after another. his mental and physical state declined quickly and he lost a bunch of weight.he had hallucinations, visual disorders, was angry and paranoid, couldn't find the right words, had sundowners, and had all the hallmark symptoms of lbd. it was horrible and we never did get a diagnosis (or much help) from his doctor or neurologist. nobody even mentioned lbd, even though i wrote down all his symptoms and gave it to the doctors. he passed away 4 months later of blocked ureters and kidney failure. it was horrible to see him go through this and feel so helpless.  i'm so sorry that you're going through this with your dad.

"my grandfather has dementia. he also has diabetes and he does a terrible job at keeping his sugar levels where they are supposed to be. we also found out he hasn’t paid his taxes in 4 years. good news is he has zero debt. owns his house and car. also has 250k in a savings account and 3 rental properties.it's hard to describe how bad it is. some days he thinks its 1990 and he's still building houses (he was a contractor and built houses for a living). other days he’s up to date with everything (my life, his daughter (my mother). but everyday he is stubborn. he was born very poor but ended up doing pretty well for himself.he still drives (passed the required il written and driving portion last week) and this aspect scares me. it seems like a huge liability.my mother has been helping him out for a while, but its starting to take a toll on her. she comes over and cleans the house every weekend. she helps put the medicine in the respective pillboxes. and one final thing she does is withdraw money from his account (she has poa) and puts cash (in small bills) in his wallet so he has spending money.lately he started a fiasco by yelling and verbally abusing my mother. he accused her of doing things that he did when he got divorced 25 years ago (my mother just recently divorced). he called me and tried to get me involved but started getting teary and said he just wished my mom would stop doing the “alleged things” (i know for a fact my mother doesn’t do cocaine and hire prostitutes). he ended the conversation saying that he is taking his finances back over from my mom, and is changing his will entirely. my mom took him to the doctor this am and the sugar level was 4x over where it was supposed to be. so moral of the story, his worst times are when he slacks on the sugar level. it also has made my mother afraid of him.here’s what im getting at.1)	this is really starting to bog down on my mom. i told her she has to go to a cpa and get the whole tax situation figured out. she doesn’t want to because shes afraid he can get in trouble. i don’t want to overstep but i know this is a huge no no. help?2)	we tried assisted living but he made it very difficult for everybody. other than the location, and the house layout, it was identical. we repainted the walls, brought in all the furniture, hung all the same pictures, etc. he likes the freedom at his house. how do we bring it up that this is probably the best option?3)	finances. other than the tax issue, what the heck do we do? i really don’t think he’s in shape to manage the rental properties anymore. even remembering to go to the bank to get cash is a bad idea imo because he has to drive.4)	any other advice?we let this situation go from bad to worse. i understand that i’m a grandson and young (m/27) but this is only going to get worse. thanks everybody."," could he be convinced to see elder law attorney or estate planner? this may help initiate the process to relinquish responsibility while giving him control, or the appearance of. getting his blood sugars under control will greatly improve his cognition. keep in mind he has risk factors for vascular dementia, which is more of an issue of misremembering rather than loss of memory.the longer you can keep an older person in their home, the better. many alfs look nice, but don't really provide the assistance to solve problems to improve their function. be calm and empathetic with him, and i would always ask myself, ""how would i react if thought i was losing everything or people were taking it from me?"" have you looked at occupational therapy services in his home. i believe medicare will pay (with md order) to evaluate his home and give plans for him to function better in his environment.

he is in his mid 80's and spent a solid month in a behavior unit at a hospital being evaluated in order to adjust his medication and see what worked best for him. thereafter he was discharged to a nursing home with a locked unit for dementia patients. he has been at this location for about a month but recently got into an altercation with another resident. i've noticed that the honey moon period seems to be wearing off as his behavior is returning to aggressive after being discharged from the hospital. the nursing home suggested (due to their concerns for their staff and patients) placing him elsewhere. what other options are there? he is a wanderer so he must be in a locked unit. they suggested at home care but i do not think it's an option. seeing strangers come into his home would turn him more volitile and he would think they were intruders as he did with my mother. the hospital would not give me other ideas/suggestions other than placing him in a nursing home when he was being discharged. i'm unsure where else he can be placed.," if you are in the us, please make an appointment with your nearest alzheimers association location and explain. they can often help you figure out alternative places. also, consider an elder care consultant who can be more honest about their opinions of the different homes. this sounds like a nursing facility my fil was in at first. he was in a locked unit, and they were horrible. every 30 days or so they would manufacture an excuse to send him to a psychiatric hospital for ""suicidal threats"" (even though he lacked the mental capacity to remember or plan). the reality is, they didn't want to deal with an ambulatory man because they are strong and more work, and this place was in the habit of parking all the wheel chairs in front of the tv and ignoring the residents. it tuns out the timing was just short of the time where the law says they have had to have a care planning meeting with the family and make longer-term plans for the resident: as long as they could ship him off to psych they could restart the clock as they tried to get rid of him. my advice is to look around at other places. ensure they are really there for memory care/alzheimer's, and not just a locked wing of a nursing home. there is a big difference in the way that they handle and care for residents due to training. my fil does strike out once in a while (in fact, he did so this weekend) but good staff will know how to handle it and how to diffuse the situation, and will know when additional medication is warranted for everyone's safety. finally, if you father is a veteran, consider a veteran's home. they are run by the states, not by the va, but can be an inexpensive alternative.

[deleted]," i'm sorry. this is going to be hard and probably only get harder. are you in the us? if so someone should apply for emergency guardianship. a lot of medical services would be free for her if you could get her on medicaid or medicare. you need a lawyer to file the motion with a court and there will be an evaluation. usually they come to the home. there will also be a medical eval and she *will* have to go, regardless of whether she wants to or not. you need this ruling though, because it will give you decision making power for all aspects of her life. money, medical stuff, where she lives, what bills she will have etc. it's exceptionally important. the key with people like this is that you can't see them as mom or dad. they are a kid and they need to do what is asked of them when it's asked. my dad and i fought a lot but once i got him the right meds i'd be damned if he didn't take them. i'd stand there and hand him one pill at a time and eventually he'd be so annoyed i was standing there he'd just take them. a lot of her behavior may change once she's properly medicated. do try and get guardianship/conservatorship. it's hard work and it's a huge pain in the ass but if you aren't checking her into a nursing home this is the step you need to take.

"so, my grandfather has had a bunch of problems over the last ten years. a couple of strokes, a heart attack. kidney problems... every time he came out of hospital, he'd just be a little bit different. in the last year or so, he's become both paranoid and depressed. we haven't managed to get a diagnosis of dementia because he's still very cunning in what he tells doctors, but most of them have come to understand that he's not in his right mind in some way. and we've just come to call it dementia anyway. he's also got the standard memory lapses, and has had them for some time. but he's become convinced that doctors are trying to kill him, and he occasionally threatens to kill himself. this isn't helped by the fact he doesn't get out much, due to balance issues and our location; and isn't willing to eat much due to a lack of appetite. so, my question is, does this sound like it is actually dementia? or something else? and, moreover, how can i help him? "," paranoia and change in apetite can absolutely indicate dementia. just a few things though (and remember, i'm not a doctor, just someone who lives with my grandma who has vascular dementia).- do you know what kind of doctor your grandpa sees? does this person have experience with gerontology (meaning elderly issues)? my parents switched my grandparents to a gerontologist when they began developing aging issues.- the type of paranoiayour description of the paranoia sounds more like manic bipolar/schizophrenia than my grandma's paranoia. my grandma's paranoia tends to be an exaggeration of everyday anxieties most people brush away after a second, like fears about her house getting robbed (an extremely unlikely situation for multiple reasons, but still sort of an understandable fear). in contrast, your grandpa's concern about doctors are killing him sounds like the elaborate/esoteric accusation i've heard from people experiencing psychotic episodes during severe schizophrenia or manic episodes. the few times my grandma has accused people of plotting against her, it's sounded more like the accusation of a frustrated teenager and it never gets unweildy or detailed--""why does my daughter go through my bills once a month? even if i did pay a bunch of late fees before she and my son-in-law began balancing my checkbook every week, it's my business if i'm forgetting to pay bills on time. they're so nosy and need to let me run my life!"" notice that even though there's a whiff of frustration in this type of complaint, it's not really detailed or esoteric or even all that unreasonable. but again, i am not a doctor. - it gives me pause that your grandfather can fool his doctor. your grandfather's ability to fool his doctor could possibly indicate that he might have better short-term memory/awareness than the average person with dementia. my grandmother's dementia is relatively mild compared to other cases, but other people immediately notice that she forgets new details extremely quickly and struggles to focus on anything for too long. even if she wanted to fool someone, i feel like she would get distracted and forget her plan. she is aware some of her fixations (like barricading the doors at night to prevent robbers from coming in) are weird, but she goes on about other weird things to strangers that she would have kept to herself in the past.  that said, it is totally possible that your grandfather may not be as debilitated as my grandma, or maybe his doctor is too busy to notice, or maybe his doctor is too inexperienced with dementia issues to notice. i just can't imagine my grandma having the concentration to fool anyone because she's just so debilitated by her condition. and remember, she's a *mild* case of dementia, so she's one of the more active/independent people you'll read about on this sub.again, i'm not a doctor. however, an experienced gerontologist might be invaluable going forward. my parents also obtained power of attorney.

"this last week i had to hear my mom, who already suffers from dementia, broke her back. the doctors all they could tell me is that it was a compression fracture and there was nothing they could do. see mom is 57, she has a slue of various issues as we call them. she is 57 and has the body of a 90 year old. frail, confusion, fear, anger, and total exhaustion are the words i can describe my mom this week. see when mom are these words she lashes out. when she lashes out it's the 5 year old i get to deal with, she can't form specifics to why she hurts she just does, things were thrown and she uses words that normally do not describe me in anyway,but today july 2nd i went to the er again for the second time in 1 week mom because mom had told her assisted living staff her chest hurt and she had problems breathing. to them it's a very big red light. so they did what they needed to do and called 911. i know mom was hurting from her broken back. breathing or any necessary function with a broken back will hurt. my whole point of this is when you feel like giving up, because that 5 year old told you that she is glad you can't have kids, or that she is glad no one wants me or loves me, or even that she wishes that she was dead so she didn't have to be around you, remember it's not her..its the disease it is the evil soul stealing disease of dementia. do not ever let those words or actions steal those precious moments from you when she is your mother again. because in the end she will not remember but you will and you will need those happy and fond memories when the sun isn't shining in your life and all you need is your mommy. love her, hold her when her sun is fun, and always be her saving grace."," oh my, i'm so sorry. thank you for writing, i needed to hear that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6kxwrs/fed_up/,Fed up...
"my mother is 61 and has suffered from cognitive issues for 25 plus years. i am not sure where the line between neurodegenerative and mental illness is, but i know that her long decline and the presence of psychological issues is making a diagnosis very difficult (see below for current symptoms). i apologize for the length of this post. bear with me… backstory: 2005 cognitive symptoms still mild. took her to numerous neurologists and for neuropsychological testing. in short, they said she was depressed (she was a lot of things, but not depressed). 2015- 2016 severe and sudden deterioration. new neuro. no new answers.feb. 2017: really deteriorated &amp; requires constant supervision. june 2017: second new neurologist specializing in parkinson’s (strong family history of parkinson’s and i thought maybe lbd?)  during exam, mom incorrectly answered questions about personal history. neuro focused on psychological aspects of my mother’s symptoms to the exclusion of her cognitive issues. repeatedly asked mom about childhood trauma (there was none) and if decline was linked to periods of stress (it was not).  neuro said she doubted parkinson’s and said mom likely had a “functional neurological symptom disorder” (aka conversion disorder or “hysterical neurosis.”) referred her for neuropsychological testing. my concerns:1.) i have strong reservations with conversion disorders as an illness at all. it originates from the ancient concept of the “wandering womb” where women’s physical illnesses were believed to arise from the uterus traveling around the body. freud popularized conversion disorders (aka hysteria) for the western world, suggesting that repressed emotional traumas manifested as physical symptoms; particularly for women. now it is considered a neuropsychological condition that seems to be a catchall for anything doctors don’t understand. it is disproportionately applied to women both historically and in the present. here is the authoritative website on it:  2.) even if this is a legitimate diagnosis my mother doesn’t fit any of the diagnostic criteria it purports to use: no childhood trauma, declines did not correspond to periods of anxiety, instead of symptoms appearing suddenly &amp; gradually improving her’s emerged gradually &amp; suddenly worsened. instead of symptoms going away in a brief period, they have worsened over decades. the only symptoms that “fit” are the generic ones that could be used to diagnose any one of us (like headache, fatigue, or pain anywhere ever). questions/advice:with that said, anyone have experiences with conversion disorders/diagnosis of? should i cut my losses now and go to a different neurologist? if so, suggestions on what to look for in the next one? or should i get the neuropsychological testing and see if the doctor’s mind changes with that? should i lie to the next neuro about the long history of decline/psychological components in hopes they take her more seriously? as a woman, i am experienced with concealing aspects of my life to ensure i am given proper care. what is a neurology appointment like when they believe your symptoms are real? do they always refer to a neuropsych or only when they think you are crazy?my mother’s symptoms do have a behavioral and psychological component to them. trying to parse out if a neurodegenerative disease caused her mental health issues or if someone with mental health issues now has a neurodegenerative disease is tough. with that in mind, how do you find a doctor that will have the intellectual curiosity to try to separate these issues out rather than let their bias blind them?

"recently my mother was diagnosed with alcoholic dementia aka wet brain. we're not quite sure yet how long she has been living with it, because she was living alone, but i believe it's been quite some time. somehow, it's an absolute miracle and i don't even believe in that sort of thing, she has been able to successfully live alone without any major car accidents or anything of the sort, up until recently when she fell down the stairs of her home and was sent to the hospital for some broken bones. it was there that they discovered the horrendous state of her liver and brain (liver failure so bad it had led to ascites) which have both regressed so much she has now been diagnosed with dementia.anyway, long story short, i have some basic questions that might not even have absolute answers to them but hopefully someone can at least provide advice. please bare with me, i am entirely new to this situation, never having dealt with anyone having dementia before. the two most prominent symptoms she is showing are severe short term memory loss and the creation of false memories.when my mother discusses/vocalizes a false memory, is it more beneficial to play along with the false memory and pretend to believe her as if it actually happened (asking friendly questions, showing proper emotions as if the story were true, etc), or is it more beneficial to attempt to shine light on how illogical the story/memory is in an attempt to show my mother it never took place?my thoughts are that if i were to play along, it would obviously make her feel happy and wanted and all that but i'm thinking it would also almost help her brain to continue to run wild. if i were to shine light on how illogical it is, it might confuse her and further her depression, but it could also help to get her to try and think logically. i'm assuming there is no direct answer and if anything, an attempt at shining a light on the illogical will be a waste of time, but again, i'm entirely unfamiliar with these circumstances. thanks in advance for any recommendations."," your mother is actually exhibiting signs of wernickes / korsakoff syndrome. it's caused by a thiamine (b1) deficiency. her 'lies' are actually her brain filling in blanks or confabulating. i strongly suggest you get her doctor to begin iv treatments with thiamine. this status could be reversed if treated aggressively and immediately. i am not a doctor. i am a full time caregiver for my friend who went through the exact same thing but did not receive proper treatment. now she is 37 years old and will be permanently brain damaged for life. i implore you to research this and get her to a doctor that will listen. and by the way, you might as well go with the story as your mother totally believes what she is saying. if you try to show her the truth it will only cause a fight because she will defend her position adamantly. with thiamine treatments you could potentially make this stop. good luck.

"my mother has been diagnosed with dementia and schizophrenia. she is in her late 70s.my dad, 5 years her junior is still very active. he does not want to get any support and takes her along to anything he does, as she cannot be on her own at home anymore. is this good bad, how can i argue with him. some examples: * my parents have 2 homes and regularly go on holiday. but my mother is only fully aware of where she is in her main home, which she grew up in. * other than a very complex, but routine breakfast that has moved from 7 am to as late as 11 am depending on how long it takes my dad to prepare it, my parents have started eating at times that suit my dad, often having lunch at 6 pm only and skipping dinner.* my dad tries to do brain training exercises with her but only does so very irregularly. my mother is currently not capable of putting a 16 piece jigsaw together by herself, but instead of trying this over and over again, he introduces different games almost daily.  * my dad is now challenged by the sailing boat they used to have due to its size and him having to operate it all single-handedly. my mother actually fell off this boat last year and injured herself, yet this year he insists on a smaller boat, easier for him to handle but much harder to balance on and a higher risk for my mother.* i moved abroad - and due to my mother's absolutely shabby behaviour towards my spouse, i cannot really ever move back home unless i get divorced. my parents never really visited us, but last year my dad decided it was okay. my mother was mentally unable to disagree - actually said she was looking forward to it. when she arrived here and saw my wife she completely forgot all that. she never ever looked at my wife, did not recognise me and mistook me for a family friend who has a terrible personal tragedy and kept addressing me (male) with the friends (female) name. we could not change the return journey and it was a terrible week for all of us. yet - my dad still wants to come back here this year even though i will much rather spend the time with them at their home.i'm really looking for arguments to use with my dad. if i look at dementia care here, people tend to only have one home and spend their time there, they try to build a repetitive schedule and avoid major distractions. i'm not sure this is right, but what is the impact of almost permanent flux in the schedule of a dementia patient?tl;dr;* is it correct to force a dementia patient into permanently changing schedules and activities?* if yes or no how do i best address this with a very active spouse who is her carer who neither wants to let go of his activities nor get any help for her care?"," routine is important and avoiding changing surroundings helps keep the patient less confused and will generally help with the symptoms. it sounds like your dad is having a tough time accepting your mom's illness and her new limitations. you have to approach this with some empathy. your dad isn't trying to make life more difficult for himself or your mom, he's having a hard time accepting the disease and that your mom can't leave the house anymore unless its truly necessary. it's possible that he feels trapped and doesn't want to be stuck at home taking care of her every need, it's a very tough burden to carry. it belongs to your dad and not you.  my recommendation is that you talk to your dad and do your best to listen to his concerns and find out why he's in denial of your mom's condition and limitations. can they afford to have someone help take care of her at home? maybe assisted living at some point?  getting some help at home can help your dad keep a somewhat active lifestyle and not put your mom in danger.  if your dad is just being stubborn and won't take any advice, you're going to have to be firm in your feedback and not allow them to visit you if you believe it puts your mom in danger. offer to visit them, maybe even more often, but you need to set some ground rules. you can't control what he does, but you can control how/when you see them.  are they seeing a doctor to treat her condition? maybe get them involved if possible.  no one ever reacts ""great"" when a loved one faces dementia. we all handle it as best we can and sometimes our love for the person blocks us from comprehending just how bad things have gotten.  i don't want to be pessimistic, but you may need to prepare yourself for things to get much worse before your dad realizes he needs to make major changes to his lifestyle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6h2eas/arguments_for_and_against_routinesupport/,Arguments for and against routine/support

"my grandfather, 89, was just diagnosed with dementia. my grandmother, 89, still tries to take care of him. they both still live at home together. this past week, she fell and broke her arm and had to have surgery. she will not be able to lift anything for about 6 months.  the trauma of her breaking her arm has sent my grandfather spiraling down. this morning my grandfather could not find any of his things. he was looking for his wallet in the fridge and swearing someone came into his house in the night and took everything. my grandmother is still in the hospital recover from her surgery. it is at a point where we need to seriously consider moving them into an assisted living facility. are there any good resources for knowing how best to help with the process of moving them?i'm their 33 year old grandson."," sooo, now my real answer.first things first. i understand that you grandmother won't be able to take care of her husband, now that she is injured. that doesn't mean that both of them need to go into a nursing home, it strongly depends on how well they managed before her accident. if your grandmother is oriented, meaning, doesn't have dementia, and she managed well with him, you could consider a short-term place in a nursing home until the arm of your grandmother healed properly. often, old couples work so well together that they can easily find coping mechanisms together, even until the latest stages of dementia (if only one of them has it, of course). his downward spiral shows that very well - he always was with her, and now that she is in the hospital and he is alone, all his machanisms stop working, and he withdraws deeper into desorientation. i would bet that after she comes home, he get's a lot better in only a couple of days.  even if that doesn't seem possible, i would only cosider your grandfather for a nursing home, not your grandmother. if she was able to manage her household until now, she will be able to do so after her arm recovers, given the proper physiotherapy. moving her into a nursing home would only worsen her live quality without the need to do so, and i would alwas see a nursing home as the last option, not the first (and i am saying that as someone who had, all together, 4 months of internship in two different nursing homes. believe me, you would really consider that as the last option, even if we talk about the good ones). if she is not able to care for herself with a broken arm, which isn't that uncommon in her age, you could consider a home nurse or similiar services, coming in two or three times a day, helping with basic hygiene, cooking and cleaning. i don't know how it is in your country, but here, the costs are prety much the same as a nursing home, and after those 6 months, you could simply stop those services. if you at least consider moving you grandfather into a nursing home, termporarily or permanently, i would search for some that are spezialised on dementia, eiither working with the validation-techniique of naomi feil (and not only havin the two hour basic course on validation and saying ""we do that"", but having staff that actually is certificated to do so, because getting the certificaate takes some time) or the three world model. nursing homes where they simply throw physically restricted people and people with dementia together most often don't provide a good quality of care, especially for the latter group. there are a lot of different reasons for this and it would be too long to write them all down, but in short, you would really want to consider a specialised nursing home to give your grandfather the the professional care and live quality he deserves. also, you would want to consider that said nursing home is as close to their former house as possible, because this both helps your grandparents seeing each other more often, which will be good for the mental health of bot of them, and it helps to keep your grandfather in an aera he knows, to give him orientation and stop the worsening of his symptoms (which often accurs after moving into a nursing home) at least a little bit. i hope this helps.

"so my mother has a form of dementia, almost certainly caused by alcohol and drug abuse. for the past couple of years she had been getting progressively more sick. at the moment she can't get dressed, eat, shower herself, read, write, or use phones. about two years ago, when she first started getting sick i tried to be her carer. this didn't work for many reasons. 1) is that i have fairly severe c-ptsd and an anxiety disorder, and my symptoms are triggered by being around her, as she was my main abuser. she is no longer physically abusive, in part due to her illness, but i got much much more mentally ill when she was living with me2) is that i live in the town i grew up in- ie: the town she regularly abused drugs and alcohol for 10+ years. she is a runner, and i would often get up in the morning to find her gone, and only find her either at one of her old ""friends"" homes, or when the police brought her home because she was lost. this was, understandably i think, pretty stressful. using drugs or getting drunk made her mental faculties much worse. 3) with the advancement of her illness i just couldn't give her the care she needed. i needed to be there for her 24/7 and i simply didn't have the ability to do that (especially since the compensation for that was $125 a fortnight, which nowhere near covered her expenses, let alone the rest that i wasn't able to add to because i was her full-time carer)4) she also just. didn't want to be there. she found me too controlling (since i didn't want her getting drunk or stoned) and was constantly looking for a way out, including making plans with other extended family members without informing me. in the end, she tried to check into a rehab and was told she was too sick to be there, and recommended her a home. that place sucked, as did the next one. we've (my wife and i) finally found one that seems to really work for her. she isn't getting better, but the decline had slowed down considerably. it's a 40 minute drive from where i live, and due to fuel and my own mental health i am only seeing her every 3/4 weeks, usually at which point she'll stay the night at my house (and i'll get up at 4am so she can't escape while i'm asleep). we're both students, we don't have any real spare money, but much of it goes to her. i have an older brother and younger sister (30 and 21- i'm 25) and they have virtually nothing to do with her. they have a lot to say about the things i do for her, and are always saying they should go and see her or call or anything, but they just don't. this is all pretty hard. what has gotten harder is that she now blames me. she calls me her jailer, not just to me, but to any extended family who occasionally call. she constantly talks about how she can be living on her own, and that i'm keeping her there. my brother and sister can do no wrong to her, and any time they deign to spend with her is treated like a blessing, but when i go the first thing she does is yell and then cry and then usually yell some more. my friends are fond of saying ""you don't owe her anything, you don't need to be doing all that"" and that's all very well and good, and i understand where they are coming from, but if i withdraw my support she'll have no-one. no-one will put in even a fraction of the effort i put in. so no. i can't just cut her off, regardless of how much she hurts me. i'm wondering if anyone has been in similar situations, and whether you have any advice on how to deal with the pressure?", it's done.  the process of turning from your mother into not your mother into a corpse has already begun and there is no coming back.  she sounds toxic.  sever.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6fzghc/dealing_with_my_mother_with_as_much_patience_as_i/,Dealing with my mother (with as much patience as I can)

"my father has an undiagnosed memory problem that is either alzheimer's, dementia or something very similar.  very early signs showed themselves about one and a half years ago.  he's at the point where he can't be left alone and cannot care for himself. he cannot to the following on his own: take daily medication, prepare food, drive, pay bills, go to the bathroom, remember where he is or how he got to where he is, and is now not remembering names of immediate family members.  i'm from an extremely dysfunctional family and escaped from this family when i was a teen (many, many years ago).  out of all my siblings i'm the most high functioning - all the others lived on the street all or most of their lives and have had very bad drug problems.    i can't be my father's care taker for the next couple of decades.  although i am considered ""normal"" by my siblings who expect me to to care for my father (simply because they're too dysfunctional to do so themselves)  -  i struggle to pay my rent and live my own day-to-day life.  if i were to become my father's caretaker the disruption in my life would impact my ability to remain employed - and continue progressing in a positive way.   the huge problem is that we don't have money.  i'm the only one that has a savings account in the family - but it isn't that much.   there's no way i could ever afford paying for a nursing home.    so, i've abandoned him.  to some extent i justify this by the fact that i was abandoned and grew up in a very unstable environment - forcing me to flee when i was young.  i never got any support from my immediate family - it was always the opposite - my immediate family has always been caustic.   getting away was the only way i could salvage myself from becoming like they are - embroiled with serious problems.     yet, there's still a part of me that remembers that part of my father i did like.  i'm conflicted - because i hate my father too - i hate him for all the things he's done to me - and all the things he allowed to happen in my home when i was a child and could do nothing about it.   but, i still feel guilty.  i feel like i'm now a horrible person.  "," i know where you're coming from and you're not a horrible person. it's unbelievably difficult and psychically painful to be put in the position of ""caring"" for an abusive parent. my abusive mum (90yrs) is slowly heading down the same path as your father and is currently resisting moving to an assisted living scenario. not sure what i'll do when she really loses it. i can hardly stand to spend 3 hrs with her once a week. wishing you the best of luck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6eaw2z/i_cant_be_my_fathers_caretaker/,I can't be my father's caretaker

"my mother [64f] was recently diagnosed with early-onset alzheimer's. in addition to the painful was of seeing her deteriorate and trying to get her set up in assisted living, i am struggling to cope with the implications that this diagnosis may have for my own future.as most of you know, there are three chromosomal mutations (app, ps1 and ps2) that account for roughly 60-70% of early-onset alzheimer's cases. if a parent has one of these mutations, a child has a 50% chance of inheriting it.while i struggle with the decision regarding whether to undergo genetic testing for these mutations myself, i suppose i'd just like to hear any ""positive"" stories out there from people who had a parent with eoad, but who have not developed it personally. of course i am aware statistically that there are such cases, but right now i have an overwhelming sense of doom and emotionally feel as if i am 100% guaranteed to develop this awful disease in about 25 years. any anecdotes whatsoever to the contrary would be appreciated.", that's *barely* early onset. most early onset is in the 40s and 50s. 65 is when we just say alzheimers. i would say do not get tested. there's nothing you gain from that knowledge right now. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6e7yf1/anyone_not_get_earlyonset_themselves_after_a/,Anyone NOT get early-onset themselves after a parent had it?
"i have a familiar with dementia. she is long gone, with only subtle moments of clarity here and there. most of her mind is gone, most of who she is. i love her very much. for my first 18 years of life, she was the world to me. then dementia kicked in... i got to say goodbye, even. but.. now she's hospitalized, i can't bring myself to visit. not that i don't love her, i cry almost every night for this, it hurts. i just can't. i don't want to remember her like this. i don't want to visit the ghost of who she was. im on the verge of being hospitalized myself for depression, and every time i see her i feel worse, and worse, just as she gets worse too. yet i feel guilty about this. i don't know what to do, or how to cope with this anymore. my family only adds to this guilt, talking with others about what a terrible person i am.the last time i saw her and she was... well, herself, she told me ""don't ever listen to our family, they will always try to make you feel bad. from now on, always look out for you, and know that i will love you forever, as i always did. just be happy, my love"". i'm hanging on, with this, but i still feel like i'm betraying her, or abandoning her. i don't know if i should suck it up and visit her anyway or hide away like i'm doing trying to think she died a year ago, just like her mind did.  truly, dementia is so, so horrible."," what about sending cards? you could write monthly, and tell her what you are up to. don't address her illness or how much you miss who she was - rather, tell her about your new shoes and the restaurant you visited. send the card with the mindset that she will read it in moments of clarity and be aware of your love. pick out notecards with art you know she'll love. don't bother yourself with whether or not she reads or retains them.  if you can't go, send her your love instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6e5wb7/i_cant_visit_her/,I cant visit her

"my grandma is in the early late stages of dementia and requires around the clock care. the last 7 months have been really difficult as my grandpa experienced a rapid decline in health. over these 7 months he was in and out of hospitals and rehabs. he survived a code and though his mental health didn't suffer it took a while to rebuild his physical strength so he could come home.  he came home towards the end of march and still required a fair bit of care. once home, his presence really just helped to settle my grandma. she felt more secure and at home with him being home.  at the beginning of may he went back into the hospital after spiking a fever. it soon became apparent that he had  a blood infection that had spread to his heart and that he probably wouldn't make it. he passed away on the 20th and we tried to prepare my grandma for this as best as we could.  she had some really good days and bad days leading up to his death. since his passing she's had good and bad days but i'm not sure how much of it she comprehends. she refused to go to attend his viewing but did attend his funeral mass and graveside. she just seemed really aloof to what was going on at the funeral. which i guess is a blessing and curse. she's asked where he was a few times since and other times acknowledged his death. i don't think through this all has she really gotten upset  which i think was something we all expected after 63 years of marriage.  i'm afraid she's going to wake up and realize what's happened but i think i'm almost more afraid that she won't. i don't want her to have to be upset about anything. however, it's just something i'm struggling with. she hasn't cried once about his passing but she cried because she thought she had messed her shoes up today. i'm just having a hard time coping with how she's handling this."," one of the first things i noticed with my dad was the ability to really conceptualize new facts.  even if *knew* someone had died, it seemed to be an utterly foreign concept to him- very much like a small child.

is it legal for a nursing home to take away someone's walker? they claim the person is pushing the walker into others and into walls on purpose.," not from canada, but as dar as i know the laws should be pretty much the same around the world. they can, if having the walker means danger for them or other people (i.e. they are trying to kill themselves with it. the chance of falling while using it is not a reason to take it away fron them). and if they do, they need to back that decision up by a lawyer. if they are doing it without, it is highly illegal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6dn82e/in_canada_can_a_nursing_home_take_someones_walker/,"In Canada, can a nursing home take someone's walker from them?"
"i am in ohio.  my aunt is 95. she has lived alone most of her life about 3 hours from me. it became obvious about 5 years ago that she couldn't live alone. she couldn't remember whether she performed simple tasks like preparing meals and taking her pills. once she drove to the store (1 mile away), pulled barely into the driveway, set her head on the steering wheel and went to sleep until a neighbor came to wake her.so, my parents live in arizona in the winters and in ohio with me in the summers. the last 5 years they've run themselves ragged trying to support her. they take her with them each winter and kind of split the time between my house and hers in the summer. throughout all of this, she constantly attacks them. she accuses them constantly of stealing from her, but always little things. at least daily she repeats the stories of how ""your asshole father"" snuck into her basement late at night and stole a pipe wrench or that my mother went through her change bowl in her room while she was sleeping and stole $.90.  the latest issue has been a struggle. when they came from arizona they took a shuttle to the airport and she agreed to pay for it. now she has no memory of that conversation and she is accusing my mother of doing it without her permission.  she has been screaming at everyone for the last day and a half that my mother made the charge and wrote it in her checkbook without her permission. the checkbook entry is clearly in her handwriting, but she ""swears to god"" that she never wrote it.she has been demanding everyone to take her to the bank and remove my mother from all her accounts to prevent any more stealing.  when we refused, she ended up sneaking out of the house, going to the neighbor's driveway and stood behind their teenage son's car until he agreed to take him to the bank.  when i figured out what happened, i rushed to the bank and just missed them. the bank manager told me he helped her and it was clear she was not stable so he refused to allow her to close anything.she absolutely refuses to sign a power of attorney for health care or finances.  i have multiple doctors support that she cannot live alone. she has threatened to bring in a waitress she knows to live with her. she says that the waitress would be happy to take care of her for free if she put her in her will. my mother had a triple bypass and a hip replacement last year and need carotid artery surgery this year.  this whole thing is ridiculously stressful and we don't know how to handle her anymore."," oh yeah, this is a fun one.  the no formal poa thing and paranoia accompanying dementia. been there, done that.   look, if your mom is a joint signer the best thing to do for a bit is to just reassure your aunt. tour aunt is scared because she's lost her capacity to understand finances.  i had an elder go through about 2 years of the paranoid ""everyone is stealing from me phase"" before they finally forgot about money entirely.  aside from finances, the stealing accusations were also directed at assisted living staff who took away dirty clothes to later return clean clothes.  what helped me was to take the elder's purse, empty it of just about everything, and then stick in a billfold with about $25 cash in it, a couple pictures, and some inconsequential plastic cards (like a library card, not credit cards).   that way the elder could see ""their"" money and feel like they were in control and had funds to spend.  other than that i basically controlled the finances.  i made sure bills got paid.  i also kept one hell of a paper trail on any money i spent out of that joint account so that if anything ever came of the paranoia i could justify every penny i ever spent on my elder's behalf.  should you need to get a real poa there are legal options to get conservatorship or guardianship over the aunt, but that takes a lawyer and would be costly.edit: one more thing.  my elder likely had dementia with [lewy bodies](  a hallmark of that type of dementia is that people can hallucinate.  it doesn't happen all the time, but it happens.  i remember my elder thinking a group of children had come in to scare them in their house one evening.  there was other stuff like that.  if your elder truly believes people snuck in, particularly at night, hallucinations could be the reason.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6dlbwe/venting_about_my_95_year_old_great_aunt/,Venting about my 95 year old Great Aunt
"i've looked around a lot and can't seem to find symptoms to support that my mum might have early signs of dementia but something definitely isn't right. she keeps asking very obvious questions, sometimes even rhetorical questions and gets annoyed when i don't answer her. some of the questions she asks where she's clearly mid way through a thought and they have no context to what we are doing at the time. she gets very frustrated by my confusion, but it's hard to answer a question totally out of context. such as ""should i do that tomorrow then?"" so i ask, ""do what?"" she'll throw her arms up in frustration and accuse me of not listening. she's also become extremely hypocritical getting very upset if someone doesn't ask her how she is despite her never asking anyone else how they are. the final straw for me was when we were talking on the phone and she suddenly hung up, when i rang back she claimed she thought we had finished talking. is there anything i can do, or anyway i can approach this? living in the uk as well. thanks in advanced.", you might need to be sneaky if she's suspicious. find a way to check her prescription bottles. does she have any friends you can recruit to help? they may have noticed her behaviour as well and she might be more receptive to them. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/6die6p/help_spotting_symptoms/,Help spotting symptoms

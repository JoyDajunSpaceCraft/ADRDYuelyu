"hi everyone,i just discovered this subreddit and have been browsing for about a week. i am 24 and my father was just diagnosed with dementia today. i’ve seen a lot of similar posts of people in the same situation as me and my heart goes out to anyone hurting right now. anyway, my question is how do i go about getting power of attorney? every person i’ve talked to has told me this is the most important thing to take care of. my mother is wheelchair bound and incapable of doing anything for herself. i want to get her into a total care home but trying to broach the subject with dad is impossible. he either doesn’t understand or doesn’t seem to agree that this is a necessity. i don’t want to go around his back and set up arrangements without him but i’m not certain he can understand anymore. it feels like he has a mental block when it comes to my mother’s care. has anyone experienced this before?i want nothing but the best care for them both but because my dad has done everything for my mom she knows nothing about our financial situation, will, etc. fortunately i am in between jobs right now so i can help out for at least a few weeks but i’m not capable of helping them for much longer as i will have to go back to work. well this turned into more of a rant but how can i approach my dad about these things when he doesn’t think they’re important?thanks for reading this all if you did and i hope you all have a great day."," not sure where you are located, if you’re in canada message me. lawyers can be pricey. we got everything dealt with through social workers and avoided legal fees. personal directives are also crucial!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mi162f/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,I Don’t Know What To Do
"hi everyone,my mother (68) has begun showing a new symptom. she will look in the mirror and see herself, and talk to this “other person” as if she is just meeting them. she also talks to empty areas of the house that she thinks are people (no one is there). has anyone else seen this? i don’t think it’s harmful since the “people” seem to be friendly/nice, just curious of other’s experiences."," i recently read a book (recommended by someone on this sub) that the person with dementia will often forget what they look like or fail to recognize themselves, especially as their memory rewinds to earlier times. they may not recognize themselves now but will recognize themself in a picture several decades earlier. this explains talking to mirrors and also paranoia where they think that there’s someone else in the house. when it becomes troublesome taking away mirrors or covering them seems to be helpful.the book was called thoughtful dementia care by jennifer ghent fuller and it was very inexpensive on kindle. i found it a very easy read and somewhat enlightening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mhwnop/friend_in_the_mirror/,“Friend” in the mirror

"mom passed 3 years ago the 13th at 94 years of age and is on my mind. she was sweet like mother teresa until you threatened her family. for a small woman she was pretty tough. the last few years she suffered increasing alzheimers and i suspect dementia. she had oodles of energy til the end. they had a banker named jaime, super nice guy. mom called him hymen. couldnt get her to say jaime. it was always hymen no matter what. i explained it and she just stared at me lol. ""yea, hymen"". trips to the bank were fun lol. i moved back thanks to a job change and very glad i did. i was needed. mom withdrew from the outside world a year after i came back. she forgot most of cooking and she was always excellent. so i took over more and more of chores, until i did all the shopping etc. she quit her library club and no matter how hard dad tried she wouldnt go back. dad was dead wrong. you dont ever force them to do anything. then when dad was in rehab hospital mom tried to drive out to see him and got lost. dad always had to have a shortcut, feeling that made him special. it was a very simple drive and he confused her and she got lost. thank god she found her way home but it scared her so bad she never left the house again. i wish i could get a do-over now that i know more. this society does not prepare us to help people or ourselves with aging issues. if you're wondering if your loved one or friend suffers from an aging disease get some answers. do some research. if they act a bit odd or you dont understand then they may need help. never think theyre being lazy or dumb or mean. thats not it. most of us will suffer near the end with this. be patient and compassionate. most importantly its simple things like a hug or a call or just spending some time. mom loved arranging flowers. i would get her a bouquet from work and she would arrange and rearrange them for a couple weeks. its the little things. its looking into their heart and playing a string. you can reach them if you try. just dont ever have regrets.theres a big rose bush outside the dining room window. moms roses. she would sit and watch the birds and love the flowers. the day after she passed it had more roses on it than id ever seen. its been through so much bad weather the past 3 years and we thought we lost it during the winter storm here in tx. but i trimmed it and its coming back strong.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mhceoo/funny_thing_about_mom/,Funny thing about Mom

"hi everyone,my father suffers dementia — we aren’t totally sure which kind because he refuses to admit that anything’s wrong/is too proud to admit that anything is off. he was very successful, professionally and was always praised for his smarts during his career. in fact he has several patents from his career as a fiber-optical engineer, which he earned and is deservedly proud of.anyway. my mother, and his wife of 45 years, recently had open-heart surgery, which was so scary and so complicated. she suffered a stroke as a result, and it was an incredibly scary moment for our family. during her surgery and throughout her hospital stay, i stayed with my father. he had delusions about her whereabouts (suspected she’d taken off to mexico; it was around the time of the freeze/power outages in texas and i blame ted cruz).it was awful. he’d wake me up in the middle of the night demanding answers. he was so confused, and so hurt. i did a shitty job explaining. i was so frustrated!but there was an evening where he woke me up, totally lucid. he apologized for what was going on, admitted he knew his mind was waning, and apologized to me and our family for the burden he’d left us with. i was totally floored. i hugged him, i told him that we loved him, that it wasn’t his fault, and that it was just as hard on all of us as it was in him. it made me feel like shit, honestly. but it was also so amazing. i documented all of it and reached out to my mom and sister.i...sort of can’t believe this actually happened. in hindsight, it feels like a dream. but it did happen — it really did! has anyone else experienced something like this?i suppose that it doesn’t actually matter. my father won’t get any better; he’ll only get worse. but have any of you experienced this moment of clarity? it seemed to me so unreal."," my dad still has many moments of clarity, but they are only moments, then the accusations and delusions kick back in. i’ve had similar conversations with him. he knows he is getting things wrong, that he’s said mean things to my mum and can’t remember what. he cries and says he doesn’t want to be a burden. like you, i just give him as much love as i can. it’s heartbreaking but also beautiful, because i see the dad i’ve always known in those moments of clarity. i try to cherish every bit. easier said than done, of course.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mh0vty/moments_of_clarity/,Moments of clarity
"i posted sometime back asking for advice on how to help support my husband whose 95 year old dad had dementia bad with violent tendencies. well, everything went downhill after that. his delusions got the better of him, despite our regular attention and talking to him several times a day. basically he got kicked out his assisted living facility for trying to kill the staff (he went after them with knives and stated that he wanted to kill them). it was like a psychotic break. he ended up being hauled away by cops and paramedics then sent for a psych hold. day 1 into the hold he declines rapidly and ends up in the icu. husband was asked by the doctors whether they should intervene, and he said yes. (don't ask why. he said he didn't know why he said yes. he sorta regrets it now). anyway, he seemed on the brink of death for at least a week, such that my husband called the family to come naay goodbye. but by some miracle he eventually makes it out of the icu and is slowly but surely going back to normal. we're now looking at him being released to a skilled nursing facility and eventually a memory care place. meanwhile, hubby has had to clear out his assisted living apartment and deal with trying to find alternative housing.today, visiting his dad, hubby saw his dad behaving like he was back to his normal - foul, violent - personality and be extremely rude to the nursing staff at the hospital (he's now in a normal room not the icu). something along the lines of yelling at a female nursing staff member to suck his genitalia, when she asked to check his iv. this is how bad he is at like 10% of his normal strength. you get the picture how foul he is. meanwhile the hospital is talking about releasing him soon. but we can't put him in the nearest skilled nursing facility to us because his dad got kicked out of there a few months back - for being extremely foul and violent towards the staff - after the was placed there to battle a serious infection.  hubby said he couldnt take another round of this sh*t again. but of course he can't abandon his dad, no matter what. he says now that he regrets having the doctors intervene, maybe he should have just let nature take its course. but i know if he had decided that, he would feel guilty for the rest of his life as if he killed his dad. and then now he feels super guilty for even saying that regrets the decision. i now know that no matter what, he would feel like this no matter the circumstances. it's so frustrating. i don't know what to do. nothing i say helps. i can't reason with him about it because it's a very emotional reaction (understandable) cos it's his father. but this man has always been a manipulative asshole and has basically psychologically tortured his son for the past decade or more - even before his dementia got out of control. hubby realizes this, and even said that he understood why his mom went first, because his dad was psychologically abusive. but at the same time, he cant help feeling this way. how do i help support him? and will i have to deal with this nightmare for the rest of my husband's life? as in, even after his dad dies, he'll still have a psychological hold over my husband?", has your husband thought about speaking with a therapist? it will help with the feelings of guilt. also speak with the local hospice. at 95 he surely qualifies. also discuss the feelings he has about no medical intervention. i myself struggled with this but i know my mom doesn’t want to live this way. i’ve honored her wishes by not placing her in a facility. but i’m not going above and beyond to keep her going.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mgz3au/husband_feels_guilty_about_fathers_decline_what/,Husband feels guilty about father's decline.

"dad is 82, we never had a formal diagnosis but it's been very clearly advancing for at least 3 years since moved in with me. five months ago, i moved with him back to his native country so that he could be with his family and familiar culture for his final years.the move itself was difficult and probably traumatic for him. like a previous hospitalization the year prior, it was the type of experience that probably advanced his dementia somewhat. however i've seen a steeper than usual decline in the last 2 or 3 months.his language is gone. he says words, but they are disconnected and make no sense. he tries to communicate with me but it's gibberish and frustrating to both of us. sometimes i can make out what he's saying just through context cues and because i'm with him 24/7 but most of the time it's unintelligible. he pretends he can take care of his hygiene, he is very private and doesn't allow me to help him very much. he wears the same clothes every day, sleeps in them even. frequently soils himself in the bathroom and i find evidence afterwards of his efforts at cleaning up. i cook every meal for him,  otherwise he'd just eat bread or spoonfuls of jam that he finds in the kitchen or cold leftovers from the fridge.the other day, he somehow managed to lose his wallet, which he always kept in his pants pocket. he never left the house the entire day, and we tore the place apart down to every garbage can and can't find it. it has upset him deeply and i think this another trauma, he's been very different since the wallet loss. his normal routines are completely gone. he paces, he is agitated, he has paranoia about being robbed, he babbles incessantly about revenge, etc. his sleeping patterns are off, he used to sleep through the night but the last 2 nights he's been pacing in the dark with his flashlight, mumbling to himself. luckily we live in an apartment building with locked entrance/exit doors so he has no way of getting out, but the way he's been talking lately i wouldn't be surprised if he tried to escape. unfortunately we have loud upstairs neighbors and he interprets their noise as intruders. he is on an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic med, but at low dosages that probably need to be re-evaluated.i'm just at the end of my rope. i don't know how to help him anymore. i have hit the wall and my compassion is gone. i can't sleep well from worry, i am tied to him 24/7 and can only leave the home for short times to get groceries. i am past the point where a full-time nurse during the day here at home would be a benefit. i am ready to turn him over to professionals.i'm just not sure if **he** is at that point. i struggle with guilt about him realizing that i have abandoned him. there are fleeting moments when the dementia seems to recede and i see those flashes of his old self and knowing that he's still capable of being fully aware just kills me. luckily i have the support of his siblings here, they will agree with the decision i make. i just fear how i'm going to hurt him. i have an appointment tomorrow afternoon to tour a place that i found that might be a good option for him. maybe i just need reassurance that it really is time and not me giving up too early and making it worse for him. it feels so final, so much an end of everything for him and what he wants for the end of his life, making that decision for him is so difficult.", > we live in an apartment building with locked entrance/exit doorswait... so people in the building are locked in unless they have a key!? sounds like a major safety and fire code problem.,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mggpbq/is_it_time_for_a_fulltime_care_home/,Is it time for a full-time care home?

"this is more of a rant but also sharing my experience to help others.  my grandma is 87, has dementia from alzheimer’s.my grandma moved in with me, my wife and my son because the assisted living place she was at managed to get everyone, people living there and also nurses/ workers sick with covid, to the point that they had to hire an outside company to come take care of people living there. my grandma ended up in the hospital for 2 months.  so my wife and i opened our home to her because she had nowhere else to go and we wanted her to be in a safe place.  i do not work so i became her caregiver.  everything i do is based on her and what she is doing. my life literally revolves around her, her confusion, and her depression.  we have changed everything in our home to make her life better, painting a bedroom, buying her furniture, installing a chair lift, giving her our master bathroom to shower in because it’s a walk in shower and would be safer for her. yes we knew things like this would come up and would need to be done. i want to stress that we agreed to take this on and help her as best we can. today started out great, my mom came over to help her shower and get her dressed, then her hospice nurse came to check her out for her weekly check up and things were going great.  recently we noticed that my grandma has been having terrible days after she was out for 4 plus hours driving with my mom the day before.  she would barely know who i was, didn’t know where she lived, and constantly saying i don’t know what i’m doing all while crying her eyes out because she thought she lived alone and didn’t have money or food.  well we told the nurse about this and she said that is very common for dementia patients and that it’s possible she had too much stimulation the day before and suggested we do only and hour or two out on drives or being away from her home (my home). so the nurse leaves and we start having a nice conversation about the weather getting nice and that the tree are changing and she will have some really pretty views on her drives. then i made the comment about her only being able to go out for 1 or 2 hours because of the horrible next day she has, she said that’s not enough time to do anything and also said so that means i’m not going on any more vacations? she hasn’t been on a vacation in years, probably 5-10 years.  she did not like the our answer when we said no.  i added, grandma you’re 87 years old and you can barely make it to the steps without passing out. keep in mind my mom and i were keeping calm the whole time and trying to have a normal conversation with her.  she blew up and started yelling, started telling us she isn’t going to be told that she can’t do anything. my mom and i looked at each other and were confused. she started screaming at us telling us she will do whatever she wants and we can’t stop her and we attempted to calm her down but there was no stopping her.  she eventually started calling me names and telling me i’m a piece of shit but with nicer words only because she doesn’t cuss much. that’s when my mom stepped in and got on her for acting like that and calling me names etc.. she then stood up and got in my moms face and telling her get move and not to get into her face but my grandma was the one who got up and got in my moms face.  that’s when i told her sit down and shut up because my nine year old can hear her acting like a nine year old. after some more arguing she went upstairs to her room. we let time pass and gave her the agitation medicine we have for her. after 30-40 minutes she came back downstairs and asked for food, i got it for her and she sat in her chair and after two minutes she started again.  talking about things that had nothing to do with the last conversation, telling us we are horrible people, that she is going to find somewhere else to live because apparently my constant caretaking of her wasn’t enough. she said that i told her to get out of my house when i actuallly said grandma if you continue to do this, act like this and scream then you will have to leave because my son can hear this and i won’t put up with him having to hear this and get upset because of this behavior.  so she took that as get the fuck out now and she held onto that but could not remember anything else about the conversation except that we were treating her poorly. which it honestly was the other way around, we have learned to just agree with her nonsense talking and “plans of vacation” etc.... but this time we were trying to inform her that the next day out she has will be shorter...so we were doing our best to stay calm and it just didn’t help.  then my wife stepped in and she told my grandma who started screaming and yelling again that she needed to shut up and go to her room upstairs until she calms down because our son can hear all this.  my grandma then threatened her by saying i really like you so don’t make me hate you and my wife said enough go to your room and calm down.  my grandma screamed at her to shut the hell up.  that’s when i lost it and screamed “stop” so loud it made everyone jump. (i rarely ever get mad and have never been this mad in my life) after i did this she got in my face telling me to get out of her face and i was so angry i didn’t just let it go like i should have and told her she was the one who stood up and got in mine so if you don’t want me in your face then move. that’s when she started getting in my moms face and then started walking towards my wife, i stepped in front of her and then my wife said this is enough, go to your room. eventually she did after us repeating that our son can hear her which scared her because she doesn’t want him to see her upset or mad etc... then after some time of calming my mom down and my wife trying to cool me down and trying to figure out what the hell happened she started to come back down but kept her head down and asked for food. i put my nice, caregiver, grandson face on and took her some food, she took her medicine, and after 30 minutes i went back up to get her plate and she was back to normal and acted like nothing happened.  so we are stuck knowing what happened and feeling bad or upset or mad while she gets to just forget it all and not know if anything happened at all.  how does this help anyone? well i understand people may lose their cool sometimes, they may get frustrated and angry, but remember it’s pointless. in my case i only ended up making myself feel upset and same with my mom and wife. i knew just to always agree with her and move onto the next topic because she won’t remember what she said anyway, but this time i let my anger get the best of me and in the end i lost, my wife lost, and my mom lost because we have to deal with every horrible thing she said to us and us getting angry with her. now i have to move on knowing how horrible she was to me after i have changed my entire life for her and continue to care for her while she gets to go back to a normal day for her. tldr:grandma went off on us after trying to explain how to help her with confusion after going out for the day before. in the end we lost, we are hurting, we are upset and she remembers nothing."," sorry it gets so hard. we’ve stopped explaining in advance. instead of saying drives will be shorter & why, we’d just take her out. make the planned (shorter) trip, avoid mentioning the time or how long we’ve been out, then return home. if confronted about wanting to go somewhere else, we’d say a simple line which we’d repeat word for word every time she asked, something like “we’ll go there next time.” no long explanations (they just invite angry responses). even if she asks why can’t we go now? our reply is the same “we’ll go there next time,” even if you have no intention of going there. compassionate deception, or therapeutic fibbing is necessary at times for dealing w/dementia. makes for less conflict. look in the pinned post resources for my post what did i say??",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mg5g75/anger_confusion_loss_of_respect/,"Anger, confusion, loss of respect"

"my grandfather has been showing signs of dementia for the last few years. he is not just forgetful, but his personality has changed or at least become less inhibited. he is very mean, makes inappropriate sexual comments, and is paranoid.  he lives alone in a small rural town that is pretty sick of him. honestly, so are his kids. attempts to get him to move closer to family (not in assisted living or a nursing home, just get an apartment in the same town as one of his kids as he is now a 9 hour drive from the closest family) are met with hostility and verbal abuse. at this point, no one wants to talk to him, let alone visit, even though they aren’t bad people. it just feels pointless. he is on lots of meds and has diabetes that is not well controlled and i’m not confident he is able to manage himself well. he has had a number of fainting spells and falls and no one is checking up on him so if he doesn’t wake up, or wakes up but can’t get himself off the ground, he would be on his own. do we have some responsibility or liability there?  what happens if you just ignore dementia? i worry that he is too far gone to be reasoned with (he never really was a reasonable man to be honest) but not so far gone that he can be legally declared incompetent or whatever the phrase is, and i just don’t know what happens next. any insight or similar stories would be appreciated."," yep! same situation! my dad is going into a nursing home next week with mid/late alzheimer’s and my mother who has been living with him and a caregiver is showing the same signs. she swears, is completely selfish, forgets everything and still believes she is the smartest person in the room. we are at our wits end with her but need to get my dad out and settled before we take on that battle. it’s a constant worry, she still drives. fortunately she is agreeable to moving into a different “retirement home” so that piece is coming together. the three children are aligned that we need to eventually get power of attorney for them but that will be a fight. the first conversation about that is with their doctor. does your dad have a doctor and do you know who it is?  hang in there. it helps talking about it!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mg27jc/ignore_dementia/,Ignore Dementia?
"my (32f) granny (85) was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's disease last year, but had been showing symptoms for around 4-5 years. she has declined a lot quicker the last 1.5 years, since my grandfather died, and she is less mobile so can't be occupied like she used to be. she get specific numbers, seemingly plucked out of the air, stuck in her head. she needs to repeat them, and will try and write them down, then gets frustrated when she remembers them wrongly. she also asks what they mean and where they have come from. similarly, she also gets confused when she hears a story (sometimes even a word will spark it) and thinks it is her experience. an example of this is when i told her i had cleaned under the fridge as it smelled. she engaged with the story normally initially, but then towards the end of the conversation started saying things like, ""oh i'll have to go, there's a horrible smell in here, it's disgusting, it's coming from the fridge"" (there was no smell). is this something that anyone else has experience of? i am struggling to know what to tell her; when she gets fixated on something she can get upset and frustrated about it, and i feel awful for putting the idea in her poor brain. is there a way i can change how i tell her things or what i tell her to avoid distressing her?sidenote: this is so hard, especially as we're unable to see each other in person at the moment."," repetition is a common symptom of dementia - my grandma repeats the same. damn. stories to us every. single. day. she doesn't take the stories we tell her and repeat them as her own, but, she does frequently confuse them between who told them to her. like my mom will tell her a story. but she'll sit in front of my mom and i and tell us about the story i told her - the exact story my mom told her the day before. she also gets fixated on limited parts of a story and then overdramaticizes them, like last fall my mom showed her photos that i was texting her while she was visiting my grandma, photos the deep orange skies (i live in northern california, and it was the week those horrible fires blocked out the sun). my mom was explaining it was caused by the wildfires in california. she asked if i was safe, and my mom said, yes, they weren't very close to me, it's just the smoke in the atmosphere, and that seemed like a good answer to my grandma. but then my grandma sent me $50 to go towards our new house since the last one burned down (side note - i wish $50 would help me buy a house lol). she totally got fixated on the 'fire' part of that story and it took a while before she dropped that one. so some aspects of what you're describing are familiar, like the fixation on specific parts of a story and repetition, but it does sound to me (not a health care professional) like some ocd, too, as that's a level of fixation bordering on obsession. honestly, with my grandma pulling out pieces of stories and twisting them into much bigger issues (some of which stress her out), my mom has decided everything is a need-to-know basis, no superfluous stories or anecdotes about the day, she facts that relate directly to her. it's helped a little, intentionally not sharing with her; that's sad, we want to tell her about our lives, but we know it stresses her out. so now we repeat ourselves too, and let her do most of the talking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mfvfbr/granny_confuses_other_stories_for_her_own/,Granny confuses other stories for her own experience and gets fixated on random numbers/words?

"for the past 5 years my father had suffered from  presumably cardiovascular dementia. usually he was alright, just a little distant, but the past year he started forgetting pretty much everything, then last week he collapsed and when he came to at the hospital was just oblivious to my mom and brother, i don’t live nearby.he had other health problems, so my family was offered the options of either hospice or palliative care. but before the choice was made, he passed at the hospital.while i don’t like that my father is dead, i honestly feel like he truthfully died several years ago and i’ve been slowly mourning his death until now. and more importantly my mother, whom while in her 70’s is very lively and active, but she feared that the rest of her life was going to involve caring for my father, who didn’t even know her. i don’t know, i’m still gathering my thoughts on the subject, and ranting a little i guess. but these are real thoughts."," i think i understand what you mean. my grandpa had a temporary rapid decline due to incompatible meds last year for a while. he went back to his early state of alzheimer's shortly after we got his meds corrected, but he is now heading toward that state even on good meds. that state where he's not himself and all you can see is the shell of someone you once knew. i feel like i've accepted him as dead in at least some part of my heart and that i treat every day where he can recognize me as a bonus. it sounds morbid, but i know part of me will be relieved when he doesn't have to suffer any more and we can lay him to rest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mfk3xv/my_father_just_passed_away_but_it_kind_of_feels/,My father just passed away.

"basic background: my dad is nearly 80 and has lived alone for nearly 20 years.  he's gone from being a very methodical and neat person to a borderline hoarder over the last 12 or so years.  he has friends, goes out, has coffee with his neighbours, shops, and basically functions mostly normally.  i haven't been in his house for many years because i told him he needs to clean up the clutter and he wouldn't let me help.  i'm ashamed to say he successfully avoided resolving that since.recently he was hospitalised for a while, now he's temporarily living with me.  we've had to go in and clean his house, and get it ready for him to move back in.  we have not let him go back to the house at all yet.the house is bad - there's stuff everywhere, rubbish everywhere (not saved up, just tossed randomly, nothing gross thankfully).  things he was super careful about years ago, have been tossed like garbage, wrecked, shoved out of the way.  half his bedroom was just piled with stuff that had an inch of dust on it.  his kitchen was horrific, he would tell me he cooks but i have no idea how.  it's like the neglect has accelerated and taken over, we've cleaned, gutted rooms, fixed all the plumbing, and are about to start rebuilding.  he just wants to go home now that he feels better.  i don't have enough words to describe that although it's not quite a hoarders house, it's a f\*cking nightmare, inside and out.he yells in his sleep, a lot, every night.  he'll call out for his dog over and over (she passed over 10 years ago), or strange phrases and things that maybe have to do with the events of the day?  but it's loud yelling, and repetitive, and he often wakes himself up, turns his radio on quite loud, then goes back to sleep. i'm not sure how to explain it, if it was once in a while i wouldn't be concerned, but it's every night.  he randomly calls our dogs by his dogs name too.he has a few repetitive things he does too, just little weird things usually and mostly at night.  like banging his hand down on his seat next to him a few times, or sighing or this weird noise over and over.  sometimes he catches himself and stops, mostly not.whenever we discuss his house and how it's going, he's always shocked when we advise him of the latest disaster we've found (we are shielding him a lot from the worst of it, there's no point) as he was sure it was just fine, he never had a problem.  and he's getting shirty if we say we want/need to change something for his benefit.  same with his car, he's not driving for now, but he's told us repeatedly it's perfectly fine, just due for a service.  so to help my brother took it for the service and there are so many things wrong he's been told to look for a new car, it's more than it's worth to even try to fix half the problems - and his mechanic said he told him this last time.  it's nowhere near roadworthy and the tyres were bald.  he had no idea.all of these things on their own just seem like typical older people things that happen and we'd help with, i don't know how to explain it but.......this is not like my dad.  stuff he cared about meaning nothing to him, especially being so lax with his car, the state of the house.  and yet he can still discuss technical things, things from 50+ years ago are still recalled perfectly, he's mostly keeping up with current events and things.  i can't put my finger on it, which is why i'm wondering if the decline is gradual or vague enough that i'm second guessing myself.  are any of these things signs of dementia, or just depression or natural ageing?  i don't want to drag him to a doctor and say i think he's incompetent when all he might need is us cleaning up this damn house and being able to visit him more.", [deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mfczfz/unsure_if_this_is_dementia_just_quirky_or_a/,"Unsure if this is dementia, just quirky, or a lonely old man with depression"

"hello to everyone here; this is my first post in this community and i hope to get meaningful feedback. i am looking to buy a realistic looking baby doll for a friend of mine who has alzheimer’s. i know that there’s at least one specific doll meant for those with alzheimer’s but i wanted to see if there are any other options because i don’t think that doll looks very realistic and it looks more like a toy to me. i’ve found very little information about realistic dolls (often called re-born dolls) in regards to them being used as cuddle items; most are not suited for children or any type of handling/play which includes being a comfort item. i know that silicone is not ideal (i’m glad i found this out because i was browsing silicone only dolls for a while) because it’s fragile and it needs specific care to prevent the skin from becoming gummy. i would also prefer painted on hair because i think real hair gives it the “uncanny valley” look and it is susceptible to falling out or getting messed up. i’m open to both a cloth weighted body, a full vinyl body, and other aesthetic features. i really don’t want it to look creepy, nor do i want one that looks very childish. i would like it to be a normal size and it be able to fit into standard doll size clothes or preemie/infant clothes. i don’t want anything that is going to be smaller than a newborn baby who is big enough to go home after birth. my budget is flexible although i think any dolls that are $500+ are likely to be made of silicone which wouldn’t work. my friend is someone i love very much and it’s been difficult to be unable to visit her. she lives in kentucky and i live in dc, but i had been making trips two times a year until covid hit. so this doll is something that i want to put real thought into and hopefully she’ll know that it’s a sign of how important she is to me. i appreciate any feedback; including advice, retailers, websites, artists, and brands. thank you all and i hope everyone is having a nice sunday!!"," i'm sure your efforts and love are being appreciated, even from afar. i'm also sure that you are over thinking it a little. part of the reason the dementia dolls and cats look very fake, is because the clients can no longer distinguish the difference. if they still can, or means they don't get distressed that the baby isn't behaving like one. the main reason i've seen the dolls be successful is because the residents get enticed to start taking care of them. the dolls are weighted, so they feel comfortable to hold and can sit upright. they need to be very cleanable, accidents of all kinds happen frequently. the looks really don't matter to them, except perhaps skincolor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mf883g/realistic_baby_doll_that_is_meant_to_be_cuddled/,Realistic baby doll that is meant to be cuddled?

"i know in my heart my dad has vascular dementia. i am a medical student in a family full of md's. we all agree.  he got covid in april and subsequently has descended into severe behavioral changes with cognitive decline. he is forgetting very basic things.  he has cerebral vasculitis confirmed by mri angiogram (post-covid).  he started cheating on my mom in june with a 35 year old (a few years older than me - his youngest daughter), divorced her in december after 33 years of marriage, moved to another state, and cannot keep a job due to angry outbursts. he is getting paranoid. he keeps thinking he can manage this with hyperbaric chambers and supplements. his reality testing is intact - he knows something is wrong - but refuses to take the appropriate treatment measures. &amp;#x200b;the absolute hardest part is that my dad is and was so abusive. at 8: he threw baskteballs at me, physically abused me, made me live with a 16 year-old-exchange student despite catching him in my room in the middle of the night. he did not kick him out until he was caught being inappropriate with his friends 7 year old daughter. he would shake me and throw me as a kid. he bruised my 4'11"" year old sister. he made her eat pasta until she vomitted as punishment. he held  my foot in hot water while i cried because i ""need to recover as fast as possible so i could play basketball."" at physical therapy he turned the tens unit up as high as it could go on me and refused to turn it down despite my crying to please make it stop. he kicked me out of the house for telling the carpet cleaner to clean the wrong carpet. i went to drug rehab and he taunted me about how he never read the letters i wrote him. he financially and emotionally abused my mother. most people say i got the worst of it. he was obsessed with me playing basketball growing up. his favorite method of punishment was public humiliation. he would constantly threaten to abandon me. he was such a cruel father. he told me that all men would ever want from me is sex. in response to my sobriety, he has frequently told me that i shouldnt expect a congratulations for doing what i am supposed to do. when i moved back in with my parents after divorcing my abusive ex-husband, he mocked me for being afraid him of murdering me and made a rule that i should not talk about the divorced around him because i should just ""get over it."" he left me alone with coach known for preying on teenage girls. even after i told him i did not want to see him because he called me to drink with him. he tricked me into seeing him during a home visit from rehab. when i told him about being sexually assaulted and harrassed by a coworker he told me - i will never find a perfect working environment. trauma does not disappear because of his dementia. it does not undo all of the terrible things he did to me as a child. i do not want to live life in regret that i should or could have done more to help him but i also don't want to endanger my sobriety and mental health (bipolar disorder) by forcing myself into a positiion that re-traumatizes me and harms me. my mother is a saint and has said she will do what she can (go with him to doctors, help him get into a home if needed, etc.) because he is our father. sometimes i wish that he would just go away forever and end everyones suffering including his own."," in a similiar boat but its my mom that has dementia shes a saint love her to end of this world. my pops has been an alcoholic all his life only he never hurt me when i was younger he hurt my mom and  my oldest brother. about two or three years ago he punched me in the face he was drunk. so drunk (at the shop) that he could barley punch so it didnt hurt physically it did mentally.whats been bothering me is my moms sick with dementia. my pops is choosing to not be there metally (drunk) he literally has been drinking so much he was shitting in a pan in his bed like hes giving up he has no energry because he doesnt do anything but sit around and drink move from bed to chair. its just sucks because my mom didnt choose to have dementia but my father drinks like he doesnt want to be there, like hes drinking to not remember. like i know lifes not perfect but nothing comes out of drinking or using.i recently quit pot due to anxiety of idk everything and too add on top of that my brother that is older than me ( im the youngest the 4th) the 3rd my brother is startinh to be an alcoholic i can see my dad in him when he drinks, he also punched me in the face while drunk ironic right. that one hurt shit he was close to knocking me out. i didnt hit back as much as i wanted to im also taller n heavyer than him. earlier in that night that he punched me, he pushed me and he fell back hitting his head on the ground literally knocking his self out. it scared the fuck out me looking into eyes without life.so when ever hes drinks he scares me not just in a voilent way im worried about his own health like he will do somthing stuiped fighting the wrong person or whatever. he moved back home recently for other reasons but has been alot help with mom which is great i needed help. it just piss me off that all these people in my life choose to be  dysfunctional and mom didnt. ugh cryin while writing this. mans gonna fall off the planet when one of my parents passes i hate to say it but its gonna happen one day.i want to move out but mom needs me. at times i wish he didnt move back in but he helps with mom. just is scary when hes drunk. today i asked why hes drinking its sunday, and he got all up in my face like you got a problem. bottle a day since friday. he was stumbling when i got home at 4pm from beers n went out n got a bottle (gf drove him yay) yay life im struggling keeping my self sane. fmlanyways if you read all that thank you and im sorry i ranted that whole story. your not alone in the fight of life..... sane life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/mf75dx/my_dad_apoe4_covidrelated_cerebrovasculitis/,"My dad: ApoE4+, COVID-related cerebrovasculitis"

my mother has been in and out of mental health care facilities for the last 2 years she claims she “can’t take care of herself” and “forgets how to do things like shower” it’s very unclear if he really has dementia because most drs think she’s playing a manipulative game. (i tend to agree unfortunately). she’s tried committing suicide on many occasions. i lost count how many calls to 911 have been made that haven’t resulted in getting any help. i’m feeling defeated as fuck because i’m planning on calling adult protective services to relinquish power of attorney. fuck the system here in the us.," has she had an official dementia/memory evaluation & diagnosis (like on the global deterioration scale 1-7)? my grandmother recently went through that evaluation, which took 3 hours over the course of 2 visits and i would find it hard for anyone to dupe the system. it's very, very hard for someone without neuroscience or aging backgrounds to understand why they're asking what they're asking, why they're doing the puzzles they're doing, etc. it's not really right/wrong answers, it's more the *way* you answer and certain patterns they can see arise that a basic, untrained person would be hard-pressed to figure out. my mom is an intelligent, highly educated person and couldn't find rhyme or reason to the tests. i have a degree in neurolinguistics and it wasn't even 100% obvious, but i could see how it was a very intelligent way of evaluating the brain's cognitive function. my grandma is in denial and is pretty good about deflecting. before the test, i was worried that it wouldn't reflect what was really going on because she can be so charming & whatnot when she talks to people for a short time that they barely notice her (severe) issues with her cognition. they didn't even have to finish the test to grade her a 5 of 7 (moderate to severe dementia, requires full time care) in spite of how 'good' she is at speaking to people. in any case, i guess i'm suggesting to get that evaluation done. we found a spot through some recommendations in my grandma's town, my mom made her an appointment with her usual physician for a 'checkup' and wrote him a letter ahead of the appointment asking him to make a referral to this memory & aging specialist for the evaluation. technically, the referral wasn't needed, but it made it easier and since my grandma likes her doctor, she (kinda) agreed to get the test done. it was 100% covered through medicare.truthfully, i think my grandma internally accepts more than she outwardly expresses, when it comes to her decline. and because she's always been a stubborn, proud, and independent person, i also sometimes question what she's doing with intention versus is just a by-product of her disease. she even expressed to my mom after the evaluation that she 'missed some on purpose' because she 'didn't want to tell them the right answer' (which again, it's not about right/wrong per se so that just showed she didn't catch on to what the evaluation was really looking into). she's definitely not self-harming & suicidal like your mother - and i'm so sorry about that - so i am thankful for that. i hope you're able to get peace and answers for yourself & your mother.

"my grandmother (88) was recently officially diagnosed with dementia, and determined to be an upper 5+ on the gds. while she's had forgetfulness her pcp has stated was early dementia for around 3 years now, in the past 5-6 months it has increased in severity rapidly. we still don't have an official diagnosis on what type of dementia, although her primary 'symptoms' are forgetfulness (of words, the purpose of certain objects, and misplacing things), misinterpreting or misunderstanding info &amp; directions given to her (i.e. if you set a timer for her to take her meds, it's 50/50 whether she remembers what the timer is for once it goes off), and paranoia. the paranoia is the newest symptom and is the reason we got the evaluation done, as i'm pretty worried she will accuse someone of something - she already accuses family of stealing things (most of the time, she'll give you a gift, then accuse you of stealing that item from her), she accuses people of stalking her, etc.  it bears mentioning that she has always been a bit of an odd duck, pretty stubborn, a little gullible, and has had pretty much 0 filter with expressing her opinions her entire life. she's physically in great health (lives alone) &amp; recognizes who everyone is, all details of her younger life, the date/address/etc, but she has started confusing memories of people recently (she told me she's closest to my youngest cousin because she helped raise her daily, even though that's me - she's only seen my cousin a handful of times; she told me my mom is becoming a great baker &amp; cake decorator even though that's me, my mom never bakes; etc). my mom was allowed to be in the room for her recent evaluation and while my mom has been the most aware &amp; alarmed of the decline, she said that the questions really showed it's much worse than even she could have expected. and my mom is with her daily! the most alarming thing in the past 2 months is that she's not eating much or well and rapidly losing weight. she sort of brags about it like not eating is a badge of honor, and sometimes makes comments that she can't eat a treat someone brought to her until she loses another 2 pounds even though she's becoming malnourished \[side note: we kind of feel like this goes back to the misinterpreting info symptom, because she's been told by doctor's she needs to eat more but it seems like half the time she recalls it as needing to eat *less*\]. in the evaluation, she was asked specific questions about safety while alone and gave extremely concerning answers. after that, the memory specialists told my mom she needs to be in a home asap. we definitely agree. trouble is, my grandma is a) insistent that she doesn't have a problem and this is all a conspiracy for us to 'get rid of her', b) insistent that she continue living at home, and c) we are worried about the kinds of accusations she makes &amp; what that could mean for staff. i'm curious if anyone has experience in general with these types of dementia symptoms, and even better if you have experience with this situation in which a family member is a danger to themselves &amp; needs care but refuses? thank you!tl;dr: grandma has moderate dementia and is recommend to be in a home or care facility, but is in denial she has any problems &amp; will not agree to moving, in addition to being paranoid &amp; combative. advice on helping her?"," we're in a similar situation with my grandma. my dad's afraid of her vitriol if we put her into a long-term care facility, but the writing is clearly written on the wall. grandma is in denial of her medical needs, so i've stopped ""reminding"" her (she just went to the er on friday, and didn't remember the following day).from speaking with long-term care facilities they are used to residents making accusations, and understand it's a symptom of the dementia. and, yes, they might get mad at you, accuse you of some nasty things -- but, quite frankly, they're doing that now, aren't they? but if they're receiving 24 hour care, at least you can rest assured that they're in a safe place, and no matter how many nasty things they say to the staff, they will continue caring for her with patience and compassion.in terms of helping her adjust to the move, i don't have the right answer. with my grandma, i think she's gonna have to hear it straight from her doctor, although she will probably forget the conversation and get angry again if we bring it up. it might be that i tell grandma she's going to rehab for her heart condition, and just leave here there for a few weeks while she adjusts, then visit her as if nothing's happened. nothing about it is easy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m6jjz1/advice_on_helping_family_member_move_past_denial/,Advice on helping family member move past denial & accept help

"kia ora! i’m encouraging my parents to get a dog to improve their quality of life, and help my mum’s loneliness. my mum is in the early stages of alzheimer’s and becomes deeply depressed if either myself or my dad isn’t home, or if we don’t speak with her for a few hours. it’s sad to say, but i find myself limiting my own social life just so she won’t be alone. i can’t go out with friends or even learn how to drive because it would mean leaving mum alone at home for a few hours. in this sense, a dog would give mum the company she seeks and allow more room for movement for my dad and i. several health professionals and psychologists have suggested we get a dog at this stage to help mum as the alzheimer’s and subsequent depression progresses. in turn, the dog would have near-constant company. the only thing is...my mum is adamantly against getting a dog. she believes she’ll no long be able to travel and will lose her freedom. my dad would honestly love the joy and company of a dog, but he’ll go along with whatever keeps my mum happy. i know in my gut the right dog would provide all the things both my parents seek: infinite snuggles and unconditional love for mum, and routine exercise and play for my dad. since i’m the one pushing them to get a dog, i don’t want to load my parents with undue stress and put more responsibilities on my dad than he already has on his plate, especially since he will likely be the sole carer of my mother as well as the dog. i hope this all makes sense, i’m just trying to find some guidance on all of this.- is it a good idea to push my parents to get a dog? - what breed is good for people with alzheimer’s? and do you have any experience with this??- do the pros outweigh the cons in this instance? i struggle sometimes coping with my mum’s condition, and i know my dad does too. perhaps this dog would turn into a therapy dog for all of us. i’m just trying to find a way to make my parents just a little bit happier, but i’d hate to burden them further. honestly any comment, suggestion, or word of advice would be greatly appreciated. i see many happy dogs and happy dog owners on the internet and i hope to give my parents the same joy.ps. for further detail, my parents prefer the idea of a small-ish, non-shedding dog that wants to cuddle all day and low energy (the last thing we want is a strong dog pulling my old parents over). while mum has obvious health issues, dad is incredibly fit (think ripped master roshi from dragon ball z) and has the time, energy and experience to train a dog. i’m personally inclined to a greyhound or a cavalier king charles spaniel, but it’s not about what i like haha! thank you for reading this far! hope you’re having a wonderful day wherever you are xx"," if you can't manage a real dog, there are fake electronic cats made specifically for dementia.i've noticed my dad seems to be really needy in terms of social contact while he's alone as well.  i have a youtube exercise video play during that time for him.  also tell him to work on crossword and read newspaper or sonething.  he seems to not need anyone when he's busy doing something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m617uv/encouraging_my_parents_to_get_a_dog_mum_has/,Encouraging my parents to get a dog (Mum has Alzheimer’s)

"i 23 (f) have been caring for my grandma since i was 16. she lived by herself until i had to suddenly move her into a nursing home last year. for about 6/7 years, i took care of her errands/doctors visits at least once a week. whenever i had travel plans, i would arrange a neighbor or friend to bring her food and her meds. around the time the pandemic hit last year, i had to go over 2-4 times a week (she lived an hour away) to meal prep and take care of her daily needs. i was paid in lunch meals and coffee. she never really learned english, became a retired housewife at 40, and hasn’t driven a car in 5 decades. so when my grandpa passed away several years ago, she became completely reliant on me, even though i had to finish high school, started college, worked 30+ hours a week in 3 part time jobs, had internships, finished college early and graduated with a masters degree a semester early too. i thought her decline in cognition was a normal part of aging until she had a diabetic seizure (turns out she wasn’t taking her meds like i thought, i think she was tossing them away or something) and the hospital informed me they were diagnosing her with vascular dementia. thank god before things got bad i had her sign a poa and started diving into her finances when she was officially diagnosed with dementia because it occurred to me she maybe wasn’t paying her bills. i found huge credit card debits, helocs, loans, no savings etc etc. i also found she stashed her bills into a drawer and was on the verge of having all her services cut off because she simply forgot to pay her bills. i caught her up to date on everything and consolidated her high interest credit card debt and quickly paid it off. now, after her diagnosis, all of her strange habits from about january 2020 - november 2020 made sense. however, she was put in rehab care for her seizure and i had to quickly scramble to figure out what to do. this is where i’m still having trouble coming to terms with what i had to do. i decided to sell her home of 30 years, the house i sort of grew up in, and most of her possessions because i realized, i could not live in and take care of her daily needs full time. i have zero medical training, and am starting my professional career in a cutthroat field. my student loans prevent me from not working too. well, i was unemployed twice in the middle of everything, but i’m putting all my remaining energy into finding a new job atm. she also fell in a sticky position where she could not afford a live in caretaker in our state on her social security, but did not financially qualify for assistive services or welfare because her social security is too high... the irony. the other stressor was that her home sold in 11 days, and i had one weekend to sell everything. my grandma couldn’t afford an estate sale company, so i spent a solid 72 hours on pure adrenaline selling furniture and all the crap she was semi-hoarding. her extra clothes, photo albums, family docs, and a few china sets are currently piled in my closet. i have now set up her nursing home to be paid for the next three years on private pay thanks to the sale of her home and estate and then she will be on government assistance. she doesn’t even remember her home anymore, and thinks she’s in 1944 in her home country... it’s currently wwii. why am i here? i think i was led to this reddit group because i’m looking for comfort. my grandmas only child, my dad, is incapable of helping because of his addictions. my mom has accompanied me to a few things, and acted as an official translator for my grandmas native language twice, but legally has no role. my sibling is a cancer survivor, and so i can’t give her any responsibilities because most of it involves hospitals, and she understandably has severe anxiety around anything medical and is too young to understand the severity of the finances. any other relatives are long dead or assholes living in another country. i won’t inherit anything because if anything is left over from the nursing home, it will go straight to my father, who will not be giving the inheritance to us. and even if he wanted to, he owes thousands to debtors who will be seizing it all. sadly my grandparents did not set up any protections for me and my sibling against our dad. yes, i have consulted three separate attorneys. it is too late. my grandma’s dementia is getting much worse, but physically she will be living for a long time. she is now seeing her other son who died at birth as a ghostly toddler hanging around her nursing home. she also had a full conversation to “something” standing next to her the other day when i had a window visit. i have chills thinking about it because she talked into the air, and jumped as if someone had brushed against her. i could see the whole room around her, nobody was there. her face turned different and her eyes were not hers for about 20 seconds. she also sees her mom sitting on her bed every night. thank you for reading."," you’ve done a remarkable job so far despite the obstacles! unfortunately with this disease it’s as if there are no winners, so i have found that what you are doing, actively seeking comfort for your loved one is all we can do ❤️god bless you and give you strength and wisdom to continue this journey. the best thing to do is find a community that understands what you (all of us) are going through and offer support, you came to the right place. one day at a time and everything will be ok. virtual hugs!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m5dte1/23_f_taking_care_of_a_grandparent/,23 (F) taking care of a grandparent

my mom is currently in the end stages of dementia and i'm so tired of being told i need to be more thankful for the fact that she is alive and it could be worse. i don't even want her to be alive. i don't even want to be alive anymore. why aren't i allowed to be sad and grieve? why does everyone feel the need to compare my situation to others and tell me i am wrong for my feelings? i'm so tired of being isolated and have no support from anyone.,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m47ctn/i_wish_people_understood_how_painful_losing/,I wish people understood how painful losing someone to dementia is.
"every once in a while i’ll pop in to see how others cope with a loved one dealing with dementia. i really don’t know how you guys do it. i am newer to this sub. i only discovered that my mom has lewy body dementia a couple weeks ago. i haven’t had contact with her in years due to her being an abusive drug addict. i ran away as far as i could when i got the chance and i never looked back. now the state will be taking guardianship over her. i wasn’t sure if i should reopen the door to my past and i still am unsure. i told my supervisor i’d be taking some time off of work to go visit her ( i live in a different state) and now i can’t get myself to actually go. i coward away from the truth anytime her condition starts to creep into my mind. today it got the better of me and i read many of your posts. i just can’t believe how strong you guys are. some of you even taking care of them from home. i guess i feel like such a coward because i could never do what you guys do, i can’t even woman up and face my mother. i wish you all the best ❤️"," when i was growing up my family was good friends with a married couple in the same industry as my parents. jose, the husband, was a super nice dude and his wife was delightful. i knew them for many years when i was a child, but one day my mother told me about why jose came over and i was sent to my room to play. jose’s mother had alzheimer’s. she was pretty bad off and lived in a different state. jose was talking to my parents about how guilty he felt putting her in a home and only talking with staff.now that my grandfather is diagnosed with dementia and has entered stage 7, i think about jose a lot. he’s no longer in my life so i can’t tell him he did the right thing for his mother, but i can tell you. if this is a door you don’t want to open, you don’t have to. we shut doors for a reason. you have to take care of yourself. whatever decision you make will be the right one. you know what’s best for you. 💜",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m41wun/you_are_all_so_brave_and_so_strong/,You are all so brave and so strong
"very rarely post on reddit but thought it might be good to join this community to understand other people’s point of view on having a relative with dementia. recently, my mum had a diagnosis of probable lewy body dementia at a young age of 56. i’m currently 24, and just wanted to ask a few questions to you guys.1. how much reassurance should i give my mum when she asks about the future of dementia? how honest should i be about what will happen?2. i struggle with impatience or sometimes anger with the ‘selfish’ or ‘ungrateful’ symptoms that occur with dementia. i know it’s not really her feelings, but how do i avoid being hurt by these behavioural changes?3. this is a very new diagnosis and we are trialling different medications to help the symptoms but some are reacting badly. how long does it take to find the right medication? i’m so glad there is somewhere like this where i can talk to others in a similar situation. any tips or answers to these questions are appreciated. thank you"," i have lbd symptoms, and many of my friends.  we have done quite a few videos in the video section for dementia mentors >> [ .",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m3wjgy/new_diagnosis_for_my_56_year_old_mother/,New diagnosis for my 56 year old mother

"i highly recommend these books with large font and large photos for people living with dementia and caregivers. there are books for veterans, fishermen, cat lovers, faith-based, etc. i’ve struggled for the past several years to find something to connect with my mom. these books have been the only thing lately to do the trick. best part is? they don’t mention in the book they’re curated for people with dementia. my mother is prone to reacting (poorly) whenever she is reminded of the illness. i love these books. buy on amazon for about $10 a book.

"my grandmother has moderate vascular dementia. i was her primary caregiver for about seven years, and now i share that responsibility with her daughter (my aunt). the three of us moved into a new house together last september, which of course was a major change that took some getting used to.another major change that's happened recently (last november) was a cat joining our family.my grandmother loves this cat. i find them cuddled up together napping on an almost daily basis. she was very, very withdrawn before we got him, and now she is much more engaged and chatty, both with him and with us humans. when she's talking about the cat she speaks more easily and with a wider vocabulary than i've heard from her in years.but it also frustrates the hell out of her that he's a cat, and can't be reasoned with. she gets very upset when he goes places she doesn't want him to go, and she reacts by loudly yelling at him, demanding that he stop. he is, of course, a cat, and doesn't listen, so she just keeps yelling until someone comes to physically remove him. (she has very limited mobility, so she can't get up and move him herself.) even when i or my aunt do come to deal with the cat, it's often only a few minutes until she starts yelling again. often he's not even doing anything wrong - she's yelled at him for not cuddling with her, for sniffing at the front door (she seems to think he can actually open the door and leave), or for hanging out on the stairs, which we have firmly established as his domain. i understand that i can't get her to stop yelling, at the cat or in general. but for various reasons, it's very upsetting to me to hear loud yelling, even if i know it's not directed at me or a reaction to a serious problem. honestly, this is a problem i need to be working on in therapy - but that's not an option at the moment.does anyone have any suggestions for how to tune out her yelling without preventing myself from being able to respond when she actually needs something? or how to accept that it's not my fault and not directed at me?"," have you ever tried meditating? that may be a good place to start. avoid the reddit subs for info though, they are generally trash. if you can build a good meditation practice, it will help you control your mind and thoughts better. it takes time and is not a total solution, but it will absolutely help. and, it will benefit you later on as things progress with your gma. i’ll see if i can find some decent instructions for you.eta: here’s some instructions on posture. don’t force yourself into things that feel uncomfortable. you can sit in a chair if needed. you can start with ten or twenty minutes, and go up to 40 if you can/want to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m3tenp/i_cant_reasonably_expect_my_grandmother_to_stop/,"I can't reasonably expect my grandmother to stop yelling, so how do I stop it from getting to me?"

"i have never posted here, but occasionally lurked when i felt like i needed to be reminded that a lot of people have gone through this. especially in the past couple days. thanks in advance for reading this rant.my grandmother is currently dying. somehow, it happened fast and slow at the same time. the last couple days have been fast -- on wednesday morning she was still talking, but by the evening she had lost awareness and only stared into space. it is clear that her soul has already moved on, and her body is working to catch up. her eyes look so dull and lifeless, and she cannot close them, which i think is the worst part. she is moaning and gasping, and then twitching in response to the morphine. it is awful.but it has also felt slow. wednesday night felt like it should have been the end, and every day since then felt even more so. and in the scheme of things -- october was when they told us she was at the end stage. we didn't think she would make it to halloween. and then thanksgiving. and then christmas. every holiday a benchmark, we thought, that she would not reach. we were certainly happy that she made it each time, especially for christmas, when i asked her if she knew what today was, and she said in the tiniest voice, ""it's christmas."" but at the same time, every holiday she was around for was marked with a sadness. she is not the person she was. she used to *live* for the holidays and worked so hard to make it special. every holiday she was around for recently consisted of her getting confused and agitated about the slight changes to her schedule, or yelling about the extra people who were around.now it feels slow again. i would sit by her and hold her hand as she takes her last breath, but every breath has seemed like her last for the past 36 hours. which is why i'm posting a rant on reddit, because what else can i do? we are just waiting, waiting, waiting, for the battle to be over."," the days before death can be both long and short. i get it. i held my moms hand as she passed quietly, my sister was laying on the bed beside her, holding her. we were so lucky. i hope you find peace with what will be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m3pl2b/we_are_at_the_end/,We are at the end

"a year ago my mom, age 71, was diagnosed with ""significant cognitive decline."" she is seeing a neurologist regularly. she said that the dr won't use the phrase ""dementia"" until after they confirm with an autopsy; that seems really unhelpful to me, but what do i know?what do i do now? do i start asking questions and writing down life stories? is there a book or a resource you recommend? i feel like i am on a clock and have maybe 15 years left, based on what i've googled. thanks."," unless you are fortunate enough to live in an area where the medical community is progressive in their approach to dementia, don't expect much from doctors. you'll go hungry for answers as they put your loved one through the rigors of psych and physical tests only to tag it with ""dementia"" of some type. they don't give you any guidebook or tips, and if you are the sole caregiver, you'll have to rely on your own pursuit of the facts, tools, and emotional support from others going through, or having gone through the experience. the doctors are pretty dismissive about things and settle on ""age-related alzheimer's"" more times than not. they don't ask about mold or other environmental factors. so, if you are the caregiver for someone with cognitive limitations, get involved in a support system like lickety glitz's stumped town dementia, or teepa snow teepasnow.com, or the broad-spectrum  to take your hand through virtual space so you don't lose heart. i wish us all fair winds and following seas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/m3myv2/at_the_beginning_what_to_do/,At the beginning.

"my 98 year old mother was recently treated in the hospital for a uti.  she has frontal lobe dementia and the hospital stay definitely made it worse such that her usual regimen of meds aren't working as effectively at helping her sleep. long and short of it, it's been two days since she slept and she's loopy as hell. seeing and hearing thngs. carrying on conversations with phantom people. told me turn off the tv (already off) before it broke and flew away. anyone else caring for someone with insomnia? suggestions? (i contacted her doctor but no response yet.) all advice welcome. i'm exhausted."," you want to ask the doctor for olanzapine commonly known as zyprexia.  i have a 81 year old mil that i care for. she has gotten the recent diagnosis of dementia. she has a tendency to be awake all night long and wander the house. after some severe behavior issues recently the doctor prescribed this miracle drug!  it is a very light sedative, but for folks with dementia it helps get a good nights sleep so they wake up feeling refreshed and less agitated.  it has made a huge difference.  start with the lowest dose which is 2.5mg.  \*tip\* please don't let your loved one self administer. be sure to watch them for any issues with balance while taking. it is a sedative after all!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/r30e3p/insomnia/,,Insomnia
my dad has lewey body dementia and recently lost a lot of function after being hospitalized for a uti. i quite my job to help care for him during the week and we’ll live if my wife’s salary. he’s not eligible for medicaid. all that being said does anyone here know of a way i could get paid to help care for him?, have him sign a poa with medical so you can make decisions when he becomes disabled. my parents did and it has made things a bit easier during tough times.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/qybbbr/getting_paid_to_care_for_father/,,Getting paid to care for father?
"hey everyone. long time lurker, first time poster on an anon account. i hope it's okay for me to post here because i'm at my wits end. sorry for the long post, but i felt like i really needed to get this off my chest.my partner and i (25 and 30) moved in with an elderly disabled woman in spring of 2019. she previously had a roommate who was her full time caregiver, but she was telling all her friends that he became violnt and she didn't feel safe and needed to replace him. we were running from an abusive landlord and desperately needed a place to live, so our mutual friend connected us. id been to her place a few times years ago, and thought she was a nice lady. she asked if either of us would be her caregiver and we said absolutely not. we both have careers and busy lives &amp; my partner has trauma from being forced to be their moms cg when they were 9 and she was 'dying' (she didnt die thankfully, but she talked like she would for a few years which messed them uppppp). lady said she totally understood, and would find a replacement herself that wouldn't live here.nobody had told us she has dementia/alzheimers. nobody knew. she still doesn't even know. and i'd never lived with an elderly person so i had no idea what we were in for.a month later, the new caregiver quits. we find another one. they're black and it turns out the lady is super racist, so soon they quit too. one by one she quickly burns through several caregivers who cant handle her personality or the hoarder house. partner and i then had to step in, and were promised it would only be a month. (that was ~september 2019...) then in feb 2020 we (not her) found a small group of community members who were all willing to take on 1-2 days a week of at least meal prep, give her her baths, etc. great. relief was in sight.march happens. we live in san francisco and our city is the first in the us to lock down. all the new caregivers vanish. one of them had been training to be a 'death doula' and she never called again. we were left without even food for the next day. my partner had to quit their high paying management job to stay home and be a caregiver. every month, we are reminding her to call the in home support services people, her doctor or her case manager and ask for new caregivers and help. all they ever do is physically mail her a list of 5 people who are signed up in the system but not currently collecting paychecks. she won't call people with non-white names and she won't give esl people a chance. obviously this means we don't have many options left. the only person who showed up for an interview/trial run in the last year used our toilet and didn't wash her hands and then asked if she could take her mask off (and this was pre-vax). so it's just been us. and she's such a massive control freak that if she even suspects that we want to go over her head about something, she flips out.she is in decline. she's spent most of this year obsessed with poo, making messes, yelling at her doctors for not giving her more the exact butt stuff she wants done and yelling at my partner for refusing to give her an enema that she did not need. it's awful. and she forgets things more, is mean more, buys more garbage and throws more tantrums than a year ago.we aren't her family. she isn't my grandma. and while i used to think she was a cool old lady that i could learn things from, i feel we've seen her true colors and i really really do not like her. shes told us some very nasty stories about her youth and i really don't think i would have liked her back then, either. she's always been entitled and elitist and rude and looked down on others. i had to tap out of helping with her face to face tasks pretty early on, because she goes on really graphic rambling tangents about her poop and her sexual history, and says shockingly horrible things and i just can't act like it doesn't phase me. i would walk away and have tremors for hours, and need to scream and cry and do therapy after just talking to her. we've had a lot of clashes and have called every social service and hotline we can think of trying to find help. nobody seems to care.she's mean and irrational. she thinks we take advantage of her. shes a compulsive online shopper and a serious hoarder, so in a 4 bedroom flat the two of us only have 1 tiny room to share. the rest are unsafe and unusable. she thinks the house should be spotless, even with her hoardes, so if she sees any of our things outside our bedroom she flips. she gets donations every week from the food pantry even though shes diabetic and the donations are never food she can eat...but we are not allowed to throw it out or give it to people who will eat it because that would be ""stealing"" from her. she doesn't respect anyones boundaries and complains, literally, that we don't ""treat her like a queen."" (she was a dominatrix in the past &amp; thinks everyone who walks into the house, especially us, is here to ""serve"" her). anytime we have a guy friend over, she texts us asking to have him do chores for her. no amount of boundary talks will get through to her because she can't remember and she doesn't really care.i'm posting here because she started *threatening violence* against my partner last week. i was so sick and really needed care myself for once. so my partner told her that morning that theyd have to postpone her bath so they could go get me meds and look after me. she threw a fit, said "" you know we'll need to have a talk later"" and wheeled out. sat in her room the rest of the day stewing and giving us the silent treatment. that night my partner went to have that talk, and she hit them with every insult, every below-the-belt blow she could think of. and she started talking about how she ""was a hells angel"" (lol no she wasn't) and wishes she was 25 again so she could punch my partner in the face!! they were like ""whoa, no, you cannot talk to me like that"" and she went on and on about wanting to hit them, kicking their ass, what an awful person they are and how theyre lucky to even be here. saying she didnt think theyd be able to get a job that paid any more than what they make taking care of her which is too much if you ask her. saying they ""should be very scared right now"" and trying to intimidate them. just every nasty thing she could think of. all because they needed to prioritize their actual partner for one freaking morning.the fact that they stayed level headed and did not take any of her bait just proves what a kickass nurse theyre going to be because omg. i was livid that she came after them like that.and then they had to give her a bath the next day anyway!! and she remembered the talk, told them ""oh you misunderstood me, i was simply telling you to celebrate how much ive grown because now i would not hit you. 😇"" !!!!! ive avoided her since that incident like the plague, hiding when she rolls into the kitchen and running past her room without looking when i need to leave the house so she doesnt stop me for some gross story. i can't act ok around her anymore. i can't act like i don't absolutely resent her and hate living here. i'm still boiling mad about her threats. they were the absolute last straw. we've both been burned out by her since before the pandemic started, idk what to even call it now. deep hopelessness?we are looking at new places to live. for the first time ever, it'll be just the two of us, no roommates. and my partner is interviewing for nursing gigs (they just got their cna license) that pay double+ what they make as a caregiver. so while we were previously trapped here by poverty (and fear of leaving an elder to die), we actually have a shot at moving up economically and finally getting a decent home!! we could finally be free!!(also, this house is falling apart. shes rented here for 52 years and the slummy landlord has never once fixed anything. we spent the first 5 months of lockdown without hot running water because he wouldnt fix the water heater 🙃 and the mold in my our room specifically is making us and our pets sick.)...but there is still no replacement caregiver lined up. we've tried everywhere we can think of. and she has no idea we have a foot out the door, because last time she thought we wanted to leave her things went nuclear. for our own safety and peace in the house, we have to find a place, sign a lease, then tell her the news. she isn't going to take it well. but that means that shes still convinced herself that even when my partner gets a new, 40-60 hour a week job, theyll somehow still be around to wipe her butt and do all her chores. or that i'll fill in. all of the advice articles i've read online are about ""caring for a loved one"". people taking care of relatives, spouses, and people they knew before. what about people like us? we were forced into this job by circumstance and had no connection with our ""patient"" before this. she's just someone some of our friends know. i used to have sympathy and affection for this lady, but not anymore.i don't love her. at all. i definitely would not do this or put up with this treatment from my own family. what are we supposed to do when even adult protective services flaked out and did nothing when we called them crying for emergency backup? what do we do when her case manager won't even answer her calls?what do we do??? i feel like the end is in sight and we want to move toward it, but we're chained down to this giant thing that we never asked for. i want us to leave as soon as we have a place, pretty much drop everything and go. give her a 2 weeks notice after we've got beds set up at the new place so we dont have to sleep here the night she throws her nuclear tantrum. partner feels guilt and responsibility and isn't quite on board yet with that. but honestly, they've turned in their 2 weeks notice like 4 times over the last 2.5 years and i really don't think they owe her that anymore. i believe we deserve to have our lives back.am i just a heartless jerk or is this a reasonable reaction? does anyone know how to get aps to actually step in and check on people? if you read this all, thank you. i promise i will always be a huge advocate for caregiver support now because of this. no caregiver gets enough thanks or support for the horrors they put up with."," find somewhere else to live. if you cannot stand staying with her, she who was nice enough to let you and your man live there, then find someone else to mouch off of, sounds like you are not doing anything to really help this lady or your current life situation. better your own self and let the system take care of her, y'all are obviously not interested in actually helping this lady or her situation out you sounds like you are only looking after your own self.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/qu21a0/i_need_help_coming_to_terms_with_leaving_an/,,I need help coming to terms with leaving an abusive elder we never wanted to care for

"i need help figuring out how to make sure i am not a secondary caregiver. i want to figure out when it is appropriate to say ""no"" to a request from my father to handle something for my grandmother. i am young (23f) and i feel like if i do become one, i won't be able to move into the next stage of my life. additionally, i highly suspect that it will fall to me to become my parents' caregivers later in life (my sister is not present in our lives), and i want to spend as few years as a caregiver as possible.i  am currently living with my parents with flexible employment hours. because of this, small to moderate tasks that require driving are most often handed off to me. i take my grandmother driving to the grocery store or find her clothing etc. if there is an issue with her dog, i take it to the vet. if my father cannot take my grandmother to a doctor's appointment, it falls to me. if she needs a new doctor, you can guess who is doing the research. so, i am trying to make sure that i am still a helpful granddaughter who is doing her part, especially because i am using my grandmother's car, which she pays for, and my grandmother has done so much for me growing up. unfortunately, i can't be near her too much because she doesn't understand boundaries and her mental health really hinders mine--her depression magnifies my depression.a big frustrating part is my uncle isn't involved in the small stuff. he's busy and has a difficult job, plus three kids under the age of 15, so i get why a young adult with minimal responsibilities would be a good pick to care for an elder, but still i feel like i shouldn't be doing this. for more context, my father is the primary caregiver for my grandmother. honestly, she doesn't need much caregiving--she can go to the bathroom by herself, she has her memory (for the most part. no dementia or alzheimers is the point) and can do practical actions that most anyone can do. her main disabilities are moderate impediments, but not so much to make living at her house impossible.please help"," functionally, you need to move into a different home. it can be nearby for emergencies. maybe even walking distance. you can still do research and help them with setting up technology. but you need to start disentangling your daily routine and life from your grandma’s needs.of course i say this, at 25 and a half… having been a secondary caregiver and informal administrative specialist of all their paperwork but without a real job of my own for basically two years now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/qdyacb/what_is_the_line_between_helpful_grandchild_and/,,What is the line between helpful grandchild and caregiver

"so, my wife's grandfather died last week of prostate cancer at the age of 92. it was about a 2 year battle (unfortunately, through most of covid) and he passed peacefully in his sleep last tuesday. he left behind his wife of 67 years, who has dementia. we are a small family - my wife is the only child of an only child - which means the care giving is falling primarily on my wife and i (fil has another member he is already caring for).it seems that the family never really confronted grandma's dementia when it was diagnosed about 10 years ago, and now that her husband is gone, it's become increasingly difficult to sit with her. conversations inevitably circle back to where her husband is, what happened to him, and how she is a terrible wife and person for not knowing he was sick. we try to reassure her, but then 30 seconds later it all repeats.i'm learning more about the disease, but the last week has been... just utterly exhausting. we've begun to keep a ""memory journal"" where she can record her thoughts and feelings, as well as a schedule broken down by hour of what has and is going to happen that day. this seems to help somewhat, but i wonder how much progress can be realistically expected.at this point i'm not even sure what my question is. i guess i'm just looking for advice, or at the least some positive things to keep in view, since the future seems very bleak at the moment."," i relate to the only child of an only child. not sure this will help, but with my nona who had dementia: my mom died about 4 months after we had moved my nona into a dementia home 20 years ago. we went and i told nona that mom (her daughter) had died, honestly it was one of the worst moments of my life (hers as well), the sobbing and grief was huge. i went home a few days later and the following week was checking in with my dad and when i asked how nona was, he said, 'she had a bad day, she forgot your mom died and when they told her it was like she was finding out for the first time again.' i immediately called the home and spoke with the head nurse who was great. we talked it through, and i said never to tell her again, if she asked when phyllis was coming, they should just respond with 'she said she's coming later, or after work', or anything besides, she had died. i didn't want her to have to relive that news repeatedly, emotionally it was too difficult.we also laminated a copy of my mom's obit which had a picture of my mom that nona loved. she carried a purse around the home and that was one of the items in it. not sure if she understood it was an obit, but she would take it out and stare at the picture and i guess read the words, but it didn't set off a grief reaction.i think their all so different but just finding a way to tell a white lie that keeps her out of the grief space. a lie like ""oh. he's at work, he's on a work trip.' because they are more likely to remember events from long ago past, your grandfather probably was at work and away daily and it might be enough to set her mind at ease instead of the more recent illness which is painful for her. i'm struggling to make this easy to understand, basically a white lie that fits her narrative of her life with your grandfather that keeps her from experiencing the recent painful memory repeatedly. this is all so fricking hard and painful for everyone involved. all the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/q7v9k8/taking_care_of_dementia_patient/,,Taking care of dementia patient

"hi everybody, using a throwaway for a few reasons. i'll go ahead with the tl;dr: **if money was no object, what would the best possible option for in-home care be so that i could get decent sleep and perhaps even work a part-time job?**now, the context: 8 months ago, i left my job and moved in with my parents to take care of my father full-time. he's recovering from a broken hip and a turp procedure to help correct his constant utis, and he came home from a short stay at a snf (before i moved in) with a surprise stage 3 sacral pressure wound. he also has vascular dementia, aphasia, and is incontinent.i'm around the house all day and all night to handle his medications and rth bottle feeds (via peg tube), to help with repositioning &amp; cleaning every two hours, and, of course, to help with home health visits (nurse 3x per week, pt 2x per week, nurse aide for baths 2x per week) and in-office doc appointments.thankfully, i know how to care for him because one of the hospitals allowed me to be there for 2 weeks straight and i ask a lot of questions whenever we see specialists.cleaning/repositioning him is typically a two-person job due to both his strength and fragility (does that make any sense?). my mom, due to physical issues, isn't able to really be hands-on except in a limited capacity, so we have hired cnas for day and night shifts. thankfully, my mom has the retirement savings and income to support this level of care for at least a few years. **so, here's my question: if money was no object, what would the best possible option for in-home care be so that i could get decent sleep and perhaps even work a part-time job? would it be a private nurse (or something more skilled than a typical cna), and if so, where do we find them in the state of georgia?** to be clear, he absolutely cannot go to a facility (poor/neglected facility care is why we're in this position today). our daytime cna is very helpful and could possibly eventually do the job on her own, but my mom is spending a massive amount of money on weekend and nighttime cnas that, while they are helpful as a second set of hands and mostly stay awake to keep an eye on him, still require my constant presence. i only sleep a couple of hours at a time each night between repositions/cleanings and it's exhausting. if my mom is spending a ton of money anyway, how can that money best be used so that we're all able to sleep reasonable hours and still tend to our own personal health during the daytime? just to clarify, we would absolutely still be extremely hands-on in all aspects of my dad's care- this post is not me looking for a way to not be involved anymore- we just want to figure out the best possible arrangement where i can step back when i need to and be well-rested without any detriment to my dad's quality of care. i completely see that caregiver burnout is so real and so highly probable.my dad's come a long way already over these past 8 months and i'm so proud of him for still wearing a big smile on his face when we give him hugs in his bed. he's been through a lot and deserves a real chance at finding a new healthy baseline.thank you guys so much in advance for your perspective. reading everyone's posts on this subreddit is deeply moving because it's helping me feel like i'm not the only person in the world who's dealing with this type of situation."," find different nighttime/weekend people if you can’t trust the ones you have. otherwise you are already doing everything. one of the ways that i was able to trust our night time caregiver was that took a day planner. one of those that has a row for every half hour and basically had her chart everything that happens. medications, rotation etc. that also helped keep track of how bed sores were healing and if my dad’s blood pressure was getting out of wack or other issues that might pop up. it helped build trust and eventually i was able to get a full nights sleep. i guess another option is if you can trust the day time person to work on her own is to sleep during the day and essentially do night shifts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/pw8tam/looking_for_help_figuring_out_the_best_possible/,,Looking for help figuring out the best possible in-home care option

"in the us, we get [7.7 million]( new cases of dementia every year.what is dementia? it’s a condition that affects a person’s cognitive functioning. while it’s very common in the elderly, it’s actually not a natural part of aging.because of this, it’s very important to keep an eye out for dementia in the elderly, as it can severely impact their safety and quality of life.if you want to learn more, then keep reading. in this article, we’ll discuss the early warning signs of dementia. that way, you can help your loved one out as best as you can.## short-term memory lossas we age, it’s only natural that our bodies don’t serve us as well as they used to. that includes our brain; it might be tougher to recall things.however, the key difference between normal aging and dementia is that with the latter, the affected person can’t recall things later on. they might have issues remembering things they recently learned, such as appointments they’ve made, things they’ve left in a room, or items bought at the grocery store in the morning.it’s important to note that memory loss is usually limited to the short-term type. those with dementia typically still have their long-term memory intact.## difficulties with speechwhen it comes to obvious dementia signs, difficulties with speech is one to keep an eye out for. your loved one might have a challenging time communicating their thoughts with you, and it seems like they just can’t find the right words.as a result, a conversation might be slow goings. there might be frequent pauses and the substitution of similar-sounding words for the ones they’re looking for.## repeating themselvesbecause they have short-term memory loss, your parent might end up repeating themselves quite often. they’ll keep asking you the same questions or doing a task repeatedly.you’ll know right away if your loved one has early dementia when you have a conversation with them. not only will they struggle with speech, but they’ll keep asking about or commenting on the same things. there may be some periods of clarity, but if your senior seems to have forgotten something you just told them minutes ago, that’s a big red flag.## difficulties with writingthe challenges with speech will also translate to writing.you might notice that your loved one’s writing is becoming difficult to read. and if they had impeccable spelling and grammar before, it’s likely you’ll see many errors if they’re in the early stages of dementia.## trouble with daily taskshas your parent forgotten how to do simple daily tasks they’re used to? then this is a huge warning flag for dementia.closely monitor your loved one to see if they’re taking care of themselves alright. are they able to cook for themselves, shower, do laundry, clean the house, etc?if you notice a lapse in cleanliness or self-care, they might be in the early stages of dementia.## confusionwe all misplace things in obvious places, only to find them soon after. having a busy lifestyle and just aging will put us in this position many times, so this is only normal.but if your senior seems significantly confused, it can be because of dementia. they might not remember where they are, how they got there, or what day it is. in later stages of dementia, they might not even recognize their family and friends.## trouble with spatial awarenessdementia causes changes in the brain, which can affect how a person handles spatial awareness. it can also affect their sense of direction.for this reason, your loved one might be clumsier than usual. they might also get lost when trying to go to and from places, regardless of whether or not they’ve been there before. even if you write out step-by-step instructions for your senior to go somewhere, they still might get lost just because their sense of direction is compromised.## changes in their mood and personalitymany people become depressed in the early stages of dementia. typically, the changes in mood and personality will be fast and even jarring to witness.seniors who were once happy and joyful might suddenly become irritated, anxious, and fearful. in some cases, they might even act inappropriately.many seniors with dementia also become apathetic. they might isolate themselves and stop doing social activities. they’ll also cease doing their hobbies and become listless.there’s the possibility that these changes in mood and personality are due to medications. so speak with your loved one’s doctor to rule that out first.## difficulty with changeit can be tough dealing with all the scary changes that dementia can bring. suddenly, familiar things become strange to them and they just can’t hold onto thoughts and memories.having early dementia can be a stressful and frightening thing. as a result, your parent might stubbornly cling to routine, being highly resistant to any changes you might want to make.## know the early warning signs of dementianow that you know what the early warning signs of dementia are, you’ll be able to spot them in your elderly parents or relatives.while the early stages of dementia are somewhat manageable, there comes a time where your loved one will need round-the-clock care. if you don’t want to put them in a home, consider becoming their caregiver [through cdpap]( you’ll be financially compensated to ensure some security.this situation ends up being optimal for many families because you can look after the elderly with signs of dementia without having to financially suffer.so if you’d like to be the primary caretaker of your loved one, then [check your cdpap eligibility]( now!  source: [", my brother-in-law is 36 and has stml from a medical condition he was born with (also from a stroke/coma). younger people can start getting early signs of dementia if they've had similar situations and i'm positive he has these. he has other issues that cause similar symptoms but he's had multiple brain surgeries as well that don't make his chances good.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/pr35ds/what_are_the_early_warning_signs_of_dementia/,,What Are the Early Warning Signs of Dementia?
lewy body dementia. fast progression. where do we go from here? she has instructions typed up but they aren’t with an attorney or anything? i don’t know where to begin.," i'm so sorry to hear about your grandmother! dementia is so hard but i think particularly lewy body dementia and frontal lobe dementia are the hardest because if the fast progression of the disease process and the physical changes that happen more quickly than other dementia types. it's good that she has some instructions already typed up! that can help give you some direction at least. the biggest things that need to be done are to get a healthcare power of attorney in place or healthcare proxy depending on what state you live in. if she is still cognitive enough to sign a power of attorney, do that asap. if she isn't, you may need to prepare to apply for guardianship. i would also look into hospice and palliative care. i'm a medical social worker, so i help families with this daily! i have more details about hospice and palliative care services, along with advance directives (power of attorney and living will stuff) and even funeral planning on my blog if you want to check it out. www.seniorplanningonline.com i hope this helps!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/pq52tk/how_can_i_prepare_my_grandmother_for_the_end_of/,,How can I prepare my grandmother for the end of her life?

"hello all. very happy to have found this group and some folks i can relate to. mom had a stroke 11 years ago, which left her with significant cognitive issues,  loss of mobility, incontinence and aphasia. she needs 24/7 care including overnight care that requires turning and changing every two hours. 5 years ago she also started to develop dementia which has significantly worsened in the last two years, she screams, cries and repeats herself. i used to have the assistance of a caregiver which allowed me to work a 9 to 5. after some instances of caregiver abuse,  combined with the coronavirus , i am now the sole caregiver. due to the severity of her symptoms finding a caregiver would be a challenge anyway. i like taking care of mom and think i do a good job. i got lucky because i used to be a home health aide working with dementia patients. it is still very challenging,  she is challenging to deal with during the day and also requires all night care. i have been allowed to work from home since the pandemic and have an employer that is generally understanding. it is however proving to be extremely challenging. in order to keep up with my work, which is is mostly data - based , i am up all night working. i am completely exhausted and tired doing both and my mental health is suffering. all of that to say, i want to quit my job but i am hesitant to give my career,  401k , but also know that this is not sustainable and that i'd be happier focusing on mom full-time. financially,  i don't have much savings,  but would become a paid caregiver to my mom which would cover the bills, for emergencies, i would have my 401k which would cover a year of expenses. has any one here made the same decision? how are you doing today? thank you in advance!", how are you going to get paid to be her caregiver?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/pmqy87/quit_my_job/,,Quit my job ?

"my extended family keeps trying to rig the california caregiver payment system. my grandfather, who has symptoms of dementia (which they keep denying, without even going to the doctor), is living with his son’s family. mind you this family is very frugal (really rich but frugal). they put their daughter, his granddaughter as caregiver so that she gets paid monthly to “take care of him”. and if taking care of an elder means sleeping in an waking up at 12pm every day while the grandfather prepares his own breakfast and preparing the minimum food by cooking rice, sure. now while classes were online she stayed home. but now that’s it’s back in person she’s moved out and apparently uses that monthly payment for “taking care of her grandfather” to pay for her rent. and she’s not even home to take care of him. they’re even trying to schedule the frequent in-person interview/check-in around her schedule since she’s not even home when technically she is supposed to be. i’m just frustrated because there’s nothing i can do but watch, knowing all this is going on. other family elders have asked them to take their daughter’s name out and use a real caretaker who will cook proper food, and take care of him. someone who will drive him to hospitals when needed, and has the right capabilities. but they still haven’t and continue to claim their daughter is taking care of him. she does to a certain extent, but it’s not the proper care a dementia patient needs to get. i honestly believe she shouldn’t be getting paid.", i'm assuming the granddaughter is getting paid through ihss in california?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/pit1fq/family_caregiver_rigging/,,Family Caregiver Rigging
"i wasn’t sure whether/how to write this down. i’ve rewritten these lines so many times, in effort to be as clear as possible. i wholeheartedly believe we’re all doing the best we can, yet sometimes the extra harshness in the world today adds to the daily struggle.for as long as i can remember, daddy has always been medically complex. he is now on hospice, dialysis, wheelchair bound &amp; recovering from a hip fracture this summer as well as managing multiple cancers and advanced alzheimer’s. immunocompromised and debilitated, he cannot get either the covid or flu vaccines. i am generally a spiritual, joyful person, in my mid30s, striving to stay positive amid anticipatory grief and an increasingly toxic office workplace. i feel blessed to help my folks with my single gal paycheck; and i am on intermittent fmla so i can help be available to them on short notice. amid working full time and caregiving, i have little time/energy for anything else. still, i try to be the change i want to see in the world - keep the narrative positive, focus on gratitude, always say pls &amp; thank you, random acts of kindness, be a loyal friend. never know when we might be planting a seed/bring someone a bit of needed sunshine, right?yet sometime like tonight, the sadness and weariness engulf. i’ve quietly cried for hours, analyzing and reflecting.and it’s not because earlier today, i literally kept running back and forth btwn my car &amp; the gas station bathroom, figuring out how to respect dad’s dignity amid emergency gi issues &amp; sundowning. we did the best we could with limited resources [let’s just say, macguyer would have been proud]. it was exhausting yet we handled it together. i lost a cherished ring in the process, tho i am just so grateful/relieved that he didn’t have another fall, i submit to simply hoping my lost jewelry brings someone else joy.it’s the other little things - when my boyfriend who is also struggling with his job doesn’t realize when he’s being grumpy with me. when i’m awaken from a nap by daddy’s sundowning &amp; he doesn’t recall he saw me at all today. being sadly surprised when my beloved, burnt out mum laments she’s in this alone or shushes me when i try to understand or comfort her.in the last several years, i’ve been on my own medical journey [severe infection developed after multiple biopsies, 5 antibiotics within the course of a month, several surgeries, etc &amp; coping with not being able to have children]. tho i am determined not to let anyone steal my joy &amp; am blessed to serve my caregiver role, dealing with the general unkindness/compassion fatigue in the world is draining -&amp;- makes it more painful when it happens amid my little tribe.  i wonder if anyone even sees me. just me. not someone to scold, project, order about, mistreat, take for granted, scapegoat. me, the girl who wears heart shaped sunglasses.someone i considered one of my dearest friends for over a decade recently discarded me recently via a texting app for “not being healthy enough for friendship” after years of claiming i saved her life by supporting her during her depression &amp; broken promises to be there whenev i needed her. another friend ironically woke me up in the middle of the night with a gossipy text about me, clearly intended for another, mocking me for being so tired all the time [she later apologized &amp; we both tried yet…]. the unexpected shaming at work for being unmarried/childless - more than once hearing i’m lucky to not have children / i ought to work “harder” ie even nore uncomp’d overtime, bc i “don’t have a family of my own“ - cruel, heartwrenching &amp; untrue. this past hospitalization, even tho i helped with his hygiene and meals, i was refused a note for work because i didn’t help “enuf” to fully relieve the cna. the worst was when the charge nurse screamed at me across dad’s bed because he developed a decubitus ulcer on his heel - an avoidable complication due to negligent nursing care. she blamed me, as she heard i too am a nurse and was there many days/nites at his bedside. yet, i was there as his daughter, as family, not an employee on payroll. so tonite, i sadly wonder again, who actually sees me and will remember me when i’m sick or gone.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/pibouf/compassion_fatigue_insomnia/,,Compassion fatigue & insomnia

"i love my family very much. my grandfather is 82 and has lewy.everyday is a new adventure in caregiving. my grandmother, while undiagnosed has a ton of anxiety and ocd like symptoms. she wont open her front door, or let me fill up a sink to wash dishes. i cooked for 500 in a residential setting but she hovers whenever i make dinner. shes terrified of water dripping, terrified the ac is too cold, terrified of everything. its crazy. caregiving based on everything i have read with my grandfather is very easy. there are a ton of fantastic resources out there. he is definitely starting to slowly chug towards post awareness. i'm so happy to be here. heres my but.it just doesnt click. shes just not wired to help someone with care needs. he wants her to help him wash, and she doesn't wanna do it. i offered to  help, my sister, a cna helped once and she freaked the fuck out on all of us. i love her so much but shes just not getting it guys. he has a shower seat but hes just sitting under the water. the home care aide now helps when he comes, but she has been his rock forever. he looks to her for everything. she keeps the house temperature at 80 degrees, and is more concerned when he is alert and complaining about the temperature than when hes hot, dizzy and spaced out. how do i help here? denial unravels hard, and sometimes she argues with his challenging behaviors instead of acknowledging them as symptomatic and homeostasis breaks. when she goes to the pool, or goes to yoga, or i have him alone while she does an errand, i follow everything you guys and the resources suggest and he goes from having dizzy spells and being barely responsive to enjoying fresh blended fruit smoothies, plenty of water and ice, and walking around and looking at his plants. as many of you know, a smooth flow and transitions are vital to ambulating and moving. she locks the brakes on his frame and runs around in circles on me lolol. it's just so hard sometimes. hes severely underweight because she cooks like when they were more successful agers, hes sometimes turning dinner away but i can always scrap together a nice hearty breakfast of his choice.when he comes up with false health worries, like red meat or something not mixing well, like milk and water he has been trying to drink, she just goes along with it and we are in the frame of dementia. she has done some reading-- i say enough to be dangerous -- and every day is a new battle sometimes. i work from home. we have respite but my life is slowly beginning to spin down to nothing at all but care. a vacation i had planned just got canceledhow do i help someone i love very much grieve? i'd do everything...every day...for 100 years if it would help. i just want to help extend this prognosis beyond. i have so much anticipatory grief that its heavy. what is she going to do when this progresses beyond our scope?i am open to any questions or suggestions..and this is not a bash of my dear mema....i just feel powerless to help them"," this is so very familiar. “everyday is a new adventure,” is what i typically tell my boss when i coordinate my intermittent fmla time off 🤓 great minds!how to help? i honestly don’t know as it sounds like you’re doing exactly what helps them both the most - for your sweet mema to see him make progress [tho perhaps part of the challenge is she doesn’t understand it’s a result of your care/not hers] & for him to feel/be better, yet you’re only human like the rest of us, making the best of a heartbreaking situation. similarly, at times, i just have to take completely over in a gentle way that my beloved & fiercely independent mum feels like she’s doing me a favor, as she will not easily ask for help, admit to her burnout/grief/exhaustion or remember her own selfcare amid her own health challenges. one of the earlier hospitalizations this past year, i was pushing them each in a wheelchair into the hospital, stopping & switching every 5-7 feet because she threw out her back but refused to rest at home or see her own doc - just bc she wanted to be with him. they’ve never been apart a night for 40 years, before covid. when hospice talked to her about respite care options, she was excited to learn if the snf he would be admitted to would have a recliner or cot for her to sleep at his side. it’s sweet yet then she is so tired at the end of the day, she doesn’t consistently have the energy to wipe down groceries, properly wear her mask, or reheat fast food before serving to dad (who is immunocompromised to the point he is too debilitated to get either the covid or flu vaccine). so, i volunteer on the regular to coordinate fmla time off work to pick him up from dialysis, telling her how i need a break from work [also true 😋] and encourage her to rest. i take him only to the few drivethrus that have 100% score from the local health departments -&- when i am able to cook/meal prep, mix protein powder into his oatmeal, smoothies, muffins & coffee. brinners & ice cream are always successful when he doesn’t have an appetite for an actual meal; so i ensure the fridge is stocked with what they both like. while dad sleeps, i offer to watch him while she rests, goes out, watch her favorite comedies together & invite her to watch the movies i know have sad/moving scenes, so that if she feels compelled to cry, she can. i encourage my sis to take her out for respite time/try to have these convos with her as she’s not very receptive to my attempts lately [during last hospitalization, we had a riff bc she told me he was full code when he was actually dnr, in effort to “protect me” from the harsh truth, when i was the primary caregiver planning to stay in the er until he  hold be admitted to the icu 🤦🏽‍♀️ we’re still striving to make up for lost ground, and i only share this in the spirit of transparency/faith that others here also understand and will kindly refrain from any sort of unhelpful feedback on our grieving loved ones. the struggle is real, of loving our fam loyally and still being so limited in what we can do, based on their capacities & our own, and we need to be able to overcome the guilt/shame of admitted the hard truths].i’m not saying this is the best way, but it’s the only way right now that works for us right now. at least this way, mum seems to catch up on rest and the intervals of her burnout are spaced further apart -&- dad is more responsive/alert/like his ol self.stay strong, redditfriend. your family and especially your sweet grandparents are both truly blessed to have you ✨♥️✨ i’m a dm away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/pc2pzw/what_do_you_do_when_it_doesnt_click/,,What do you do when it DOESNT CLICK?

"i just need to know if other caregivers have experienced this and how things ended up working out.i reached out to my aunt for help after months of spinning my wheels trying to get my mom's doctors to listen and my mom to quit work due to health issues that makes it really hard for her to get there without help. if she wants to work, i have to take the day off to help her get there. it's a real problem.she's had strokes and seizures. she's started sundowning. her doctors put her on statins even though her cholesterol was low because they couldn't be bothered to find the root cause of her strokes and treat them so she's having joint problems and can't always walk.so, anyways, i decided to move her to another state while she was still coherent enough to have a say in where she went, when to quit working, and new doctors, but that was a huge mistake. the roommate she was going to stay with changed the terms of the whole agreement as soon as we got here and my mom was so confused by the whole thing that she got combative. when i tried to smooth things over, the person went off on me and the whole thing was impossible to fix.i ended up spending all my money on hotels until i ran out of money. i mean, i was letting my car payment go to keep a roof over her head. so, i called my aunt to see if she had any suggestions and she offered to take my mom in so i could focus on work and getting more money together. i was hoping i'd be able to focus more on my mother's doctors, housing, and finances while someone else took care of her physically. she doesn't need much help. she just struggles with sundowning and following a plan. driving is a bit iffy -- enough to mess you up if you're busy, but not so much that it's a lot.well, flashforward two weeks later (yesterday) and my aunt decides she won't take my mom in because she has cats (there's obviously more to it because my mom has always had cats.), and she doesn't know why i can't give my mom more money. she looked up my business online and couldn't find me on facebook. so, she's convinced i just don't work which i'm not sure what that would even have to do with anything, but it also sucks to know you've been busting your ass trying to be a caretaker while running your own business full-time only to be told you're not doing enough, but i digress.point is: i'm on my own. my family is not going to help me and i don't know how to be a full-time caregiver and still run my business. on top of that, we've been living in tents since i ran out of money for hotels. and, without a permanent address, no state knows what to do with her. i can't qualify for caregiver income until she belongs to a state. i can get her a down payment for a mobile home, but it'll take a few months now that it's gotten so bad. in any case, it's my only option so it's what i'm working towards.here are the questions: have any of you gone through this? how do you get past feeling completely alone? how do you keep working when you have a homeless, elderly woman with alzheimers to take care of? i know i can't get my aunt to understand the overwhelm i feel, so what do you tell yourself when people judge you for not handling things better? there are so many people who have never experienced this and they just don't get where all the money, time, and energy goes. how do you stay confident that you're doing everything you can when everything still falls apart?thanks for reading!"," i’m going to echo the other poster. you absolutely need to get your mom into senior housing. there is no possible way to caregive properly while homeless and living in a tent. like you mentioned, it’s difficult to get the benefits/resources/etc that your mom will need without a fixed address. in addition, the nurses in a seniors home would be able totrack mom’s behaviours and the doctors would listen. this would help get a proper diagnosis and treatment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/p9hoe5/family_doesnt_understand_i_have_no_help_input/,,Family Doesn't Understand.

"hello, i just joined and appreciate all your posts and all that you do! this is my first post on reddit so forgive me if i format it wrong. i’m a caregiver in my early 50’s. my partner has ms and i’ve taken care of him for a number of years now, and it really never got me to a point of frustration or regret. at the beginning of the year, we moved and bought a larger house and moved my dad in with us, and going into it he was fairly strong and healthy for an 80+ y/o. but as soon as we got settled in, he got sick. long story short we find he has renal kidney failure, and the beginning of dementia. in a short period of time he has become bedridden, and basically can’t do much of anything for himself. because of nighttime episodes of dementia where he was trying to drive away, without his glasses on thinking he had a dentist appointment at 2:30am for one example, i’ve had to take his car keys away as well as his guns. i’m overwhelmed and feel like this is way more than i signed up for. we’re in florida, and normally he’d be hospitalized right now, but given the explosion of covid cases and the hospitals being overwhelmed, the doctors decided to keep him home. i’m exhausted, it’s day and night. and i worry about the effects on my relationship with my partner, who no longer has my undivided attention and care. between taking care of both of them, taking care of the house, cleaning, shopping, appts, yards, laundry and everything else, i’ve definitely put myself on the back burner. i’m new to this so will continue to read thru all your posts, but i certainly have a new level of respect and understanding for all you do. keep your heads up and a smile on your face!"," it certainly does feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day! yeah, i meant when living alone just the two of us, my partner had my undivided attention, as he was my sole focus. that was something i chose to do, and he never expected it and still doesn’t expect it now. he’s very laid back and has actually been through this before with his mother, before we were together. he never complains and is very support. his ms also is at a stage where he can still do a fair amount for himself. but now with my dad in the mix, and his health going downhill so quickly, it requires a great deal more of my time and energy, and i just worry my partner will feel neglected, and i do ask him about it and he says everything is fine. with him i enjoy giving him any amount of attention, but i find with my dad that because his demands are nonstop, and rarely come with any kind of gratitude, that i begin to become short with him. the lack of sleep doesn’t help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/p8s4h9/tired_and_burned_out/,,Tired and burned out

"here's the situation. our mom is 98 and requires round the clock care. she is wheelchair bound, has some dementia, needs help with feeding, toileting...basically everything. she is high maintenance, entitled and would never last a week in a facility. we care for her in her home. my shift is 8-6 seven days a week. my brother works from the house and takes over in the evenings. we have no other help and can't afford any. my mom has some money in the bank and doesn't qualify for any financial caregiving assistamce.  my only child, my daughter, is getting married soon. yesterday, sunday, i threw her a bridal shower in the town where she lives which is an hour and a half away. this was a rare opportunity to get out and my brother agreed to watch mom. the shower was a brunch and i was out of there and back on the road at 2. i encountered heavy traffic though, and it was almost 4 when i finally got here. my brother was livid. where the hell were you? mom had a bad day and you weren't here. he left the room without another word. mom seemed ok. her hearing aids needed adjusting, but other than that i couldn't see any big problems. i ordered dinner to be delivered, tidied up, and stayed until 8. when last seen my brother was enjoying the dinner i had ordered and didn't say another word to me. he is making himself scarce today. as well. i think it's ridiculous that i can't get away for a few hours once in a blue moon without coming back to a bad attitude and guilt tripping. he generally has all day on weekends to do as he pleases before i leave at 6. i looked forward to the shower for weeks, enjoyed myself, and then he spoiled the mood, there are a couple more wedding related events coming up and i'm frankly afraid to mention them. then, there's the wedding itself. not sure how i'm going to handle that. he wants to go and bring her along with me keeping an eye on ner. i say if she comes it's with someone hired to be with her the whole time. i don't think she's up to it, but he doesn't want to leave her at home ""with a stranger."" i am at my wit's end with him. if he was your brother, what would you say to him, (keeping in mind that he is moody with a terrible temper)?"," i got about 2/3's of the way through and got the issue.... unfortunately, it may be unpopular...if he's the primary care giver and you're there when it's ""your shift"", you don't get it. caregiving is extremely hard on the primary caregiver. you're not there during the evening. you're not there when she wakes up and has to go to the bathroom. you're not there for showering in the evening. hopefully you see what i'm saying here....i'm the primary caregiver with my wife. i wake up at around 4am and give her meds. sometimes i fall back asleep (usually not, so i'm always tired). i get my wife up, do things then get her into the bathroom via a hoyer. our cna's take over after that 5 days a week (i do weekends). after everything is done during the evening (6-9pm), i take back over if no one is here (otherwise it's me doing meals, extra breaks, etc). bathroom, cleaning, bed, adjustments, then sleep. then awake and adjustments. sle...adjustments. 4am rolls around and i'm back up with meds and maybe i fall sleep again.... it sounds great that i have cna's 5 days a week during the mornings but it scratches the surface.going to be honest here. you are not the victim. you need to give him more time off......",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/p16hy8/what_would_you_say_to_my_brother/,,What would you say to my brother?
"hello, i am a 27 yr old from pennsylvania. i’ve never posted to reddit before so bear with me. my mom has recently been diagnosed with fronto temporal dementia. she has been going down hill for years now and we were finally able to get a diagnosis that actually makes sense. i currently work full time, but am looking at home health aid options. i would like to be her primary care giver. everything seems super complex in trying to get care for her. she only has medicare with no gap insurance as of yet. i’m unsure of what next steps to take and plan on reaching out to our agency of aging in the next few days. by the looks of their website it seems like i’d only get reimbursed rather than actually paid. i absolutely have to have some sort of income because i do have student loans for a degree i never got because of my moms ongoing health issues. at this point i’m at a loss and am looking for any sort of direction. tia"," info:  does your mom have any income?  could she qualify for medicaid?  with medicaid she would get full coverage, including home health aides.to my knowledge, the state of new york allows the individual needing care to choose their caregiver, and medicaid will pay for it.  i think they're the only state doing thus right now though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/p0rnfs/helpadvice/,,Help/Advice

hi my dads late eighties with dementia. his diagnosis this year gave me some closure at the same time as fucking me up in the head a little. for the last few years it’s been obvious he’s not himself. but what i’m finding hard to get my head around is how burnt out i am. it’s contributed to me becoming unemployed and out of work. and now i feel like i can’t even handle little things. people asking me for lifts etc is driving me insane. and it feels like the more i try and explain my situation the worse it gets. nobody really sees the version of myself of taking my dad to the graveyard 15 miles away to see his parents graves. or the me who walks into his parents room to get fresh clothes and smelling the pissy air in there. they just see whoever i’m fronting as in ‘the real world’. truth is i’m knackered 100% and most people don’t realise when they are making everything worse. i want everyone to erase the idea of who i was or who they think i am in there heads. but then ile have a few drinks to blow off steam and then i’m opened up to all the bullshit again. it’s like a never ending downward spiral.  i feel like i have more people getting me fucked up in life then i do supporting and i really don’t know how to cope with it," that's why we're here. you can vent here. i have so much going on with my elderly compromised parents i don't even post it (yet) in this group because it's so huge and complicated and exhausting. if you have an empathetic friend, ask if you can sit down and share everything. i did that last week with an old friend. not to get help of advice, just to vent. she was flabbergasted at it all and honestly her reaction was helpful because it validated my mental exhaustion and all of my other messy feelings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/owz2w7/losing_mind_a_lil_here/,,Losing mind a lil here
"32 year old daughter caring for her 71 year old mother with early onset alzheimer's (5yrs since diagnosis)  &amp;#x200b;i want to walk away from being my mother's caregiver.   i can't do it anymore. i'm done fighting her on everything. &amp;#x200b;the spark: she wants to use a regular pill box to manage her own medications and she is now refusing to use the pill machine even after i fix it.  i can't. i can't add the extra responsibility of making sure that every fucking day she is manually taking her pills correctly and she will not accept a stranger doing it.   i just tried so hard to be calm and supportive yet frim with her on the phone this morning. to explain over and over that it is not something that is within her control and that, that doesn't make her incompetent or ""the village idiot"" (her words) but that it's just something she needs help with to maintain her health. she accused me of wanting to ruin her life, of trying to control her. i can't do this.   i get that she is not of sound mind and that this is a horrible thing for her to go through, and that she's loosing control and that, that is terrifying. i would hate it too. i would want with my whole being to get back the control i was losing everyday but i could also accept what was happening and i could accept help. i could be humble enough to understand that i was not fine on my own. &amp;#x200b;my mother will not. she sees every action as something being done too her, she is the victim, she is the put upon party. there are no other sides in her story there are no gray or colored corners of the book just the black and white writing of her and the villains doing her wrong. and right now that black smudge, that part of the world being cruel to her, is me. which is as it has been for her. if i'm honest how she has seen me all of my life. i was always the difficult child. the problem. if only her daughter could be better to her, easier, agree with her more. i was not a ""normal"" daughter i was ""different"" and ""too head strong"" and ""too much like my father""  ""a little bitch"" at the age of 2 and therefor my mother had more to deal with than any other mother did. because even in motherhood she was the victim and the world was against her.  the toxicity of being so involved in her life means that i get these peeks into her private self. i have access to her phone and therefore have seen the videos she has recorded of herself crying and saying how mean i am, how cruel her daughter is to her. questioning why she has been cursed with me. videos that are dated before she was diagnosed with dementia. i shouldn't see that. i shouldn't hear that. i shouldn't know.  and now i find i don't even really like this women at the end of the day. the only good redeeming quality that she has is that she loves me. in a dark twisted judgmental way she loves me, she does, but only because i'm hers, because she should love me because you have to love family so strongly it hurts. that can't be enough anymore. to love me because i'm hers, is to love me because i am a possession not a person.  so i get fed up. i get frustrated and without raising a decibel in my voice i give an ultimatum. which, yes, fuck me for doing that. because how dare i. how dare i do that, but i do and even the guilt of something like giving an ultimatum to a mentally unstable sick women some how doesn't make me regret it. i don't feel any shame.  because i tried, i try over and over again to gently, then bluntly, then pleadingly,  but always, always patiently, i try to get to the end result. to have her agreeing to go back to the pill machine. to give me that one small reliable support, the stead fast answer of a machine, to give me answers. &amp;#x200b;yes the am pill have been dispensed. no they have not. &amp;#x200b;but she will not, she argues, ""(she) can do it on her own."" ""(she) was doing it on her own just fine"" before me and the machine ""ruined (her) life"". she is capable... of telling me yesterday that everything was taken correctly so far with her meds. that there are only two boxes missing from the fresh week of am &amp; pm pills i have set up for her. with such confidence she reads off to me. empty sunday am. empty sunday pm. she's proud to inform... but it's is sunday. it is noon on sunday, but sunday pm is empty and she see's no reason this is a problem. &amp;#x200b;if only i could accept time travel so well. &amp;#x200b;the flame: after all this i say, ""i need her to work with me on this and just try to accept the situation as it is or that i would not be a part of her life anymore."" &amp;#x200b;and so she says, ""good"" that she would rather do, ""what she wants and if she takes the wrong medication and it kills her fine."" &amp;#x200b;yes, i'm sure that was just an emotional response from her because she's upset and yes i know that i am upset too, but god damn me i mean it when i say. they are not words of upset and irritation. i mean it when i say i would not be a part of her life. i would and could walk away. i can.&amp;#x200b;because i would have to, because if she wanted to just do whatever she wants, whatever she feels is best for her. if she is her own ""master"" and everything dissolve into absolute chaos and her mental health evaporates with every self controlled mishap. i cannot be there for it. i cannot be just a daughter who takes her out for lunch and stops by to spend holidays with her while she disappears into a land of make believe and no calendar and it happened yesterday, no a week ago, no never at all.&amp;#x200b; i could not watch this car accident happen, and i can not be the one to put out the fires and call the ambulance afterwards either. &amp;#x200b;i resign. i quite.   and i don't care. i want that. i want to give my 2 weeks notice, postdated 2 weeks from yesterday. i don't want to take care of someone who fights everything and is irrational and combative. &amp;#x200b;i don't really want to spend time with her even without being her caretaker either because she's negative and racist and sexist and homophobic and unkind to me. we have not worked as a duet for as long as i could recognize my own person from hers.&amp;#x200b;we are as unalike as night and day and our personalities chase each other away like sunset and dawn. &amp;#x200b;i don't want this. i don't want her. i want to wash my hands of her for good. i hate when people tell me how much they love my mother. yeah? than you take her. &amp;#x200b;i feel no lose from the idea of loosing her in my life, i just feel relived. like it's an end, an escape. air after suffocation. &amp;#x200b;i tell her to have a good life and end the phone call. &amp;#x200b;where i will go from here i don't know but i'm not panicked over it. i don't feel anxious.  and i'm not even sure if it's my anger will carry this resolve for longer than a day or if it will all fade by tonight and i will feel the overwhelming blanket of shame that comes with failing, even slightly, as a caregiver; but god i don't want this anymore. &amp;#x200b;my brother can have our mother, he can have our father (who is another story for another day). he can keep his wife and his fresh new baby who i long to see grow, he can keep them all in that small little bubble of rights an wrongs. of conformity and ridicule the pumps out the perfect little cookie cut ken's and barbie's in bubble gum pink camo gear. &amp;#x200b;i just want to be left the hell alone! my boss just joked that i need a new family. i didn't tell him what had just happened, he knows the barest of bones in regards to my family dynamic but he knows enough. helped me find lawyers, given me countless days off. for today all i had said was, ""more family stuff""  and he said, ""well that's everyday for you!"" and you know what?

&amp;#x200b;or hit by a truck. &amp;#x200b;just so someone would take care of me, put me first in a day. &amp;#x200b;just so that i could have someone look at me and not say, ""oh you're fine. you can handle this on your own. you are fine and strong. then stroll along and leave me to my own devices, because i gotta say my devices are basic at best. no luxury or easy of use involved with my devices. they are the most base, cheap stock model on the lot. one step above a chisel and stone. &amp;#x200b;and they work. with great effort they do work.   let me be alone. let me feel unloved. or better yet let me find love and inclusion in people who don't force me to be a whole other person for them. because this family lets me feel included and loved but only as someone else not as me. it's like i'm playing a role to get table scraps. but there is nothing wrong with me. i'm a good person. i like making other people happy because i want them to feel happy, because i know what unhappiness feels like and i don't want others to feel like that, like this. that's intolerable to me; seeing someone suffering or sad and not trying to help them. that's a good person, a selfless person. i wish i wasn't, i wish i was selfish and vain and cared more about me than others because than i could be a part of the selfish mean majority and maybe i could be happy. ignorant, cruel, empty and happy. those people are much more productive beings than i am.  i am the baby of my family. the youngest. yet i am the responsible one. the party in charge. have been since i was a tween. why tho? for what reason should i have been anymore responsible for our family's happiness than my older sibling? my mother? my father you left before either my brother or i hit high school? &amp;#x200b;this isn't even burnout, this is just good old fashion anger. being feed up with having to be the janitor for this family's bullshit. i have my head on straight. i do not need to be coddled or hand fed life by my own perspective or views, but they do and i won't do it anymore. i'm so tired of being nice. this false veneer of calm, understanding kindness i wear all the time now. pretending that things said or spoken or done around me are fine. that i don't have any opinions on things, of saying ""uh-huh"" or nodding along with whatever someone else says just to appease them. keep them liking me, keep from upsetting the status quo.   if i have to bite my tongue one more time and go dead inside to survive the company around me i feel like i will forget how to be a person again. i want to judge them. i do judge them. i can judge and weight others without hating them or putting a persons opinion or worth beneath me. &amp;#x200b;having different opinions is the part of being human that drives us to have better clearer ideas of the world around us, but god there is no room for that with this family! it's follow or be damned. i do not follow. i do not want to follow. i am a person of wonder and curiosity. &amp;#x200b;i don't want to be told the answers i want to find it. &amp;#x200b;i hate this family. i hate my mom's equal amount of doe eyed compliance and her stubborn denial of anything she doesn't like. it's a maddening mixture of i don't know the answers, i don't want it explained to me but i've decided how things are and no one can tell me otherwise.   why can't i walk away?

"ever since my father passed away, and my mother didn’t know what to do, i’ve lived with her. she has dementia now, and some days it’s better than others. i’ve always thought that i would stay put until she needed to go into a home, if that ever happened. today for the first time, i thought maybe it’s healthier for both of us if i make the decision to move out. this would result in her going into a home (unless a relative happens to decide to move here, which is not likely but not impossible). but for the first time i thought it would help save our relationship if i moved out. we’re different people, and she always says she’s worried about me after she’s gone. maybe if i make the choice to move on with my life, she’ll worry less. but i can’t determine how traumatic that move might be for her. and i can’t determine how truthful to be about the reason for moving out, if it would be more hurtful or less. i guess, thanks for reading (if you made it this far), and thanks for letting me share this with you all, because i don’t really have anyone else right now with whom i could share this in private. cheers to you all. have a good rest of the weekend. chin up!", its hard to make the decision when you dont know how it will impact the person you love. its hard to put yourself and your mental health first but sometimes you cant be the caretaker they need on your own. just know whatever you decide a loved one would understand you're doing whats best for you. i hope you find ease and happiness.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ovin0t/thought_about_moving_out_for_the_first_time/,,thought about moving out for the first time

"my mom has been in a nursing home for a year due to dementia and a stroke. one of her symptoms is excessive crying. when i visit her i read to her from chicken soup for the soul books. this really calms her down and stops her crying. she likes the sound of my voice. she even said ""read"" to me one day when i stopped.her social worker called today and said tele psych had suggested a weighted blanket to calm her. i mentioned she doesn't cry when i read to her. the social worker asked if i could record some stories for my mom to listen to when i'm not there.this seems like it would be a simple request and i'm embarrassed to say i am in it, but what would be the best way to record myself and have her be able to play back?  it's not 1980 anymore so i can't just whip out the cassette player. i thought about an audio cd but she doesn't have a computer to play it back. someone suggested a link to a google drive folder that she might be able to access on an ipad?  all of this will require an aide or a nurse to open the recording for her.any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"," i really hope it’s ok to say this here, but if you don’t mind me asking, has your mom been evaluated for pba (pseudo-bulbar affect)? one of the main symptoms is uncontrollable crying, with or without a reason to cause the crying. it can happen with people who have neurological conditions like dementia, stroke, tbi, ms, etc. please don’t think i’m implying that she has no reason to cry … obviously i don’t know her or you or the situation very well, so i’m just sharing a thought. here’s the reason i’m asking. i’m a full-time psychologist in a nursing home. there are a lot of emotional experiences that come with dementia and they are hard to figure out sometimes. it is *so painful* to see someone cry all the time but sadly it does happen. the staff are understandably very worried about it and usually assume depression. but a thorough eval is important because there are many reasons that people cry other than depression - like anxiety, grief, loneliness, difficulty communicating, or sometimes it’s a symptom of the dementia itself. in all the evals i’ve done over the years, i’ve only come across 3 legitimate cases of pba so it’s not common. it’s also much more complex, symptom-wise, than the internet makes it sound. but, with the right treatment, i can’t tell you how significantly it changed those residents lives. it’s a huge boost in their quality of life. again i mean no harm by posting this here; if this is not the right place i hope someone can kindly teach me… i promise it comes from a good place…",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/oocuqt/i_should_be_able_to_figure_this_out/,,I should be able to figure this out

"my mother (54 years old) is a primary caregiver of her mother, my grandmother (85 years old) and has been for the past 5 years. my grandmother suffered a stroke and is bedridden, she also has dementia and often is not aware of where she is etc. she has to be fed and taken care of in all possible ways.my mother goes to work, and so during her absence there are employed caregivers who feed and wash my grandma etc. - however, due to financial reasons, my mother takes over as soon as she comes back. my mom does not have friends or a significant other; she does not have vacations; she is with my grandma during all her free time, providing care. our apartment looks more like a hospital than a home.what is the most troubling is that my mom is completely burned out. everyday she talks about being a slave and hating her life. she says that she wishes she could die / shot herself etc. she suffers from depression and her health (both physical and mental) is deteriorating very rapidly. our relationship is suffering tremendously as well. i try to help with my grandmother whenever i can and am home from school, but it doesn't seem to make a difference in my mom's state.my mom is refusing to see a therapist, she frequented therapy in the past and was unhappy with it. she also refuses to place my grandmother in assisted living, for she says that she ""could not live with the guilt"". her mental health is horrible, her physical health is going downhill - lack of sleep, constant stress, spine issues etc. it is all getting worse and worse. our relationship is in shreds. my own mental health is bad - i have diagnosed depression and am on medication. i wish my mom placed my grandmother in assisted living but she refuses. i have no idea what to do. please help me."," if you are in the united states, your state's ageing and disability resource center (adrc) could give you/her more information about state help programs, counseling, support groups, and other resources your mother hasn't used yet.   if your mother is already accessing those (likely if your day help is state funded) then your grandmother and mother have a coordinator, or at least someone who has your grandmother's casefile. part of ardc programming, at least in my state, is helping the caregiver gauge when they can no longer care for their loved on safely. your mother has reached that time. we (caregivers) are not always the best people to make that decision. we're too close and don't see all the incremental changes. this is why the state sometimes steps in to protect both people.   my fil wanted to take care of my mil until the end, but there was a time when his family and coordinator stepped in and made him realize that wasn't safe for either of them. he visited her daily, did her laundry, and helped support staff at a nursing home for several years before she passed away. after a year, even he admitted it was safer for her there. they had machines for lifting and were much more aware of small medical changes then he could be. the rns saved her life multiple times just by knowing when she needed to be hospitalized vs. she just needed rest and medication.   finally, recognize that you are young and you shouldn't need to do this alone. talk about your fears to other adult members of your family and your mother's close friend group. find allies. your mother probably needs the confrontation of a larger group of people who love and empathize with her. people who can help her go through this. if you have no other alternatives or connections you can make a call to adult protective services (aps) and they can contact the proper authorities, but if your mother can be brought willing to this point it will make the transition easier for both her and your grandmother. being able to plan where you go and who you're with makes it easier to feel some control over the process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/odx1w1/i_am_a_teenage_child_of_a_caregiver_who_is/,,"I am a teenage child of a caregiver who is completely burnt out, talking about suicide everyday.

"so my mother who my brother was taking care of supposedly…was put in a bad situation. brother was practically holding her hostage, i was afraid to go get her because he might shoot me. my mom has alzheimer’s it seems so she couldn’t get ahold of me. last night my brother was strung out on meth, and started hallucinating. he shot up the house because he started seeing people. we went over to go get my mom, luckily the house was still in her name too. they sold all of her other assets so she has no money. i’m wondering what to do, we can take care of her by my income alone, my wife can stay at home full time. i was wonder how to get assistance or what to do, it’s been a stressful day. she’s 63 years old and her social security is 1250 a month."," wow, that's a lot to have on your plate.  if you are in the us, there is an office that works with aging populations.  it's often called adult protective services but there are 50 states out there so some of them just have to use different titles.  it doesn't matter what they're called but they have the information on what resources are available in your area.  in a pinch, you can go to your local library.  librarians are amazing at finding information and they are under used for that particular skill so when they get a question like that, you'll not only get the information, it will be organized and systematic.  half the time, they'll mark you a path for several steps forward in case you come back when they're otherwise occupied.  bonus points, it's free.  (slight con, thorough means it takes time but also better decisions and less wasted time so my point is budget a block of time for this step.)if she's widowed and her husband served in the military during certain conflicts/wars there might be assistance there.  but go to an information central point for your area that's the best first step.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/odc0qt/caregiver_for_mother_emergency/,,Caregiver for mother emergency
"i’ve been more involved in my caregiving duties during the holidays, but the treatment that those whom i care for afford me is getting on my nerves. i have a 64 year old aunt whom i care for as she is suffering from multiple sclerosis and alzheimer’s. i care for her in tandem with my grandmother. my aunt can’t seem to conceptualise how much i do for her. she is rude and nitpicky, and i’ve come to realise that the subtlety of her jests is what categorises them as emotional gaslighting. she will ask me about personal family issues; try to exert control over me; ask nuanced, yet rude questions, so that at face value her inquiries seem innocuous, and her treatment towards me is always twinged with implicit antagonism. i clean her entire house for ever every day, plait and do her hair for her, iron her clothes, prepare her meals, and she still treats me as if i am inferior to her. she was recently fired due to maltreating her employees, and i presume that her treatment of me is some form of a copping mechanism as she no longer wields the same amount of power that she used to.  please advise on ways to let her know that she can’t treat me inferiorly. how might i help her to realise that she can’t maltreat people."," are you involved with any of your aunt’s medical visits? her primary might be able to prescribe something to help brighten her mood, if it’s appropriate. my mom used to be very cranky and complain about everything. she changed on anti-depressants. i’m not sure if they are appropriate in your situation, but they might help (?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/oc7mh9/advice_for_nitpicking_rude_family_members/,,"Advice for nitpicking, rude family members"
"well, hello again, everyone. i thought i’d stop by and give you an update on how i’m doing and the whole situation. for those who are new and decide you want to read the whole picture, just scroll back through my post history, i’ve no intention of retyping the same thing over again. you might want to just skip to today’s topic and that’s just fine with me.today we get to talk about hard times and hard choices and how to make decisions. might as well take a comfort break, grab a snack and then settle on down on the comfy couch for this particular chat because it’s going to be a long one. the best thing about a text medium is that you can leave when you want and come back later and read it again if you want to and can stand it.first, i’m *fine.* exhausted. sad. exhausted again. but my vitals have all been bullied back into compliance and my chronic condition tantrum has emerged, chagrined, from its little corner. just my digestive system which is always a menace is giving me grief, but i’m used to a bit of that.monday came along and we went to the neurologist and … don’t you just hate it when you’re right? sure enough, just as i’d thought: progressive, frontal temporal, vascular dementia/alzheimer’s(?) which needs an mri to stage. before then, the plan had been to keep her here while we figured out a treatment plan and found her placement. my chronic illness’s temper tantrum (let’s call it ole betty, i like anthropomorphism up to a point) brought home to me the fact that we had no safety plan in place that was even approaching the realm of sanity, let alone anything resembling reasonable. her staying with me was no longer an option. her staying with him is not one either – though i, technically, left that to be his decision since she’s, his mom.subtract those two options and you arrive at the answer of assisted living. and not later in some distant future time: now.since i pretty well knew what i was expecting to happen; i’d been preparing my husband for the news since the er visit 6/21. he’s human, and this is his mom, so he was indulging in the entirely human coping mechanism of denial. i don’t begrudge him or anyone else their humanity. figure the day i start down that road is the day i have given up on my own humanity.but, the visit was informative (for him) and the ct scan was not subtle. as the (experienced) assist, i’d planned ahead. i let him get a head start on the tedious portion of the paperwork then took over when it came to the important questions like: what is the purpose of today’s visit. if you work with experts/specialist like neurologists, a key life skill is knowing how to get the most out of them. these are very busy, very expensive – and in this case an incredibly lucky encounter with an extremely good/knowledgeable one. (they appreciate people who know where to focus and this guy has done me a solid in helping me get there.) i’m going to tell you the how and the why of it all if you care to listen.first: i knew with the confidence that comes from experience what was likely coming down the pipe. it’s nothing like certainty. i’m an engineer and not formally trained in anything medical; but i’ve seen some things, read a lot and pay attention to what’s going on around me, so i walked into that room with a plan.step 1: be flexible. if he’d said something completely different the plans out the window. since he didn’t, execute the plan.step 2: safety first. people need to be safe and cared for and not neglected. all the people. me. husband. and mil. so, we already had a place lined up that passed enough tests to be temporary and has a spot for her to go to on in the place we’re moving.step 3: compassion and empathy for everyone. it hurts. this is an awful diagnosis. for me, because i’ve seen where it goes. for my husband, because he’s scared to death of what i’ve told him, he doesn’t really know what’s coming at him and that’s terrifying, and it so happens to be his mother. worst of all, for her, because i don’t know how you’d feel about it, but i can’t imagine getting much worse news that my brain was dying while the rest of me was still relatively healthy. she’s petrified. who wouldn’t be? step 4: tenderness. i can’t fix this situation. i am not magic. i have a lot of will power and, i suppose, a couple of people might have described me as downright commanding when the urge strikes me in the right moment, but i can’t defy the laws of nature (would that i could) or the laws of society (that, i might get involved in later).step 5: action. i wrote on the purpose of today’s visit a note to manage my mil’s move out of state and transition into the necessary assisted living environment as comfortably for her as possible. the neurologist and i made eye contact as he confirmed my expectation that you don’t ask a primary care physician to prescribe anti-anxiety, anti-depressants, or psycho-active medication in someone who’s brain is that altered away from a normal regulatory condition. it’s not that they don’t mean well; it’s just that things change, and they don’t have the expertise. sadly, sometimes, they don’t recognize that they don’t and that’s why competent medical advocacy is so darn important.usually for anti-anxiety – say for a long airplane flight – they prescribe a benzodiazepine (ex. ativan) and that manages the panic symptoms. in mil’s brain that’s going to operate like an amphetamine. it will ramp up all her sensations to 11 and increase her befuddlement and confusion. so, he prescribed something for the trip and something else for the first 3 months of her transition. the goal is to just give her a little sea of calm in the chaos. i’ve rescued her from freefall, but i can’t defy gravity. so, i’m going to set her down just as gently and lovingly as i possibly can and that was the focus of my visit. i think the neurologist quite understood where i was headed with this and he’s filled out the intake form for the new place and the summary notes for the new neurologist – he took his time and gave them to me this morning. they are entirely comprehensive so i have a nicely packaged bunch of records for a hand off. this important step saves time, frustration, energy and money in the future.why? experts love it when you respect their time. he’d seen that i was prepared for the diagnosis. he knew my husband was in safe hands (i’ve got the information, we reviewed it slowly and in detail this morning). and, poor mil, she heard the word dementia and just curled back up into the safety of her coping mechanisms which is a good thing because this isn’t her problem to deal with. it’s time for us to step up.we’re making plans and waiting on a confirmation, but i expect her to be packed, traveled, and checking in the new facility on or around next monday. there’s a holiday (because the universe just hates me this week and i can’t figure out why) in the middle or it would be a certainty. and, i’m going to come along to make sure she’s handed off well and safely and also to help my husband so he can concentrate on his brand new job which has been extremely accommodating. just in case you think i’m one of the 1% who doesn’t need to worry about the money, let me disabuse you of that notion. i am simply appalled at the lack of planning that has festered in this side of the family (not my branch, i come from a long line of obsessive worriers). but, because i’m a planner and the economy has been up, down, sideways, loop-de-loop, and tossing us all around lately – i’ve laid enough aside to weather this storm and i know well how and when to deploy my resources. we can talk on that later if anyone is interested.right now, i want to discuss the how and why i/we are going with these options. how to cut through the chatter, reduce the problem to action steps, not forget about or trivialize the people involved because otherwise, what’s the point in caring?i could. i can. just choose to stay home, full time, and see this lady to the end of her journey.  i have the skills. it would be a lot cheaper for me to do it (and the government knows it and that’s why things like medicad are designed to be so frustrating that only the truly desperate would be motivated to use it. if there was any other choice or if they made it *easy*, well, i don’t honestly know what they expect would happen except a whole lot less misery. and we apparently can’t have that.)but since no one loves a martyr and that is what that would make me, we have to find a different solution. one that keeps everyone safe and balances the load. she has to accept that she can’t live at home with us anymore and that’s hard for her to accept because she’s just received the worst news. my husband has to accept that he has some serious financial responsibilities that i won’t allow to bleed through all the resources i’ve carefully planned for our (or just my if you want to hear me be selfish) retirement and future. i suppose i have to fly across a country for about a week, help her into the home and pick out our new home, then fly back and wrap up this mess by packing up a house, selling it, and then going back across the country and ramping up to re-enter the workforce.i will be taking at least a week off when i arrive back here from the coast to rest though. life can wait on me a spell.which brings me to a natural breaking point and i’m still in the mood to ramble because i’m on watch and husband’s out riding his bicycle for stress relief while i keep one ear out for mil to make sure she gets through dinner and her evening medication. the universe must be really annoyed with me right now because, of course, she has developed a small, irritated sore inconveniently located where the leg turns into the buttocks area. it’s not a cyst or infection, took her to the doctor to ensure that this morning. just keep it clean and it should resolve on its own – no lancing, poking, picking, or creative homebrew remedies required. make a cut out in her briefs and dress her in loose clothing.what about me? well, this is like my 4th house so i’m no stranger to moving. i hate it. so, this time all the heavy stuff is going into storage until we finally settle down. we’re bringing a few necessary things and all the stuff that gets beat to hell and back will sit here, packed well, until i’m good and ready for it. stuff can wait.as for re-entry into the job market. many of you are in the same place. you’ve been away for so long you doubt your ability to even reenter the market and you’re the folks i’d like to speak to now, if you have any more head space for my ramble. if not, i’ll place a bookmark and you can come back and read it later because i’m on a bit of a tear.&lt;bookmark&gt;welcome back.i admit that i’ve often been described as having a ‘whole other way’ of looking at the world from other people but mostly in a good way. many of you are scared of the job market and i get it. i really, really do.what i want to say to you is that if you done caregiving for a long time – long enough to get rusty at your career of choice – i’d like you to consider a thing or two. first, there are a lot of types of people running around this dizzy blue green planet of ours. lots of different make ups, temperaments, and personalities. here’s some things you might want to see if they sound like you. i happen to think us, we, the caregivers of the world – the responsible, the ones who step up, the ones who care – we’re made of the stronger stuff. we take a grinding, no doubt. we have our battle scars but a good sand, shine, and a bit of polish and we’ll hold the sharpest edge you can find around you.for any of you who’ve read this far or any of my other ted-rants, i’d like to ask you a non-rhetorical question (meaning, i’d politely request you leave me a comment). without regard to your industry or what not: ***would you like someone like me on your team?*** i’m organized, compassionate, empathetic, reasonable, practical, articulate, i build teams, lead, leverage expertise properly, flex with the situation, exercise good judgement, communicate on many different levels orally and in writing, learn fast, make decisions, and i can go the distance. and that’s before i even start to speak about my actual education. (you can just comment “yes/no”, i have enough of an ego already, no need for flattery.)do you think i’m going to crawl into some hiring manager’s office some supplicant looking for someone to toss me a chance? have you ever encountered a question in a classroom, on an assessment or in a job in-ter-view that was more dire than imminent threat to life, limb, or even significant property damage? i’ve been on both sides of the desk and i’ve seen some things but i have yet to see *that*.so, here’s today’s saying to memorize: **know your worth.** you, my caretake friend, are a guide, a guardian, a shelter in the chaos of this world. you not only walked the hard road, you took someone vulnerable by the hand and lead them through it. you have nothing to be ashamed of and everything to offer.take a look around the world. do you see a lot of lost people out there, wandering about? if you let your light shine, you’ll attract people to your orbit like lint. don’t doubt that you’re worthy. you might need to do some work to shake off the rust and buff up your surface; but underneath it all you are the package, the one that everyone wants to work with. or, at least this internet stranger would like you on my team. take care now.", damn right.  if we want to live in a society where people help each other it's on each of us to make it our personal responsibility.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/oald0t/todays_tedrant_decisions_how_to_make_hard_choices/,,Today's TED-Rant Decisions: How to make hard choices and what comes from them.

"i’m writing this from a hotel room in baltimore while mom sleeps. i’ve posted a few times over the years about my journey through caregiving for both my parents, the intense part starting in 2017. it’s been an incredibly difficult and rewarding heartbreaking and overwhelming in all the best and worst possible ways. the last year has been incredible. i wouldn’t believe it if i hadn’t livid it, but i’ve mostly had my mom back. still some mild dementia, but with my constant (pandemic facilitated) attention, excellent diet, and careful use of clinical levels of cbd and micro dosing, she’s been delightful and so much improved. she does still suffer from anxiety that mostly manifests in sustained interactions with others and leads to her talking about deeply personal family things that are mostly invented because that’s all she can talk about, but as long as i’m around, she does pretty well. and that’s the thing. this is an exchange of my life for hers. five years ago, i had an amazing life. everything i wanted or could dream of in a city i loved. when both my parents got sick at the same time, one physical, one mental, i did the impossible for 18 months caring for them. i couldn’t save dad, but i did save mom. it cost my amazing life, my boyfriend, my city, but she’s better. mom is  young. just 76, but she has a heart condition, which though easily fixed with a quick, usually successful surgery, kills 85% of those who don’t get it fixed. since it’s the very same surgery that set dad on his 18 month death clock (he was an anomaly in this particular outcome), mom has always said she would never get it done. but we’re here in baltimore because she has changed her mind and we are moving forward with the surgery. i have so many feelings. i love her like myself and i can’t imagine life without her. we are very different and i have edited myself to be with her. i can’t do anything without her and my world is so much smaller because of her. i didn’t like giving up my life, but when i believed her heart would fail before the dementia kicked in fully, i made the choice to be with her as much as i could. i am glad of my choice and would do it again. with the best case scenario of the heart fixed, the dementia will progress, albeit slowly if i continue the therapies as i am, and i will be forced to watch her and my own opportunities deteriorate slowly over time. it is hard to regain momentum once it’s gone. it is entirely possible she could live another 20 years. i would be past retirement age then. yes, i can hire help, sort of. most people who do this sort of care understand how much deterioration occurs when the primary caregiver is gone for even a few days. yet i have done and will do this again, because i know my life is valuable. i actually believe my life is more valuable than hers at this point, but taking the actions that backup my beliefs… actually seeing her suffer because of my absence or choice to put myself first is so hard. i know you all know what i’m going through. the absolute wrenching this sort of thing does to our souls. i wish this surgery were not going to happen because when she comes out she will not suddenly become a productive member of society with a clear and compelling purpose. she will not regain her ability to interact with the world or probably even find anything that is satisfying for her to do. and i will feel it’s my duty to try to involve her, keep her interested, engaged, while simultaneously letting my own engagement and interests wane, because i can only perform the impossible for so long, and i’ve already lost so much. but she will be healthier and her physical body will last longer, and i’ll be able to hug my mom every morning and tuck her in every night. and i am truly, deeply grateful for that. at least until sometime down the road, i have to make the decision to put her in a home somewhere because i cannot care for her any longer. i just never knew, never imagined that caregiving would be the apex achievement of my life. or that it would cost so much. thank you for reading this rambling mess. i appreciate you."," i had to double take to make sure i didn't write this. we are living parallel lives. both parents fell ill in 2017, my dad mental, my mom physical. i couldn't save my dad, but i have my mom. if you need a friend, i'm here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/o9wcmr/terrified_not_hopeful/,,Terrified Not Hopeful

"hello reddit,i'm going to preface this by saying it's a novel. it's complicated. it could probably be a lifetime movie. for a bit of background about my father, he has been married and divorced 3 times, and has kids with all 3 women. i am his only bio child from wife number 2, but my older sister has been ""his child"" since she was 2 months. even after the divorce, he never once treated her different than me. we both ended up moving in with him 20 years ago (me 11 her 13) due to an event that happened with my sister (that's her story to tell). while he was not an emotionally available, openly loving person, and could be quite hard to get along with, we were still in a more stable living situation than we had been in years. we had the essentials. no frills, but they weren't missed most of the time. when i was 14, he started dating wife number 3. she was/is my best friend. they had 2 daughters (now 11 and 14). their marriage/relationship was on again off again, for a number of years, but finally permanently ended 3 years ago. despite their continued shared love, there is a lot of old hurt and resentment towards each other. she moved on to a healthier relationship and is remarried to an awesome guy. their mother does a really good job of attempting good co-parenting despite everything, but my father's definition of co-parenting is passive aggressive comments and occasional outright hostilely towards her new husband.i am now a wife and mother of three. we had been out of state for a number of years, and moved back 5 years ago. at the time, my dad and sm were splitting up and my father needed help running his restaurant business. so we decided to move home. it took us a year to get it all ready to go, and during that process they were on again. 🤦‍♀️ we came home anyways. i came back into the fold of the family business, with the intentions of owning it in the future. within 2 years they were signing divorce papers, and he stopped caring about life as a whole. he pushes his young daughters away (like he did the oldest 3 from wife 1), criticizes them to death, and makes inappropriate comments about their mother in front of them. he stopped taking his medications (type2d, blood pressure, cholesterol). and overall didn't care whether he lived.at the same time, my own life is getting more complicated with my children and their own needs, so i make the decision to walk away from the business (we had been trying to sell at this point due to unrelated issues) to focus on my own family, despite where he stood on the finalizing of the sale. i would be done jan 1st 2021.in september 2020 he started experiencing symptoms of a stroke, but ignored/hid it for a week. he hoped it would kill him. when he realized it wouldn't be quick, he sought treatment. by the end of september he was diagnosed as having had 2 strokes, which left him with left side mobility issues, but otherwise mainly he okay. he spent a few weeks in the hospital, and 4 weeks in a rehab facility. while there, we had lots of discussions about what would happen when he came home. the only thing we could all agree on from the get go was no nursing home, because of trying to maintain custody of his two young daughters. my sister offered for him to move in with her, since our house want suitable. our father was adamant he wanted to be in his own home, and would like us both to move our families in to his home... um no. so, since he wasn't budging, i did, because 1 week after the second stroke, my youngest sister ended up in the hospital. she ended up diagnosed type1d. even more so now, he needed someone to be live-in for help caring for her. so in the middle of october we moved in and he came home a week later.since he's been home, he tries to be helpful by parenting his own children, but ends up causing more fights than anything. his is a tough love parent and antagonizes fights out of stupid stuff. he refuses to do his exercises, and was dropped from outpatient therapy because they weren't seeing any progress being made. he doesn't ask for much from me, but there is a distinct air of expectation and resentment when not meet. his young children on the other hand, he has expectations that are unrealistic and degrades them when not met. needless to say it's fairly chaotic around here. i attempt to keep the peace, as much as possible, but also try to stay out of it when possible. that's easier said than done, most of the time. i feel like, for the most part, i have found my footing, but when family asks how it's going, i feel obligated to tell them it's all great. no issues here. just because, when they hear the truth they tell me this is too much for me, and i should ask for more help. whom shall i ask? his 72 year old parents, who already help more than anyone else? his 3 oldest children he alienated in their childhood? my sister who finally overcame her past, graduated from college, and just took on a full time career? oh did i mention she lives 45 minutes away and has a husband and her own children to care for? because of the business (i tried to get away from and now have to run completely) he didn't qualify for medicare or disability, so we don't have access to respite without paying a large bill. i will admit i haven't put much effort into looking into it though, seeing as what little time i do have is usually interrupted by one of 7 people who need something. i have zero motivation to do anything other than what has to be done.this is a long term situation, that needs to just be a well greased wheel. at this point, 9 months later, i've transitioned from trying to get him to have a better outlook on life, to ensuring my sisters have the support they need. i attempt to co-parent on his behalf. i work to counteract the example he sets with how he treats people. i allow him to think he is the parent here, but i deal with most of it without him ever finding out about an issue. any issue he is brought in on, is blown out of proportion and turned into an inquisition. he has no interest in changing, and honestly has starting displaying possible signs of dementia. i feel this will get worse, before it gets better.i need help retraining my brain. i don't want to be a martyr, but feel like i wasn't really given a real choice. because the only other choice was a nursing home. where he would have lost his house, his business, and his custody. i would have been responsible for him losing everything. all because i wouldn't step up. so i did. help me find peace with this decision."," you're in a tough spot and i feel for you. he isn't doing anything to help himself but you love him so much you want to hold him up. in the long run this isn't sustainable. i don't have any guidance, but i give you internet hugs and wish you the best",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/o8igum/i_feel_trapped_but_need_to_find_a_new_mindset/,,"I feel trapped, but need to find a new mindset!"
"hi ya’ll. i’ve been my moms caregiver for only 1.5 years. given up my entire life to see her through her sudden decrease in lung ability, covid, and then through a double lung transplant.she is on the other side of the transplant, living in my apartment, and is regaining her independence (yay!). however there are tight dietary restrictions with a transplant and my mom has been battling me non-stop on them.she goes behind my back, buys a giant amount of groceries that get delivered and she notifies me of that same day. then when we start unpacking we go through and she has bought 30 things she can’t eat, and one that is fine.she gets furious at me, starts whipping out guilt trip after guilt trip. tells me that i don’t know nutrition, and then steals the stuff i remove from her. she is extremely picky, insists on cooking her own meals (which i’m fine with), but then buys all of the bad-for-her ingredients in bulk, filling my house top to tail with unhealthy food that i don’t even have storage for.i tell her that now is the time to be learning new recipes instead of relying on the old unhealthy favorites, and she says i have no sense of taste and to stop pretending i’m a nutritionist.i work full time and don’t have the time to be making all of her meals.she is complaining to all of the relatives that i am controlling her. i told her i will buy groceries (and i did), but she said she hates all the healthy options and she goes and orders takeout. her new thing is not eating all day so her blood sugar dips dangerously low, and then she gets to eat sugary stuff. it’s dangerous, and she is using it as a manipulation tactic on the doctors to tell them she doesn’t need insulin anymore. she is also using it as an excuse to keep the house stocked with sugary and fatty foods.every time her sugar goes low she says “see?? these diabetes are bullshit, it’s all fake”.the problem is the constant guilt trips. she blames me for everything every time i call her out on her behavior. she finds excuses for everything, blaming her behavior on first her illness, and now in her transplant. i have told her to keep the house filled with healthy food, and to eat treats out of the house and occasionally, but this has turned into something she does 5x a week which makes it anything but occasional.she fights me on her medication, she screams at the top of her lungs when i give her injections, which she stays silent for for the doctors. she screams at me for telling her to cross the street, and the next day when the doctors say to practice crossing the street like i said she is all smiles.she fakes illnesses, telling me that my controlling behavior is killing her, and then is fine 20 minutes later.i have a month left, and the more independent she gets, the worse her behavior becomes.honestly she has been awful to me ever since she got sick, and i thought the return of her health would bring her back, but it’s just gotten worse.any advice? anyone been through something similar? just want to know that i’m not alone, dealing with someone who is honestly awful to me who doesn’t have dementia. this has opened my eyes to who she is and has changed my opinion of my entire life tbh. she has always been abusive and narcissistic, i’m just finally old enough and sane enough to realize.", ensure healthy options are available and perhaps make her another appointment with a dietitian through your family gp....... document what she's eating/buying and provide list to physican also mention blood sugar non sense.  you can't force her to eat healthy food. also you can't force her to take medications. if she were in a retirement setting staff wouldn't push the issue of taking medications they would have to let her suffer the consequences until she accepted or requested the medications. i once had a lady refuse her nitroglycerin patch because she believed i singled her out by administering her meds first.....patients with dementia often feel paranoia. anyways she had a episode a few hours later and needed nitro under the tongue to stop heart palpitations.   will your mom be moving out soon or is this a permanent arrangement? would a family member agree to stay for a few days to observe? god bless you ❤ i know it's really difficult,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/o7bhmm/narcissistic_parent_fighting_everything_i_do_to/,,Narcissistic parent fighting everything I do to help
"quick summary of the situation.  monday i was in the er with my mil who had a uti and i finangled a ct scan.  the 16 letter word on the discharge papers referring us to the neurologist indicates to me that we've arrived at dementia.  i didn't get to see the scan.  my poor, dear husband is on the other coast and just started a new job this week so i got the wonderful job of trying to walk him through what he's about to be hit with.to be perfectly frank, i had to be really blunt.   we're both engineers by education and his primary processing runs through data and analysis; he works well with specs.  there's a lot we don't know yet, but i'm trying to prepare him because i can take a pretty good guess (vascular, approx mid brain and creeping into the frontal/temporal area, seems pretty agressive but that might be acceleration from the uti; they cause that.  damage that has happened will not be reversed.)  of course i could be wrong about my assumptions and i covered that, as well.  (if it's moving towards the brain stem and is aggressive then he might need to drop everything and get back here.)  we'll know monday so that's enough about that.so.  boundaries.  you might think that after 30+ years of doing this in and around for relatives on both sides he's set.  nope.  i'm not up for the task; too tired, not recovered from my escorting my parents through their end of life care, and that was my parents so i'm just the assist here.  i'm a pretty good assist, not because i'm special but because i have experience.  also, i'm pretty practical.i only joined this board ... this week ... (i think it's still this week, it's been a hell of a long monday, if you know what i mean).   mil is quite safe and content.  she's upstairs watching tv with headphones since otherwise the volume is about 50 and besides then she doesn't need her hearing aids.  about 4am when i was still wide awake and wishing my brain would just shush and let me get some necessary sleep, i left her a note next to her coffee cup, clearly available hot or cold breakfast, explained i needed to sleep and i'd be up when i woke up.  set an alarm for about when she usually gets up and doddled upstairs to verify she'd made it through the morning.  told her i'm going back downstairs until i'm rested - routine can wait.she's fine with it.  my husband is the one who has me concerned right now and kept me up last night.  since i've been here i've seen boundaries as a recurring theme so i thought i'd share some tired thoughts on the subject which some of you might find helpful.  at least i hope so; i told my husband that if he bothers to get me a tombstone the epitaph should just read: *useful*.  that's what i try to be in life and most of the time it works out pretty well for me.  i find it a pretty good way to make it through life.first thing to memorize is this phrase:  ***no one loves a martyr.***  if that's how you think you're earning love and affection or earning some sort of warm fuzzies from the people you're caring for or from the people who won't step up because: reasons, then you are in for a very long, extremely difficult road, and it's bad enough already.  print it out and stick it to your bathroom mirror if you need a daily reminder.  next up is the whole idea of what it means to be a support.  that means that if you go down, you're pulling the entire house of cards along with you.  no wonder you're so tired, frustrated, depressed, anxious, worried, stressed and i could go on but you've already got the picture.  you know how you can't seem to get people to cooperate and sometimes you just wish you could *make* people do something.  often, it's even something very, very simple?   well, i'm here to tell you that no one can actually make you do anything, either.  i'm not saying it's easy or trivial.  i know there's a big attitude of *not my circus, not my monkeys* circulating around and i have a sense of humor so it's a cute phrase on a t-shirt or coffee mug or even spray painted on a wall but it's just not practical, is it?   medical neglect is not an option and i'm the last person you'll ever find advocating for that.  generally, i think suffering is something to avoid if it can be helped and that gets to include you.  because caregivers are people, too.  and we suffer, don't we?since you're valuable, important, and entirely human - treat yourself that way.  one morning of a microwaved fake-egg stir together breakfast won't be the death of my mil nor will a bowl of cereal.  if she watches television safely for a couple of hours while i restore myself to fully functional then that's the wisest course of action, don't you think?   that way when it *really* hits the fan i've got some fuel in my tank to power though it.  if you go full out, pedal to the metal, balls to the wall all the time you're not going to make it.  not even if you really, really want to and that's not even the worst part.the worst part - say it with me now is:  ***no one loves a martyr*****.**   by the time everything is said and done and you're surveying the wreckage that is your life - you're going to find our you're extremely **lonely**.  oh sure, you'll get some nice cards and maybe some flowers but those other people, the ones who aren't helping, the ones you're hoping will notice your sacrifice?  not gonna pick you up and put you back together, my friend.  to do that you'd need another you and if you had another you in your life then you probably wouldn't be so bad off. basic engineering.  build fault tolerance into the system.  if you design something around a single point of failure and expect that to be sustainable, well, it might work for a while.  you might even manage to accomplish the task but it's not cost effective, practical, safe, or *kind*.  you want a real world non-emotional example?  look up the boeing 737-max.  all those crashes were caused by one little software bug that only took input from a single sensor (despite aircraft being designed with redundant safety systems to avoid crashes) because... and i can only assume ... it made the software decision tree simpler.  first rule of flight:  *every take off is optional and every landing is not.*if you look around and discover, to your distress, that you're the single point of failure then it's time for some remediation.  it's ok that you're there - it's kind of how our society operates these days.  but when you know better then you can do better.  if you see yourself in this then it's time to budget the time, relax the routine, step back and make a plan to get to a more stable environment.  not gonna lie; it's gonna be hell.  but, it's a kinder, gentler hell that might leave you some people in your life to care for you when the time comes that you need it.  you already deserve it and you don't need to prove anything or do anything more to earn it.  and i care about you already so i'm hoping for the best possible outcome for you.now that that's off my chest and i needed a good reminder because my life's about to get harder.  i'm going to unplug and see if i can go to sleep.  catch you all on the flip side.  be kind to yourself, would you please?  that's what i'm going to do.", i really needed to hear this. thanks so much!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/o73734/i_didnt_sleep_last_night_todays_tedrant_will_be/,,I didn't sleep last night.

"prior to 2020, i felt i had a pretty good handle on the state of assisted living places.  some good, some bad, how to evaluate them and all that.   now, we're in the process of trying to decide between options for my mil who moved in with us last october.  she was in the er monday with a uti and i managed to finagle a ct scan due to her confusion which revealed - i'm not sure exactly what but we have an appointment with the neurologist monday and i'm quite sure it's going to be a dementia diagnosis of some type (likely vascular due to a stroke approx 10 yrs ago.).  just our luck, no planning has been done prior to us taking over her care and we did dentures then hearing aids (honestly for the first few months i wasn't sure if it was a memory issue or deafness.)  so, no financial planning has been done and she has essentially no assets.  (spend down will be trivially easy.)  the problem is i don't know whether i want to try for in home assistance so i can closely monitor the help or whether or not the state of the industry is ... well, let's just all agree that 2020 was very, very hard on caregiving homes.  i'm worried about staffing levels.  she's lost track of what day of the week it is and things are about to get really hairy.  i'm struggling because i've spent the past 30+ years already caring for family and, now that my parents have passed, i was looking forward to re-entering the workforce.  it's not that i *can't* it's that i don't really want to and it's lighting up my ptsd from all the prior caregiving like a christmas tree.  fortunately, i'm in good therapeutic hands (good therapist and psych nurse) and i'm definitely able to handle her.  my husband, not so much.  he was not really involved in the day to day (or hard) tasks of caregiving for my parents or other family generally because they were truly impossible and i never asked him.  assuming we can even afford it and find placement, does anyone have any thoughts on how well the industry is doing?  my quick glance research opinion is that trying to keep her here for at least 24 -36 months might be our best outcome while the industry recovers and stabilizes. i'm trying to be a support for my husband who will make the ultimate decision but obviously my opinion weighs heavily into the picture.  so, what are your thoughts?  how's it going out there?  it sounds bad but i trust other caregiver reports more than google web adverts or complaint review boards.   you all know what we're looking at/for so what are you seeing?just in case having mil wasn't enough, we're kind of between deciding where we're going to be living (job change, the economy) and the two states in question are utah vs. florida.

"this is gonna be sort of an ""am i the asshole?"" post.i took care of my dad for about 8 months. he's bedbound with severe dementia and requires complete around-the-clock care. i had no help during this time, despite begging my mom multiple times to put him in a nursing home. caregiving destroyed my mental health and caused me to have a mental breakdown. i ended up finally standing up for myself and setting a boundary with my mother: that i was done being a caregiver. after this, my mom stepped back in to take care of him.it's been a few months and repairing my mental health is still a daily struggle. i was able to get him set up with hospice, so now mom has a bit of help. however, she still refuses to put him in a nursing home.today i was asked to watch my dad for a few days, because my sister is driving up north for a funeral and needs someone to watch her 6 kids (my mom). my mom guilted me into caring for my dad again during this time because ""family just does that for each other"" (even though my sister literally never goes out of her way to help family, but that's another story). the other option i was given is to let my mom continue caring for dad while *i* go stay at my sister's house for a few days to watch her kids (without any compensation, of course), which also sounds miserable. i feel like being a caregiver was actually traumatic for me, because the thought of having to do it again for just a few days has been giving me panic attacks. it's also going against the boundary i set. but i still feel like an asshole if i refuse. what would y'all do in this situation?"," no, you are not the asshole. i was in a similar situation and had to leave because it was too much and i was treated horribly from the whole family and treated like a slave from my racist grandmother. i get panic attacks every day and break down. my mom guilted and trick me to watch grandma after telling her i don’t feel safe being alone with her for five minutes.your father needs the best care and you can’t do it if you don’t feel comfortable. call around and find someone to help. maybe call the senior place to ask for reasources",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/o2hu8b/just_the_thought_of_having_to_take_care_of_my_dad/,,"Just the thought of having to take care of my dad again sends me into a panic attack; yet, I feel guilty for refusing to take care of him"

"i would truly appreciate any suggestions based on your experience. this is for my 95 you grandma with dementia and a hip replacement. i'm overwhelmed with all the systems you can buy and pay for monthly. - fall detection- motion detection with an alarm (not a beep or small noise) that can be on a schedule or easily turned off and on. we need to know when she leaves her room overnight but not her bed. she can get to her bathroom on her own fine.- help button that notifies up to 2 caregivers on site she needs assistance. ideally, we could communicate through it but we'd just be happy to get the alarm as we're in the same house. - the interface for my grandma should be as easy as a button. she can't manage apps or anything like that. thank you so much in advance!"," i have my 98-yo grandma with dementia at home with me 24/7. she is under constant supervision so we don’t fall detection like those life alert type buttons, but do have every other monitoring thing we could think of. the system we got is [smart caregiver]( it can be found on amazon in addition to other medical supply sites. we have a bed pad that detects when weight is removed (sitting up or getting out of bed or a chair) a floor pad that detects when weight is added (if she makes it out of bed and steps onto the mat) and a motion sensor. they can all be programmed to a single or separate monitor. they also have a paging system and control center type thing like for a nurses station but we use the portable monitors. the motion one has a chime or alarm and will ring like an alarm  or ding like a doorbell continuously until the motion stops. the pressure pad monitors ding continuously until you turn them off so you could position the motion sensor in front of her doorway to be alerted when she is heading out. the mat would work for that too, but might be a trip hazard. it lays flat and secure but i’d still worry having it in the middle of a walkway. ours is pushed up to the bed so if she gets out she steps directly on it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/o0j2xq/please_help_with_recommendations_for_medical/,,Please Help with Recommendations for Medical Alert with Motion Detection

"i started this caregiving gig back in late march and it’s been hard. i’m getting better at my job everyday. i’m new to this so i feel like i’m always learning something. i’m struggling with something new now that i don’t believe is any fault of my own and i don’t know how to handle this part of my job. so, i’m a private contractor for this family and their mother who is very old and has dementia. she has a son and daughter who are in their 70’s and 80’s. the son rarely stops by and usually comes for dinner every so often when i’m here and him and his wife are nice to me. however, i started two months ago and the daughter was on a trip during this time. now she is back from the trip and i have gotten to meet her. prior to meeting her i had been given warning from other caregivers including her son’s wife and the handy man that she is nitpicky and likes to tell what you are doing is wrong and boy has she. she comes over like three times a day and they are long visits and i wouldn’t mind so much but she makes me feel like i’m walking on eggshells. if i do something slightly wrong(not the way she likes it) she lets me know y’all. like yesterday she was telling me how i made the bed wrong and the sheeted were too far on one side. she gave me trouble for giving the patient her meds too soon before she had breakfast. she went on today about how i couldn’t get an oxygen reading because her fingernails were painted so then i removed the polish and placed the polish remover on the table behind her chair and she raised hell about that saying it would ruin the finish on the table. i apologized and said i’ll never do that again i’m so sorry and she didn’t say it’s okay or anything like she appreciated my apology just that i was wrong and how another person ruined a table doing that. then the icing on the cake was her standing beside me while i took her to the bathroom and i stood her up too soon and she was urinating standing up and she was in my way. i was trying to sit her back down because i thought she was done using the bathroom so then urine got on the floor and probably her shoes but i don’t care she was in my way trying to do my job. why hire a caregiver if you’re going to tell them how to do their job and try to do it for them. why don’t you just be the caregiver? idk i’m just done."," i’m taking care of my elderly parents and have a sister who likes to micromanage, but it is beneath her to actually help.by now, a few people who have been involved in caregiving or the medical field have informed me that this is common: the person who is doing the least, or the least likely to lift a finger to help is the one who will come in and make the most demands of others and be the most critical. hopefully there’s a special place in hell for them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nz54ff/need_to_ventrant/,,Need to vent/rant
"situation:back home for 3 weeks after a fall that resulted in a hip fracture and a month-long rehab stay. i am granddaughter, and one of two primary caretakers. i rotate with my aunt and uncle on a 3 to 4 day basis, and occasionally another aunt and uncle will do a few days. grandparents live on a ranch, grandma is early-stage dementia, grandpa has bad copd and is still a bit discombobulated from the hospital delirium. i call them ""om"" and ""pop"".they have 5 kids, 11 grandkids.  ""hi everybody -time for one of my awkward messages on tough topics.there seems to be an underlying current of tension between the family regarding long term plans for om and pop.i'd like to clarify my stance, as well as a summary of what i've gotten out of discussions with everyone else.i absolutely, flat out, am not willing to entertain the discussion of an assisted living facility for one or both of them. it's a hard no from me. i haven't heard anyone else who is advocating for that either, but maybe privately there have been some mentions.i will do anything in my power to take care of them at home. i believe assisted living would be a death sentence for them, and regardless of how much time we have left with them, i want them spending it in their home.there are a couple different options we can look at if we need to, including hospice or becoming certified as a home care provider to help financially.i am at a point in life where, because of {husband's} work ethic, pay rate, and our shared value system, i am able to come and stay for periods of time, and i am willing to do so. however, i would truly like to have somewhat of a rotation schedule set up, because living life 3 or 4 days at a time with no ability to plan ahead is unsettling.i think things are stabilized enough at this point that they can make it for periods of time (hours, not days) without help. if we had someone here each day for a 4 to 6 hour period of time on a predictable schedule, it would be logistically possible to allow them some more independence. i know that this comes with risks - however, i also think we need to weigh those risk versus the benefits. i don't think having someone with them all day, every day, is healthy for anyone. it's taking a toll on their pride and dignity, and they feel they are burdening us. i know that's not necessarily how we feel, within reason, and overall i know everyone is willing to do whatever is needed to help them remain in their home. but again, that needs to be balanced with other factors, and while it may be slightly less safe physically to have them alone, i think the increase in their confidence and dignity is worth a slight trade off. i think with the right supports, precautions, and plans in place, we can help them regain some independence while also staying safe. i am not saying this can happen today, or this week, or next week - but the planning and concerns can start to be discussed. we also need to make sure we aren't working against each other, and have some continuity in how we go through each day here. we need to be, within reason, setting the same expectations and using the same processes. each different person and rotation of care having different techniques is going to add confusion and uncertainty, and detract from a stable, predictable environment for them. i know this is going to spark some strong emotions and concerns and reactions, and please know that i am not trying to unilaterally make any decisions, and am not doing anything differently until we have a group consensus, to the best degree possible. this is just something that needs to be addressed and considered, and clarified between everyone so that we all know where each of us stand and what we would like to see happen. you are welcome to reply to this message in a group message, if you use the whatsapp group, or you can message me individually. i will not throw anyone under the bus and play a he-said/she-said game, but i am willing to help facilitate discussions and give general feedback to everyone regarding the opinions and concerns that are raised. what i would like to avoid is triangulation, where different people are having side discussions but leaving their underlying concerns unaddressed, and ending up with resentment and frustration and feeling excluded. i would also strongly, strongly, like to ask everyone to please consider using whatsapp and to be part of the group conversation, if you aren't already. i ask this for many reasons, not the least of which is that, a lot of the time, we're pretty hilarious and witty.for example, {aunt} informed us yesterday that she may need to sell her vacuum cleaner, because it just collects dust. there was also some conversation in spanish between {aunt}, {cousin}, and {my husband}, as well as a translation request from {my mom} regarding urine and cilantro. we did not ask for details. please remember that you can ""mute"" the group messages so that you do not get notifications, but can just go into the app at any point and review what's been said, add your opinion, and try to top the vacuum cleaner joke (it shouldn't be hard).it would be very helpful to have everyone able to respond to the group and have all of us in one place. i spend a significant amount of time on the phone as a go-between, and as part of the millennial generation, this results in a deep amount of anxiety. kidding - somewhat. take some time, think all this over, come up with a better joke, and join the whatsapp group. {whatsapp invite code pasted here}"," can i offer an idea that works very well with our family?  collectively as a group, sit down together and vote for a secretary. this family member will have the sole duty of gathering information, documents, and will take notes during this meeting. have blank calendar pages for the next 6 months, and give everyone a set. ask them to fill in their work schedules, vacation plans, and any weekly commitments. decide whether you should have a treasurer who will be in charge of all monies for bills, medications, food, etc. decide whether you should elect someone to be in charge of accompanying om and pop to all doctors visits. all of this information will always be passed on to the secretary who will be in charge of keeping the “care binder” current and accurate.the care binder is your bible in keeping all informed of the daily tasks and needs of om and pop. on this first gathering you will gather the information that should be kept in this binder. examples: health insurance plans and copies of cards, names and phone numbers of doctors, emergency contact numbers, list of all medications and dosing with pharmacy phone number, power of attorney (if you have one), any dnr orders, monthly rotation calendar, and daily task sheets. how this works: choose a place where the binder stays at all times and require all helpers to review at the start of each shift and updating the notes at the end of shift. not only does this avoid any surprises, but it keeps tasks from being forgotten or repeated twice. decide what shift will handle certain tasks and create a checklist with space for notes the date and a signature. this may seem like overkill but it keeps everybody on the up and up. the idea is that everything for each day is written down and available to all. in the event of an emergency you have all the information in front of you.  it is a lot of work in the creation phase but quickly becomes the best source of information to those doing the work. in my family it was 3 or 4 of us caring for my papa, but we had family out of state wanting to know things, and most importantly when hospice started. we required all hospice people to sign and date and record time and tasks and any notes. my mom and i rotated 24 hour shifts and this is how we kept medication managed and any changes or concerns addressed. my brother covered a shift and called 911 and due to the care binder was able to inform the paramedics on all questions. he later said without it he would not have known any of the answers. just thought i would share and tell you that having a solid system in place makes communication go much smoother and makes everybody equally accountable. good luck",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nz45vg/my_reality_check_message_to_the_family/,,My reality check message to the family

"i don’t know what’s wrong with me.my life started going very downhill at the start of december, when my 70 year old mother was hospitalized due to a terrible case of heart failure. she was hospitalized for a month or two, then put in rehab for a couple more, and finally returned to my dad (73 y/o) and i in february.my dad was… torn apart during their time apart. my mom was his everything, and he was stressed, anxious and depressed for the months she was apart from us, and put his everything into caring for her when she came back.she has parkinson's and a few (many) other health issues including slowly progressing dementia (maybe?), paranoia, etc. she was so weak for being bedridden for a month, and rehab at the rehab center didn’t work too well for her, that she came to us bedbound. still, she did much better at home, and with the help of a physical therapist coming every week, she was able to start walking.honestly though, my dad has always been the one to do everything. he cooks, he cleans, he moves stuff for my mom when she wants to rearrange the furniture. he does all her medications, knows which novellas they watch and what times they air on, knows all her doctors and appointments, etc. she has always relied on him, but even now moreso than ever……he passed away near the end of april.we can’t afford our house without him (he was a veteran, the pensions greatly supported their income). he passed away two days before i started a new, important job. i’ve had to find my own (and very first) apartment, sell my car because the family car was passed onto me (mom for sure cannot be trusted to drive), while adjusting to my 5-day-a-week new job, juggling my other job on one of my days off, and taking care of my mother because i’m the only one that lives with her.my situation isn’t so terrible, honestly. my brother has handled finding a place for my mother. he’s always handled their finances, ad he was the one who organized everything when she was hospitalized. he lives two hours away and visits once a week, occasionally staying the night. honestly, i wouldn’t be able to do half the things he does for my mom, and it’s all out of love.i… don’t know what’s wrong with me.i’ve always had a short temper with my parents. i’m a 26 year old loser who’s always lived with them, even after college.i feel like being saddled with taking care of my mother is… bringing that to a truly horrible, terrible point. i don’t think i was ever cut out to be a caretaker. every day i snap at her. she doesn’t understand, learn anything. she can’t open the blinds on the window. she doesn’t know how to use the remote for the tv. every twenty minutes i am called for something. i can’t stop getting angry. i want to break something.my brother says i hate her, hate the family. he says i am lazy, shutting myself in my room all the time, and lack respect for my mother. he says none of the family want to help or stay over because i am a terrible person. i don’t know if this is true or if this is something borne from one of his anger outbursts, but nobody has stayed. people rarely visit. we live far away from other family in times of change. i don’t know. i don’t think i hate her. what my brother has said, however, makes me feel awful. like i’m truly in the way of improvement.the only reason why i’m not thinking of suicide is because i attended my dad’s funeral ceremony last month and realized how terrible it would be to have two funerals in such a short span of time. i don’t think anyone but my mom and sister and my boyfriend would be sad, though. and my dad. but i’ve thought a lot about how, if what my brother says is true, my mom would have more help. i don’t want to die though. another case of selfishness on my part.between 6 work week days and taking care of my mother, i’ve been slowly chipping away at my own goals. i found an apartment with my boyfriend that i can’t move into until my mom has moved into her assisted living. i sold my old car so i can move my car insurance to the family car. i’ve been adjusting to my new job, and i’ve been trying to gather essentials for my apartment in my free time. i had a needed root canal done because a week after my dad passed away i had a terrible toothache for a week, but had to book the appointment 3 weeks in advance.i still get angry. people visit, talk with her, cook meals, but they never stay. my brother says i can try and move out in stages – stay at my apartment one day and return home to my other – but then, today, he tells me it was irresponsible of me to leave my mother at the clothing section of walmart (she wanted to buy clothes) alone. i wanted to buy a trash can for my apartment.i feel terrible. i haven’t slept at my apartment (i’ve had it since 05/24) because i’m worried about leaving my mother alone. i’m also worried i’ll one day snap, in a bad way. in a violent way. i know my angry outbursts, my visible frustration, is stressing my mother out. i know it saddens her to see me like this, to be the cause. i don’t know why i get so angry but i don’t have health insurance and i don’t know if i even have the time for a therapist.i try to relax. this is what my brother calls me lazy for. i stay in my room and try to play games to distract myself. i am always interrupted. constantly, by my mother. this adds to my anger and frustration, and my stress.my sister tries to tell me to be patient. i try but it’s like i can’t control it. my brother calls me a brat. i think everyone thinks i’m a brat. i’m the youngest child, given plenty and many things, and ungrateful. this has been held over my head for a long time. my parents have sacrificed so much for me and given me this much, surely i could do the same.when my mother moves to her assisted living home and i can finally live in my apartment, on my own, i don’t know. i feel like i’d still be held responsible for caring for her, even if she’s an hour away. i just want to rest. i just want my peace. i want a life. i want things to be normal. i don’t want to be angry anymore. i feel like i’m breaking and i feel like a shitty person because i am looking forward to being free but i’m also terrified and worried about my mother being on her own. she’s terrified of being alone, too. i feel for her. i really do. my dad was her everything, too, but no family will take her in.i feel like i’m drowning. i feel like a terrible person. i don’t know what to do. i needed to vent but i don’t know how much better this’ll get. this is part vent but i also just want to ask how to not be so angry at my mother? at my situation? i’ve been with my mom all my life and i’m genuinely sad and scared that we’re being split. i know it’ll be better for both of us, but i want our last days living together to be okay. my boyfriend tells me i'll feel better with distance, and seeing her on occasion will be *much* better, and happier, than it is now. it gives me hope, but still..."," you're not a

"my dad has dementia and requires complete around-the-clock care. i took care of him for 8 months without any help, until it made me so burned out/depressed that i had a mental breakdown. my mom stepped back in at this point and became his caregiver while i took a month off for myself. mom refused to put him in a nursing home up to this point.well--surprise!--mom got hurt while taking care of him, which meant i had no choice but to step back in. my mental health went right back to where it was previously. luckily, this time, mom agreed to put him in a care facility. i got the ball rolling on that. got him on hospice. it looked like he would be cleared for a facility soon.i booked him a respite stay at a nearby nursing home to give myself a little break. mom went to visit him during this time. she said it was heartbreaking to seem him in that state, and his eyes ""looked dead."" i rebutted that dad has severe dementia and is on hospice, and his care is beyond what we can provide at home... it's sad, but a nursing home is our best option right now. mom still decided that he will stay home, despite all my efforts.well, i've told her that i can't continue being his unpaid caregiver. i want to live my life and focus on my mental health. i'm tired of having this heavy burden on my shoulders--especially after trying to hard to set him up in a nursing home, only for mom to change her mind last minute. it's painful to set a boundary, but i had to do it.i still can't help but fill extremely guilty. my mom is not physically capable of caring for him properly, but she is incredibly stubborn. she will literally take care of him until she can no longer walk, and then i will have to figure out how to put two parents in a nursing home. it's incredibly frustrating. am i being terrible for refusing to help with dad's care?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nlw61t/am_i_wrong_for_refusing_to_take_care_of_my_father/,,Am I wrong for refusing to take care of my father any longer?
"throwaway account. found this subreddit recently and started lurking until today where i felt motivated to post. i (23m) live with my mom (60) and grandma (82) who has been diagnosed with dementia (possibly lewy body). my grandma has always been abusive to my mom but we are stuck with taking care of her because my aunt refuses putting my grandma in a home. my grandma although clearly cognitively unwell, still remembers that she hates my mom and treats her terribly; whether its damning her to live alone or telling her to eat shit, saying we’re poisoning her, or talking badly of her to anyone who stays to watch her for a couple hours while we run errands. she will also get up in the middle of the night and take off her pajamas and diapers to dirty the sheets (i dont believe this is intentional, but its hard to believe its a result of the dementia when she knows to say exactly the same things she would say to my mom when she was a child to belittle her). she can walk but she refuses to at times, she can get up off the bed and her chair but at times she refuses to do that too, yet at night she’s up and i swear shes doing gymnastics from the ruckus i hear in her room. my mom is so tired from having to work and then take care of her abusive mother, and i cant help as much as i can being that i am in college and dealing with classes, maintaining my job (i run a small buisness online from home) and having to be available for my father who is declining with alzheimers and his care/doctors appointments.what do i even do? am i doing something wrong? has anyone else gone through something like this? i feel terrible knowing my mom is suffering and i cannot help as much as i should be. neither of us even mind helping her get up and go to the bathroom, making her food (that she refuses to eat), putting her to bed; but when she calls out every 5 minutes to get you to do something and then starts the verbal abuse, it’s unbearable. luckily i dont get the abuse but watching my mother get it is almost worse; i rather be at the recieving end of it. my mom is so depressed as her life is passing by her and i dont know what to do."," your aunt is going milk this for as long as she can get it. if she wants grandma out of a home, grandma can stay at her home. right now auntie is getting her cake and eating it too, while your mom gets no reprieve. not cool",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/nl5nxh/my_mom_is_a_caregiver_shes_rotting_away_and_i/,,My mom is a caregiver; she’s rotting away and I dont know what to do.
"hi. longtime redditor, off and on for years. for the past 3 years, my sister and i have been the primary care givers for our father with alzheimer's. he is progressing quickly. i'm at the edge of complete burn out, my sister is burnt but won't admit it. i am looking for ways to find a moment of peace for both of us. looking for your advice and techniques.i love my father very much, i'm just exhausted.", where do you live ? are you in the usa - there are respite programs for families who sometimes need a break .,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ni7yss/how_do_you_keep_your_sanity/,,How do you keep your sanity?
"tl;dr i'm just so tired of the disrespect. she doesn't recognize me or my mother (her daughter) as family but also can't fathom that i could want a life outside of her. i'm currently helping my mom care for her mother/my 90 year old grandmother. i have been on the extended unemployment since covid, but of course that won't last forever. she's lucid and cognitively capable except her judgement is awful (was never great, she got scammed since mid adulthood ), she refuses to ask for help and thinks she can do everything herself (also her personality). in fact she probably makes trouble because she needs help (she is blind) and so she's just bored when i explained we've been renovating her house to be more disability-friendly (the plumbing and other stuff  had been neglected and it had to get gutted anyway) so she doesn't need as much help, and we plan to have a caregiver come in via medicaid. she had an idea cooked up that her house was perfectly fine (the cement floor had rotted pipes) and we were renovating it to steal her money by spending it on stuff she doesn't need. it never occurs to her that anyone could ever have goals or reasons that aren't about either propping her up or scamming her. she was shocked that i wasn't planning on doing this for 3 more years. i said no, i need to get a real job. i have a college degree you know, and the student debt too. she suggested that if income is a problem why do i simply not get married (??????). lol, stuff is so expensive nowadays that two income couples are the norm, you can't just have a husband with a normal average job, and a stay at home wife and own your house like before unless the husbands job is very high income. then later that day she told my mom both ""you're not my daughter"" and ""you're shirking your duties"". her disabled son (who has aphasia and limited speech; but does not have dementia) was also totally shocked that wouldn't want to waste my youth (25), and my mom waste the last few years her body will be strong and healthy (60s), on cleaning up their messes and saving them from the problems they manufacture.we still need her to sign some paperwork in front of a notary so that the medicaid process can go forward. (to put her money in a trust for her disabled son). so i can't tell her off just yet.", my dad is not this impaired but he called me a racist the a few weeks ago because i said i didn’t want our cleaning lady’s opinion on decorating (after she left) and she is latina. that was so hurtful; i am certainly not a racist and if i was that comment wouldn’t be a telltale sign. also planning to get a caregiver part time soon and cannot wait!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ndi7fv/how_to_tell_when_its_dementia_vs_just_choosing_to/,,How to tell when it's dementia vs just choosing to be mean
"for the last year my grandpa has been living in my mom, brother and i. he is 80 years old and suffers from parkinson, at this point he fully has dementia and is lossing the small amount of balance he had left.i am physically strong for my size (lifting weights and such), but i find that when i have to help him get up after a trip or fall i just can't seem to get the leverages right, my legs are too short. and when i hold  him he is so light that i feel that i should pick him up easily, but i just can't without potentially injuring my back.luckily i have my brother to help me most of the time, but on the odd ocasion it's very frustrating. so my question is: is there a tip or trick that could help this situation?"," did a quick look around, and i found [this video]( you're going to have to assess how viable it is for your situation, i don't know how advanced his condition is. they mention a gait belt as a tool to help lift them to the different stages. that can be around $20 but helps a lot. kneepads may also be something to look at, as they will be walking on their knees a small amount.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/ncd4y4/question_to_fellow_short_people/,,Question to fellow short people

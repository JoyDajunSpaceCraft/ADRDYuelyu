i’m 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer’s when i was 17/18. i lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel i missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. i had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like “you’re the only reason i’m here” all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. i’m having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. i feel like i’ve made so many decisions based on everyone else’s happiness instead of my own, it feels like it’s been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i’ve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. it makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. i want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what’s going on with him and help to make decisions. i guess i’m wondering people’s thoughts on that, whether you’re my age or someone older. am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer’s at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it. i think if my dad wasn’t sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. he always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts. - my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week imo, go. alzheimer's is already stealing what is left of his life. that being said, i'm a 45 year old man, missing out on many things, including things with my own child, to continue caring for my mom who is on hospice and could remain so for god knows how long. it sounds like you have already put your father before yourself. i think you should focus on yourself for a bit. ended up not going to go stay with my mom and try to care for her (no official diagnosis at this point but she was not able to hold a job and had very clear signs. we knew it was alzheimer’s)  you should go to school. my dad has it too. my mom thinks that he's had it for a while, but his symptoms started getting worse when i was 14ish. i'm in my 20s now and i'm in a similar situation to you. do what's best for you. i am glad i lived my life and if i had stayed 24-7 to care for my parent, i would be bitter considering it's a likely possibility for me. i echo every one else here - go and live your life to the fullest you can. i'm hopeful it will be what your father would wish for you. i'm 39 and cared for my dad for about 10 years - we tried to keep him at home for as long as we could but it came to the point that it was no longer safe or dignified for him to remain there. the respite provided to me since he has been in a care home has been significant - i feel like i can live my life again and do things i've been unable to for the past 10 or so years - and it feels good. you deserve to live your life now! you only get one life, you don't owe it to anyone but yourself. please let your parents make their own decisions for their own lives. alzheimer’s destroys everything. but alzheimer’s destroys everything and that will still be true even if you stay. good luck with your decision. live your life. sometimes the kinds of sacrifices that you would need to make can leave you feeling bitter and resentful for many years to come. i don't think your dad would want that for you. don’t do what i did and be afraid to live your life. that being said, you aren't just losing your father to this disease. and what ever you end up choosing, do right by yourself first. you can't 'do right by him' if you are burned out. your health, mental and physical, comes first. don't break your back.	0
would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house. better or worst than long term facilities? do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio? if you have worked in or own one i would love to hear from you. would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion. i have not used either of these, but there was a period where i was looking into them as an option (mom decided to keep dad at home in the end). im not sure but i *think* a major deciding factor would be more about what kind of care the facility is qualified to give, and what kind you need. like some facilities have staff that are allowed to administer medicine, and some may not have staff thats allowed to (patient has to give medicine to themselves). some facilities aren't allowed to keep someone from wandering out, and some have a special status where they can. you might want to see if your state and county have a dept on aging or elderly or dementia. they may have guides describing rules that may be specific for your state or maybe even a handy list of facilities identified by type of care. depending on the level of care, you could eliminate your options quickly.	0
title is pretty self explanatory, it could be for android or ios, the more suggestions the better, and thank you in advance. if you use it and could describe why and how it helps you, that would also be much appreciated. what are the features you like and what features did you wish it had? i use an ios app called memory lane with a patient when i need a distraction. it is a very simple trivia game filled with photos and nostalgia. it was designed specifically for alzheimers patients. and it is free with no adds or upgrades/offers! [memory lane](  i wish there were more apps/games for entertainment purposes. i also had to use an app to create picture button icons on a smart phone that can be used to call loved ones. whoever is caregiving for someone with alzheimer's, try joining support group. i was in a few. some better than others. there is an app called alz science hub. it’s mostly focused on research, but also has good information about resources for help.	1
my father (68) has alzheimers and up until recently was being cared for exclusively by my grandmother (87). over the past year, my father's condition has progressively gotten worse and he's started showing signs of anger, anxiety, and aggression. anti-anxiety meds helped some, but it still got to a point where it was no longer safe for either of them to be in that house together and we made the decision to move him into memory care. unfortunately, the transition to memory care did not go well. within 4 days of moving him in he had assaulted another resident, cornered and threatened a staff member, and refused to eat or take his medications, until the facility finally asked for him to be transferred to a hospital because they couldn't handle him. fast forward 6 weeks and in that time, he's been in 3 different hospitals and 2 different geriatric psychiatric facilities. he was transferred back to memory care after the first psychiatric stay when they thought they had figured out his medication, but after 4 days he had assaulted another resident, was tearing pictures off the wall and throwing them, and had defecated on the floor of another resident's room. he's currently on his second geriatric psychiatric stay as they once again try to tweak his meds but i' m not hopeful. we are one week into what is supposed to be a 1-2 week stay so he's going to be discharged soon. the memory care facility he was originally in won't take him back and so far we haven't found any others that will take him. i don't see how he could come home, even with in-home nursing help. i just can't see how it would be safe for anyone. i've checked into some nursing homes but supposedly they are going to cost between 10-15k per month and that's not something we can afford. i don't believe he will qualify for medicaid as he has a pension that would put him over the eligibility requirements. making all this worse is i live on the west coast and am having to manage all of this remotely. this last 2 months have been so draining and we seem to be out of options. what are we supposed to do? i'm posting in hopes that someone maybe has a solution or something i haven't thought of but it all seems so hopeless. with my mom, we had to private pay until she was bankrupt. in her case, the only med that worked to ease her rage (she broke her own and other people's bones in attacks) was injections of haldol. because they had to be injections, we had to have 24-hour skilled nursing, and the doctors reported that it was a must to keep her from being a danger to herself and others. once she was bankrupt, the way medicaid worked was they took her pension and ss and returned it was i think $70 per month for her to have personal spending money. if you haven't talked to someone in medicaid locally, it helps to at least have the conversation with them to see what happens next. i'm really sorry you're going through this, op. i was in the same hopeless boat back in october of last year. my dad has increasingly gotten aggressive. because of covid, no geriatric psych places would even consider taking him in. his doctor at memory care was having no luck tweaking his medications. his facility was kicking him out and we couldn't find a single place within the state that would consider taking a man with 'behaviors'. we began looking out of state. i also asked about hospice and they agreed to have him evaluated. hospice believed my dad was probably suffering from terminal agitation and we signed him on to hospice. they gave him dilaudid but it didn't slow him down one bit. one of my nurse friends (seeing how hopeless the situation was) recommended i ask hospice about contacting aps. they did and got some social workers involved to help us out in finding a new facility. in the meantime, we had to hire 24/7 caregivers to live with him in memory care. somehow we found a facility nearby that would give him a chance as they typically handle people with 'behaviors'. we moved my dad to the new place (having hospice on-board was nice because they provided  a hospital bed). i'm just sharing my experience. reaching out to aps can be scary but we got desperate. nobody would take my dad and i knew if he got discharged anywhere, that his current memory care would not allow him back in. i feel like i truly tried everything. sadly there just aren't many resources for when your loved one gets aggressive/violent. and no, you cannot take him back in to the home with your grandmother. i'm so so sorry. i was in your position only 5 months ago. i'll be thinking about you. what i did was enlisted my friends' help in asking them to make calls to facilities for me. having someone else make those calls and keep a shared spreadsheet was probably the most helpful. i hope you have friends you can call on. such a heartbreaking disease.. so sorry.. you should try posting this question on the forum at agingcare.com the people over there tend to give better advice about these kinds of situations and are more realistic. this is a long shot, but i was just getting a massage today and in the waiting room, i read something in a 'massage therapy' magazine about alzheimer's and massage. as little as 5 or 10 minutes of gentle massage, head, shoulders, neck, back or hands, reduced agitation and aggression in alzheimer's patients. it can be done by a cna, it doesn't have to be a licensed massage therapist. see if you can get his carers in the hospital to try that every day for a week. i'd also want to know if it happens only in the latter half of the day (sundowning) or if he has a uti. music might be useful. i was able to take care of my spouse who got alzheimer's in 2012. when the violence started the doctor perscribed risperidone .25 mg 3x a day. it was an amazing transformation and helped me be able to do everything at home until passing in 2020.   i got hospice involved in the last year and a half or so, which set us up with a hoyer lift, hospital bed,  and nursing care 3x a week all covered thru insurance and medicare, when walking no longer was an option. when covid started i voluntered to do bedbaths and the nursing was reduced to 1x a week to avoid unneeded traffic and risk of covid. this was during the time when it was so horrible in the nursing homes, before vaccines. i am grateful for the extra time i had, grateful that i didn't need to rely on any of the kids who all had jobs and families, grateful that i didn't need to bankrupt us or move out of this house we have lived together in for 35 years, grateful we never got covid. i miss my spouse so very much. hope this helps and god bless. i'm sorry i don't have a good or cheap suggestion, as we went through it with my mil when she was fist admitted to a mental care facility. we were finally able to get he placed into a facility which was able to manage her, both through medication, and through having 'large' skilled nurses and aides who could control her outbursts. once a lifetime of savings, the home, everything was gone, medicare stepped in and took over. facility received every dime, social security, navy (spouse retirement) pension, everything except a few hundred bucks a month we were able to use for upgrades in food, cable tv, and a room with a view of the plants/garden outside. what breaks my hear more than anything is i'm on the front edge of this journey with my wife, who was diagnosed with early onset, and is now 67.  i'm not emotionally ready to have to watch the love of my life disappear from me in slow motion while i remain helpless and heartbroken and incapable of making anything better for her. please speak with the hospital social worker (or have his poa do so). the reality is that dad is likely going to need further adjustments of his medications & an onslaught of behavioural approaches to try & find the balance whereby he's not a danger to himself or others. what i know to be true in my province is that a hospital cannot discharge someone who needs constant care if a sufficient solution is not available. is the hospital the right place for him, long term? probably not but until his situation stabilizes, and a home is found, then i would not be accepting responsibility for him to come home. it's an impossible position to be put in, & the system is so very broken & i'm so sorry that your family is having to wade through this walking nightmare. talk to the social worker & reach out to the local alzheimer's society/ society for the aged & ask them for advice as well. sending you such support over the interwebs. xo there’s an anti-psychotic medication that my fil takes that really helped his aggression. if you want to know the name, dm me, i would have to ask the wife. regarding ~~medicare~~ medicaid you should talk to an elder care lawyer. typically, if a person qualifies for  ~~medicare~~ medicaid funded care they pay all their assets first, minus a very small amount, and ~~medicare~~ medicaid covers the rest. this varies from state to state so be sure to find a lawyer in their area. good luck	0
if the loss of sense of smell associated with alzheimer’s would be studied towards restoring it first would memory return? does the pineal gland hold the answer? you're not likely to have heard about studies where things like this were researched and found not to be helpful. i’m a research patient. but wouldn’t do the loss smell thing because i smoke. how far outside the box?	0
my grandma is far down the rabbit hole and diagnosed with alzheimers or dementia. we are moving her to a care home tomorrow but one of her recurring issues is obsessively counting money. in her own home we just had her constantly pay us money, put it in a cabinet and then give it back to her each visit. now that she's going to a home with outside people, we don't want her having real money just in case. the bank of canada has a fake money printout for children but she can tell the texture difference between our plastic bills and complains.	0
my mom is well into the later stages of alzheimer's and can no longer do  any self care. her restlessness and excitability is really  tiring, so we requested a medication to ease her anxiety. to my surprise  an anti-psychotic ( aripiprazole ) was prescribed, and while she does  tell imaginary stories i do not see how this drug will address her fear  and anxiety. anyone got any experience with the effect of this meds with  alz patients, and any relevant advice? i thought something like  lorazepam would be prescribed. i do not have any experience with aripropazol in dementia patients. i will say that after my grandmother (probable alzheimer’s) started taking seroquel, her mood improved dramatically. i have a family member who is a neurologist who has also seen seroquel help quite many dementia patients. i bet many other people here can attest to seroquel’s impact as well. my understanding is that if the dementia is alzheimer’s it will have the intended mellowing effect, however if it is a different type (ftd or lb, don’t remember) it will immediately make the mood worse. my grandmother was also prescribed lorazepam while she was in hospice, but she was one of those minority of people for whom it did not have the intended effect. although it made her sleepy, she became extremely paranoid with the delusion that we had kidnapped her and were holding her hostage. my mil (moderate stages) takes hydroxyzine twice a day and it works well. she takes 10 mg in the day time, and 25 at night. it has certainly worked well  to keep her anxiety and temper tantrums at bay. since she has high blood pressure and takes meds for that, i doubt she'd ever be on seroquel.	0
anyone else experiencing their alzheimers loved one clicking when he/she can't remember how to say a sentence? earlier dad wanted to ask me if it would bother me if he turned on the tv but i guess he couldn't find the words. so he just walked over to the tv, pointed at it, and started making clicking noises at me like it was a recognized language. reminded me of that 80's old movie with the coke bottle. my dad went through a clicking phase and even a barking phase. hth mine says 5,5,5, a lot. it's getting to be a challenge. not so far. thank you all for sharing. no i understand better how this may progress.	0
okay, so my dad was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. because i gave birth to a child and didn't live super close to my parents i was never able to attend many of his doctor appointments. now i have moved closer and my child is older, so i'm paying closer attention to his health and helping out my mom. one thing that was never made clear to me is what type of dementia he had. so at his last appointment with his neurologist, i asked her what type of dementia is he diagnosed with. and she said, based on his scans it's either alzheimer's or vascular dementia. so is that a thing? i guess i was looking for something definitive. not: maybe this, maybe that. i guess from her perspective it's all under the same umbrella, but from my prospective i'm just confused. yes, it's a thing. my mom also has vascular dementia and alzheimers. remember, alzheimers is a form of dementia so you're right, it's all under the same umbrella. i wish you all the best! eta: there is no definitive way to diagnose alzheimers while the patient is alive, it's only when they die that they can say (via autopsy) that it was alzheimers. another common cause is vascular dementia. a person can also have both. as others have said, alzheimer's can't be diagnosed with 100% certainty until an autopsy. i've read that alzheimer's presents as a slow progression whereas vascular dementia will process periodically with sudden changes. a uti will also appear as a sudden change, but treating the uti will help improve the sudden problem. my grandmother has vascular dementia and dementia. although i did assume they are the same and it's not? interestingly enough, not diagnosed with alzheimers. we went to different doctors and honestly, none were much help. my grandmother is on medication, it's really not improving her symptoms. i think going to get a second opinion will help in the sense of getting the right mix of medications if you don't think the dr. is doing what he can. my so has a dementia, undefined diagnosis at this point. but without an effective treatments or accurate tests, i am not pushing for further diagnostic testing. we are four years into the dementia, i am focused on positive support, seeing that she gets good food, plenty of rest and limit her over stimulation. i give her opportunity to be functional, but step in when she get confused. had a similar chat with my mom’s doc when she was diagnosed. he told me that the only true way to tell if it’s alzheimer’s is to do an autopsy after she passes away. until then, they use standardized testing. i read somewhere that mri scans show shrinking of the brain with alzheimer’s, more so than regular senile degeneration. while i’m assuming vascular dementia shows less blood flow>>>less circulation from kidney disease or diabetes>>>cognitive functional decline	0

my dad has been really struggling with being my moms primary caregiver. he never had to do much of the child raising and i can tell he’s cracking but am not sure how to help him emotionally. has anyone had success finding a counselor for their parent? he looked for support groups once and then never followed up so i think i’ll need to find someone and give him the push. why kind of counselor has training in this kind of thing. would it be a grief counselor or family counselor? any advice is appreciated my biggest help has been a local alzheimer's group, unless people have experienced it themselves they just don't get it. even just sitting and listening to other people has helped me have some perspective on my own situation. i’m the primary for my mom. i have things covered, but from the outside it might look like i’m holding up way better than i am. you know what i’d absolutely melt for? if i came home from work one day and someone had arranged for my mom to be looked after so that they could take me out to dinner as a thanks for everything. i know there’s no medals for this, and i don’t really expect it, but making time to really acknowledge your dad’s dedication might really mean the world to him. go together with him to a support group or 2, whatever you can find, and folk there likely will know of counsellors / therapists specialising in carer support / grief processing. folk often research for support but then not follow through - if you find when & where & tell him you're going together with him, then that breaks the ice & starts him off. or ask your area alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org, they know for sure. good luck! get his blessings before you take the next step—but my 2¢, select the counsellor, set up an appointment, make sure his 'shift' with mom is covered for the time he'll need, and gently push him out the door with enough time to get there. how to select: if there is a nurse who comes in, then there is some kind of institutional apparatus behind the nurse: hospice, hospital, medi-care/caid… reach out to them for referrals, best kind of counsellor to seek. if not, contact his pcp for a referral. why you need to set wheels in motion: dementia is contagious. caregivers need to remember, sequence, execute millions of adl tasks for self *and* for loved one. lack of self care leads to lack of care for loved one, leads to lack of self-care… vicious cycle. god bless you for caring for the caregiver. my dad was similar, caring for wife & emotionally reserved & struggling with his own issues, and he was a total mess. my dad found a class that he was able to take virtually through the local adult day care center. the class was perfect. the class included video examples, a handout binder broken into sections like 'eating', and a live instructor that was able to answer questions and also curtail some of the winding stories from other classmates. pm me if you want and i can share the local day care details - there may be something similar in your area. i find it almost impossible to be able to join and attend a specific group, but have gotten a lot of great information from this youtube channel, which i can watch anytime it's convenient for me. [www.alz.org](   this will help you find your local alzheimer's chapter. they have group meetings. he needs to attend. set it up for him. get him there. if he's financially stable, then hire an assistant to help out a few days/nights a week. nobody can be a care taker 24/7 and stay sane. ask the nurse for a list of recommended care takers. the nurse or the social worker can provide this. take care. it's a tough job to take care of the dying but even harder when we love them.	0
do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? that’s what i’m struggling with. my family and i can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad i worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. we’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. i am pushing to get it done but the more adamant i am about it, the more i wonder if it’s even the right choice. i have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly i don’t know what to think anymore. thanks in advance for any advice. no; a diagnosis will not affect the disease. what i've had happen, though, is my loved one stopped trying to fake being neurotypical. in a word, she appears like someone with more pronounced dementia than previously. that's while she's around me. we talk about dementia—openly, gently, with respect. having a diagnosis helps me know better how to help her maintain her dignity. helps me learn strategies which would violate norms for neurotypical people, but that have now become helpful—completing her sentences, tying her shoes, asking 'do you understand,' cutting her slack when she can't remember or do something. i've set down my experiences; ymmv. i get you’re worried your dad will feel sadder with a diagnosis, but in my case - my mom knew something was wrong with her, and it upset her not knowing why or what was going on. now that we have a diagnosis, i think it helps her to have an explanation. now when she gets upset because she can’t remember something, i tell her “well mom, it’s because you have alzheimer’s. the alzheimer’s makes you forget.”  it weirdly calms her, i guess because there’s a reason for what’s happening, and knowing what it is in that moment might be helping her confusion. i can tell you from my family’s experience, getting the diagnosis is the right choice. once you have it, you can move forward and get information and help on what to do next. odds are, though, they'll agree it's probably alzheimers. one side note worth mentioning: my mom was also called back for extra testing. at the advice of my bil, an md, my dad asked a lot of questions around what they were looking for specifically, and found out that particular neurologist wanted to enroll my mom in a very expensive drug trial. the extra testing (which my parents would have paid for) only would have shown whether she was a candidate for that trial. so... ask questions. what sort of further testing do they want? neuropsych testing is pretty comprehensive. if his neuropsych testing did not diagnose dementia then he may not have it. severe depression can mimic dementia as well. i experienced something similar to what you describe - i would just say treat it like it’s in your head … at the end of the day, your doing the best you can and make sound judgments while accounting for all evidence. my moms second round of tests showed major decline, enough for the neuro-psych to say “most likely dementia”, and then no follow ups or anything (after a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and small vessel ischemic)  there are times when it seems like a diagnosis makes it worse, mom is relatively lucid and any diagnosis would be perceived by her as straight up gaslighting (hence she refused to see the neuro psych again anyway). but a couple hours later she may think she is in her childhood home and wondering where her parents are …   in sum, i think the diagnosis is critical to get help in the system (i just changed her doctors so she will be more comfortable) - but it may also lead to a lot of crazy fighting (especially if they think they are fine, or constantly forget about the diagnosis). with my one data point, i say no. i have tried changing things up numerous ways to try to manage and try to stay ahead of my wife’s decline. her decline has been a constant steady progression. it seems like every week i noticed a subtle little thing she can’t now do. when she can’t feed herself or use the restroom properly it seems significant, but i see the constant steady decline. staying on a constant schedule of sleep and meds seems to make for much better next days.	0

in december, my father p (m 78) who has stage 6 alzheimers got engaged to be married to his girlfriend of 18 months (f 72) n, who had managed to isolate p from his friends and family and gain control over his finances. in early january, we learned that p & n were meeting p’s longtime accountant and another lawyer to rewrite his will to remove his children and grandchild and give everything he had to n. p had the original will written in 2019 shortly after receiving his diagnosis. although p had failed a capacity test in december and could no longer legally sign his new will or sign his trust fund over to her, he could still get married as the bar is very, very low. despite his severe dementia, p still had many lucid moments and could seem totally fine for short periods. if p signed a marriage certificate, n would have legal control over his health decisions. it would also give her the cover she needed to drain away his financial resources in secrecy, a process she began even before the big day by redirecting the pension payments he received into a bank account she controlled. all n had to do is move him somewhere away from his meddling kids and take away his phone and he would be effectively incommunicado. something had to be done. scammers preying on the elderly in their community was nothing new to them. p’s friends and fam began to plan an intervention over zoom. the idea was that his younger son j (m 51) &  daughter in law s (f 52) would go over to p's house, surprise p with a meeting with all of his friends who would then confront him about their concerns about n and her diabolical plan. after that, j would show p the evidence that they had learned from the background check that n was a lonely hearts romance scammer who had already been convicted of fraud years ago and had lied to him about her own financial situation, telling him she was “loaded” and did not need his money, despite having a huge tax lien on her house. they would also show p a [checklist ]( abusive behaviors to try to get him to see how terribly she was treating him. once he was convinced, they would call the locksmith to have the locks changed, help him pack up his stuff, and drive off to a prearranged airbnb out of state. we also worried she may become physically abusive if he resisted her. early on we had learned that n had quite a temper which worsened when she drank. what would she do if she learned her golden goose was going to break their engagement? timing was everything here. thankfully, p's caregivers gave us a heads up that n was out of town that weekend and that she would not see him until she returned on tuesday. j set the intervention for monday. he said he had no plans to marry n (n wanted this kept secret!) about an hour later i received a text from my sister-in-law reading: on our way to arizona with p!! it would be a difficult situation for any person to realize they wanted to break up with a partner and take the necessary actions to do this, but for someone with dementia they may well be helpless. the other thing we found was that p’s dementia was much much worse than we had known or suspected, despite the increasingly dire caregiver reports. since our contact with him was increasingly limited to short visits and conversations after n arrived on the scene, we had not been able to grasp the severe decline in his memory and communication skills. n took advantage of p’s confusion over his own condition to convince him that he only had mci (moderate cognitive impairment - his initial diagnosis), which was vital in constructing a reality where she was simply marrying a man she loved and who loved her, instead of financially abusing someone dying of a neurodegenerative disorder. on the drive to the airbnb, j reported p had become incoherent after nightfall and kept asking them who they were and where they were going. they learned they needed to keep him out of the kitchen as he would wander around and touch all the knives and even play with the oven burners. it became clear they needed to get him into a care facility as soon as possible before p could endanger himself. thankfully, even at his worst behavior, he continued to be a very sweet and loving person towards j & s.   it would take about a month to get p examined by his doc and admitted into care. until then, they had to keep a very active senior safe and happy in a relatively small space, arrange for a high quality yet affordable memory care, reconstruct p’s finances after n put them under her control and then trashed them, clean out p’s condo and arrange for sale, and do a ft wfh job. first, a man claiming to be a local police officer called asking if p was with j and could they speak to him? j: how could we trust you with p? the sheriffs were standing in front of j's door (they not home) and wanted entrance and to speak with p to verify his condition. we appreciate the supportive comments. wow, what a saga, and terrifying to realize there are people out there who will do this sort of thing. thank you for sharing, and so glad your father is in a better place! so sorry this happened but elated that you were able to rescue p!	0
my dad became unwell yesterday - very high temp, extremely confused, unresponsive at times, unable to walk. i called the gp who triaged over the phone and advised we call an ambulance as dad was deteriorating and needed hospital care. after 6 hours we called again and were told it would be several more hours. my parents live in a flat and we couldn't get dad up from the sofa, let alone down two flights of stairs in order to take him in ourselves. this morning i called the gp back in tears. he came to do a home visit and has decided that dad is ok to stay home under the care of the community team as his condition is improving. i'm relieved that dad seems to be better today but absolutely appalled. i work in the nhs but i've lost all faith that there's any support. so glad yr dad is better now, i hope he continues to improve. it's shocking that they never even came, must have been very stressful, i feel for you! we have ambo ramping problem here in australia, it's terrible. where are you? i hope you don't encounter this problem again. best of luck! big respect to you working for the nhs. both i and my grandma appreciate all the hard work you do.	0
i hope you’re all doing well. we are helpmate, a company run by phd and master's students with a mission to help caregivers and people living with dementia navigate their post-diagnosis journey. **   currently we are gathering expressions of interest for our free pilot cohort-based program which aims to educate and upskill caregivers. the program will run for 4-weeks, comprising of a live session each week led by a specialist in the dementia space (gp, occupational therapist, nutritionist, nurse consultant, neuropsychologist) as well as hearing stories from people living with dementia and their caregivers. we are currently looking to start this inaugural cohort in late april/early may. **are you interested? **   if you are a caregiver and are interested in being part of a tight-knit community of caregivers and want to upskill yourself, please fill in the form below and we will be in touch! **   our team has been navigating this space for months. we have spoken to over 50 different people including caregivers, people living with dementia, loved ones, clinicians, and academics and one thing was very clear to the team. we believe the dementia space lacks a medium for many new and existing families to learn about how to adapt to their new situation. it was also evident that for many families trying to find specific information for their situation, this can also be very difficult as dementia is different for every single person and family. we hope to offer caregivers and their loved ones access to necessary information and surround them with a community of people who share their journey, with our cohort-based program.	0
my grandmother has been living alone for about 2 years and at that time more things have had happened that wad worrying as such. ashe has gone away for 2 times already in which my father just bought an gps tracker for her so that she wont go again. after this my dad was much more worried about my grandma, and made her stay here by lying to my grandma that she needs to wait for my uncle. in the first few weeks it was fine and my uncle was able to come to our home again and again, but then in the fourth week or so my uncle left to go to america since he lives there nowadays. this time it was different, it was today where she went out of our house and tried to go to her home. right now my grandma is arguing with my dad on trying to go home, she just wants to go home and me and my mom are very stressed about this situation because it is very irritating and since my mom is a baker, she always gets in the home. and my dad has had enough and had a mental breakdown about my grandma and surprisingly my grandma was fine about it and said sorry afterwards. what do i do in this situation? i desperately need help because it is very stressing for my entire family and my mom wants to leave and rent an apartment somewhere so that she can work in a nice enviroment. does your grandma have memory issues? can someone move in with her so she can be at her house? if she really can’t live alone and she likes to bake, maybe try baking with her so she is supervised. i am sorry i can’t be of much help. i have more questions than answers. i assume your grandmother has alzheimer's disease or something similar. there is a point where someone with that condition cannot live alone. from what you described, she could be at that point. i don't know where you live, but you could see if your local community has any daycare programs for someone like your grandmother. then show your parents the options. you could read with her or do crafts with her while your mom is trying to get something else done.	0
my grandma has alzheimer’s and she can barely see/hear so she “entertains herself” by scratching and fidgeting with her nails. does anyone know of a fidget toy or ring or something that would be good for her? i googled fidget toys for adults but i’m wondering if anyone has experience with this and can recommend a product the person liked to use. we have the same issue with my mom and the best thing that works are these plastic shapes that i brought which you thread laces through..i have no idea what you would call them but i found them on amazon, i think they are for kids to learn how to lace things up.. basically it's a flat 2d shape with holes in and my mom threads shoe laces through..she can sit for hours doing them, it seems to really relax her too. hope this helps my dad gets a lot of use out of the [playschool fidget cube]( he now tends to put things in his mouth so the smaller fidget toys aren't safe. we also got him some of those silicon bubble pop things. those fidget blankets don't hold his attention because he thinks it's just a blanket. any catalog we got in we would give to him, until he started tearing it and eating the paper. so the toddler toys have been great etsy has a lot of fidget toys made specifically dementia sufferers. the dots can be picked off like scabs. my mil likes to play with pop-its. i think this a good tactile activity for your grandma who can't see very well. it's like an easy and reusable version of bubble wrap. hope it helps! lap blankets, fidget muff. the dollar tree has pop it’s and such for cheap that you can try. does see like animals or babies? try a baby doll or they have animals that meow and pure that might help my wife has a little pillow with rings, and velcro straps and other little things to manipulate. latest thing she likes is a stuffed dog.	0
my friend is in memory care. they would also constantly confabulate or retell the same story. his only story is 'going to get a car today'. both times his face went back to normal as soon as i started talking again. any thoughts would be well appreciated. he just happened to be a resident in the same facility, so i visit both. could be lewy-body dementia. lewy-body has attributes that are very similar to parkinson's. my mother had this and would often look surprised or almost in shock of things.	0
it's been a rough couple of weeks with my mom (64 f). the week before last, she was stuck at home with me because she developed a skin infection on her butt from her nighttime fecal incontinence, and couldn't go to daycare because they wouldn't administer the medication she needed to treat it. on thursday this past week, daycare called me to let me know that my mom was having a really difficult time and complaining of pain in her legs, crying more than usual and just not herself. 'okay,' i thought, i'll take her to urgent care when i pick her up. well, when i picked her up that day, they came out with three bags of clothes saying that she peed through her clothes i sent her in, her spare clothes, and walked out wearing pants that were loaners. the problem there was, she had not been exhibiting any uti symptoms at home. urgent care ended up not being an option because they all need appointments, and the only clinic that takes walk ins is closed now for the foreseeable future after an electrical fire that happened the week we were there for her skin infection. they got her triaged and we waited in the waiting room for a couple of hours before she started sundowning and just would not stop crying over every little thing. the sundowning actually ended up saving us, because we were able to get her into a bed faster, and who knows how long we would have continued to wait if i didn't bring it up. so we get her into the room, they cath her and say she has the cleanest sample they've seen in awhile, no uti. the pain is so difficult to help her with, because in the previous occasions i've had her seen for pain, it's really hard to pinpoint what's real and what's phantom, and then usually she's fine, but something does seem to be off. she screams as if i'm going to kill her when i try to swing her legs out to get her out of bed, or when i need to try and get her to sit up straight in bed, rather than hunched over to her right, or straining her neck, which will actually end up hurting her. anyway, the er doctor was really sweet and talking to me about life with her as it is now, and suggested looking into getting a hospice referral from her pcp. hospice had been suggested to me by a family friend, and that my mom doesn't actually have to be knocking on death's door, that we may be able to get the extra help just for comfort care. after the past two weeks, i feel like maybe these smaller conditions have just progressed her alzheimer's further, and it might just be the disease pushing her into a new stage (she's already progressed so fast this past year, and has been settled in moderate to severe over mild since after she moved in with me last february). i kept mom home with me on friday just because we were up way later than she's used to while at the er for hours, and i wanted to make sure she got some rest. well, friday morning after she woke up, she was really unsteady and unbalanced when trying to get her into the bathroom to change her, and she fell. i could not get her to understand how i needed her to help me help her get up. when she was a caregiver for a man with alzheimer's before she developed her own symptoms, the man she cared for fell all the time (not hard falls, usually he'd slip out of his recliner), and my mom could never get him up. the man's daughter told my mom she just had to call 911 each time he fell to have ems come pick him back up. it got to the point that ems told my mom that if she called one more time, she'd be reported for elder abuse and negligence. so imagine my immense dilemma when trying to decide if i needed to do the same. i did though, the guys who came were all great, and they were in and out in less than 10 minutes. but now i completely understand why my mom needed the extra help with the man she cared for. i'm thinking hospice might definitely be something i want to look into, but i was hoping to get any perspective from those of you who may have had similar experiences with hospice. any input, general information i might not know, suggestions or advice you may be able to offer would be really helpful! i'm also looking now into either a rollator or a wheelchair for her at this point, because the last thing i need is her falling at home, but also when we're not at home or she's at daycare. that's also kind of difficult to reconcile, because if she is at the point where she's not going to walk anymore, it's just going to make caring for her until i can get her into memory care, 10x more difficult, and it means that she is becoming further and further from who she used to be. i'm just going to share my experience with my dad, alzheimer's and hospice. we had moved my dad in to memory care february 2021. in september, my dad started having some aggression issues and violent outbursts. we tried really hard to get a geriatric psych eval but nobody was open due to covid. by late october, his facility told us we needed to find him a new place. unfortunately nowhere in the entire state would consider taking a man with 'behaviors'. we began looking out of state. i had been asking about hospice for a couple months and they finally agreed he should be evaluated for it. they told me in order to qualify for hospice, they have to have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. hospice came the following day to evaluate my dad and decided he qualified. they started him on dilaudid. we finally found him a new facility that would take him and very fortunately it was just a few miles down the road. we moved him in and the new place seemed great and much better equipped to handle my dad. i visited him a few times and they had a family thanksgiving gathering. my dad passed the day after thanksgiving and caught even hospice off-guard. i got a call that they thought he was transitioning to actively dying but i didn't need to rush down. 20 minutes later i got a call back to say that he'd passed. my dad was on hospice just under a month before he passed. it's worth an ask. their job is to help your mom feel better and be comfortable. i'll be thinking about you, op. geriatric social worker here. if your mom qualifies for hospice, go for it. get the care. get the nurse visits. get the social worker visits. get the chaplain and the art therapy and the volunteers and the pet therapy. welcome them to your home. in 6 months, if she qualifies again, awesome. if she doesn’t, you’ll have all these people from that hospice who know you and your mom who will be able to make recommendations on what to do next. i work in a nursing home and one of the biggest misconceptions about hospice is that the patient needs to be “knocking on deaths door.”  they don’t! instead of getting help and care and support, the family puts it off until the person is literally dying, and then they have all these hospice strangers trampling in to help, which is weird and awkward when the family just wants to be with their mom. emt here. if you can’t pick her up without help, we will happily help you. we understand that the disease puts her more at risk for falls. you are one person, you can only do so much. if it does get to the point where we are being called too often, we won’t threaten you. we will have a conversation to make sure you can find the appropriate resources for your mom. thanks for sharing, sorry i don't really have anything concrete to add. i've read plenty of people's stories where they put their loved ones into a facility that specializes with memory care. do you have something like that in your vicinity? essentially, if you aren't capable of taking care of her yourself, you should think about it to lighten your load. where i'm from, we pretty much only have one hospice in the whole country (less than 2 mil pop though), but it's very much for actually dying people, mostly cancer. most elderly homes offer extra care for people with dementia (basically the more help you need, the more it costs). your story made me realize i need to take care of some holding bars around the bathroom for grandma asap. listen when it comes to dementia, there is no real downside to hospice. you get more support, and there aren't any medications you really cut, not the same way as cancer meds. my grandmother was in a similar way after she broke her hip. we got her signed onto hospice in mid-jan. she was still up and walking around, with a lot of help (lifting up onto feet with gait belt, one person in front and behind, and a walker). even as we got her out of bed and worked harder at the heavy lifting trying to 'exercise', she eventually was not able to take a step from standing, then could put her feet flat on the floor. we absolutely would not have been able to handle these fast drastic changes without the support of hospice. everyone says, they wish they started it sooner. i recently found out that people with dementia are eligible for hospice at a certain point, because it is a terminal illness-it does not necessarily mean they are close to death. they are another pair of hands (and heart) to care for your loved one and take a little pressure off of you. they have a lot of experience, give great advice, and are not only there to care for the physical/emotional needs of your loved one with dementia, they are also there to care for the needs of family members. it’s a great program, i can’t recommend it enough. best of luck. from what i understand a doc has to be the one to sign off on her being eligible for hospice care. they do it based on a reasonable expectation that the person has 6 months or less to live. my dad ended being on it for many years. when he got hospice care it was very helpful. he got a medical bed to help him sit up, wheelchair and other medical equip to help keep him clean. also nice to have access to home nursing. just because mom is eligible doesn't mean you have to use hospice. you can also pull her out at any time, and to put her back on it, the doc just has to approve, which im told is easy to get. i would 100% look into this. leave it up to doc to decide, and tell them everything. if she is eligible, id definitely look into all the options for starting up.	0
my grandmother is in her final stage of alzheimer’s disease. she hardly moves and is bedridden. her nurse sent a picture of her legs with mottling creeping up from her feet - said she would probably be with us for another two days. my mom, my husband, and i went to go see her. my mom sees her frequently, but this is the first time i’ve seen her since january. after my husband and i got home, my mom calls saying she checked grandma’s legs and the colors has gone away. has anyone experienced this with their loved one? yes, and unfortunately it may last much longer than 2 days....try 2 years unless of course the nursing home is planning on 'helping along the transition process.' my mom is 87 and has had dementia since at least early 2006 and is now at stage 7 for over 5 years. she started to develop bedsores last summer until we got a hospital bed, and the in home care nurse helped treat and heal her wounds.	0
my dad has been in assisted living for a short while now, and that is going great. the problem is everything else that remains. my sister and i need to prepare his house and its contents for auction/sale. of course, there are some things we both want in the house, and there are the feelings i have to wrangle with of “should i keep this or not?” it’s like dealing with someone’s house after they have died. i’m overwhelmed. i just want to get this task over with and move on, but it feels like there’s so much to do. i live three hours away and have my own family, so it feels like an impossible task. i suppose i’m just venting. did the same with my mothers house. if it has no real sentimental value and i mean “no real” do not keep it. set up 3 areas of a room. make a keep pile, a sell pile (estate sale, let go, etc), and a donate pile. the donation pile helped a lot with making decisions on things because i knew at least someone else could use it and it would do some good. once you start going you will be surprised how little you will keep and how fast the process moves. it helps. i still have boxes of my mom's things even though we emptied her house years ago and she passed away in december. i'm stuck with things that i don't want, but i know she cherished them. i'm in the same boat and totally feel you. we just put my dad in memory care a couple weeks ago and i'm so stressed about his house and all the crap he (and my mom) accumulated over the years. there are so many and i don't want all of them but i feel so guilty throwing them away. there are people who, for a fee, will go through all that stuff and hold an estate sale. that might not be the avenue you choose, but be aware that it exists. a senior center or local realtor could probably put you in touch with one. others have commented on the keep/toss/donate strategy. i've done that too, it's just that there's so much! my approach to big chores is break it down into manageable increments and keep going back to it when possible. since you live 3 hours away, you might put a couple cartons in your car with every trip and work on decisions from your home base. right where i am, too. my dad went into a facility two weeks ago. the kicker is we got a practice run. my dad had been keeping his dad's house for 15+ years his death. was 'cleaning it out' on his monthly and then twice-yearly trips across a couple states. last april, i saw my dad's condition and knew we had to get this house sold, so i got my brother and my dad on board (my dad was a bit resistant but knew deep down he couldn't hold onto the house forever) and planned a four-day trip to 'finish cleaning the house out.' had a realtor all set up. when i arrived it looked exactly the same as i remembered last time i visited like 10 years ago. some items cleaned, but mostly still a fully-crammed house full of stuff. we spent those four days frantically tossing, donating, and packing what we wanted to keep to take back home. packed a 40-yard dumpster to its gills. did a lot of emotional work with my dad trying to get rid of some stuff or get him to realize he has to take things back to his house. now it almost feels easier this time around because i'm practiced and he is not there to have to guide through things. it certainly helps me to read about how other families deal with this. my sister overpaid a cleaning/estate sale service to go thru our parents' house for us. we walked through together (i brought my best friend for moral support) and removed things we wanted. it's easy for us because i live in a different country, that limited what i could take home. i did have to sacrifice some small items to her crazy, and ultimately my friend just started putting some of my mom's knickknacks straight into her purse (my mom is still alive and now in assisted living) so my sister wouldn't keep them. my mom just put those things in a drawer so who knows if it was worth the subterfuge. be thankful you have a someone to help, i had to do this alone. although, i did not have the added “i want that” headache with a sibling. i started by doing many many runs to goodwill but just ended up getting a dumpster. i felt bad about trashing useful items, but it would have taken weeks and no charity would pick up. an estate sale would have ended up costing more than the dumpster since i, of course, kept anything of value. but, i don’t want to freak you out or anything, the house clearing was the easiest part of my alzheimer’s caregiving experience. that is something that could be done and accomplished. i'm in the same, same, same situation ahhh  i'm in front of his new home now, texting my sister, about to check in, thinking about how in a week ill be on the floor of his house hours away going through boxes. and my sister is no help 😤 (her having a new baby and also being in another part of the country is a pretty good excuse though)  you and i and all of us will get through this, because our parents would have if they were in our position i hired a junk removal service and moved the sentimental/valuables to a storage unit. hired a relator and got that baby sold. you’ll feel so much better when it’s done and you’ll hopefully have some profit from the sale to be able to to help fund assisted living facility costs. to me it feels like a violation of their property, since my mother is still living in nursing care. it took me a while to even go there and have a look at what needed doing. if it wasn't for my daughters i would still be stuck. i opened a shed door yesterday and just stood there crying. why did they keep so much junk? we have one room to put all the household items in for sale as we go through each room, cupboard drawer methodically. we will hold a garage sale to get rid of what we can, use fb marketplace for any items left and then call a charity to bring their truck. my biggest problem is getting rid of the clothes. all the donation bins are still full most of the time thanks to the great ovid cleanout everyone seems to have had, and the charity shops no longer want things. if worse comes to worse it will have to go to landfill but i would rather not have to do that. when my grandpa died (of cancer), i did most of the cleaning. keep some clothes you can wear, that's my favourite memento, because i actually use it often (kept a couple of shirts). i have a garage full of stuff i can't part with. maybe we should switch houses and clean each other's parents' stuff. i think i just created a new reality show. my brothers and i will likely be having to do this too in the near future and i dread it, i can see how you would be overwhelmed.	0
my great grandmother, recently diagnosed with alzheimer’s, was very fond of her two dogs, a pug and a corgi, however she couldn’t take care of them after the dead of my great grandfather, and has been living alone ever since. i was looking for robotic pets she doesn’t need to take care of, and saw two nice brands. perfect petzzz and joy for all. anyone know if there’s some hybrid with realistic breathing and sleeeping and the same functions as joy for that’s a pug or a corgi? set aside 180 pounds for this, hoping i can give the dog to her before her birthday of april 28. i would think just a nice cuddly stuffed dog would be great. i am going to visit my mom in memory care and was thinking of getting her a stuffed cat toy as she always loved cats. your live, time and caring is your greatest gift. i have seen some folks in memory care with stuffed animals that they hold and love on. i know its a recent diagnosis and you want to do something nice, but id be a little cautious with a pricey niche gift like this. its possible the other commenter is right, your time (or maybe your assistance to her primary caregiver) would *probably* be the better gift now, unless you 100% know shes going to love it, or itll have a great return policy. i got my alz grandma a stuffed dog that looked *realistic* and like a dog she used to have, around the same time i got her a baby doll that looked like a life-size toy.. she thought the *doll was real* and coddled it like a real baby, but was angry and offended that i would give her a toy dog doll. i had to return it. on top of that she did love the baby but it gave her a little bit of anxiety because she was afraid of waking it all the time. in any case good luck, its nice you want to be nice. my mum has a sleeping breathing dog toy. she prefers the more ordinary but lifelike soft toy dogs. she cuddles and talks to them..and it doesn't matter if they fall on the floor or get a bit messy.. the best gift you can give her is time. do things like take her on long walks (if she is capable of doing so). i feel like my grandma would be offended, if i brought her a toy dog (although she doesn't like animals as it is), because she'd still know it's a toy dog. i did encounter articles about pets helping a bunch and i am interested in having a dog myself, although grandma is resistant at this point. i'll keep these robotic pets in mind, thanks for bringing it up!	0
none of the major risk genes for alzheimer's are in the sex chromosomes, so females can pass those genes to male offspring just as well as they can to female offspring. that said, alzheimer's is approximately twice as common in females than males. how old were they when they became ill? elderly alzheimer's is not hereditary. young-onset alzheimer's is/can be genetic. most alzheimer's patients are elderly. also, women live longer than men on average. men are likely to die younger of other causes before elderly alzheimer's starts to happen.	0
how do you handle this? my dad (alz, mid-way-ish through disease process) has diseased toenails that are difficult to manage. should i have a medical professional assist in trimming every 2 weeks? it’s painful for him, but i’m always worried about possible infection. additionally, best shoes for alz. he has these no-tie sketchers but they’re getting harder for him to push on. maybe crocs? think he’d be up for a pedicure? i take my mom in when i visit every few weeks. it’s a huge help and the team at her local salon is amazing. it has become a nice socialization thing for her. or if you think they’re really diseased maybe a podiatrist could clean things up first, and then they’d be easier to manage? following for shoe recommendations. podiatrist/chiropodist home visits - they can treat and cut his nails. crocs for outdoors, rubber soled velcro slippers for indoors. get a podiatry home visit every few weeks. gran is less squeamish when they do it. also has the added bonus that she perks up a bit with someone else to talk too. she wears sandals round the house that are easy to wear but can get cold. there are travel nurses at home specific for foot care. my grandmother is doing very well with birkenstocks made from eva foam, try the arizona model. very comfy, clean very easily (i wear them myself as well). we don't do her nails every two weeks, they grow way slower than mine do. she doesn't want to go to a salon, but she enjoys when i do her feet. i first soak her feet in hot water with salt (very salty, probably around twice the amount as i would use for pasta), squeeze of lemon juice (you can use any other acid on hand) and a pump of soap. 30 minutes is a nice time, but the water is gonna get cold, so check in-between. i got the recipe from a friend that does old lady's nails and feet professionally. after the soak, i first scrub her feet with that black sandpaper thing (i don't even know what's it called in my own language :d) and remove any harder stuff with a rougher stone. sometimes she gets these little blister like things on the tips of her toes. then i clip what i can, her big toes probably have fungal infections because they are very thick and crumbly, but that was before i started taking care of her, so it's probably too far gone to really do anything about it. i'd recommend good clippers, the big ones that kinda look like pliers are a lifesaver with the thick nails. for the end, i use a good foot cream and that's that. i used to do it every couple of days, because her soles were shot (really dry, flaking all over, she also has light diabetes, so that was a worry, etc. we had the same problem! took him to the podiatrist, and they cut his toenails, recommended some fungal cream, and gave us a list of people who can do monthly maintenance for him, including people who could go to where he lives (in memory care). get him the meds if his doctor says it’s ok.  in 3 months his nails will be better. my mum goes to a podiatrist and my dad goes to. my mum is the one with alzheimer's but dad goes with mum and they both have their apps so mum is more comfortable. before that i was cutting her nails and doing fungal nail treatment for her. we just did a foot bath this week, then i trimmed her nails. we used to do it monthly, but hadn't for several months recently. i could tell a difference, as she didn't want to leave her feet in the water for 20 minutes and kept taking one out, so i started after 10 minutes. when she was more lucid, she asked to go to a podiatrist to get her nails trimmed. i had never heard of that and thought it was weird, to but her sister told me that is a normal thing. i too use the pliers type clippers. i had seen them at pedicures before, but my grandmother bought them at walmart. those are the ones i have the best luck with. i don't know about shoes. when she goes out, a rare thing, she usually wears a pair of my easy spirits that zip up. they were too tight on me, to do i had given them to my grandmother who wore a size smaller. i bought some men's memory form slippers that are warm and big enough, but turns out they slide off the hardwood floors something awful. i guess she'll need a larger size or different style in the future. i just go to the nail salon and leave a big tip (like $10-20), which is double or more than what they charge for a trim.... just so they don't hate us going in.	0
i’ve gone through early-onset with family for decades. first my mom when i was pretty young 12/13 until 31) and now my sister from who knows when - past 20 years. my sister is now late stage. i don’t know how much longer she will hang in. i hate it for them, and i hate it for me. heartbreak my whole life. trying to be positive, but some days are so bad. you don’t have to be positive everyday. sometimes you need a break from being strong. give yourself that break, tomorrow’s another day. oh my...that's a very heavy burden on your heart from such a young age. i'm so sorry,this is such a cruel time taker of a disease. my family has it as well, i am scared how do you manage thinking about it happening to you? will you have kids? my wife, 54 was just diagnosed. i feel for you- having to deal for so long. i would love to know more about the varying stages and most specifically what are the indicators for which stages. your story and bravery can really help people. i'm all ears. much love	0
my moms pretty bad off and believes that my dad who has heart issues ran off to die because he didn’t want her to find him. she also thinks the man taking care of her is her best friend mj. my dad has never left her side and i know it’s killing inside. is there anything we can do to help her kinda snap out of it or is it all just down hill from here? 'hi, i'm [name], your husband of x years.' also maybe a 'loving couple' photo portrait in her line of sight, his arm around her or some affectionate pose?	0

my mom has been diagnosed and lived with alzheimer for 4 years. her condition now is really bad and she doesnt have any common sense and manner at all, she can hardly be concious at things and even if i call her mutiple times she wont reply. but lately my brothers turned some sort of buddhism audio for her at night while she slept, i'm an atheist so i dont care about much but then he had to stop because my dad didn't want to involve in religious stuffs (yeah that's audio was kinda spooky for real). after  a few days, one night, it was like 1 am or something, i heard she was mumbling, normally when my mom sleeps, she has somniloquy so i just think that she is sleep talking but then i came closer i realised that she woke up and looked just like the first stage of alzheimer. she remembered me, remembered normal manners, remembered how to calculate and i asked her to sign her name-which she normally can't do, she did, of course sometimes she still mistook things but i surprised that she was concious and looked normal. but when she be able to read the clock and tell the time, she had to sleep and i was kinda afraid that if she sleep, things would be back to normal, and they sure were. have anyone met this situation before?????? yes have had a relatively similar experience. one night i was stepping in for my brother and his partner so they could go out. this was way past the time of her realizing she was sick - it was really shocking. looking back in it i’m glad it happened, it was a nice interaction and i haven’t had a good one since really. it's pretty common, i think. wow! music certainly is a great therapy, especially classical music like beethoven, so it’s worth while to explore different musical genres. i’ve seen these “moments of clarity” over my several years of being a caregiver, and it’s quite spectacular to witness. but people should tame their hopes and expectations that these moments can be repeated and/or extended. continued socialization, music, dietary changes, etc, can all contribute to reducing or slowly down the effects of the disease. how amazing! that must have been nice to have your mom back for a bit. here’s a buddhist rhythm to try. my grandma with alzheimer’s would always respond when i played guitar or chanted this mantra  reminiscing is vital.	0
this last year my father's mental condition has been deteriorating. those who've been in my place for longer, how do you cope during the progression? get power of attorney sorted out now, and i mean now. if your dad gets declared as lacking capacity, he can no longer sign to appoint one. then you have a lengthy, complicated and expensive legal procedure to get it done. trust me, that is what i am going through right now. had to call sheriffs a few times and had a few hospital visits. my dad was quite stubborn and insisted nothing was wrong, but i managed to get durable poa set up to help him with this big transaction he was confused on. he probably didn't understand he was signing a durable poa. i don't think i did anything wrong because it really needed to happen. i second and then immediately third the notion to get durable poa right away. it saved the bacon of everybody involved when he finally ended up in the hospital and they wouldn't release him except to a memory care facility. i then would say if he lets you, use the poa to get his affairs in order when you can still ask him questions. emotionally, well, it sucks the big one. my dad just passed away from alzheimer’s, he lived with it for almost a decade. as another commenter said, get power of attorney as that will allow for you or your mom to make important decisions for him. care is extremely expensive especially down the road, so i would try to get financials in order if at all possible. the way to get medicaid to pay for care is to spend down your assets to the point where it appears you have less money than you do, i.e. buying a house or car. down the line you’ll want to get in touch with an elder care attorney as they specialize in this stuff. spend time with him and get him moving and seeing old friends as those things just get harder as time goes by, but don’t feel guilty if it’s hard for you to be around him a lot because it’s simply depressing. i wish you the best of luck. being a caretaker for your parents is one of the most difficult and also rewarding things you can do. fill your mind and soul with patience, compassion and love. take lots of pictures and videos of good times and bad ones too. they become great tools for reflection and learning. she was 52 when she was diagnosed. get your power of attorney in order and before he is too far gone make sure that he has nothing in his name: homes, cars, access to accounts. we hired a lawyer for this. we were able to get my mom on medicare and no one went after my dad for money for medical stuff. my mom is now 57, and she lived in a nursing home, she couldn’t be left alone while my dad went to work anymore, it’s hard but eventually it becomes the normal. feel free to reach out of you have questions. i've dealt with alzheimer's most of my life. first with my grandmother, who declined quite rapidly throughout my high school years, and then my father, whose stroke got the ball rolling in the same year my grandmother passed. the number one thing i can tell you is to have patience, and when he gets combative or starts not recognizing you, keep in mind that those moments are not him, it's the disease. second, power of attorney is exceptionally important. all the upcoming doctors visits and legal struggles will be made ten times easier if you have poa. my mom had poa over my dad, and it was like pulling teeth to try and get her to do anything because she didn't want to admit he was declining either. when he passed in 2016, she absolutely shut down and i had to make all the decisions anyway, but had to string her along to sign paperwork. third, show him old videos if you have any, but also take new ones. cherish those memories. 💜 you or another family member should go to a doctor's appointment with your dad to 'discuss the incident of finding himself in another town.' something like that happened with my dh and the doctor promptly said 'you need to give up driving.' this is huge - most men don't like giving that up (women too, but it seems a bigger deal to men) and having the doctor say it may be the thing that makes it happen. a person with dementia not only endangers himself but others. as for you coping - are you his primary caregiver? if you are, or are going to be transitioning into that role - i strongly suggest you find a dementia caregiver support group. it helps you cope with your feelings as well as learn a lot of necessary tips for helping your dad. get an elder law attorney. get durable poa, **now**. you need the attorney to arrange his assets so that he will be eligible for a medicaid waiver home care and nursing home eventually, without draining the inheritance entirely. does he have a diagnosis yet? if he does not, you may be able to purchase a long-term care insurance plan. he is quite young and if he is also physically healthy, he may live with this for 15 or 20 years. * [ * [   **if you modify your base assumptions and expectations to set up a good environment for him, he can have a normal-feeling life for a long time. ** and reach out for help when problems arise instead of trying to diy until a crisis lands him in the hospital. because every injury and hospitalization (especially if surgery, bed rest healing time, and residential pt rehab is required) will make basic tasks require more help, which accelerates dementia. also, test him for hearing loss. for example, he needs to be living in a disability-accessible, walkable community asap. he must not be living in a home that requires him to drive if he wants to leave the house and do anything. he must have a roll-in shower, a bathroom that can take a shower bench. no stairs, non-slip floors. all these will make it easier for him to live without heavy assistance, longer. later on, it becomes extremely hard to disrupt their living habits because they cannot form new habits. but the home has to be safe. if he can walk to shops without driving, he will be able to socialize, run low-risk errands, and feel normal for a very long time. thank you all for the advice. the poa situation will definitely be a priority once it's all official. i should clarify there are a couple tests they need to do first, but yes, his doctors are fairly sure that this is what we're dealing with. i really liked everyones suggestions of memory documentation, since there's already so much for him that isn't the same and it feels like every month its a little worse. i find comfort just in knowing that others understand how this all feels and how confusing it is, for the family, but also the one diagnosed. like others said get both poas. find the insurance policies, car titles, passwords and any other important documents. i wish i had taken some of my wife when she was better.	0

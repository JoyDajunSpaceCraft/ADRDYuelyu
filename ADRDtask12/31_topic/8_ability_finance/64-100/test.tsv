my grandma is far down the rabbit hole and diagnosed with alzheimers or dementia. we are moving her to a care home tomorrow but one of her recurring issues is obsessively counting money. in her own home we just had her constantly pay us money, put it in a cabinet and then give it back to her each visit. now that she's going to a home with outside people, we don't want her having real money just in case. the bank of canada has a fake money printout for children but she can tell the texture difference between our plastic bills and complains.	1
this last year my father's mental condition has been deteriorating. those who've been in my place for longer, how do you cope during the progression? get power of attorney sorted out now, and i mean now. if your dad gets declared as lacking capacity, he can no longer sign to appoint one. then you have a lengthy, complicated and expensive legal procedure to get it done. trust me, that is what i am going through right now. had to call sheriffs a few times and had a few hospital visits. my dad was quite stubborn and insisted nothing was wrong, but i managed to get durable poa set up to help him with this big transaction he was confused on. he probably didn't understand he was signing a durable poa. i don't think i did anything wrong because it really needed to happen. i second and then immediately third the notion to get durable poa right away. it saved the bacon of everybody involved when he finally ended up in the hospital and they wouldn't release him except to a memory care facility. i then would say if he lets you, use the poa to get his affairs in order when you can still ask him questions. emotionally, well, it sucks the big one. my dad just passed away from alzheimer’s, he lived with it for almost a decade. as another commenter said, get power of attorney as that will allow for you or your mom to make important decisions for him. care is extremely expensive especially down the road, so i would try to get financials in order if at all possible. the way to get medicaid to pay for care is to spend down your assets to the point where it appears you have less money than you do, i.e. buying a house or car. down the line you’ll want to get in touch with an elder care attorney as they specialize in this stuff. spend time with him and get him moving and seeing old friends as those things just get harder as time goes by, but don’t feel guilty if it’s hard for you to be around him a lot because it’s simply depressing. i wish you the best of luck. being a caretaker for your parents is one of the most difficult and also rewarding things you can do. fill your mind and soul with patience, compassion and love. take lots of pictures and videos of good times and bad ones too. they become great tools for reflection and learning. she was 52 when she was diagnosed. get your power of attorney in order and before he is too far gone make sure that he has nothing in his name: homes, cars, access to accounts. we hired a lawyer for this. we were able to get my mom on medicare and no one went after my dad for money for medical stuff. my mom is now 57, and she lived in a nursing home, she couldn’t be left alone while my dad went to work anymore, it’s hard but eventually it becomes the normal. feel free to reach out of you have questions. i've dealt with alzheimer's most of my life. first with my grandmother, who declined quite rapidly throughout my high school years, and then my father, whose stroke got the ball rolling in the same year my grandmother passed. the number one thing i can tell you is to have patience, and when he gets combative or starts not recognizing you, keep in mind that those moments are not him, it's the disease. second, power of attorney is exceptionally important. all the upcoming doctors visits and legal struggles will be made ten times easier if you have poa. my mom had poa over my dad, and it was like pulling teeth to try and get her to do anything because she didn't want to admit he was declining either. when he passed in 2016, she absolutely shut down and i had to make all the decisions anyway, but had to string her along to sign paperwork. third, show him old videos if you have any, but also take new ones. cherish those memories. 💜 you or another family member should go to a doctor's appointment with your dad to 'discuss the incident of finding himself in another town.' something like that happened with my dh and the doctor promptly said 'you need to give up driving.' this is huge - most men don't like giving that up (women too, but it seems a bigger deal to men) and having the doctor say it may be the thing that makes it happen. a person with dementia not only endangers himself but others. as for you coping - are you his primary caregiver? if you are, or are going to be transitioning into that role - i strongly suggest you find a dementia caregiver support group. it helps you cope with your feelings as well as learn a lot of necessary tips for helping your dad. get an elder law attorney. get durable poa, **now**. you need the attorney to arrange his assets so that he will be eligible for a medicaid waiver home care and nursing home eventually, without draining the inheritance entirely. does he have a diagnosis yet? if he does not, you may be able to purchase a long-term care insurance plan. he is quite young and if he is also physically healthy, he may live with this for 15 or 20 years. * [ * [   **if you modify your base assumptions and expectations to set up a good environment for him, he can have a normal-feeling life for a long time. ** and reach out for help when problems arise instead of trying to diy until a crisis lands him in the hospital. because every injury and hospitalization (especially if surgery, bed rest healing time, and residential pt rehab is required) will make basic tasks require more help, which accelerates dementia. also, test him for hearing loss. for example, he needs to be living in a disability-accessible, walkable community asap. he must not be living in a home that requires him to drive if he wants to leave the house and do anything. he must have a roll-in shower, a bathroom that can take a shower bench. no stairs, non-slip floors. all these will make it easier for him to live without heavy assistance, longer. later on, it becomes extremely hard to disrupt their living habits because they cannot form new habits. but the home has to be safe. if he can walk to shops without driving, he will be able to socialize, run low-risk errands, and feel normal for a very long time. thank you all for the advice. the poa situation will definitely be a priority once it's all official. i should clarify there are a couple tests they need to do first, but yes, his doctors are fairly sure that this is what we're dealing with. i really liked everyones suggestions of memory documentation, since there's already so much for him that isn't the same and it feels like every month its a little worse. i find comfort just in knowing that others understand how this all feels and how confusing it is, for the family, but also the one diagnosed. like others said get both poas. find the insurance policies, car titles, passwords and any other important documents. i wish i had taken some of my wife when she was better.	1
i stumbled on this 1-hour documentary this weekend and wanted to  share with you all. it's a former cnn reporter who is now in her 80s and  has the apoe-e4 gene and wanted to know how likely she is to get  the disease.	0
but for the past year or so like clockwork around 8pm he wants to go home and it takes around an hour or more to make him 'stop' and be content and stay. man it's so taxing. i mean he has incontinence bowel and urinary so i take care of that, and all the other stuff that comes with the territory no problem but this constant 'goin home' gets me.. we have several different techniques that work with my dad:  the obvious one i take him home, we are lucky that we can leave town drive a short distance and reenter town on a different road. when he says home he means bed (especially at night) so mum takes him up to their room and he settles. a dog walk around the block, again exiting their estate on one road and reentering on a different road to break the cycle. obviously some of these won't fit your situation but please ask any questions and i will try my best to help. sometimes it means they want to go back to when they weren't sick. i'd grab his hand or hug him (to reassure him) and say something like 'ok, we'll head home after we x (insert activity here)'. my grandmother always wants to start the i don’t know why they brought me here conversation. usually she veers back off topic with the questions i’m asking her and forgets the original complaint. it doesn’t make it any less irritating, but it calms her down when i give her the options. my mom does the same thing, but she is already bedridden. i will just say 'we're here,' and mention the name of community we live in, but in our case it's the same house for 50 years, but sometimes she still mentions europe where she grew up and asks for her mom who also passed 45 years ago. you might have to say something and reference the name of community he is talking about if it's not the home you are at now. it's like a switch in atmosphere, and most patients with alzheimer's respond pleasurably to music; it's an area of the brain that remains functional longer than others. it helps distract them and change their focus from 'home' to the music. i like u/kitkatinkerbell's suggestions and have used some of the same techniques when helping my sil care for my brother, especially 'taking him home' by getting in the car, riding several miles and returning, saying 'we're home!' i admire you so much for caring for your dad! that's such a loving, caring way to honor your father. ...in the day- to-day struggle, i know how much of a strain it can be, how much stress and fatigue you must be feeling. i hope you're finding support with other caregivers who understand your challenges, and i hope you have family or others who can offer relief for you so you can get the rest you need. bless you! cheers to all the hard work you have done to take care of him! since it is always happening at the same time, it may be from a long forgotten routine from years back. try to engage and ask if there is someone they want to see at home, or is there something they need to do? or if they just want to be at home. it may be physical, sensory ,(is it too loud, too quiet? hth	0
fil is in al but not memory care, so he can come and go. i am worried that he’ll over do it and not be able to make it back home and get stranded. he wears a medical alert necklace 24/7 but it doesn’t have a gps locate so i was thinking about adding an air tag with the kind of water resistant cover you use for dog tags. thoughts? now is the time to start prevention measures so that he does not get lost. often seniors that go missing are in early stages. this is when they are most ambulatory and can easily get confused. just last week a lady where i live was still driving and went missing. she was in the early stages and her family was still letting her drive. my mom thought it was ok to let my dad drive shortly after he was diagnosed and he went the wrong way down a street. i put my foot down and said no more driving. my mother's assisted living facility had a system just for this phase of dementia. she wore a bracelet that triggered an alarm if she attempted to through any of the exterior doors. of course, it was an added option that i begrudgingly paid, but it worked quite well. my mother could do anything she liked within the facility (including interior courtyards) but had to have an escort if she left the building. i'm actually surprised your facility is allowing someone with alzheimer's (albeit in the early phases) to be in assisted living without some sort of safeguard. i tried airtags with my kids. it's ok but doesn't give you minute-by-minute updates. it works great if they go to a friend's house after school, but near useless at an amusement park as it doesn't update frequently enough. if your fil got lost, the airtag may tell you where he was 1 minute ago or 30 minutes ago. i am in a similar situation. i use find my friends on my mom’s phone to track her. you can add alerts for when they leave certain places, are not at certain places etc. of course only works if they have their phone on them. i also track her vehicle’s gps. we considered the air tag but being an apple user myself, id have to swap between her apple id and mine to see it which would get difficult. tile is another one you can use, but it does emit a sound when trying to track which could be startling. there’s a lot of ways to track and drawbacks to each. as long as you find one that’s reliable and works for you, all the better. keeping them safe is top priority. i guess he doesn't take a mobile phone around with him? if so there are apps like life360 that will give you tracking at all times. i haven't used apple air tags but have heard stories about how they helped people retrieve their stolen bikes pretty well so its worth investigating. how could you guarantee he always had it with him? &nbsp;   check out these little spark nano gps trackers. they are super inexpensive. my sis got them for her teen's car a while back and really liked it. we'll most likely be getting one for mom soon-ish. i have an airtag for my hubby. (about stage 5-6) i have an iphone as does our three children. the airtag  is assigned to my iphone and shows up on the apple find my ap under the “items” tab. i have activated the “share my location” option on my phone with each of my kids. they can see where my hubby and i are. this is a safety support for both of us. i put the airtag inside hubs wallet as he always puts his wallet in his pants and i secured in place with double sided tape. this has worked well for us.	0
short version (i can add info if needed), my fil is stage 4 dementia. roommate almost died and is still recovering. family member who was helping lost her husband. i am the legal guardian and i made arrangements for fil to go into assisted living. he can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it). he initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind. the problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available. the reasons he gives for wanting to leave al are not grounded in reality. he’s not progressed enough for memory care, but al is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will. i keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there i don’t know what to do with him. see if you can visit the place a few times and tell him he lives there and you will be back to move his things there. maybe you and the al social worker could sit down with him and go over all his concerns. additionally, you need to remind him it's not as simple as going back to his old house, because it's rented out to someone else, and the roommate/caregiver is no longer available to help him with day to day affairs. explore options - maybe he would prefer a different al placement? you and the social worker can also go over some of his deluded beliefs (don't call them that in front of him!). show him where the eye drops are, and ask if he'd like someone to administer them to him. my dh who i am trying to put into memory care at present, has had similar delusions. and when he has lost a wallet by leaving it somewhere, he states that someone 'stole' it. he can't locate most of the things he needs (constantly losing toothbrushes). good of you to look out for this man. my dad is in memory care and went through a similarly tough patch where he was paranoid, angry, argumentative, and distrustful. he worried about people taking his car and money (this included my mom, who he said his lawyer would be contacted, because she needed to get out of his house.) this passed after time, but it was a tough roughly 2 years. keep your fil a little more comfortable by finding lies that will calm him down. i'm constantly saying this to my mother during every conversation i have with her and she's been in memory care for almost a year. now that she is settled (she still isn't happy about it), she fears change and when i bring up finding a new facility for her, the thought of changing her routine scares her and she stops complaining (for a little while)  i was staunchly against medicating my mother for behavioral reasons because i didn't want to lose what little was left of her inside. move him, medicate him one thing i did with my dad is tell him we found him “an apartment with help” that was just a home base for him. i drove back there with him in my car, and when he saw the building, he said, “that’s a bad place.” i parked and he asked, “what are we doing here?” i said, “i need to speak to the lady at the front desk.” “should i stay in the car?” “no, come with me, i said.” he came with me, i checked us both in, walked him to his room, and we said goodbye like everything was fine. also, if he’s paranoid he may not want to take additional medications, but if he’s already taking medications, you could speak to his doctor about adding something for his mood (assuming you have medical poa?). that has helped my dad. good luck! my husband and sil try to logic her out of these delusions with evidence. she refuses to discuss assisted living and lives in the same town as sil. they check on her a few times a week, and my husband will stay with her 2-4 weeks at a time. (we are in another state) the other 2 siblings are no help. (she was also not the nicest person in younger years so they see her 1-2 times a year out of duty.) if he is a danger to himself, you can gain power of attorney and guardianship. my grandmother had moved al twice and both times she has gone through a phase of this when she first moved in. it went on months the first time, but she had progressed by the second move and it lasted a few weeks.	0
is there any want to stop/help a grandparent from leaving the house especially at night? i think they’ve tried locks but she figures it out. we bought some of those toddler door handle safety covers and that really did the trick. we also put those cheap slide locks at the base of the door and dad never noticed it to open the door. we had those cheap alarms on the doors but the rest of us would always forget about them and scare the crap out of ourselves when we went out the door. dad wasnt too bad about wandering at night but there was a short time he would get up. double keyed deadbolt. depending how far along your grandparent is, you may try one of those door decals that makes it look like a bookcase or something. also, an alarm on the door is wise. my fil installed double-keyed deadbolt locks and always keeps the keys hidden. door alarms - not terribly expensive and they wake you or an overnight attendant who can then intervene;	0
if the loss of sense of smell associated with alzheimer’s would be studied towards restoring it first would memory return? does the pineal gland hold the answer? you're not likely to have heard about studies where things like this were researched and found not to be helpful. i’m a research patient. but wouldn’t do the loss smell thing because i smoke. how far outside the box?	0
my mom is well into the later stages of alzheimer's and can no longer do  any self care. her restlessness and excitability is really  tiring, so we requested a medication to ease her anxiety. to my surprise  an anti-psychotic ( aripiprazole ) was prescribed, and while she does  tell imaginary stories i do not see how this drug will address her fear  and anxiety. anyone got any experience with the effect of this meds with  alz patients, and any relevant advice? i thought something like  lorazepam would be prescribed. i do not have any experience with aripropazol in dementia patients. i will say that after my grandmother (probable alzheimer’s) started taking seroquel, her mood improved dramatically. i have a family member who is a neurologist who has also seen seroquel help quite many dementia patients. i bet many other people here can attest to seroquel’s impact as well. my understanding is that if the dementia is alzheimer’s it will have the intended mellowing effect, however if it is a different type (ftd or lb, don’t remember) it will immediately make the mood worse. my grandmother was also prescribed lorazepam while she was in hospice, but she was one of those minority of people for whom it did not have the intended effect. although it made her sleepy, she became extremely paranoid with the delusion that we had kidnapped her and were holding her hostage. my mil (moderate stages) takes hydroxyzine twice a day and it works well. she takes 10 mg in the day time, and 25 at night. it has certainly worked well  to keep her anxiety and temper tantrums at bay. since she has high blood pressure and takes meds for that, i doubt she'd ever be on seroquel.	0
anyone else experiencing their alzheimers loved one clicking when he/she can't remember how to say a sentence? earlier dad wanted to ask me if it would bother me if he turned on the tv but i guess he couldn't find the words. so he just walked over to the tv, pointed at it, and started making clicking noises at me like it was a recognized language. reminded me of that 80's old movie with the coke bottle. my dad went through a clicking phase and even a barking phase. hth mine says 5,5,5, a lot. it's getting to be a challenge. not so far. thank you all for sharing. no i understand better how this may progress.	0
okay, so my dad was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. because i gave birth to a child and didn't live super close to my parents i was never able to attend many of his doctor appointments. now i have moved closer and my child is older, so i'm paying closer attention to his health and helping out my mom. one thing that was never made clear to me is what type of dementia he had. so at his last appointment with his neurologist, i asked her what type of dementia is he diagnosed with. and she said, based on his scans it's either alzheimer's or vascular dementia. so is that a thing? i guess i was looking for something definitive. not: maybe this, maybe that. i guess from her perspective it's all under the same umbrella, but from my prospective i'm just confused. yes, it's a thing. my mom also has vascular dementia and alzheimers. remember, alzheimers is a form of dementia so you're right, it's all under the same umbrella. i wish you all the best! eta: there is no definitive way to diagnose alzheimers while the patient is alive, it's only when they die that they can say (via autopsy) that it was alzheimers. another common cause is vascular dementia. a person can also have both. as others have said, alzheimer's can't be diagnosed with 100% certainty until an autopsy. i've read that alzheimer's presents as a slow progression whereas vascular dementia will process periodically with sudden changes. a uti will also appear as a sudden change, but treating the uti will help improve the sudden problem. my grandmother has vascular dementia and dementia. although i did assume they are the same and it's not? interestingly enough, not diagnosed with alzheimers. we went to different doctors and honestly, none were much help. my grandmother is on medication, it's really not improving her symptoms. i think going to get a second opinion will help in the sense of getting the right mix of medications if you don't think the dr. is doing what he can. my so has a dementia, undefined diagnosis at this point. but without an effective treatments or accurate tests, i am not pushing for further diagnostic testing. we are four years into the dementia, i am focused on positive support, seeing that she gets good food, plenty of rest and limit her over stimulation. i give her opportunity to be functional, but step in when she get confused. had a similar chat with my mom’s doc when she was diagnosed. he told me that the only true way to tell if it’s alzheimer’s is to do an autopsy after she passes away. until then, they use standardized testing. i read somewhere that mri scans show shrinking of the brain with alzheimer’s, more so than regular senile degeneration. while i’m assuming vascular dementia shows less blood flow>>>less circulation from kidney disease or diabetes>>>cognitive functional decline	0

my dad has been really struggling with being my moms primary caregiver. he never had to do much of the child raising and i can tell he’s cracking but am not sure how to help him emotionally. has anyone had success finding a counselor for their parent? he looked for support groups once and then never followed up so i think i’ll need to find someone and give him the push. why kind of counselor has training in this kind of thing. would it be a grief counselor or family counselor? any advice is appreciated my biggest help has been a local alzheimer's group, unless people have experienced it themselves they just don't get it. even just sitting and listening to other people has helped me have some perspective on my own situation. i’m the primary for my mom. i have things covered, but from the outside it might look like i’m holding up way better than i am. you know what i’d absolutely melt for? if i came home from work one day and someone had arranged for my mom to be looked after so that they could take me out to dinner as a thanks for everything. i know there’s no medals for this, and i don’t really expect it, but making time to really acknowledge your dad’s dedication might really mean the world to him. go together with him to a support group or 2, whatever you can find, and folk there likely will know of counsellors / therapists specialising in carer support / grief processing. folk often research for support but then not follow through - if you find when & where & tell him you're going together with him, then that breaks the ice & starts him off. or ask your area alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org, they know for sure. good luck! get his blessings before you take the next step—but my 2¢, select the counsellor, set up an appointment, make sure his 'shift' with mom is covered for the time he'll need, and gently push him out the door with enough time to get there. how to select: if there is a nurse who comes in, then there is some kind of institutional apparatus behind the nurse: hospice, hospital, medi-care/caid… reach out to them for referrals, best kind of counsellor to seek. if not, contact his pcp for a referral. why you need to set wheels in motion: dementia is contagious. caregivers need to remember, sequence, execute millions of adl tasks for self *and* for loved one. lack of self care leads to lack of care for loved one, leads to lack of self-care… vicious cycle. god bless you for caring for the caregiver. my dad was similar, caring for wife & emotionally reserved & struggling with his own issues, and he was a total mess. my dad found a class that he was able to take virtually through the local adult day care center. the class was perfect. the class included video examples, a handout binder broken into sections like 'eating', and a live instructor that was able to answer questions and also curtail some of the winding stories from other classmates. pm me if you want and i can share the local day care details - there may be something similar in your area. i find it almost impossible to be able to join and attend a specific group, but have gotten a lot of great information from this youtube channel, which i can watch anytime it's convenient for me. [www.alz.org](   this will help you find your local alzheimer's chapter. they have group meetings. he needs to attend. set it up for him. get him there. if he's financially stable, then hire an assistant to help out a few days/nights a week. nobody can be a care taker 24/7 and stay sane. ask the nurse for a list of recommended care takers. the nurse or the social worker can provide this. take care. it's a tough job to take care of the dying but even harder when we love them.	0
do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? that’s what i’m struggling with. my family and i can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad i worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. we’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. i am pushing to get it done but the more adamant i am about it, the more i wonder if it’s even the right choice. i have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly i don’t know what to think anymore. thanks in advance for any advice. no; a diagnosis will not affect the disease. what i've had happen, though, is my loved one stopped trying to fake being neurotypical. in a word, she appears like someone with more pronounced dementia than previously. that's while she's around me. we talk about dementia—openly, gently, with respect. having a diagnosis helps me know better how to help her maintain her dignity. helps me learn strategies which would violate norms for neurotypical people, but that have now become helpful—completing her sentences, tying her shoes, asking 'do you understand,' cutting her slack when she can't remember or do something. i've set down my experiences; ymmv. i get you’re worried your dad will feel sadder with a diagnosis, but in my case - my mom knew something was wrong with her, and it upset her not knowing why or what was going on. now that we have a diagnosis, i think it helps her to have an explanation. now when she gets upset because she can’t remember something, i tell her “well mom, it’s because you have alzheimer’s. the alzheimer’s makes you forget.”  it weirdly calms her, i guess because there’s a reason for what’s happening, and knowing what it is in that moment might be helping her confusion. i can tell you from my family’s experience, getting the diagnosis is the right choice. once you have it, you can move forward and get information and help on what to do next. odds are, though, they'll agree it's probably alzheimers. one side note worth mentioning: my mom was also called back for extra testing. at the advice of my bil, an md, my dad asked a lot of questions around what they were looking for specifically, and found out that particular neurologist wanted to enroll my mom in a very expensive drug trial. the extra testing (which my parents would have paid for) only would have shown whether she was a candidate for that trial. so... ask questions. what sort of further testing do they want? neuropsych testing is pretty comprehensive. if his neuropsych testing did not diagnose dementia then he may not have it. severe depression can mimic dementia as well. i experienced something similar to what you describe - i would just say treat it like it’s in your head … at the end of the day, your doing the best you can and make sound judgments while accounting for all evidence. my moms second round of tests showed major decline, enough for the neuro-psych to say “most likely dementia”, and then no follow ups or anything (after a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and small vessel ischemic)  there are times when it seems like a diagnosis makes it worse, mom is relatively lucid and any diagnosis would be perceived by her as straight up gaslighting (hence she refused to see the neuro psych again anyway). but a couple hours later she may think she is in her childhood home and wondering where her parents are …   in sum, i think the diagnosis is critical to get help in the system (i just changed her doctors so she will be more comfortable) - but it may also lead to a lot of crazy fighting (especially if they think they are fine, or constantly forget about the diagnosis). with my one data point, i say no. i have tried changing things up numerous ways to try to manage and try to stay ahead of my wife’s decline. her decline has been a constant steady progression. it seems like every week i noticed a subtle little thing she can’t now do. when she can’t feed herself or use the restroom properly it seems significant, but i see the constant steady decline. staying on a constant schedule of sleep and meds seems to make for much better next days.	0

in december, my father p (m 78) who has stage 6 alzheimers got engaged to be married to his girlfriend of 18 months (f 72) n, who had managed to isolate p from his friends and family and gain control over his finances. in early january, we learned that p & n were meeting p’s longtime accountant and another lawyer to rewrite his will to remove his children and grandchild and give everything he had to n. p had the original will written in 2019 shortly after receiving his diagnosis. although p had failed a capacity test in december and could no longer legally sign his new will or sign his trust fund over to her, he could still get married as the bar is very, very low. despite his severe dementia, p still had many lucid moments and could seem totally fine for short periods. if p signed a marriage certificate, n would have legal control over his health decisions. it would also give her the cover she needed to drain away his financial resources in secrecy, a process she began even before the big day by redirecting the pension payments he received into a bank account she controlled. all n had to do is move him somewhere away from his meddling kids and take away his phone and he would be effectively incommunicado. something had to be done. scammers preying on the elderly in their community was nothing new to them. p’s friends and fam began to plan an intervention over zoom. the idea was that his younger son j (m 51) &  daughter in law s (f 52) would go over to p's house, surprise p with a meeting with all of his friends who would then confront him about their concerns about n and her diabolical plan. after that, j would show p the evidence that they had learned from the background check that n was a lonely hearts romance scammer who had already been convicted of fraud years ago and had lied to him about her own financial situation, telling him she was “loaded” and did not need his money, despite having a huge tax lien on her house. they would also show p a [checklist ]( abusive behaviors to try to get him to see how terribly she was treating him. once he was convinced, they would call the locksmith to have the locks changed, help him pack up his stuff, and drive off to a prearranged airbnb out of state. we also worried she may become physically abusive if he resisted her. early on we had learned that n had quite a temper which worsened when she drank. what would she do if she learned her golden goose was going to break their engagement? timing was everything here. thankfully, p's caregivers gave us a heads up that n was out of town that weekend and that she would not see him until she returned on tuesday. j set the intervention for monday. he said he had no plans to marry n (n wanted this kept secret!) about an hour later i received a text from my sister-in-law reading: on our way to arizona with p!! it would be a difficult situation for any person to realize they wanted to break up with a partner and take the necessary actions to do this, but for someone with dementia they may well be helpless. the other thing we found was that p’s dementia was much much worse than we had known or suspected, despite the increasingly dire caregiver reports. since our contact with him was increasingly limited to short visits and conversations after n arrived on the scene, we had not been able to grasp the severe decline in his memory and communication skills. n took advantage of p’s confusion over his own condition to convince him that he only had mci (moderate cognitive impairment - his initial diagnosis), which was vital in constructing a reality where she was simply marrying a man she loved and who loved her, instead of financially abusing someone dying of a neurodegenerative disorder. on the drive to the airbnb, j reported p had become incoherent after nightfall and kept asking them who they were and where they were going. they learned they needed to keep him out of the kitchen as he would wander around and touch all the knives and even play with the oven burners. it became clear they needed to get him into a care facility as soon as possible before p could endanger himself. thankfully, even at his worst behavior, he continued to be a very sweet and loving person towards j & s.   it would take about a month to get p examined by his doc and admitted into care. until then, they had to keep a very active senior safe and happy in a relatively small space, arrange for a high quality yet affordable memory care, reconstruct p’s finances after n put them under her control and then trashed them, clean out p’s condo and arrange for sale, and do a ft wfh job. first, a man claiming to be a local police officer called asking if p was with j and could they speak to him? j: how could we trust you with p? the sheriffs were standing in front of j's door (they not home) and wanted entrance and to speak with p to verify his condition. we appreciate the supportive comments. wow, what a saga, and terrifying to realize there are people out there who will do this sort of thing. thank you for sharing, and so glad your father is in a better place! so sorry this happened but elated that you were able to rescue p!	0
my dad became unwell yesterday - very high temp, extremely confused, unresponsive at times, unable to walk. i called the gp who triaged over the phone and advised we call an ambulance as dad was deteriorating and needed hospital care. after 6 hours we called again and were told it would be several more hours. my parents live in a flat and we couldn't get dad up from the sofa, let alone down two flights of stairs in order to take him in ourselves. this morning i called the gp back in tears. he came to do a home visit and has decided that dad is ok to stay home under the care of the community team as his condition is improving. i'm relieved that dad seems to be better today but absolutely appalled. i work in the nhs but i've lost all faith that there's any support. so glad yr dad is better now, i hope he continues to improve. it's shocking that they never even came, must have been very stressful, i feel for you! we have ambo ramping problem here in australia, it's terrible. where are you? i hope you don't encounter this problem again. best of luck! big respect to you working for the nhs. both i and my grandma appreciate all the hard work you do.	0
i hope you’re all doing well. we are helpmate, a company run by phd and master's students with a mission to help caregivers and people living with dementia navigate their post-diagnosis journey. **   currently we are gathering expressions of interest for our free pilot cohort-based program which aims to educate and upskill caregivers. the program will run for 4-weeks, comprising of a live session each week led by a specialist in the dementia space (gp, occupational therapist, nutritionist, nurse consultant, neuropsychologist) as well as hearing stories from people living with dementia and their caregivers. we are currently looking to start this inaugural cohort in late april/early may. **are you interested? **   if you are a caregiver and are interested in being part of a tight-knit community of caregivers and want to upskill yourself, please fill in the form below and we will be in touch! **   our team has been navigating this space for months. we have spoken to over 50 different people including caregivers, people living with dementia, loved ones, clinicians, and academics and one thing was very clear to the team. we believe the dementia space lacks a medium for many new and existing families to learn about how to adapt to their new situation. it was also evident that for many families trying to find specific information for their situation, this can also be very difficult as dementia is different for every single person and family. we hope to offer caregivers and their loved ones access to necessary information and surround them with a community of people who share their journey, with our cohort-based program.	0
my grandmother has been living alone for about 2 years and at that time more things have had happened that wad worrying as such. ashe has gone away for 2 times already in which my father just bought an gps tracker for her so that she wont go again. after this my dad was much more worried about my grandma, and made her stay here by lying to my grandma that she needs to wait for my uncle. in the first few weeks it was fine and my uncle was able to come to our home again and again, but then in the fourth week or so my uncle left to go to america since he lives there nowadays. this time it was different, it was today where she went out of our house and tried to go to her home. right now my grandma is arguing with my dad on trying to go home, she just wants to go home and me and my mom are very stressed about this situation because it is very irritating and since my mom is a baker, she always gets in the home. and my dad has had enough and had a mental breakdown about my grandma and surprisingly my grandma was fine about it and said sorry afterwards. what do i do in this situation? i desperately need help because it is very stressing for my entire family and my mom wants to leave and rent an apartment somewhere so that she can work in a nice enviroment. does your grandma have memory issues? can someone move in with her so she can be at her house? if she really can’t live alone and she likes to bake, maybe try baking with her so she is supervised. i am sorry i can’t be of much help. i have more questions than answers. i assume your grandmother has alzheimer's disease or something similar. there is a point where someone with that condition cannot live alone. from what you described, she could be at that point. i don't know where you live, but you could see if your local community has any daycare programs for someone like your grandmother. then show your parents the options. you could read with her or do crafts with her while your mom is trying to get something else done.	0
my grandma has alzheimer’s and she can barely see/hear so she “entertains herself” by scratching and fidgeting with her nails. does anyone know of a fidget toy or ring or something that would be good for her? i googled fidget toys for adults but i’m wondering if anyone has experience with this and can recommend a product the person liked to use. we have the same issue with my mom and the best thing that works are these plastic shapes that i brought which you thread laces through..i have no idea what you would call them but i found them on amazon, i think they are for kids to learn how to lace things up.. basically it's a flat 2d shape with holes in and my mom threads shoe laces through..she can sit for hours doing them, it seems to really relax her too. hope this helps my dad gets a lot of use out of the [playschool fidget cube]( he now tends to put things in his mouth so the smaller fidget toys aren't safe. we also got him some of those silicon bubble pop things. those fidget blankets don't hold his attention because he thinks it's just a blanket. any catalog we got in we would give to him, until he started tearing it and eating the paper. so the toddler toys have been great etsy has a lot of fidget toys made specifically dementia sufferers. the dots can be picked off like scabs. my mil likes to play with pop-its. i think this a good tactile activity for your grandma who can't see very well. it's like an easy and reusable version of bubble wrap. hope it helps! lap blankets, fidget muff. the dollar tree has pop it’s and such for cheap that you can try. does see like animals or babies? try a baby doll or they have animals that meow and pure that might help my wife has a little pillow with rings, and velcro straps and other little things to manipulate. latest thing she likes is a stuffed dog.	0
my friend is in memory care. they would also constantly confabulate or retell the same story. his only story is 'going to get a car today'. both times his face went back to normal as soon as i started talking again. any thoughts would be well appreciated. he just happened to be a resident in the same facility, so i visit both. could be lewy-body dementia. lewy-body has attributes that are very similar to parkinson's. my mother had this and would often look surprised or almost in shock of things.	0
it's been a rough couple of weeks with my mom (64 f). the week before last, she was stuck at home with me because she developed a skin infection on her butt from her nighttime fecal incontinence, and couldn't go to daycare because they wouldn't administer the medication she needed to treat it. on thursday this past week, daycare called me to let me know that my mom was having a really difficult time and complaining of pain in her legs, crying more than usual and just not herself. 'okay,' i thought, i'll take her to urgent care when i pick her up. well, when i picked her up that day, they came out with three bags of clothes saying that she peed through her clothes i sent her in, her spare clothes, and walked out wearing pants that were loaners. the problem there was, she had not been exhibiting any uti symptoms at home. urgent care ended up not being an option because they all need appointments, and the only clinic that takes walk ins is closed now for the foreseeable future after an electrical fire that happened the week we were there for her skin infection. they got her triaged and we waited in the waiting room for a couple of hours before she started sundowning and just would not stop crying over every little thing. the sundowning actually ended up saving us, because we were able to get her into a bed faster, and who knows how long we would have continued to wait if i didn't bring it up. so we get her into the room, they cath her and say she has the cleanest sample they've seen in awhile, no uti. the pain is so difficult to help her with, because in the previous occasions i've had her seen for pain, it's really hard to pinpoint what's real and what's phantom, and then usually she's fine, but something does seem to be off. she screams as if i'm going to kill her when i try to swing her legs out to get her out of bed, or when i need to try and get her to sit up straight in bed, rather than hunched over to her right, or straining her neck, which will actually end up hurting her. anyway, the er doctor was really sweet and talking to me about life with her as it is now, and suggested looking into getting a hospice referral from her pcp. hospice had been suggested to me by a family friend, and that my mom doesn't actually have to be knocking on death's door, that we may be able to get the extra help just for comfort care. after the past two weeks, i feel like maybe these smaller conditions have just progressed her alzheimer's further, and it might just be the disease pushing her into a new stage (she's already progressed so fast this past year, and has been settled in moderate to severe over mild since after she moved in with me last february). i kept mom home with me on friday just because we were up way later than she's used to while at the er for hours, and i wanted to make sure she got some rest. well, friday morning after she woke up, she was really unsteady and unbalanced when trying to get her into the bathroom to change her, and she fell. i could not get her to understand how i needed her to help me help her get up. when she was a caregiver for a man with alzheimer's before she developed her own symptoms, the man she cared for fell all the time (not hard falls, usually he'd slip out of his recliner), and my mom could never get him up. the man's daughter told my mom she just had to call 911 each time he fell to have ems come pick him back up. it got to the point that ems told my mom that if she called one more time, she'd be reported for elder abuse and negligence. so imagine my immense dilemma when trying to decide if i needed to do the same. i did though, the guys who came were all great, and they were in and out in less than 10 minutes. but now i completely understand why my mom needed the extra help with the man she cared for. i'm thinking hospice might definitely be something i want to look into, but i was hoping to get any perspective from those of you who may have had similar experiences with hospice. any input, general information i might not know, suggestions or advice you may be able to offer would be really helpful! i'm also looking now into either a rollator or a wheelchair for her at this point, because the last thing i need is her falling at home, but also when we're not at home or she's at daycare. that's also kind of difficult to reconcile, because if she is at the point where she's not going to walk anymore, it's just going to make caring for her until i can get her into memory care, 10x more difficult, and it means that she is becoming further and further from who she used to be. i'm just going to share my experience with my dad, alzheimer's and hospice. we had moved my dad in to memory care february 2021. in september, my dad started having some aggression issues and violent outbursts. we tried really hard to get a geriatric psych eval but nobody was open due to covid. by late october, his facility told us we needed to find him a new place. unfortunately nowhere in the entire state would consider taking a man with 'behaviors'. we began looking out of state. i had been asking about hospice for a couple months and they finally agreed he should be evaluated for it. they told me in order to qualify for hospice, they have to have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. hospice came the following day to evaluate my dad and decided he qualified. they started him on dilaudid. we finally found him a new facility that would take him and very fortunately it was just a few miles down the road. we moved him in and the new place seemed great and much better equipped to handle my dad. i visited him a few times and they had a family thanksgiving gathering. my dad passed the day after thanksgiving and caught even hospice off-guard. i got a call that they thought he was transitioning to actively dying but i didn't need to rush down. 20 minutes later i got a call back to say that he'd passed. my dad was on hospice just under a month before he passed. it's worth an ask. their job is to help your mom feel better and be comfortable. i'll be thinking about you, op. geriatric social worker here. if your mom qualifies for hospice, go for it. get the care. get the nurse visits. get the social worker visits. get the chaplain and the art therapy and the volunteers and the pet therapy. welcome them to your home. in 6 months, if she qualifies again, awesome. if she doesn’t, you’ll have all these people from that hospice who know you and your mom who will be able to make recommendations on what to do next. i work in a nursing home and one of the biggest misconceptions about hospice is that the patient needs to be “knocking on deaths door.”  they don’t! instead of getting help and care and support, the family puts it off until the person is literally dying, and then they have all these hospice strangers trampling in to help, which is weird and awkward when the family just wants to be with their mom. emt here. if you can’t pick her up without help, we will happily help you. we understand that the disease puts her more at risk for falls. you are one person, you can only do so much. if it does get to the point where we are being called too often, we won’t threaten you. we will have a conversation to make sure you can find the appropriate resources for your mom. thanks for sharing, sorry i don't really have anything concrete to add. i've read plenty of people's stories where they put their loved ones into a facility that specializes with memory care. do you have something like that in your vicinity? essentially, if you aren't capable of taking care of her yourself, you should think about it to lighten your load. where i'm from, we pretty much only have one hospice in the whole country (less than 2 mil pop though), but it's very much for actually dying people, mostly cancer. most elderly homes offer extra care for people with dementia (basically the more help you need, the more it costs). your story made me realize i need to take care of some holding bars around the bathroom for grandma asap. listen when it comes to dementia, there is no real downside to hospice. you get more support, and there aren't any medications you really cut, not the same way as cancer meds. my grandmother was in a similar way after she broke her hip. we got her signed onto hospice in mid-jan. she was still up and walking around, with a lot of help (lifting up onto feet with gait belt, one person in front and behind, and a walker). even as we got her out of bed and worked harder at the heavy lifting trying to 'exercise', she eventually was not able to take a step from standing, then could put her feet flat on the floor. we absolutely would not have been able to handle these fast drastic changes without the support of hospice. everyone says, they wish they started it sooner. i recently found out that people with dementia are eligible for hospice at a certain point, because it is a terminal illness-it does not necessarily mean they are close to death. they are another pair of hands (and heart) to care for your loved one and take a little pressure off of you. they have a lot of experience, give great advice, and are not only there to care for the physical/emotional needs of your loved one with dementia, they are also there to care for the needs of family members. it’s a great program, i can’t recommend it enough. best of luck. from what i understand a doc has to be the one to sign off on her being eligible for hospice care. they do it based on a reasonable expectation that the person has 6 months or less to live. my dad ended being on it for many years. when he got hospice care it was very helpful. he got a medical bed to help him sit up, wheelchair and other medical equip to help keep him clean. also nice to have access to home nursing. just because mom is eligible doesn't mean you have to use hospice. you can also pull her out at any time, and to put her back on it, the doc just has to approve, which im told is easy to get. i would 100% look into this. leave it up to doc to decide, and tell them everything. if she is eligible, id definitely look into all the options for starting up.	0
my grandmother is in her final stage of alzheimer’s disease. she hardly moves and is bedridden. her nurse sent a picture of her legs with mottling creeping up from her feet - said she would probably be with us for another two days. my mom, my husband, and i went to go see her. my mom sees her frequently, but this is the first time i’ve seen her since january. after my husband and i got home, my mom calls saying she checked grandma’s legs and the colors has gone away. has anyone experienced this with their loved one? yes, and unfortunately it may last much longer than 2 days....try 2 years unless of course the nursing home is planning on 'helping along the transition process.' my mom is 87 and has had dementia since at least early 2006 and is now at stage 7 for over 5 years. she started to develop bedsores last summer until we got a hospital bed, and the in home care nurse helped treat and heal her wounds.	0
my dad has been in assisted living for a short while now, and that is going great. the problem is everything else that remains. my sister and i need to prepare his house and its contents for auction/sale. of course, there are some things we both want in the house, and there are the feelings i have to wrangle with of “should i keep this or not?” it’s like dealing with someone’s house after they have died. i’m overwhelmed. i just want to get this task over with and move on, but it feels like there’s so much to do. i live three hours away and have my own family, so it feels like an impossible task. i suppose i’m just venting. did the same with my mothers house. if it has no real sentimental value and i mean “no real” do not keep it. set up 3 areas of a room. make a keep pile, a sell pile (estate sale, let go, etc), and a donate pile. the donation pile helped a lot with making decisions on things because i knew at least someone else could use it and it would do some good. once you start going you will be surprised how little you will keep and how fast the process moves. it helps. i still have boxes of my mom's things even though we emptied her house years ago and she passed away in december. i'm stuck with things that i don't want, but i know she cherished them. i'm in the same boat and totally feel you. we just put my dad in memory care a couple weeks ago and i'm so stressed about his house and all the crap he (and my mom) accumulated over the years. there are so many and i don't want all of them but i feel so guilty throwing them away. there are people who, for a fee, will go through all that stuff and hold an estate sale. that might not be the avenue you choose, but be aware that it exists. a senior center or local realtor could probably put you in touch with one. others have commented on the keep/toss/donate strategy. i've done that too, it's just that there's so much! my approach to big chores is break it down into manageable increments and keep going back to it when possible. since you live 3 hours away, you might put a couple cartons in your car with every trip and work on decisions from your home base. right where i am, too. my dad went into a facility two weeks ago. the kicker is we got a practice run. my dad had been keeping his dad's house for 15+ years his death. was 'cleaning it out' on his monthly and then twice-yearly trips across a couple states. last april, i saw my dad's condition and knew we had to get this house sold, so i got my brother and my dad on board (my dad was a bit resistant but knew deep down he couldn't hold onto the house forever) and planned a four-day trip to 'finish cleaning the house out.' had a realtor all set up. when i arrived it looked exactly the same as i remembered last time i visited like 10 years ago. some items cleaned, but mostly still a fully-crammed house full of stuff. we spent those four days frantically tossing, donating, and packing what we wanted to keep to take back home. packed a 40-yard dumpster to its gills. did a lot of emotional work with my dad trying to get rid of some stuff or get him to realize he has to take things back to his house. now it almost feels easier this time around because i'm practiced and he is not there to have to guide through things. it certainly helps me to read about how other families deal with this. my sister overpaid a cleaning/estate sale service to go thru our parents' house for us. we walked through together (i brought my best friend for moral support) and removed things we wanted. it's easy for us because i live in a different country, that limited what i could take home. i did have to sacrifice some small items to her crazy, and ultimately my friend just started putting some of my mom's knickknacks straight into her purse (my mom is still alive and now in assisted living) so my sister wouldn't keep them. my mom just put those things in a drawer so who knows if it was worth the subterfuge. be thankful you have a someone to help, i had to do this alone. although, i did not have the added “i want that” headache with a sibling. i started by doing many many runs to goodwill but just ended up getting a dumpster. i felt bad about trashing useful items, but it would have taken weeks and no charity would pick up. an estate sale would have ended up costing more than the dumpster since i, of course, kept anything of value. but, i don’t want to freak you out or anything, the house clearing was the easiest part of my alzheimer’s caregiving experience. that is something that could be done and accomplished. i'm in the same, same, same situation ahhh  i'm in front of his new home now, texting my sister, about to check in, thinking about how in a week ill be on the floor of his house hours away going through boxes. and my sister is no help 😤 (her having a new baby and also being in another part of the country is a pretty good excuse though)  you and i and all of us will get through this, because our parents would have if they were in our position i hired a junk removal service and moved the sentimental/valuables to a storage unit. hired a relator and got that baby sold. you’ll feel so much better when it’s done and you’ll hopefully have some profit from the sale to be able to to help fund assisted living facility costs. to me it feels like a violation of their property, since my mother is still living in nursing care. it took me a while to even go there and have a look at what needed doing. if it wasn't for my daughters i would still be stuck. i opened a shed door yesterday and just stood there crying. why did they keep so much junk? we have one room to put all the household items in for sale as we go through each room, cupboard drawer methodically. we will hold a garage sale to get rid of what we can, use fb marketplace for any items left and then call a charity to bring their truck. my biggest problem is getting rid of the clothes. all the donation bins are still full most of the time thanks to the great ovid cleanout everyone seems to have had, and the charity shops no longer want things. if worse comes to worse it will have to go to landfill but i would rather not have to do that. when my grandpa died (of cancer), i did most of the cleaning. keep some clothes you can wear, that's my favourite memento, because i actually use it often (kept a couple of shirts). i have a garage full of stuff i can't part with. maybe we should switch houses and clean each other's parents' stuff. i think i just created a new reality show. my brothers and i will likely be having to do this too in the near future and i dread it, i can see how you would be overwhelmed.	0
my moms pretty bad off and believes that my dad who has heart issues ran off to die because he didn’t want her to find him. she also thinks the man taking care of her is her best friend mj. my dad has never left her side and i know it’s killing inside. is there anything we can do to help her kinda snap out of it or is it all just down hill from here? 'hi, i'm [name], your husband of x years.' also maybe a 'loving couple' photo portrait in her line of sight, his arm around her or some affectionate pose?	0

my mom has been diagnosed and lived with alzheimer for 4 years. her condition now is really bad and she doesnt have any common sense and manner at all, she can hardly be concious at things and even if i call her mutiple times she wont reply. but lately my brothers turned some sort of buddhism audio for her at night while she slept, i'm an atheist so i dont care about much but then he had to stop because my dad didn't want to involve in religious stuffs (yeah that's audio was kinda spooky for real). after  a few days, one night, it was like 1 am or something, i heard she was mumbling, normally when my mom sleeps, she has somniloquy so i just think that she is sleep talking but then i came closer i realised that she woke up and looked just like the first stage of alzheimer. she remembered me, remembered normal manners, remembered how to calculate and i asked her to sign her name-which she normally can't do, she did, of course sometimes she still mistook things but i surprised that she was concious and looked normal. but when she be able to read the clock and tell the time, she had to sleep and i was kinda afraid that if she sleep, things would be back to normal, and they sure were. have anyone met this situation before?????? yes have had a relatively similar experience. one night i was stepping in for my brother and his partner so they could go out. this was way past the time of her realizing she was sick - it was really shocking. looking back in it i’m glad it happened, it was a nice interaction and i haven’t had a good one since really. it's pretty common, i think. wow! music certainly is a great therapy, especially classical music like beethoven, so it’s worth while to explore different musical genres. i’ve seen these “moments of clarity” over my several years of being a caregiver, and it’s quite spectacular to witness. but people should tame their hopes and expectations that these moments can be repeated and/or extended. continued socialization, music, dietary changes, etc, can all contribute to reducing or slowly down the effects of the disease. how amazing! that must have been nice to have your mom back for a bit. here’s a buddhist rhythm to try. my grandma with alzheimer’s would always respond when i played guitar or chanted this mantra  reminiscing is vital.	0

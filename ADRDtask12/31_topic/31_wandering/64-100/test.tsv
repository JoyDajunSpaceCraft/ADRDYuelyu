fil is in al but not memory care, so he can come and go. i am worried that he’ll over do it and not be able to make it back home and get stranded. he wears a medical alert necklace 24/7 but it doesn’t have a gps locate so i was thinking about adding an air tag with the kind of water resistant cover you use for dog tags. thoughts? now is the time to start prevention measures so that he does not get lost. often seniors that go missing are in early stages. this is when they are most ambulatory and can easily get confused. just last week a lady where i live was still driving and went missing. she was in the early stages and her family was still letting her drive. my mom thought it was ok to let my dad drive shortly after he was diagnosed and he went the wrong way down a street. i put my foot down and said no more driving. my mother's assisted living facility had a system just for this phase of dementia. she wore a bracelet that triggered an alarm if she attempted to through any of the exterior doors. of course, it was an added option that i begrudgingly paid, but it worked quite well. my mother could do anything she liked within the facility (including interior courtyards) but had to have an escort if she left the building. i'm actually surprised your facility is allowing someone with alzheimer's (albeit in the early phases) to be in assisted living without some sort of safeguard. i tried airtags with my kids. it's ok but doesn't give you minute-by-minute updates. it works great if they go to a friend's house after school, but near useless at an amusement park as it doesn't update frequently enough. if your fil got lost, the airtag may tell you where he was 1 minute ago or 30 minutes ago. i am in a similar situation. i use find my friends on my mom’s phone to track her. you can add alerts for when they leave certain places, are not at certain places etc. of course only works if they have their phone on them. i also track her vehicle’s gps. we considered the air tag but being an apple user myself, id have to swap between her apple id and mine to see it which would get difficult. tile is another one you can use, but it does emit a sound when trying to track which could be startling. there’s a lot of ways to track and drawbacks to each. as long as you find one that’s reliable and works for you, all the better. keeping them safe is top priority. i guess he doesn't take a mobile phone around with him? if so there are apps like life360 that will give you tracking at all times. i haven't used apple air tags but have heard stories about how they helped people retrieve their stolen bikes pretty well so its worth investigating. how could you guarantee he always had it with him? &nbsp;   check out these little spark nano gps trackers. they are super inexpensive. my sis got them for her teen's car a while back and really liked it. we'll most likely be getting one for mom soon-ish. i have an airtag for my hubby. (about stage 5-6) i have an iphone as does our three children. the airtag  is assigned to my iphone and shows up on the apple find my ap under the “items” tab. i have activated the “share my location” option on my phone with each of my kids. they can see where my hubby and i are. this is a safety support for both of us. i put the airtag inside hubs wallet as he always puts his wallet in his pants and i secured in place with double sided tape. this has worked well for us.	1
i stumbled on this 1-hour documentary this weekend and wanted to  share with you all. it's a former cnn reporter who is now in her 80s and  has the apoe-e4 gene and wanted to know how likely she is to get  the disease.	0
but for the past year or so like clockwork around 8pm he wants to go home and it takes around an hour or more to make him 'stop' and be content and stay. man it's so taxing. i mean he has incontinence bowel and urinary so i take care of that, and all the other stuff that comes with the territory no problem but this constant 'goin home' gets me.. we have several different techniques that work with my dad:  the obvious one i take him home, we are lucky that we can leave town drive a short distance and reenter town on a different road. when he says home he means bed (especially at night) so mum takes him up to their room and he settles. a dog walk around the block, again exiting their estate on one road and reentering on a different road to break the cycle. obviously some of these won't fit your situation but please ask any questions and i will try my best to help. sometimes it means they want to go back to when they weren't sick. i'd grab his hand or hug him (to reassure him) and say something like 'ok, we'll head home after we x (insert activity here)'. my grandmother always wants to start the i don’t know why they brought me here conversation. usually she veers back off topic with the questions i’m asking her and forgets the original complaint. it doesn’t make it any less irritating, but it calms her down when i give her the options. my mom does the same thing, but she is already bedridden. i will just say 'we're here,' and mention the name of community we live in, but in our case it's the same house for 50 years, but sometimes she still mentions europe where she grew up and asks for her mom who also passed 45 years ago. you might have to say something and reference the name of community he is talking about if it's not the home you are at now. it's like a switch in atmosphere, and most patients with alzheimer's respond pleasurably to music; it's an area of the brain that remains functional longer than others. it helps distract them and change their focus from 'home' to the music. i like u/kitkatinkerbell's suggestions and have used some of the same techniques when helping my sil care for my brother, especially 'taking him home' by getting in the car, riding several miles and returning, saying 'we're home!' i admire you so much for caring for your dad! that's such a loving, caring way to honor your father. ...in the day- to-day struggle, i know how much of a strain it can be, how much stress and fatigue you must be feeling. i hope you're finding support with other caregivers who understand your challenges, and i hope you have family or others who can offer relief for you so you can get the rest you need. bless you! cheers to all the hard work you have done to take care of him! since it is always happening at the same time, it may be from a long forgotten routine from years back. try to engage and ask if there is someone they want to see at home, or is there something they need to do? or if they just want to be at home. it may be physical, sensory ,(is it too loud, too quiet? hth	0
he'll take money out, then forget that he took money out and then take more out. (you shouldn't even be driving himself to the bank where the atm. we do the best weekend to stop him but it's not easy to keep track of him 24/7)  he gets a state issue disability check every month. and our mortgage payments are set to automatically withdraw from his account. always has been. takes out 400 to 600 a month to buy pot. in the comments section of a different post someone suggested contacting social services about having his check split between him and someone else. something about how his bank has an overdraft thing. which means social services can't give him a certain amount of money knowing that it's only going to pay off the negative balance and then he won't have any left. i hope i'm explaining this right. i hope i'm making sense. we were trying to ask them to put $400 into his account as an allowance. and then put the rest of it into my mother's account. but because his account's always in the negative, they wouldn't do it. could we ask the bank to cancel the overdraft service? i know typically no one else can make changes to a bank account without the account holder there. but if we explain the medical situation, and we're not asking to take any money from him. or if we had some kind of doctor's note explaining he's incompetent, could we then take that to the bank and put my mom's name on his account as well? sorry if this is long and rambling. the various things you want to do would require him giving you durable poa (legal, business things). i take it you haven't had that discussion yet? what is your mom's role here? if your dad has been diagnosed with alzheimer's, he shouldn't be driving. it would be good if somehow the topic of diminishing capacity could be broached, or you have many large fights ahead of you. cut up his cards with scissors, take his tires off and roll them to a friend's house. seriously, he could kill someone driving. get serious. my dad used to do something similar. he was taking out cash every week because he only understood cash as really money any more. at one point the bank wouldn't even let him take out as much as he wanted. not sure if they were really allowed to do that... but they were aware of his issues. his car got taken away soon after that so i would have to take him to the bank. does he have a poa or anything in place? if not do it now while he's still somewhat with it. i used to have to drag my dad to the bank because he has a trust which makes everything a pain. he would just sit there and smile while i did everything for him. the bank was aware of the situation and was pretty nice about it. i think they're used to elderly customers having issues and in the end if it's a good bank they want to do what is best for their customer. you need power of attorney and to prevent him from getting to the assets in the first place. absolutely file for that asap. explain the situations to his doctors - they may not realize he’s as far gone as he is. you may also need to switch doctors and see someone who can properly evaluate him, because that is exactly why power of attorney was invented. to address situations like this. absence an incompetence hearing, and judgment, you need his signature for poa. you get it set up first, and then take him to the lawyer or whoever can do it for you, in our case, it was the bank. i don't know where you live, but cannabis is one of the most beneficial treatments for alzheimer's patients. far better and safer than anti-psychotic drugs. unfortunately, when it comes time for a care facility, that will not be available to him. that's my opinion and my experience. here's a good article :   move up the day that the money is taken out of the bank so it doesn’t sit there. speak to the branch manager about removing the overdraft protection.	0
short version (i can add info if needed), my fil is stage 4 dementia. roommate almost died and is still recovering. family member who was helping lost her husband. i am the legal guardian and i made arrangements for fil to go into assisted living. he can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it). he initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind. the problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available. the reasons he gives for wanting to leave al are not grounded in reality. he’s not progressed enough for memory care, but al is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will. i keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there i don’t know what to do with him. see if you can visit the place a few times and tell him he lives there and you will be back to move his things there. maybe you and the al social worker could sit down with him and go over all his concerns. additionally, you need to remind him it's not as simple as going back to his old house, because it's rented out to someone else, and the roommate/caregiver is no longer available to help him with day to day affairs. explore options - maybe he would prefer a different al placement? you and the social worker can also go over some of his deluded beliefs (don't call them that in front of him!). show him where the eye drops are, and ask if he'd like someone to administer them to him. my dh who i am trying to put into memory care at present, has had similar delusions. and when he has lost a wallet by leaving it somewhere, he states that someone 'stole' it. he can't locate most of the things he needs (constantly losing toothbrushes). good of you to look out for this man. my dad is in memory care and went through a similarly tough patch where he was paranoid, angry, argumentative, and distrustful. he worried about people taking his car and money (this included my mom, who he said his lawyer would be contacted, because she needed to get out of his house.) this passed after time, but it was a tough roughly 2 years. keep your fil a little more comfortable by finding lies that will calm him down. i'm constantly saying this to my mother during every conversation i have with her and she's been in memory care for almost a year. now that she is settled (she still isn't happy about it), she fears change and when i bring up finding a new facility for her, the thought of changing her routine scares her and she stops complaining (for a little while)  i was staunchly against medicating my mother for behavioral reasons because i didn't want to lose what little was left of her inside. move him, medicate him one thing i did with my dad is tell him we found him “an apartment with help” that was just a home base for him. i drove back there with him in my car, and when he saw the building, he said, “that’s a bad place.” i parked and he asked, “what are we doing here?” i said, “i need to speak to the lady at the front desk.” “should i stay in the car?” “no, come with me, i said.” he came with me, i checked us both in, walked him to his room, and we said goodbye like everything was fine. also, if he’s paranoid he may not want to take additional medications, but if he’s already taking medications, you could speak to his doctor about adding something for his mood (assuming you have medical poa?). that has helped my dad. good luck! my husband and sil try to logic her out of these delusions with evidence. she refuses to discuss assisted living and lives in the same town as sil. they check on her a few times a week, and my husband will stay with her 2-4 weeks at a time. (we are in another state) the other 2 siblings are no help. (she was also not the nicest person in younger years so they see her 1-2 times a year out of duty.) if he is a danger to himself, you can gain power of attorney and guardianship. my grandmother had moved al twice and both times she has gone through a phase of this when she first moved in. it went on months the first time, but she had progressed by the second move and it lasted a few weeks.	0
my grandfather has alzheimer’s (or possibly dementia) and is in full care by my grandmother (who admittedly is not the best with pushing for better medical care or testing from doctors). this morning he had an episode where he was laying down in bed, seemingly awake (eyes open and moving) but unresponsive to her calling him, touching him, etc. they took vitals and said that he was all good in that are and my grandfather refused to go to the hospital so they didn’t push it and left. my grandmother took him to his regular doctor today and said that it was just another stage of his decline. i am still concerned that it could be something else because i have never heard of it. i am the first point of contact for them but i am living out of state and trying to do my best from afar. does anyone have any experience with this? or can provide any more insight on what i should be doing next time i am there? my mom had a few episodes like this before we knew she had actual alzheimer’s. i actually think they co tributes to quicker cognitive decline, but the doctors always tested for stroke and other things and said they couldn’t find anything. i do believe it is a form of stroke, maybe medicine just hasn’t caught up with it yet.	0
my dad has been in memory care for a couple of months now. recently he had backpain and wouldn't leave his chair. so they sent him to the hospital to be checked on. they didn't find a source of the backpain (which seemed to go away on its own) but they did find blood clots in the lungs (blood thinners prescribed) and he was dehydrated so they pumped him with liquid. he was in bed for 3 or so days. when i came to pick him up from the hospital he couldn't walk. i was really annoyed that the hospital wasn't helpful in that regard, but i chalked it up to his feet being swollen from the fluids. with a lot of effort we finally managed to get him in the car, and back to the home. so i called today to see how he's doing and they said not great and that he's not walking on his own. apparently they can get him upright with assistance but he can't walk. the memory care doctor will be seeing him tomorrow so i know i just need to sit tight and not karen until then, but i'm just so frustrated. dr. google is telling me older people lose that function a lot faster after bed rest, but it just blows my mind. it’s not uncommon for this to happen after a hospital visit, but it’s dependent on a lot of factors. previous conditions obviously contribute but it could just be the new phase he is entering. or could it pass in the following week, as this happens too. the doctor should be able to determine what’s going on. i know edema causes a lot of issues with this population’s mobility, but exercise and compression socks can help fix that; a pt or ot could be suggested as well. i’d say wait to hear what the doctors says. keep us posted. look into massage. it helps my husband with his arthritic spine. medicare covers it under certain conditions, which includes chronic back pain. also, if your patient has been hospitalized for three days, medicare covers 100% of a nursing home stay as long as discharged directly from hospital to nursing home. (check your insurance but we recently did this.) if you can't swing that, maybe physical therapy. good luck. i had a similar experience with my mom. within a few days of moving into memory care she had several falls and then could no longer walk. that was right around new years and she has not walked since. sorry to say this was the beginning of the end for my grandmother. the muscles deteriorate fast and ingrained muscle memory that is not exercised for a couple days evaporates. remember that alzheimer’s attacks the brain’s ability to make conscious choices first. the decision of lifting your foot to step; planting it firmly, feeling confident enough on the first foot’s ability to bear weight 100% for a moment, that you lift the other… this is where she got frustrated and yelled. we tried asking her sweetly to let us help and she yelled and refused for hours.	0
hey guys. my father-in-law is under 60 years old and was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. my mother-in-law had always said that she would like to put him in a secure safe assisted-living facility if/when he starts to get violent or too difficult to deal with. well, now it is “well he didn’t mean to hit me, he thought i was the dog” or “he isn’t going to hit me. he’s just making those motions with his fists.”  let me preface this by saying she has “read all the books“ and she even leads an alzheimer’s support group. i know she knows what she’s doing but i think her judgment is clouded because it is her husband. she is not admitting to her kids the full extent of what she has to deal with on a daily basis. she’s not in denial about the fact of the disease is progressive, and that eventually he will be beyond her capacity to help, but i don’t think she is ready to admit that he is far beyond that point. she wants to have kids and grandkids over but also does not want her husband to be upset and stressed and angry. her kids legitimately had to have a meeting with her to convince her to get help just two times a week with an outside service that can come and give her a break. the hardest part is that she has told me that she doesn’t want to put him in a home because it will make her feel guilty. i know it is hard for me to understand because it is not my husband, but it is so hard to watch her lose control of him and have to take care of him or take him for drives when she really wants to spend time with her children and grandchildren. are we being insensitive in thinking that he is more than ready to be in a secure facility? how do we navigate the conversation that she no longer has the capabilities as one woman to care for a 6 foot 200 pound relatively healthy otherwise man with early onset alzheimer’s? side note: the facility has an excellent reputation and we have family that works there. any guidance or suggestions would be appreciated. there's a saying that by the time a family is ready to consider placing someone in assisted living what they need is memory care. for many people with dementia getting medication right can help a lot with agitation and violence, too, and it doesn't sound like there's a geriatric psychiatrist in the mix. it's definitely worth consulting one. and on a practical note, is it clear that there's money for this facility? that may be a part of your mil's reluctance that she's not voicing. a visit to a certified elder law attorney (even though he's under 65) would also be really important in figuring out how to preserve what she has if medicaid is going to be involved, as it is for most people. in my state also facilities have to have a special license for people under 65, and those who have that license and also accept medicaid patients are few in number. (though those facilities may accept private-pay patients who will switch over to medicaid when the money runs out--that's something that needs to be explicitly asked, and it's also worth asking whether there's a difference in services when they move to medicaid (shared rooms are likely, for instance). has your mil seen the facility you are considering? does the facility have a social worker with whom she can speak and voice her concerns? not a sales counselor but a real social worker. has she discussed her situation with her support group? i have a friend who was hospitalized after her husband with dementia assaulted her. once the person with dementia becomes violent it is past time to make a change. it is my husband who has alzheimer's, and i expect to have him enter a memory care facility in the next ten days. i feel no guilt! he always told me 'i want to stay home, i don't want to go to an institution' and i always answered 'i will keep you at home as long as i can, but the time may come when i can't do it any more.' that time is now. actually an admissions coordinator asked when i would want him to move in and i said meekly, 'yesterday?' having to make that call to move a loved one to a memory care or other secured facility is incredibly difficult even knowing it's the best thing for everyone when you get to that point. my mom struggled with it the most and wanted to talk to my dad about it. i discouraged it as it would only make my dad angry (he was too far long at this point) and wouldn't remember. what finally helped my mom realize was when i told her my concern was if something happened to her, his primary caregiver, we'd be forced to put him somewhere and rushed. if we decided as a family, we could research places and coordinate his move for it to go as smoothly as possible. we moved my dad in to memory care february 2021 and he passed in november. my mom broke her arm and needed surgery three weeks after we moved my dad in to memory care. i had to move in with my mom for the first few days as she could not do much on her own then her sister had to come stay with her after surgery. so, had we not made the decision, the decision would have been made for us when my mom broke her arm. mom and dad are on the short end. both were rns for 25-30 years. dad, the one with alzheimer’s, has amazingly reduced mobility. (he had polio in his teens, so he got off with a limp.) mom is his caregiver until she makes up her mind. personal pride still reigns. you know, until dad falls again…  i’ve volunteered to help out, but it is up to her to accept help of any kind. so... he hits the dog? i would say gently that i would like to take over care decisions. if not, i would have a social worker come for an evaluation of both parties.	0
hi all,  sorry in advance for this rant but it’s half two in the morning and i realized i just need to get things off my chest in order to sleep. i’ve been caring for a 92 year old family friend with alzheimer’s for the past couple years. i (m22) live in the upstairs of her socal home and have been doing so for just over 10 years. my dad had to move here for work, but socal is very expensive. thankfully she allowed us to rent her upstairs at an incredible price. my dad passed away in 2017 so i’ve been here alone with her for almost 5 years. her alzheimer’s is getting to be quite advanced e.g. i keep getting this awful feeling like i’m catching alzheimer’s just by caring for her, being around her, or touching things she’s touched. i know you can’t catch alzheimer’s and i know those suffering from alzheimer’s need just as much love and attention as we all do, but it’s like a horrible phobia that i can’t shake! i’ve been distant with her, and her daughter only comes to visit for a week or so every couple months. all she really has is me and a few friends who visit for an hour here and there once or twice a week. i just want to do what is right for her and care properly, but it’s impossible with whatever this is i’m experiencing. thanks for reading and any advice would be much appreciated. you definitely can’t “catch,” alzheimer’s, but stress and depression can certainly cause you to be forgetful or have “brain fog” temporarily. i would have a real talk with her daughter about plans to keep her mom safe by bringing in a caregiver or moving her to a facility. i'm 67 and caring for my 81 year old husband who has alzheimer's. since the early days of his diagnosis, i've wondered 'is this contagious? my support group reassures me that it's due to picking up all the cognitive load that is cast off by the patient in this picture. my latest stressor is my husband likes to wander around the house picking things up and putting them elsewhere. he is teetering right at the border between middle stage and late stage, so he takes a lot of structuring, prodding, reminding, etc. i am hoping he can go to memory care within the month. and i could use a little more of an empty nest. good luck to you. one day your selfhood will return! stress, less sleep than usual, all things that can cause what you're feeling. for your sake and hers, i hope you have an idea of your future plans because if something happens, you may be homeless real quick. try to make sure to get some time to yourself where you can rest, relax, etc. best of luck op! and from such young age caring for an elderly alzhms person on your own, wow super very tough, i don't know how you manage - what a legend!. seems you're developing a stress-induced issue? actually, most if not all sole carers do. depression, anxieties, insomnia, eds, ocds, other & all sorts of mental health issues carers develop. so sorry eh, i feel for you, it's great you are aware & reaching out! i guess, your memory issues are result of stress, and the worry about that, is tripping another stress reaction. (some similar things have happened to me a few times too, over the past years i've been caring for my mum, lost my whole life & all my friends & job to move countries back here to care for her. not even trained well paid professionals can do this sort of thing alone for indeterminate years on and on, it's intense. and unless the family are paying you an adequately substantial amount of money to help out, you need to have time to  be living your own life, right? ok you're getting a great deal on rent - but how much of your time and emotional & mental health are you losing? like i get the strong bond you have with kind old lady, and you want to be a good human, but you can't run yourself into the ground for other people and cheap rent. i think for a start you need respite time-off, for sure. some counselling, would also probably be helpful. a proper talking with the daughter to get some other solutions organised. and are you connected with carer support orgs? so often, in the caring for someone else, the carer themselves are left by the wayside. they endure & suffer being the main pillars of support, they also need aid & assistance to remain healthy happy & strong! alzheimers .org or dementia .org can assist you with finding options & details for all those things. they are experts in all aspects of memory-loss diseases & conditions, have tons of free resources, information, counselling, telephone helplines, etc etc. contact & speak with or visit yr area alzhms / dementia org asap! they were life-savers for me, & my mum. of course it's the daughters responsibility to actually organise & arrange services / respite / in-home care / going residential / whatever for her mother, but who knows sometimes family members who live at a distance haven't really got around to finding out all that information - it might be helpful if you can at least get some printed literature / pamphlets / booklets whatever for her, to get things at least productively starting moving along somewhat. and she needs to start organising some more help sooner, not later, not in 3 months 6 months time. it's great you're persevering with college, good on you! i hope alzhms org can help you out with lot of options & info. hang in there, best of luck to you! give an update some time, i'll be thinking of you! \* hugs \* i lived in a house with a very old woman that had dementia. i provided the evening meal and did some laundry until she had to go into a home. i was desperate for help and nobody understood. even the health nurse didn't bother pressing her to see how far gone she really was. i found out how woeful the system is for coping with things like this, even the professionals other than in the hospital. because an ambulance came to pick her up one day when it got too much. only a week before i told her gp that her mental deterioration need urgent attention and i stressed the urgent part. i feel for what you're going through, it's bitterly tough. i found a new level of misery living there. i'm also sorry you lost your dad, i lost mine in 2016.	0
hey all. new member here. i guess i’ll give a quick background story; my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimer’s back when i was in late grade school/early middle school. i was relied upon heavily as her caregiver (assisting my mom and a daytime aid we had most weekdays) and it was traumatic, to say the least. my mom was diagnosed officially last month, but i knew it had been coming for at least two years. the pandemic and some bad doctors really prolonged the diagnosis finally being on paper. i guess i y need to talk to other people who get it. my boyfriend, whom i live with, isn’t as supportive as i need. i do not speak about her like she’s dead, but i can’t call my mom for advice. or to gossip. or to joke about our weird family anymore. we can’t go shopping and try on clothes together anymore. it’s simple things. i feel that (he is a bit abusive but i’m looking for a way out of this, i wish we hadn’t moved in together, it’s so complicated right now for various reasons…) he almost tries to minimize my issues because my mom “is still here”. some days he’s very loving and consoling but most he’s cold and is very critical of her doctors. he’s never met them, but he always makes sure to tell me every negative assumption he’s made. i finally have her with an excellent geriatric neuropsych, and he’s insisting that more could be done medication wise. i feel diminished. like, you don’t think i’ve discussed these things to death with medical professionals?! i’m the only child and my dad is no spring chicken and i worry about how this will take a toll on him. but more than anything… i miss my mom. and my partner is not comforting about it. he has a slew of his own family issues which he expects me to always help with, and i do, but him insisting i’m wrong because i use past tense for certain things regarding my mother is irritating. i’ll never be able to go to a broadway show with her again or bake together at christmas like we did every single year. i’m just so deeply  drained physically mentally and emotionally and all i don’t know how much more of his crap i can take while i handle my mom’s needs. i hate alzheimer’s and i hate the lack of empathy among people. thanks for reading, love and strength to you all 💜 i’m so sorry you’re dealing with such a double whammy of losing your mom and an unsupportive partner. i’ve tried to explain to my partner how many seemingly intangible things i’ve lost with my mother over the last few years (advice, consoling, shopping), and he doesn’t get it either. all i can say is get support where you can, from therapy and a caregiving/alzheimer’s community. i believe men don’t understand the connection between a mom and daughter. my husband (75) has ad and although i was able to see my daughter , we haven’t been able do do any of the fun things we use to do together . it must be harder on you not having those mother / daughter talks and joking around. my best advice is to enjoy the time you do have and  maybe get some videos of her while you can . also a book that gets recommended that may help you. it’s called the 36 hour day your dad may find it helpful as well. best wishes to you and a big hug from a mom. i am sorry you have to go through this and not get the support you need. you said so much of what i felt when my mom went through the progression of alzheimers. i grieved the loss of the mom i knew for 72 years. i missed calling her when i just needed my mom to comfort me and sympathize. i missed so much. then i thought i was so prepared when she did pass away last month. i grieved for her when she was alive,but then when she was actually gone, i couldn't even hug her or kiss her cheek or stroke her hair. i know for myself i had to find some acceptance that i couldn't get the old mom back, so i did my best to find ways to be with her. honestly, some times i really struggled to visit her,but i did usually feel better afterward, knowing i spent time with her.	0
growing up i didn’t get to see my dads side grandmother a lot. she lived a state over, and so i only got to see her maybe once a summer and over a holiday, unless she drove to see us, and those weeks always went by way too fast. she sold that house and moved to florida when i was in middle school. over my time in high school she developed alzheimer’s, and we only ever talk when i call her, and it’s dependent on her being at the phone or not having lost her phone. and i loved the talks we had. it took her a minute to realize it was me,but when she reconnected those dots she cheered up, unlike any conversation she has had with my dad, mom, or sister the past year, and she started asking all kinds of questions about things i didn’t think she’d know about or remember. after we hung up the phone, i cried, it’s been two hours, and i’m unable to do anything else but think about the conversation we just had. 😭 with alzheimer's, you grieve the loss of your loved one long before they breathe their last breath. i'm sorry you are experiencing this. a lot of elderly people really value cards and letters. you could make a nice difference in your grandmother's life if you would send her one card or letter every week. it probably doesn't come naturally to you because of your generation, but i think it would have a big impact. firstly, i want to say i’m so sorry this is affecting your grandmother and now by extension you so badly. my grandmother developed alzheimer’s when i was in middle school and i spent a good chunk of my teen years being a caregiver. i wouldn’t change my circumstances as i, like you, just wanted to see her. i’m sad reading this because i have been in your shoes (in it again with my own mom atm but this ain’t about me) so i fully understand and feel your pain. as the commenter above me said, alzheimer’s is hell because we are grieving the loss of someone who isn’t physically “gone” yet for a long time. i’d also agree with them that cards and letters would be a nice thing to consider. if this isn’t too personal to ask, can she still read ok? only asking because my mom is at a stage where she’s losing that ability, but i’ve discovered that if i can make her a small painting or piece of art, she really cherishes it and it’s something they can always look at and find new meaning in, and even subconsciously make a connection to you in it in their minds. you can dm me if you ever want to talk to someone, i’m sadly no stranger to this evil illness. i wish i could give you a big hug right now (if you’re into hugs, that is lol) but i hope at least me letting you know that you’re understood and not alone can provide some comfort. sending tons of love to you and your grandma and family 💜	0
does anyone know how much can be deducted from taxes that is spent on a memory care nursing home? i would think it would be qualified care since it's memory care as opposed to regular care and my parent definitely can't take care of themself anymore? i just finished filing my parent's taxes, and with my mom in a memory care nursing home for the last few years, we have been including that as a qualified medical expense on their itemized deductions, as per irs rules about [qualified long-term care]( (ltc). we only deduct the amount not covered by her ltc insurance reimbursements, but we do also deduct the premiums my dad pays for his ltc insurance policy which has yet to be activated. also, here is a [link to a turbotax q&a]( that specifically mentions alzheimers. i'm not an accountant, and this isn't tax advice. are they your dependent? how did they file last year? has a judge given you guardianship? hire a cpa and take them your last year's expenses to see if they meet the threshold to qualify as a dependent.	0
hi everyone,  i know both being stubborn and having trouble making decisions are symptoms of alzheimer's but i wanted to know why this is, if anyone knows. as time goes on my grandma has been getting increasingly disinterested (?) the other problem recently is stubbornness. for example she saw something in our neighbor's yard and asked my mom if it was in neighbor #1s yard or neighbor #2s yard. another example is taking showers. my mom asked her why not and she eventually said it was difficult...to open the shower door. we are lucky to get her to take a shower once a week at this point. does anyone know anything about these? why this shows up in alzheimer's, how it's a part of it and what we can do to address it? thanks for any suggestions. i really recommend teepa snow for understanding more; she's a very respected name in alzheimer's caregiving, and she's practical and funny and smart as a whip. i got into her via [this playlist]( but there are lots of other videos. for me it could be college-level calculus (or any calculus at all, really). imagine being in a family where everybody does this breezily and then being asked to solve a calculus problem--that's likely to be how your grandmother feels when asked to make a decision. not only can't she do it, it's stressful to be asked. the shower thing could be any number of things, and i wouldn't overfocus on what she *says* is the reason. the same could be said for drilling a cavity without novocaine, but not many people sign up for that either. so maybe it hurts her hand, or she's not sure if she's opening the door correctly and that's why it's not opening, or the bathroom lighting is confusing or the floor is slippery or it's cold, or she's struggling to get clothes on and off, or she forgets why she was in the bathroon, or she doesn't give a damn about taking a shower now because she can't smell anything bad and she doesn't enjoy them, so why bother? addressing it often means letting it go. good spotting.' for the shower, it might be time for assistance in the process, not just the direction to take the shower. the decision issue is because thought is much harder when you have dead brain cells. i try to be sympathetic about it, or sometimes order for my husband and he seems relieved. i don't agree that alzheimer's people are necessarily stubborn. two other things to know about dealing with dementia. it's okay to lie, as long as it's something not likely to be found out; and redirecting is much better than direct confrontation. good luck! never argue with a dementia patient, even over something as simple and clear to you as the property lines of your neighbours. as their brain changes due to the dementia so does their perception, understanding and ability to communicate effectively about the situation. as for making decisions, lets say the question is steak or chicken for dinner? does she remember what the choices are? has she forgotten how to eat a steak dinner? does she think she needs to help cook, but can't remember how? many dementia patients hate taking showers as the disease progresses: one of the big reasons is due to not liking the water hitting their head and the other is not remembering what to do. things that can help: don't give her a choice, make sure the bathroom is warm, have warmed towels or robe ready for after she is out, you may need to get in with her so be ready for that, treat it as very routine. stubbornness and the other problems are going to seem minor when she can't feed herself or walk anymore. the most difficult thing to accept is that alzheimer's is progressive, and there is no rationale that changes that. the way to handle this is to say “would you like chicken or steak for dinner?” rather than “what would you like for dinner?”. simply stop asking open ended questions! either-or, or yes-or-no will be relieving for both of you. for the stubbornness: similar reason, its because they can tell they’re missing information and it makes them angry/frustrated more often than not, no one likes to feel like they’re forgetting or they’re wrong about something they *think* they’re sure about. try reaching out to your local alzheimer's chapter. they even have support groups for you to share your experiences and ask questions. first you get scared. then you go to fight or flight mode. just keep it simple. my mom has had cognitive decline since before the pandemic but was able to hide it pretty well, no socializing probably accelerated it. april ‘21 i visited after being vaccinated (she in sc, me in nyc) i knew she needed someone to come in to help but she still refused so i let it go. fast forward to january 22… she had a heart attack in the shower and was down for about a day before i sensed something was wrong (spoke with her on a saturday, she was very disoriented, didn’t return my calls a few days later) & asked a neighbor to check on her. i’ve been here at her house caregiving since; she is and has always been stubborn and hard headed as hell. i’ve learn to deflect and redirect just like when i hang out with a drunken friend. dementia is brain damage… it won’t get better. good luck 🙂	0
hi guys,  i hope this post is fine. basically today my mum has been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, most likely alzheimers but we will find out more on a second round of tests in 3 months. it's heartbreaking for her because she has worked in the nhs in the uk on dementia wards for the last 15 or more years and has said it's her biggest fear to forget who her kids are. i'm out drinking at the moment (just a disclaimer against typos) but i wanted to ask some advice. of course part of that will be emotional support but another part is practicality. i want to start a conversation about doing things to make her life easier because she is okay at the moment but things will be different in ten years time. for example, she had recently talked about selling her house and mortgaging two to rent out to make passive income. i don't think this will be sustainable with everything in mind so i wanted to advise her to buy something outright that she can own and not have having over her if that makes sense? similarly i would advise her to live close to myself and my brother so if she needs us we are close by. this isn't at all intended to be patronising or anything i'm honestly just trying to start a conversation around ways to make her life easier for the years that are ahead. with all that preamble i wanted to ask if you had advice of things we could think about or start talking about in terms of preparing for the future to make sure she is comfortable, happy and independent for as long as she can be. i'm sorry if i am wrong or stupid with anything that i am saying; she is an amazing woman and my hero and has been a mum and a dad to me and i am just searching for anything i can that will make life better and give her less stress if that makes sense? if you were in the us, i would tell you to get a durable power of attorney and living will. i don't know if you need that in the uk. there are a bunch of resources pinned to the top of the dementia subredit. i would recommend you have an honest conversation about what she wants for her future while she is still able. i'm so sorry you were just hit with the probable diagnosis. between my grandmother and my mom, i've been dealing with alzheimer's for forty years, and when i read these sad stories, i want to be in support, but i still never know what to say. this is going to be a tough time, and keep it simple as possible, but if your mom is still lucid, take care of the financial matters as soon as possible, with an eye towards the very real possibility that living in her own home will not be permanent. the more you can prepare for in advance, the better. having other family members to help, is very important, as well, if you have them. 🥂 don't rush her talking about extended decisions. one thing that has worked well for me is to involve a social worker in some difficult discussions. you might also want to get in therapy yourself to help you cope with the stresses and sadness. it doesn't have to be weekly, maybe monthly or quarterly would feel right to you. i see a psychologist monthly and find it very helpful. i second the top comment. get a power of attorney and a will. im in the uk and helping my nana with it now. it covers both finances and health. i know it sounds controlling and patronising right now - but down the line there will be a point when shes no longer in capacity to make decisions and that is where you as a family will need to step in. this is as a safeguard for her wellbeing and assets knowing its someone she trusts managing this when she cant in her best interest. it doesn't have to come into effect until she's without capacity if thats a concern right now too! there are loads of options. i'm in scotland so if youre in another nation im not sure of the protocols, but speak to the memory clinic about all of this (they usually have handy info packs for both patient and family/carers). most importantly, look after yourself as well as mum! its so exhausting doing all of this at times, as much as you love them. reach out to carer and family support services for advice on how to proceed. theyre the experts at the end of the day. but ill also add that your own mum is an expert in herself; having a frank, open and empathetic conversation (while acknowledging there may be conflicts of opinions or difficulty in accepting diagnosis) is the best way forward to ensuring things are done the way your mum sees fit for herself. its still her and her life, youre just helping making things a bit easier. other little helpful things, you may or may not use them yet depending on how troublesome her memory can get at present:  -leave notes for all important stuff like brushing teeth twice a day next to mirror in toilet, how long and what temp to cook food in micro or oven. keep a notepad by the phone for her to write things as soon as the call ends. - buy a big digital clock that says the time and full date and the time of day it is in full display in common area (nana loves this!) - have a weekly wall planner that has reminders to do things like go food shop or do a bit of dusting  - speak to occupational therapy through social work to get adjustments to the home that make appliances and things more user friendly and safer to ensure shes independent at home as long as possible  - continue with stable routines/habits e.g. leaving keys by table at the front door, going to see you for coffee at the same day and time  - if she takes medications, get the gp to change them to blister packs that portion it into the day of week and time of day which js delivered to her home weekly. call to remind and wait until shes taken it, if this is a point of issue. good luck and stay well all of you xx	0
firstly i want to apologise in case i use any terms or anything incorrectly, i don’t know a lot about alzheimer’s so i’m going with what i’ve read. i (18) have noticed my dad’s changing behaviour since around 2020. at the start of the pandemic specifically he became irritable and argumentative, we assumed it was just him being bored and angry about covid so he was taking it out by saying outrageous things and fighting with me and my siblings about them. in fairness, a lot of his behaviours sound like symptoms of dementia although he has never really gotten “worse”, is always just the same eg he gets very stressed about things like making dinner, giving lifts or going on trips. recently he forgets things like what i’m doing, eg a couple days ago i had to travel to a different city and told him i needed a lift to the bus, and on the day of he forgot and i had to jog his memory quite a bit before he remembered. basically, i can’t tell if this is just him getting old or if it’s signs of early-onset alzheimer’s. or if the term “getting old” actually stems from a misunderstanding of what alzheimer’s is? the thought of it affecting my dad petrifies me and it weighs on my mind a lot. i’m scared to “lose” my dad since i am so close to him and my siblings and i are still pretty young. i don’t want to bring it up with my younger siblings or my mother who works 40+ hrs and is also pretty much full time studying, as i don’t want to scare any of them especially if i’m just overthinking. thank you for taking your time to read :) some of these things could be indicative of dementia, but honestly, what you are describing does not sound like dementia to me. only a doctor can say. forgetting to pay bills, paying them twice because she forgot she paid them already, ordering things she already had, then not knowing where her money would go. issues with short term memory. forgetting what day/year it was, what state she was in, whether she had eaten or not, forgetting recent conversations or events. asking the same questions or telling the same story over and over. hygiene issues. things like not bathing or brushing her teeth for days. when we would bring it up she would insist she had just taken a shower or brushed her teeth. forgetting what to do or how to operate during normal daily activities like using a computer, her phone, using the tv remote, the microwave, etc. she hid it well at first, but over time it became more and more obvious she was struggling. again, i am no doctor, but what you are describing sounds more like age-related forgetfulness, but it's hard to say without getting him to the doctor to be checked. alzheimer’s is really difficult to diagnose just by symptoms so there’s no real way for you specifically know he has it, there’s so many things that have to be ruled out before a neurologist considers it alzheimer’s (coming from someone whose dad was diagnosed with it at 61/62). the symptoms he’s showing could be caused from other things that maybe should be looked at by a primary care doctor first (i’m not sure exactly what but there’s plenty of possibilities)   if he shows more serious signs of forgetfulness you can and should encourage him to go to his primary care doctor and/or neurologist. he will probably fight against going or roll his eyes but if he is experiencing dementia there is help out there to slow things down so getting to the root of it sooner rather than later is a great move. i wouldn’t jump to conclusions but i very much empathize with your situation, hope all is okay with your dad ♥️ i am not an expert but if you are noticing those things at his fairly young age, it is worth looking in to. try talking with your mom about it; this is a lot for you to carry alone. your mom could be noticing things but she’s afraid to worry you about it. ideally you or mom could talk to dad about it. if he is willing to talk w his dr about seeing a neurologist that would be best to sort things out and get treatment if needed. you are an intuitive person and your dad is lucky to have someone like you in his corner.	0
my mom's neighbour is getting worse and her half sister and friend are doing next to nothing to help her, instead, just leaving it all to my 81 year old mom to worry about. the neighbour, who i'll refer to as f, does not look after herself, wears the same clothes for days, repeatedly goes to the bank to withdraw money, which she then secretes somewhere, forgets where it is, then goes back for more, and is often lost, dazed and confused in the street, a mile or so down the road. meanwhile, despite my mom relaying all this back to her half sister and friend, all they say is that, because f is adamant she doesn't want strangers (carers) in the house, their hands are tied. they also just say 'she has safeguarding in place'. uh, ok.  so, it's all on my mom. you can call adult protective service and have someone check on her. when my mom had memory issues and was living by herself, she fell. when the doctor checked her she was ok but  he had a social worker visit the house w  they were actually very helpful with us getting the care she needed and some physical therapy. we had talked to mom before her fall and she insisted on living by herself. well, if it's too much for your mom, she can always step back - she isn't family, after all. but maybe your mom likes to feel needed? if you call the local social service agency, and describe the above, they most likely can have a social worker make a friendly visit. they won't drag the neighbor off in chains, it's more social. they can perhaps offer that there are free rides to lunch at the senior center, or something like that to get her involved. nice of you to care!	0
there are a lot of you on here that ask for resources to help you as a caregiver. i just wanted to plug that the alzheimer’s association has a free 24/7 helpline that can be translated into over 100 languages. the people answering the helpline calls are all social workers with a masters degree and can help with any question you have - ranging from “what is alzheimer’s” all the way to you being in a crisis and need guidance on how to handle the situation. they can also help connect you to local support, like support groups, care consultants, education, etc. it’s an amazing resource that i highly recommend. thank you so very much this hotline saved me when i was navigating my mom’s first steps into her alzheimer’s. they are so kind and so helpful. if they don’t have the answer, they are great at directing you where to go to get one. 10/10 give them a call if you need help!	0
i wanted to share in this group for others with questions, specific to the impact of covid on their lo. tomorrow marie pasinski, md of [harvard medical school]( and [massachusetts general hospital]( and susan wehry, md of [university of new england college of osteopathic medicine]( are taking questions and discussing the connection between [\#covid19]( and dementia. live q&a (tomorrow 1:30pm est): [is there a link between covid-19 and dementia?	0
i ended up having a talk the week before last with my mom’s (64 f) daycare about her general decline, they agree she has declined, and said they didn’t think it would be any trouble for her to be evaluated and qualify. we had the hospice referral appointment with her pcp last tuesday, and it hit me harder than i was anticipating. so much so, i ended up calling out sick for work the next day, and took a me day while mom was at daycare. the first hospice agency referred to us by the pcp was not a first choice of the woman who runs the support group that i’m in, and i trust her opinion. my mom really qualified without any second thought. they’ll provide a shower chair, a wheelchair and a hospital bed as soon as i have room for them to. i got her a rollator last week that has been helping at daycare. other supplies will be provided as well. of course i just did a pretty recent big restock of diapers and wipes…  i’m a little nervous that i’m not actually going to get the extra help and relief i need. a nurse will come out twice a week, and an aid can come out 5, but only for an hour to get her ready for the day. she can still go to daycare and be on hospice as long as she does not become completely hard to care for in their facility. she will be assigned a social worker who may be able to help me figure out more in home health services or short term respite care. i know i need to see how this even plays out to start. they can arrange a 5-7 day skilled nursing facility stay for respite otherwise. my mom doesn’t understand much anymore. what do i tell her about this? do i keep it simple and just say they’re new friends coming to help, or do i tell her that she’s on hospice? i have a feeling it’s the former, but want to get some input. is this a sign she knows it could be happening, or is it just the insecurities of the disease? i mean, she’ll say it at the most random times sometimes. i could be putting her socks on or getting her out of bed, and she’d say it. i probably need to have a physical scheduled as soon as possible. hey there. i am in a very similar situation, my mom (67) was diagnosed with alzheimer's 7 years ago. she has been on hospice for the last 3 months and they have been wonderful. accept the extra help, yeah you can shower your mom but it's great to be able to hand off some care. caregiver fatigue is a real issue, please make sure you're taking care of yourself. i am deep in this too, message me if you want to chat. it's great for you both that you'll be receiving additional hours & help, well done! i'm in australia so our system is different, idk. probably a 5-day break would be really good for you, give some time to catch up with yourself. best of luck with everything! just put your mom in hospice. tough go. u did wonderfully!!! my dad passed from dementia. mom elected to keep him at home, for familiarity. before mom passed, she & my brother arranged for 24/7 care. i kept praying for our lord to take him home. on day he was brought to hospital, he even complimented an employee of his tie. i applaud your efforts getting your mom into hospice. best of luck.	0
i don’t know if ptsd is the right word i’m sorry if it’s not. in 2020 i lost my grandmother to alzheimer’s and that was hard but just last month i lost my second grandmother to alzheimer’s i was much closer with her and saw her decline first hand since then i’ve been having panic attacks and freak out when my mom or other family members forget things. i’m laying in bed crying worried about having to go through that ever again does anyone else have this problem? this is apparently an evolutionary adaptation to help us see potentially dangerous situations ahead of time, and take appropriate action to avoid the same danger in the future. that's ptsd in a nutshell. (i'm not a doctor or psychologist). another direction might be reaching out to a grief therapist. my sincere condolences on your losses; and big, warm internet hugs to you. other commenter is right, i definitely had diagnosed ptsd when my dad had it and after he died it changed but it was still there. i would also suggest you consider joining a support group. they are free, and they used to be in person, but since covid there are many online:  . the anxiety you describe is similar to what many folks experience.. you may find comfort that its not just you. maybe you can find a good fit for you. . good luck.	0
my grandmother was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago, but we knew long before she finally agreed to see the neurologist. since the diagnosis it just feels like everything has now progressed so rapidly. just last week things were bad, but after going away for the weekend i returned to the news from my mother that she had gotten substantially worse in the few days i had been gone. a couple days ago my grandmother was barely capable of holding a conversation, but now she isn’t even able to string together a couple of words coherently. the scariest part is i’m sitting in the er right now, and i can swear i hear the death rattle. she has also been mumbling what sounds like my grandfather’s name. so far we have ruled out a stroke, and they don’t seem to think she has any sort of infection. i just can’t wrap my head around how quickly this is all happening. i just sort of needed an outlet for my feelings with some people that understand. alzheimer's is a fucking awful disease. my first thought was a uti. my mother has alzheimer's and she would get very, very bad when she had an uti. she made sandwiches for my dad who died in 2011. she couldn't read a clock, understand the time, or why it was dark outside. i sincerely hope your grandmother is just going through a bad spell. so sorry for you! my mother is also rapidly getting worse in the last few weeks. stay strong for both of you. every timing is different, my mom has been calling for her mom for a few years now and she died 45 years ago. my mom has been bedridden and immobile for almost 17 months now and her limbs have been 'frozen' for well over 6 months now. it really does seem like she is near the end now but we said that throughout all of 2021. she is 87 and has been at stage 7 for well over 5 years and with obvious moderate stage dementia for over 15 years. my mom definitely has the prolonged version of the disease and it's been terrible for several years now. memories usually go back to where they remember people from their past, that’s maybe why she’s saying your grandfather’s name. definitely check out the uti connection tho!	0
sorry for your loss, i'm the caretaker of my mother as well. fighting as hard as i can to keep her mind with us as long as i can. beautiful work and a nice way to honor your mother. nice tat, and i'm sorry about your mother. i work with advanced alz and dementia folks and your piece is on point from where i sit. i am a medical professional that works with early onset alzheimer’s, alzheimer’s , and dementia, this tattoo speaks to me…. i am so sorry about your mom, i know your pain, my patients aren’t my blood relatives but i am all they have now as their families have walked away from them…. your mom was so lucky to have you, this is just so beautiful and such a tribute❤️❤️❤️ so awesome! beautiful it captures the confusion and pain so beautifully oh this is so very beautiful. my papaws battle with alzheimer’s ended about a month ago and this speaks wonders about that horrible disease.	0
nan i hate to be skeptical but.... this person was reportedly diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's in 2014 and this book was published in 2022.  early onset alzheimer's is a more rapid disease. truthfully the vast majority of people diagnosed in 2014 with early onset alzheimer's would likely be deceased by now or completely debilitated. even her first book in 2018 (4 years after diagnosis) is far too along in an early onset alzheimer's disease course to be able to write a book even with assistance.	0
my grandmother is fiercely independent but lately has not been able to function the way she used to. i'm in a worrisome debate if it's regular aging or signs of something more serious. forgetting conversations we’d had the day before and misplacing car keys and stuff all the time 2011, my mom was complaining about the fancy new name that they gave the “tidal wave” that hit japan. there were a few things for me:   - his driving got worse. an excellent driver, he started to get into car accidents. drove a lot slower than usual and would  ignore usual traffic 'politeness'. - he wasn't able to grasp new games, even with my guidance. - we would call each other over skype to play our weekly games. did this for years. as soon as i started to see changes to those key abilities of his, i knew something was off. not being able to pay bills or follow recipes, she would just get too overwhelmed. all the while, refusal to see a professional. hiding and denying changes. and, of course the frequent accidents that weren’t her fault. it took a year but the state finally took her driving privileges away. “he” was always “she,” and “she” was always “he.” that started cropping up in 2017 when she didn’t even register as having mci on the moca (scoring 29/30). that was also the year my 23&me came back showing i had a copy of the apoe4 gene and i knew then, in my gut, my mom was on that path. then, slowly over the next few years, more and more words began to be replaced, if a store closed, it had “died,” if a tire was flat, it was “dead.” now, on her worst days, every other noun is just a “thing.” she’s still early stage and can live independently with very little assistance, but she’s right at the tipping point to middle dementia. praying before eating dinner - he would always do (lead?	0
okay, so my dad was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. because i gave birth to a child and didn't live super close to my parents i was never able to attend many of his doctor appointments. now i have moved closer and my child is older, so i'm paying closer attention to his health and helping out my mom. one thing that was never made clear to me is what type of dementia he had. so at his last appointment with his neurologist, i asked her what type of dementia is he diagnosed with. and she said, based on his scans it's either alzheimer's or vascular dementia. so is that a thing? i guess i was looking for something definitive. not: maybe this, maybe that. i guess from her perspective it's all under the same umbrella, but from my prospective i'm just confused. yes, it's a thing. my mom also has vascular dementia and alzheimers. remember, alzheimers is a form of dementia so you're right, it's all under the same umbrella. i wish you all the best! eta: there is no definitive way to diagnose alzheimers while the patient is alive, it's only when they die that they can say (via autopsy) that it was alzheimers. another common cause is vascular dementia. a person can also have both. as others have said, alzheimer's can't be diagnosed with 100% certainty until an autopsy. i've read that alzheimer's presents as a slow progression whereas vascular dementia will process periodically with sudden changes. a uti will also appear as a sudden change, but treating the uti will help improve the sudden problem. my grandmother has vascular dementia and dementia. although i did assume they are the same and it's not? interestingly enough, not diagnosed with alzheimers. we went to different doctors and honestly, none were much help. my grandmother is on medication, it's really not improving her symptoms. i think going to get a second opinion will help in the sense of getting the right mix of medications if you don't think the dr. is doing what he can. my so has a dementia, undefined diagnosis at this point. but without an effective treatments or accurate tests, i am not pushing for further diagnostic testing. we are four years into the dementia, i am focused on positive support, seeing that she gets good food, plenty of rest and limit her over stimulation. i give her opportunity to be functional, but step in when she get confused. had a similar chat with my mom’s doc when she was diagnosed. he told me that the only true way to tell if it’s alzheimer’s is to do an autopsy after she passes away. until then, they use standardized testing. i read somewhere that mri scans show shrinking of the brain with alzheimer’s, more so than regular senile degeneration. while i’m assuming vascular dementia shows less blood flow>>>less circulation from kidney disease or diabetes>>>cognitive functional decline	0
this last year my father's mental condition has been deteriorating. those who've been in my place for longer, how do you cope during the progression? get power of attorney sorted out now, and i mean now. if your dad gets declared as lacking capacity, he can no longer sign to appoint one. then you have a lengthy, complicated and expensive legal procedure to get it done. trust me, that is what i am going through right now. had to call sheriffs a few times and had a few hospital visits. my dad was quite stubborn and insisted nothing was wrong, but i managed to get durable poa set up to help him with this big transaction he was confused on. he probably didn't understand he was signing a durable poa. i don't think i did anything wrong because it really needed to happen. i second and then immediately third the notion to get durable poa right away. it saved the bacon of everybody involved when he finally ended up in the hospital and they wouldn't release him except to a memory care facility. i then would say if he lets you, use the poa to get his affairs in order when you can still ask him questions. emotionally, well, it sucks the big one. my dad just passed away from alzheimer’s, he lived with it for almost a decade. as another commenter said, get power of attorney as that will allow for you or your mom to make important decisions for him. care is extremely expensive especially down the road, so i would try to get financials in order if at all possible. the way to get medicaid to pay for care is to spend down your assets to the point where it appears you have less money than you do, i.e. buying a house or car. down the line you’ll want to get in touch with an elder care attorney as they specialize in this stuff. spend time with him and get him moving and seeing old friends as those things just get harder as time goes by, but don’t feel guilty if it’s hard for you to be around him a lot because it’s simply depressing. i wish you the best of luck. being a caretaker for your parents is one of the most difficult and also rewarding things you can do. fill your mind and soul with patience, compassion and love. take lots of pictures and videos of good times and bad ones too. they become great tools for reflection and learning. she was 52 when she was diagnosed. get your power of attorney in order and before he is too far gone make sure that he has nothing in his name: homes, cars, access to accounts. we hired a lawyer for this. we were able to get my mom on medicare and no one went after my dad for money for medical stuff. my mom is now 57, and she lived in a nursing home, she couldn’t be left alone while my dad went to work anymore, it’s hard but eventually it becomes the normal. feel free to reach out of you have questions. i've dealt with alzheimer's most of my life. first with my grandmother, who declined quite rapidly throughout my high school years, and then my father, whose stroke got the ball rolling in the same year my grandmother passed. the number one thing i can tell you is to have patience, and when he gets combative or starts not recognizing you, keep in mind that those moments are not him, it's the disease. second, power of attorney is exceptionally important. all the upcoming doctors visits and legal struggles will be made ten times easier if you have poa. my mom had poa over my dad, and it was like pulling teeth to try and get her to do anything because she didn't want to admit he was declining either. when he passed in 2016, she absolutely shut down and i had to make all the decisions anyway, but had to string her along to sign paperwork. third, show him old videos if you have any, but also take new ones. cherish those memories. 💜 you or another family member should go to a doctor's appointment with your dad to 'discuss the incident of finding himself in another town.' something like that happened with my dh and the doctor promptly said 'you need to give up driving.' this is huge - most men don't like giving that up (women too, but it seems a bigger deal to men) and having the doctor say it may be the thing that makes it happen. a person with dementia not only endangers himself but others. as for you coping - are you his primary caregiver? if you are, or are going to be transitioning into that role - i strongly suggest you find a dementia caregiver support group. it helps you cope with your feelings as well as learn a lot of necessary tips for helping your dad. get an elder law attorney. get durable poa, **now**. you need the attorney to arrange his assets so that he will be eligible for a medicaid waiver home care and nursing home eventually, without draining the inheritance entirely. does he have a diagnosis yet? if he does not, you may be able to purchase a long-term care insurance plan. he is quite young and if he is also physically healthy, he may live with this for 15 or 20 years. * [ * [   **if you modify your base assumptions and expectations to set up a good environment for him, he can have a normal-feeling life for a long time. ** and reach out for help when problems arise instead of trying to diy until a crisis lands him in the hospital. because every injury and hospitalization (especially if surgery, bed rest healing time, and residential pt rehab is required) will make basic tasks require more help, which accelerates dementia. also, test him for hearing loss. for example, he needs to be living in a disability-accessible, walkable community asap. he must not be living in a home that requires him to drive if he wants to leave the house and do anything. he must have a roll-in shower, a bathroom that can take a shower bench. no stairs, non-slip floors. all these will make it easier for him to live without heavy assistance, longer. later on, it becomes extremely hard to disrupt their living habits because they cannot form new habits. but the home has to be safe. if he can walk to shops without driving, he will be able to socialize, run low-risk errands, and feel normal for a very long time. thank you all for the advice. the poa situation will definitely be a priority once it's all official. i should clarify there are a couple tests they need to do first, but yes, his doctors are fairly sure that this is what we're dealing with. i really liked everyones suggestions of memory documentation, since there's already so much for him that isn't the same and it feels like every month its a little worse. i find comfort just in knowing that others understand how this all feels and how confusing it is, for the family, but also the one diagnosed. like others said get both poas. find the insurance policies, car titles, passwords and any other important documents. i wish i had taken some of my wife when she was better.
my mom has been diagnosed and lived with alzheimer for 4 years. her condition now is really bad and she doesnt have any common sense and manner at all, she can hardly be concious at things and even if i call her mutiple times she wont reply. but lately my brothers turned some sort of buddhism audio for her at night while she slept, i'm an atheist so i dont care about much but then he had to stop because my dad didn't want to involve in religious stuffs (yeah that's audio was kinda spooky for real). after  a few days, one night, it was like 1 am or something, i heard she was mumbling, normally when my mom sleeps, she has somniloquy so i just think that she is sleep talking but then i came closer i realised that she woke up and looked just like the first stage of alzheimer. she remembered me, remembered normal manners, remembered how to calculate and i asked her to sign her name-which she normally can't do, she did, of course sometimes she still mistook things but i surprised that she was concious and looked normal. but when she be able to read the clock and tell the time, she had to sleep and i was kinda afraid that if she sleep, things would be back to normal, and they sure were. have anyone met this situation before?????? yes have had a relatively similar experience. one night i was stepping in for my brother and his partner so they could go out. this was way past the time of her realizing she was sick - it was really shocking. looking back in it i’m glad it happened, it was a nice interaction and i haven’t had a good one since really. it's pretty common, i think. wow! music certainly is a great therapy, especially classical music like beethoven, so it’s worth while to explore different musical genres. i’ve seen these “moments of clarity” over my several years of being a caregiver, and it’s quite spectacular to witness. but people should tame their hopes and expectations that these moments can be repeated and/or extended. continued socialization, music, dietary changes, etc, can all contribute to reducing or slowly down the effects of the disease. how amazing! that must have been nice to have your mom back for a bit. here’s a buddhist rhythm to try. my grandma with alzheimer’s would always respond when i played guitar or chanted this mantra  reminiscing is vital.

is there any want to stop/help a grandparent from leaving the house especially at night? i think they‚Äôve tried locks but she figures it out. we bought some of those toddler door handle safety covers and that really did the trick. we also put those cheap slide locks at the base of the door and dad never noticed it to open the door. we had those cheap alarms on the doors but the rest of us would always forget about them and scare the crap out of ourselves when we went out the door. dad wasnt too bad about wandering at night but there was a short time he would get up. double keyed deadbolt. depending how far along your grandparent is, you may try one of those door decals that makes it look like a bookcase or something. also, an alarm on the door is wise. my fil installed double-keyed deadbolt locks and always keeps the keys hidden. door alarms - not terribly expensive and they wake you or an overnight attendant who can then intervene;	1
my grandmother has been living alone for about 2 years and at that time more things have had happened that wad worrying as such. ashe has gone away for 2 times already in which my father just bought an gps tracker for her so that she wont go again. after this my dad was much more worried about my grandma, and made her stay here by lying to my grandma that she needs to wait for my uncle. in the first few weeks it was fine and my uncle was able to come to our home again and again, but then in the fourth week or so my uncle left to go to america since he lives there nowadays. this time it was different, it was today where she went out of our house and tried to go to her home. right now my grandma is arguing with my dad on trying to go home, she just wants to go home and me and my mom are very stressed about this situation because it is very irritating and since my mom is a baker, she always gets in the home. and my dad has had enough and had a mental breakdown about my grandma and surprisingly my grandma was fine about it and said sorry afterwards. what do i do in this situation? i desperately need help because it is very stressing for my entire family and my mom wants to leave and rent an apartment somewhere so that she can work in a nice enviroment. does your grandma have memory issues? can someone move in with her so she can be at her house? if she really can‚Äôt live alone and she likes to bake, maybe try baking with her so she is supervised. i am sorry i can‚Äôt be of much help. i have more questions than answers. i assume your grandmother has alzheimer's disease or something similar. there is a point where someone with that condition cannot live alone. from what you described, she could be at that point. i don't know where you live, but you could see if your local community has any daycare programs for someone like your grandmother. then show your parents the options. you could read with her or do crafts with her while your mom is trying to get something else done.	1
if anyone can understand, it‚Äôs you guys. i (33f) am my dads only caregiver. he doesn‚Äôt need full time care necessarily at this point but it‚Äôs coming. i teach 75 minutes away from my home so my dad can stay in the home he‚Äôs lived in for nearly 30 years and i fully financially take care of my dad except for his small ssi check. my sister was going to visit from the other coast and take my dad for a few days while i was on spring break so i could live a few days of my adult life in my own home, getting things done around the house that i can‚Äôt get done otherwise. woke up to a text that she‚Äôs been covid exposed and is waiting on a test but most likely won‚Äôt be able to come out and visit. i‚Äôd be lying if i said i didn‚Äôt lay in bed sobbing at 6am because i‚Äôd gotten my hopes up at having a few days of freedom. tonight, went to check the mail and got the notice that the doctors office didn‚Äôt get the form in to ihss for our initial assessment and so he‚Äôs been denied. there‚Äôs no end in sight and once again i‚Äôm laying in bed sobbing. i have no help, i can‚Äôt get help, and i don‚Äôt have hope. i‚Äôm beyond burnt out and i‚Äôm doing this alone. my friends can‚Äôt understand because they don‚Äôt live this life. i can‚Äôt get to a support group and so my entire therapy sessions are just me desperately crying to my therapist. i don‚Äôt need advice. i just need someone to understand what this is. for what it's worth, as caregivers, we do relate to what you're going through. it feels like you're using yourself up taking care of your loved one, missing out on your best years. i wish i could offer more than to say hang in there, it's not forever, even though it might feel like it. take the small moments to yourself when you can, and take some solace in knowing you're doing the right thing. the role of a primary caregiver is usually a lonely one. family members may have good intentions, but are not involved on a daily basis, and soon tire of the intrusion into their lives. what's more, they tend to offer advice when they are not familiar with the real circumstances. because of that they have not been able to develop coping mechanisms to stay in the game. in ten years, i had about a total of two weeks away, and most of that time was spent in the hospital for surgeries and other things, and the family, frustrated by my mother's behavior brought her back to me, the same day i was released from the hospital. in the beginning, i had a knee replacement and because i couldn't get around, elected to take ten days in rehab, so i could partially recover, but my family could not handle my mom, so they brought her back home and dropped her off, and left her with no way for her to get around or anyone to help, so i got two days of rehab before i had to go home. you will be criticized for your decision making by family members who feel guilt for their own inabilities. in my case, they've talked behind my back about how she should have been in a nursing home long ago, even though they were not willing to take on that process themselves. bringing professional caregivers into a home where you also live is usually not practical, and as the patient advances they may become hostile to strangers in their home. in my case, two of my sisters are nurses, and when the time finally came, i threw up my hands and forced them to make the arrangements for the care facility. caregiving for a parent is a noble undertaking that is full of surprises and changes along the way, and only the exceptionally strong are fit for the job, so know that. i am sorry for your difficulties, but steel yourself, because you have only begun on this journey that's full of twists and turns. my wife and i worked hard all our lives and had such grand plans for retirement and this damn disease changed all that. i get up really early so i can have a little me time. see if you qualify for some in home help. is there anything you can do to give yourself a treat or reward? some method of self-soothing or relaxation? my mom died four months ago now and i'm still getting myself together. i'm so used to taking her from one appointment to the next and eventually her needing nursing home care where the phone rang multiple times a week regarding her rage, i still can't hear the phone ring without panic kicking in. i feel your pain üòû  i've been taking care of my parents for 3 years now as an only child with not much help from my own family. both have dimentia and i was just told two days ago my mom won't be able to ever come back home unless she has 24-7 care at home. that's going to be impossible for me to do so it's a crap shoot getting the help from dss. i also just had my first kid and he's only 6 months old so dealing with it all has me literally burnt the fuck out. praying for you in these tough times sister. my mom always said what you put in into life you'll be rewarded in other things that surround you. love your dad. your doing a great job thus far and god will repay you in many other ways. there's no playbook or guide for what we're doing but it's the least we can do for the people that raised us to be great people in life. goodluck. patience is a virtue üôè .hugs. i also understand the just crying at the therapist. mine had hearing aids and discreetly turned them down during our sessions. hah! i understand. teaching is also high stress and requires a lot of giving as well. will sister reschedule her visit? even though you won‚Äôt be on break-you could get some relief/normalcy? do you have summer off? can she come then? the form‚Äîcan you re-start the process? the paperwork and appointments can be so overwhelming and they seem to come in waves. one step at a time. write things down and cross them off when done(helps me so i can see progress). find small things you can do for yourself. sometimes it may be having a good cry in the shower. or a quiet cup of coffee. wishing you well. i‚Äôve cried my eyes out more times than i can remember. and for sure, siblings can‚Äôt really understand what we go through - they can say they appreciate all you do, and you can tell them all the stressful things you‚Äôre dealing with, but they truly don‚Äôt get it. i hope soon your sister will be able to come give you those few days off, and then not only do you get time to yourself, but she can also see firsthand what it‚Äôs been like for you. take care  eta: i know you said you don‚Äôt want advice, but i noticed you said you can‚Äôt get to a support group - the alzheimer‚Äôs association has free zoom caretaker support groups - it‚Äôs helped me to talk to people that get what‚Äôs going on, but also have been dealing with it all for a long time and have wonderful advice ü§ç i very much understand! i‚Äôm 30 f dealing with sharing responsibility with my sister for my mom (70 f) and her care. my dad died about 6 months ago and my mom is still living at home but unable to do instrumental tasks (cooking, cleaning, filling her own meds). it‚Äôs been a massive struggle especially since i‚Äôm expecting my first baby in about 6 weeks. i get burnt out very easily and it‚Äôs so hard to not get frustrated. it‚Äôs hard, just starting out in your life, and having to take care of a parent. denied for what? big hugs. and if health insurance, etc. the disease i could almost cope with, but the shit system of us laissez-faire capitalist mangled hell care is the thing that's really messing me up. i understand.	0
hello so trigger warning i guess is in order but a week ago we had to put our dog down as she was in pain from a tumor and that night my grandma stopped eating and the morning after she stopped drinking so it was obvious she was starting to decline and looking to be entering the death process on  wednesday she seemed to get worse and worse by the day and by that morning her 02 sats were 'low 90s high 80s' friday she calmed down enough to have her go to a nursing home because her care was overwhelming mom and she required almost 24/7 care so we had her transported there and we came to visit that night and they had a o2 tube in her nose which confused us so we asked and they told us her 02 during transport was 71 so they put a tube in and then they just kept it going at the home i get them doing it during a transport but not at the home they say its for her comfort and wont prolong death but i dont buy it to be honest it seems like a part of death and i feel some people with alzheimers die this way so it seems like eliminating a way of death which to me is prolonging death at a certain point her body just wont function on that low of a oxygen level so giving her oxygen seems like prolonging i get that it might be for comfort but to me death is uncomfortable the body doesnt like dying i can understand the morphine and haldol because those dont do anything other than help with pain and restlessness it doesnt help life but the oxygen seems like it would help her live longer she needs to pass soon and quickly she wouldve hated living like this and she would want it to be as quick as could happen also this nursing home is questionable i went to check on her today and the door was wide open which would be fine if i didnt walk in on her completely naked on the bottom edge of her bed just sprawled out and she had a few visitors earlier shes supposed to get morphine every hour an haldol every two hours both people said in the few hours they were there they never had a nurse come in and they had to get them to go give her her medicine which irritates me so im kinda questionable on their opinion so id like an outside opinion  tl;dr: my grandma is dying shes at a nursing home and they have her on o2 which confuses me since it seems like it would prolong life the home says its just for comfort but it seems as if it would prolong life im all for comfort but death is uncomfortable and it seems like they are preventing that way of death so does o2 prolong life not an expert. my understanding is that oxygen just makes it easier to breathe, it doesn‚Äôt heal infection or damage to the lungs it just makes it so your lungs don‚Äôt have to work as hard for basic breathing. it‚Äôs not the same as intubation. my grandma died at home in march. she will just need a doctor referral, i'm pretty sure. also do you guys have a medical directive? we have one for my dad that covers all types of care and we made a decision as a family what we would allow and not allow. takes the pressure off last minute decisions. i am an rn on a dementia unit. i see this a lot. current belief is that supplemental oxygen is for comfort. in addition, we administer ativan liquid and morphine at scheduled intervals. most of my residents pass quietly and (i assume) comfortably. i assume your parents or other relatives are your grandmother's medical poa, and have already had end-of-life discussions to know what she would want. you don't need to understand the reasons for the interventions. if she is not being medicated on schedule, call it to the home's attention and ask for an explanation. also inform the medical poa, usually a relative.	0
hi there, my dad lives in a memory care unit. he has become aggressive with staff which is so opposite his personality. i know it‚Äôs just the dementia progression. he got admitted to psych this evening and they called me to tell me they had to restrain him to his bed because he assaulted a nurse. i am the only one responsible for his decision making/care and i just want to know what to expect. this is so painful; i can‚Äôt even believe this is a real illness. without having any information on your father's case: what other care options have been tried? we frequently have aggressive patients who only get combative during personal care. the kind choice can be to deal with a smelly resident, and reduce the amount of showers given etc. sometimes hygiene care really can't be avoided, but often the frequently can be turned down by a lot. same goes for 'having to sit at the table' or being woken up/ sent to bed/ interrupted from wandering etc. often the nurses are trying what they think is best, but it's not always what's right for the patient. your permission to adapt his care can go a long way. so sorry you're dealing with this aspect of the disease. is he on any mood stabilizers? i know what you mean about not being able to believe it‚Äôs a real disease. i am a nurse and we get situations like your dad very frequently. physical restraints are used temporarily until chemical restraints (mood stabilizer and such) are adjusted to a new level required to keep the patient calm. this stage of the disease lasts for a wide variety of time from person to person, but it doesn‚Äôt last forever. some it‚Äôs just a short time, they respond to medication quickly, some needs multiple readjustments of medication. allow the doctors to medicate your dad as much as necessary. in my experience, some doctors are too conservative with medication and the patient ends up in physical restraints for days. but finding that balance is hard, because you also don‚Äôt want the patient ‚Äúsnowed‚Äù or asleep for days due to medications. still, being asleep is better than being awake and restrained. it may trigger him more to have you visit so sometimes it‚Äôs a good idea to hold off, but you can check with his nurses about what his mood is prior to and after your visits to see how it affects him. when you do see your dad, try to think of him not as your dad but as someone who is afraid. it may help you to disassociate, at least during the visit. i would sign him up for the cassava sciences pre-screening for their drug in trial. every patient has shown improvement from as little as 27 days. it is on their website. please take a look. link for pre-screening ^^   above is a youtube link of testimonies from patient‚Äôs family members that are currently on the drug ‚Äúsimufilam‚Äù	0
my mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. we got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything 'clean'. mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her 'apartment' (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or  not), but she must have not locked it. we talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. so all seemed to be under control. however - my mother needs to feel secure in her room. i am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. tia. my husband who gets into my personal stuff at home, is now doing the same thing at adult day care. staff informed me yesterday he has been going through other people's purses or backpacks and taking items out. i asked him about this and he denied doing it, but i trust staff's memory of events better than i trust his! i know it's not the same as wandering, but kind of similar. no advice, just wanted you to know this is definitely a feature of the disease. good luck to your poor mom. could the facility alarm her door during sleep hours? i'm sorry, i find it totally unacceptable that patients are allowed to wander at night. there is all kinds of alarms/technology to prevent this. i saw one little old lady that would just up and slap other residents. it's on the facility to make sure residents are safe. you must stay on management, most are profit driven, but you are a vital link in oversight. raise hell if necessary, i'm sure your paying$$$_. your mom‚Äôs right to feel safe trumps this man‚Äôs freedom to wander at night. i have no doubt he has no clue as to what he is doing; nonetheless, the facility needs to control this behavior or he needs a new level of care. if this were happening to my mother i would be most unhappy. they need to handle it. you need to raise hell with the facility. that it happened once, you were understanding, they told you the solution they would implement, you accepted that, and then it happened a second time and that‚Äôs entirely unacceptable. it sucks for the family of the man, but you have your own loved one to worry about so i would say that if the staff isn‚Äôt capable of protecting your mother from another patient, either those staff members or that patient needs to be removed. and you want monetary reparation on top of that since you‚Äôre paying $$$ for the safety and security of the room and its occupant and you‚Äôre not getting that, twice now. say you‚Äôre considering leaving a couple of reviews online about the negligence of the staff there, and how unsafe your mom feels because they apparently have no alarms, locks, safety measures or competent staff in place to prevent people from wandering at night. that‚Äôll get their attention. don‚Äôt *expect* them to give you any compensation (and dont threaten to remove her, i‚Äôm sure they have a waitlist a mile long and will gladly take you up on that threat), but reminding them that you‚Äôre financially invested and have the power of google reviews might put a fire under their ass to do better. honestly though, get her on a waitlist for another facility. it seems as though you can‚Äôt trust the staff at this one to do their jobs. if the night staff get fired over this, and i say this as a professional caregiver myself, they absolutely deserve to lose their jobs for this level of negligence. it is not hard to prevent this situation with 24 hour awake staff plus modern technology...i‚Äôd worry about where they are dropping the ball in other places. or that despite the crazy amount of money each resident pays to stay there they are purposely understaffing to make more money. i know moving someone with dementia is hard and expensive but this is so unacceptable to me and would raise so many concerns about the quality of the staff and the safety measures they have in place. that man should never even be able to leave his room after bed time. ridiculous. i hope you get this sorted promptly, they give you a discount for her disrupted month, and they hire new night staff. oh my god.. i‚Äôm sorry but your poor mother, i can‚Äôt even imagine how terrified she must have been. this is unacceptable my dad was the wanderer but i sort of think he was doing it on purpose because the only part of his mind that worked was the, 'where da ladies at?' i sure hope he didn't scare anyone. bed alarm for him. maybe one of those child safety locks for her door.... so she can get out but it takes a non-dementia person to figure out how to open it what facility? i am looking for a good one for my dad. feel free to pm if you want.	0
phew, documentary filmmaking is running me ragged, but i got some time this week to write a couple of caregiver tales! [don't-care-caregivers: what are the options when you feel like you're out of options? ](  [what's the scoop, poop? i spill the dementia family caregiver beans on the rodgerthat podcast. ](  p.s. wow, i'm still reading but i had to stop to write this:   i'm just after another crazy episode with my mother, scrolling through reddit. with one hand on my head thinking of post here this exact same question! i just can't do it anymore. my life is ruining, i lost my job, i've depression, nobody want's to be with her because she was a horrible person all her life let alone stay and live with her. i lost my job, i  lost my gf, my family doctor already knows that i got depression because of this. she kick me out of the house at least 30 times during these 3 years after i spend a day collecting my stuff, hiring movers she then calls me anytime between 2 hours to 10 hours later begging me to come back. i've reached the point that i just can't do it anymore. i lost so many things in the process, i basically will have to rebuild my life when this is over. don't care caregiver should be a community flair. thanks for sharing as always!	0
my grandpa has been slowly losing his memories as alzheimer's takes its toll. he's recently been moved into the memory care unit of his nursing home, and myself and the rest of the family do what we can to visit and talk to him regularly. the thing is, grandpa has been a wickedly funny man his whole life, and yesterday he commented on his memory loss and the loops himself. i don't know who needs to hear this today, but growing older and losing one's memory is tragic and funny, all rolled up in a confusing yarn ball. its ok to do both at the same time. i was watching news with my grandma and bringing her cut up apples, smack dab in the middle of an ukranian war segment. i held my breath, this is it, a truth about life is coming. we look for the humor too. my grandma is still in assisted living. she getting closer and closer to needing more care. but so far she's able to stay pretty safe and independent in her little apartment. my grandpa passed almost 10 years ago. my wife and i have found out we are going to be parents. telling my mother in law that she is going to be a grandmother gets her excited everytime. it has its moments very rarely. we skyped with our daughter a few days ago and every time my wife walked past i would show her the phone and it was a new experience every time seeing the kid.	0
my grandma got diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia something like that  please tell me how bad it is im shaking she‚Äôs only 60   is it true she will only live about 6-7 more years? im 13 she won‚Äôt even live to have my first drink with me  is it really one step down from full alzheimer‚Äôs??? it's different for each person. i've heard of people who were diagnosed with alzheimer's and still living 20 years later! not the most common outcome, but i think i made my point. if a drink with your grandma was something you were looking forward to, you can do it now. one drink won't hurt anyone, even if you are just 13. i recommend reading the book ‚Äúsomebody i used to know‚Äù by wendy mitchell. she was also diagnosed with early-onset dementia around the same age. one possible benefit to an early diagnosis is that decline can be slower. my mother was diagnosed four years ago at 64 and while she has lost some cognitive abilities, her progression so far has been slow. guessing someone with dementia‚Äôs longevity is hard, but i would say enjoy the time you have with her now. having a loved one with dementia forces you to really live in the present moment with them. i believe you are asking about frontotemporal dementia (ftd)  with my wife it has been a vicious and fast progressing disease. i know at 13 you are ready to start talking about adult things, but the details and the way this disease changes a person is something everyone should avoid learning about. watching what this disease has done to my wife has been the toughest thing i have had to deal with in my life. my advice to you, is make memories with your grandma now, knowing that very soon this disease will change her into a different and very unpleasant person. all cases are different in terms of speed of progression. know this....your grandma will eventually act out in ways she can't control. remember it's not her, but her diseased brain. cherish the good times.	0
how does everyone handle things with their siblings when it's a parent who needs care? i don't know how to get conversations and plans going about my dad's care without starting a fight. hello,  i had a very similar situation with my sister. i was the live-in caretaker for my mom and step dad and she was in the same city. i was drowning in caring for them, having some mental health issues because of the toll of caregiver fatigue. we sat down with a social worker and talked about how i needed her support. progress was slow, but 4 years later she is my best friend and we depend on eachother a lot. our mom is now in the late stage and in a memory care unit. please give your sibling the offer of support before they reach that point. literally same scenario, my wife and i are the caretakers to my mother in law with mid stages alzheimers. her son who lives 10 mins away visits once or maybe twice a month. hasn't done much for her care and i believe doesn't like seeing his mother in her condition. unfortunately you cannot change them to make them care more, either they are willing or not. it's a bad situation and i would wish all parties put the same effort in. it's like every bad sibling interaction from childhood on is happening again with my sisters. it's tearing us apart and i'm thinking it'll not be repaired. my brain is tired tonight but it's like family roles, our roles as siblings and roles with parents have created patterns that got worse with ailing parents. if i could redo the last few years i'd ensure that my step up sister didn't take on so much. i'd also care less about worrying that i'd step on toes or hurt feelings and care more about stuff just getting done. the sibling who is good with your dad:  support her every way possible. bring meals, do chores, drive dad places, give her money and ask if there's anything else you can do. hint:  most caregivers could you use a respite caregiver so they can get to the dentist or have their hair cut. mention if he's losing weight, is he sleeping well, what goofy thing has he done lately (my dh recently peed in a wastebasket in the night, but didn't remember doing it). don't ask her for help, but at least she's in the loop when possibly bigger decisions need to be made. first we had to identify who our parents had put in charge if any. hunted for papers to find out who was the power of attorney. you could have a social worker come to your parents house with or without a nurse and evaluate your parents needs. once the social worker knows what is needed, a seperate meeting could occur with all family members present to hear what mom and dad need. responsibilities can be assigned to each in the sw presence to avoid conflict. remember though, you need to consider the life of each person. for example, i had a brother who was currently taking care of his inlaws. three of us really worked to help our parents out and we were successful. & tears. where there strengths were with our parents. if you don't have a poa then ask the social worker what can be done to do this. it might take a day in court to be established but will give you legal access to handling their affairs. i hope this helps.	0
my mom has been seeing a neurologist and a few months ago she took some kind of written test to see whether she has alzheimer's or not. i'm not entirely sure what the test results were as my mom can be rather private about her health and down play things, but the doctor ordered a brain mri for her. my mom sat me down yesterday and told me that the mri does show alzheimer's. she has not been back in to see the neurologist yet as the doctor is booked out pretty far, but my mom is on the wait list for an appointment so hopefully she gets in soon. i'm not sure how far along the alzheimer's is or if they can tell that from the mri, but my mom seems to think she only has 4-5 years left. i have suspected for a few months now that she may have alzheimer's as she has been having memory problems for a while (started when i was in high school) but have noticeably gotten worse recently. also, alzheimer's does run in her family. she did have a brain mri done 2-3 years ago (i'm not sure if it was related to her memory issues or not) and they said that everything was normal; i'm not sure if maybe they missed something or if there really were no signs on the mri yet. she forgets things we have recently spoken about, sometimes as close as ten minutes ago. she forgets what she was doing. she doesn't clean things up around the house (i.e her dog pooped indoors and she just left it there). she forgets to bathe. however, i do think things are worse than that. she wasn't even going to tell me the results of the mri and was going to pretend that everything was normal but my dad convinced her otherwise. she has not told my younger brother yet. i feel very lost. i'm about to be 24, so i know that i'm an adult, but i'm still finding my footing in the adult world and trying to figure out my place. i don't want to lose my mom. i know i have to step up and help her, though i have no doubt that she will try to leave me out of everything and handle it herself, as she doesn't want to feel like a burden though i have assured her that she is not one. i'm sure my dad will help her with things but, while they are still friends, they have been divorced for over a decade and he works long, demanding hours. i wouldn't mind moving in with her to help her but she will not let me. she says that she will stay in her house for now, and hire someone to come during the days to help her. and when that no longer works/helps, she will move into a care home. i just wanted to confide in y'all and hopefully get some advice. my mom has told me not to tell any of my friends, which i understand and respect, but it means that i have no one outside my family to talk to about this. for those who have a parent that has been affected by alzheimer's, what was it like? what should i prepare myself for? what is something that you wish you had been told? how do i help someone who feels bad about asking for help? any and all advice is helpful. going forward, you will find that unless someone has a parent with dementia, especially early onset, they just will not truly get what you are going through. having a grandparent with dementia is not the same thing. you will find that the best support and understanding you receive is from others in the same boat as you. hiring caregivers and then going into a facility and not looking to young-adult children to take on caregiving is 100% what's best for her and you. her words right now are very important - don't forget them. she wants you to remain her daughter, not become her caregiver. many adult caregivers of parents with dementia are totally breaking down under the stress of caregiving, and wondering what our parent would want if they were in their right mind, or if our parent would understand if we need a break and have to hire professionals or place them in a facility. you already have all that information right from your mom's own mouth. dementia varies a lot from one person to another so keep in mind that your mom's symptoms and experience may be different from what other people tell you about. also, unless your mom has vascular dementia and a history of strokes, i think her 4-5 year life expectancy prediction will probably be wrong. i'd like to go back to times that i previously was complaining about - because i didn't realize at the time how good things still were. i‚Äôm 20 years old, my grandma had dementia from around 70 i would say. she‚Äôs 80 now, however i haven‚Äôt had to take care of since 2 years ago. i wish i could give lots of great advice, but i‚Äôm still learning myself. also, it gets easier, you learn what works and doesn‚Äôt i was a few years older than you when my dad diagnosed. i‚Äôm so sorry you have to go through this. being young makes it even more unfair. i highly recommend getting an elder law attorney as soon as you can. they can help you get durable power of attorney, health care power of attorney, etc. they can also help you navigate your mom‚Äôs assets. its important to do this while your mom is still mentally capable. one thing that‚Äôs not fun to think about, but important, is to talk to your mom about her final wishes. you can plan and prepay for her funeral. you can ask the funeral home to store the funds in a way that makes it so medicaid can‚Äôt take them. it‚Äôs also important to make sure there‚Äôs nothing left unsaid between you and your mom. the alzheimer‚Äôs association helpline (800-272-3900) has helped me a few times when i had questions and i wasn‚Äôt sure where to turn to. they are extremely caring and helpful. i also recommend starting therapy and making sure you take care of yourself. it‚Äôs also important to make sure you still live your life, you only get one. i dont have much advice but ill share my story in hopes something resonates with you. i was 29 when my dad was originally diagnosed with ad in 2019 (since then was diagnosed with cbd/cbs). every day for a month straight after diagnosis, i cried. all day. i felt so lost too. i went to work at cried at my desk. but every time i saw my dad, i was okay. i didnt cry. things have progressed (or regressed) and its now hard to see him but i can cherish every second im with him. having him keep talking about childhood memories and music makes him light up he is so happy when he remembers the life hes lived. its such bs though that we have to go through this. i get so jealous when i see my friends with their parents, enjoying retirement. sometimes its oddly comforting to know that others your age are also dealing with this. my mom is much older than yours and she was diagnosed a year ago. i'm not sure how you can prepare yourself, but there are a lot of resources out there. [  i found the attached to be helpful. best to you and your family. my dad was diagnosed in 2015 when i was 19 and he was 62. he had been showing symptoms for many years. my dad is now in a full time care facility and he has lost all his abilities. i want you to know that it will be hard. you will be grieving and you will be frustrated with your mother. please be patient with her. i wish i knew how little time we actually had. sorry if my comments doesn't make sense. i dont really know what to mention as there's so many things. ask me anything if you want. in 2019, my mom, 61 years old, was diagnosed with early onset ad -- which, like your mom, ran in her family. unfortunately it's impossible to know exactly how much longer someone with eoad has, but generally, in the case of eoad, the long-term prognosis is not great. you're going to be taking things one day at a time. and then later it'll become one hour at a time. it's very likely she'll lose any social filter and start saying mean, hurtful things. prepare yourself now for these things so you don't end up taking them personally when they happen. my mom has just fairly recently lost track of her grandkids' names (there's only 3 of them) and about a year ago lost track of who's kids are who's and who's wife is who's, but she still seems to very clearly know my brothers and i.  it's the disease that's doing this to your mom and mine, and it's a fucking awful, no good, bag of shit disease. help out subtly when and where you can. if the dog pooped in the house and she's skipped over cleaning it, then just clean it and keep life moving on. keep tabs on her rx and daily intakes to make sure everything's happening as it should -- and nothing's happening that shouldn't be happening. do what you can to be as present and patient as possible. it's very, very hard on the family, but also it's our moms that are the ones constantly confused, disoriented, and trying to figure out day-to-day life when nothing makes sense anymore. another thing... be kind and patient with yourself too. take breaks when you need them. my dad was not diagnosed until 2018 with alzheimer's and we suspect he'd had it since 2009 or so. he had a severe decline over 2020 and we ended up needing to move him to memory care early 2021 as my mom could no longer care for him. my dad passed away at 71 in november of 2021 and the last few years of his life were some of the most challenging. if you have personal friends/family who have experience, reach out to them. i found this subreddit to be particularly helpful in my darkest moments. ask all the questions and get all the history and life stories while you can. good luck and god bless. i‚Äôm only 19, but my mother was diagnosed about a year ago (the date should pass any day now) through her spinal fluid. at the time she was a registered nurse, but just before the diagnosis she lost her job at trader joe‚Äôs. at that point, my father was giving her a lift to work and home every day. when i was 18, she destroyed her car in a wreck because she somehow completely missed seeing someone right in front of her. we managed to hide it from the insurance company but she no longer drives, which i think was the best decision. **if this hasn‚Äôt happened a lot yet, expect it to start. ü§ç the whole process is brutal. she had already stopped driving 3 years earlier. 2 years later she was already getting lost in her own neighborhood, wandering in parking lots when told to wait, and telling outlandish stories that made no sense and her memories were already bad at that point. by late 2016 (literally 10 years later), she was clearly already in late stage dementia and had no idea what was going on anymore. prior to that i was fortunate that i had older tenants that rented rooms in her house that kind of looked after her. my father who was divorced since i was a child also came around so that helped too. i finally had to move back with mom along with my family when she got to the late late stages of the disease in 2018. she got to the point where she would just wander mindlessly in circles around the house, talking to her delusions, and go to bathroom in trash cans, or on the floor at times. later that year she had no idea who i was anymore and i am her only child. in late 2020 she lost the ability to stand and has been bedridden ever since. she is currently 87 and is completely motionless for over 17 months stuck in a hospital bed and just mumbles to herself all day long. to say her existence is downright horrible is an understatement and we all suffer right along with her because we really can't go anywhere now and haven't done much of anything for about 4 years and i have to do literally everything for her. i truly believe my mom's case is an outlier case as most patients don't last this long from what i hear from others (even her own doctor put her on hospice 2 years ago and didn't think she would make it far along into 2021), yet here we are still. nothing about this disease is predictable or easy. some days are better than others, the worst years for me were 2018-2020 when she was basically an out of control angry zombie like personality and would try to cause damage with any items or furniture that she passed by. now she can't do anything so it's a more controlled environment with lots of downtime, but very hard to watch none the less. the hardest part for me now is juggling her care while trying to offer a normal childhood for my two kids, but fortunately my wife helps me alot with the things i just can't do right now. hope this helps, good luck! my best advice is a second opinion with a memory specialist neurologist. misdiagnosis is common in the 50s age group and a brain mri cannot show alzheimer's. they are not very diagnostic and at most you can try to appreciate patterns of atrophy typically seen in alzheimer's but it's not too absolute. a spinal tap looking for ad markers or an amyloid pet scan would be much much more useful than an mri. everything that you described is also seen in pseudo dementia as well so it is important to make sure a miss diagnosis has not occurred. my father is now mid to late stages and while i‚Äôm older than you this might help. try to spend plenty of quality time with your mom now and take pictures. eg go to parks, zoos, beach, hikes. make some nice memories for yourself. try to get your mom on a good diet now. decent nutrition will help keep her mind healthy longer, whether it‚Äôs meal delivery service or whatever. do those legal things, even though it will likely be awful. also find the care home she likes now so there are fewer questions later. best wishes i appreciate you sharing your story. 30 years old here with my mom getting diagnosed with eo a few months ago at age 59. it has rocked our world as it has not run in her family up until this point. i had joined a support group for a meeting but all the caregivers are also older and just felt like i couldn‚Äôt connect with them. if you or anyone else would like to connect just to talk and vent about being a young adult who has to deal with this shit situation, i‚Äôd love to find a way for us to find a forum to do so.	0
personally i'd rather see the alz association focus on getting long term care covered by medicare, using the same force and energy they're using for this drug. or they could do a better job of creating more local support groups. or publishing more useful guides - it's interesting to me that many of the great guides or books like teepa snow never seem to be recommended by them. rather than bankrupting medicare for a drug that doesn't work, money would be better spent on research into preventing dementia and providing care for people with this god awful disease and others that require long term care. heck, money would be better spent on covering dental care.	0
we too have gone to all finger food and an air fryer has helped quite a bit. wife gets ensure for breakfast. i bet dad would love that. thanks for posting! üòä really nice. for my mom, we found that small portions really helped. üíï yep, finger-food grazing plates are the way to go! a few years ago i got my mum sporks (spoon/fork) for when cutlery is needed - also makes it easier.	0
tl;dr: mom's sick and hostile towards me. how best can i help her, and keep us both safe, until the doctor sees her? my mom gets incredibly agitated when she's sick and with a fever. i do my best to remain calm and try to tell her reassuring words but it seems like it falls on deaf ears. i can't redirect her or distract her like the resources i've been find online say as she only gets more worked up and tells me things like i'm faking being nice to her. i've also tried being in a different room than she is so she can calm down on her own, but she meanders and eventually finds me again and gets worked up. i've tried looking around for other tips but it's not for anything as drastic as her pushing me. she's sick again and we're working on getting an appointment set up with her pcp asap. i don't mind so much that she's taking her frustrations out on me, granted i do get shaken up by it, but i just want her to be feeling better. generally she's been very sweet since she got diagnosed with early onset three years ago so the sudden mood changes are quick to be noticed and the four of us, my dad, two sisters, and myself, work as fast as we can to give her care. does your county/city have palliative care?palliative care has helped so much more with my dads mood issues that his primary care doctor. it might be worth it to see if they can help with your mom. her psychologist prescribed three basic antipsychotics that really helped, for my wife zoloft worked the best. but i started giving her more and more pills chasing good behavior. the psychiatrist adjusted her program and it has worked fairly well up to this point. she is taking eight pills a day and she does everything she can to avoid taking them.	0
this question was posed in 2017 and 2018 in this sub, but now that a bit more time has passed, i'm wondering if more people have read the book and tried the recommendations? i'm especially confused about how 'extreme' of a diet do we need to follow? and since  damage starts occurring in the brain starting in 30's / 40's, my partner and i want to make sure we follow a brain healthy lifestyle, given his family history. thank you!!! it‚Äôs not grounded in repeatable science. in other words, you can‚Äôt prove a causal relationship between the proposed diet and alzheimer‚Äôs progression. it‚Äôs unfortunate, but anything that claims to solve or cure alzheimer‚Äôs is unlikely to be real unless it‚Äôs brand new, and coming from a major medical institution or medical journal. sadly it is as horrible as bredesen, perlmutter, or oz. if you want a diet to help alzheimer's, cut out as much processed oils (canola oil etc) and with it, fried foods as possible. the genetic link between alz and dementia is explicitly tied to the oxidative byproducts of fats (all kinds). the last group is 5% of the population, and account for ~1% of cases (protective variant). the differences are related to the protein's ability to detoxify the lipid oxidation byproducts. exercise, sleep well, heart healthy diet while knowing that it might not work. saved you many pages.	0
i have a parent who tells me they've been diagnosed with alzheimer's. my relationship with the parent has been trying for my entire life due to their mental illness and, i believe, extreme narcissism. the issue i have is that i'm on my own and they're in one of the poorest states of the country, so, i'd be looking at some pretty limited options in terms of work and life, to say nothing of the fact that they've never really willingly been there since i graduated in terms of safety net or helping me in my career. the parent has a partner but they're in their 80s so... honestly, and i may get tons of shit for this. i would suggest avoiding completely uprooting your life, career and future for a parent you are not close with, and harbor any amount of resentment towards. i honestly don't believe just bc you birthed a kid or two, that you're entitled to their time/effort and anguish..... especially if you were  a shit parent. and taking care of a much loved relative w/ alzheimer's is hard on the good days. i would see about taking family leave for as long as you can, in order to try and get a sense of what they have going on now/what she needs & how to set things up for management from afar. get medical poa at minimum, switch all physician contact info to you, also look into financial poa if possible. (may be much harder w/ a spouse or partner involved) if she is still fairly self sufficient, i would try and find a facility that starts with assisted living, and has steps for future memory care. (we wish we could have gotten my grandma into her facility sooner, when she was more 'with it' she's always been very social, and if she had more time to adjust prior to decline, we think she would be more comfortable now) if you can get her set up where she's comfortable, and manage her care from afar i would, in your situation. that or find a facility close to where you are now, and move her there for you. if career prospects and everything is as bad as you say, i think avoiding it would be overall better. they moved closer to me, a nearby city where 2 siblings live so i don't get the brunt of it. it's a lot of work, tons of paperwork and research as they decline. from my own experience, a rocky relationship gets worse. i have a really hard time fighting my own feelings and being kind when i just want to walk away. maybe it'd be different if my mother liked me but who knows. if it's affordable this is the time to look into transitional living, independent to memory care. it can be complex, so much to factor in. oh jeez i'm sorry to sound so negative! it's just a struggle i'm currently dealing with. i have the opposite situation as you, my dad is the kindest, sweetest man i‚Äôve ever known. he‚Äôs in an ‚Äúapartment with help‚Äù (memory care) 10 minutes away which is centrally located between my siblings and i. and it can still be really stressful. my mother died suddenly in november 2020. i believe it was due to the stress of caregiving. add to that the narcissism of your parent and other mental health issues you‚Äôve mentioned, and uprooting your life and moving to a place with limited career options sounds like a dream come true for a narcissistic parent and a nightmare for the child of a narcissist. unless they‚Äôre willing to give you poa or move to ‚Äúan apartment with help‚Äù i personally wouldn‚Äôt move there. if they expect you to move there and be their whipping boy/girl for the rest of their life i would make it clear it‚Äôs not happening. and then i would expect them to say what an awful son/daughter you are because that‚Äôs what narcissists do. i‚Äôm so sorry you have to go through this. please keep us updated! i found a local support group for adult children of alzheimer‚Äôs patients through alz.org. if you have to be the primary caretaker, move them to you, or both of you move somewhere with max. options and support. my family and i did exactly this about 1.5 years ago. don't give up your job and social network to become a caretaker to an aging narcissist. nope, you'll simply get verbally abused.. we moved my mil from florida to nc to live with us instead.	0
my dad is 50. i‚Äôm his primary caregiver, he has early onset alzheimer‚Äôs and every day i see him get worse. every day when i wake up i feel this gaping hole in my chest, and by the time i go to bed at night it‚Äôs so bad i can barely breathe from it. had to get therapy for it still working on this. end of last year my wife started asking me things that made it clear that at certain times, she didn't know who i am. 'where do you live? but every day is a little worse: more uncertainty, more people and places gone. (it is right next to the bed). so coping is really, so far, just a matter of keeping perspective. i fear that one day, probably very soon, reality will hit. i think coping is a matter of letting go of how you want it to be and instead, knowing  what to expect. (and, of course, acting accordingly)   ^(not sure this is helpful. i think i just wanted to type this out to read it back to myself) i try to remember simple is better. simple answers, simple expectations and try to care for myself. i help my mother with my dad, they live with my husband and myself. i vent regularly to my husband. but i also take antianxiety meds. in started then not long after my dad was diagnosed i did try to wean off them butt i got cancer and went back on. make sure you get assistance. it can be a family member taking over for an evening or an side. you gotta take breaks, even if you do absolutely nothing during those breaks. it's mostly a slow process. my mother struggled with expecting my dad to still be able to do things and communicate but she adjusted. just remember to take care of yourself. my dad got diagnosed at 61/62 for early onset but he was showing signs before that and let me tell you, coping is really hard. try to put yourself in the mindset of ‚Äòthey cannot help it, they‚Äôre not trying to annoy you‚Äô ‚Ä¶being primary caregiver is a huge burden to carry so try to get as much external support as you can. my brothers and i would work from my parents‚Äô house 1-2 days per week to take care of him while my mom worked, my aunts and uncles would all come by as often as possible to help too. he‚Äôs now in a nursing home at 66 because he couldn‚Äôt walk and my parents house was becoming a huge danger to him but we visit him every day and feel a little lighter knowing he‚Äôs in a place where they have the tools and machines to get him through the day. i try to remember simple is better. simple answers, simple expectations and try to care for myself. i help my mother with my dad, they live with my husband and myself. i vent regularly to my husband. but i also take antianxiety meds. in started then not long after my dad was diagnosed i did try to wean off them butt i got cancer and went back on. make sure you get assistance. it can be a family member taking over for an evening or an side. you gotta take breaks, even if you do absolutely nothing during those breaks. it's mostly a slow process. my mother struggled with expecting my dad to still be able to do things and communicate but she adjusted. just remember to take care of yourself.	0
my father (m, 70) has been confined to a wheelchair for about 15 years, and is reliant on help for even getting out of bed and going out and about. my mother (f, 61) is there to assist him, and we are lucky to be able to afford carers who tend to him. recently, over the last few years, he has become noticably forgetful - from both small things, such as what day it is, what he had for lunch, or what time someone is supposed to come over, to other more things such as my brother's birthday, his cousin's name, whether people are dead or alive, etc. sometimes he will ask the same question 2 or 3 times during lunch or dinner, not realising that we have spoken about it already barely 5-10 minutes earlier. it has reached the stage where it is noticable even to people who don't live with him, but are meeting him socially. the problem is - he is refusing to acknowledge these things happening. in one instance, even when on text message he mentioned something unfathomable, and we tried to show it to him as 'proof', asking him what he was trying to say, he just shuts up and shuts everyone else out. looking at early symptoms of alzheimer's, he is displaying a number of them: forgeting about recent conversations or events; forgeting the names of places and objects; asking questions repetitively; becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things. but he refuses to see a doctor. i really am not sure how i even proceed with this - i do not live in the same city as my parents, and i know that my mother is quite anxious about what the future holds. in her opinion, even if we just know what is happening, either way, at least it makes it easier to deal with - if a diagnosis can be confirmed, wouldn't it be better to start treating with medicines as early as possible? and if he is being this stubborn now, and he does indeed have alzheimer's, what is it going to be like as it progressively gets worse? in the last month itself i have felt it get worse. any advice is appreciated, both on how to approach my father and try to make him see a doctor, as well as how i can help my mother cope better with this. thanks in advance! you can't really treat it very effectively, so i wouldn't stress about getting a diagnosis, unless you expect you'll need it to get subsidized care or some other form of government help. does your father visit the doctor at all? my grandma got a mental ability test during a routine checkup at her usual general practice doctor. you do just a couple of things, doesn't take long and it's enough to get the papers. have your mother talk to the doctor beforehand about what's been happening. i would request that the doctor tells him what kind of test is being done, my grandma felt entrapped a bit, because it wasn't explained clearly to her. does he take pills as is now? it's more important to start figuring out how you'll deal with more and more advanced care your father will most likely need. can you mother handle it alone or should you start looking for help? do you have to enroll him in a home sooner rather than later because of waiting lines? best to be prepared. start educating yourself and your mom about the disease (and i mean dementia here as a broad umbrella term, i don't think a specific diagnosis is very useful in patients with gradual onset over a couple of years), it's more about coping with it for carers. you have to stop caring about repeating things and getting asked the same questions, takes a little practice to get used to it. for example, my grandma always has this one story about someone stealing her bed sheets (partly true story, partly i removed some when i moved in with her). i stopped convincing her that it didn't happen, i just listen to her, confirm that stealing is horrible and that a bad thing did indeed happen to her, but that she is safe now. that way we both remain calm and move on with our day. the patients usually don't really know what's going on anyway (my grandma doesn't really remember, that she doesn't remember, if that makes sense). you gain nothing (i'd argue that you often end up achieving the opposite, just causing stress to both parties) by making your father admit he has memory issues, because he'll forget about it anyways and you'll be doing it all over again the next day. i'm sorry you're going through this. i've been going through this too, and it is probably the hardest part of the condition... the fact that they can no longer be reasoned with because reason doesn't get through. there's an account that i follow on instagram (i am in no way affiliated with them, it's just been a really helpful account) that posted something recently. when my dad was at a stage that it sounds like your dad was at, he was already out of it enough that we could lie or just not tell him we were taking him to a doc. i think we booked the appointment (you could explain to the docs office what was going on so they'd be ready for complications or resistance) and we might have told him but he forgot. then on the 30 minute trip there, im pretty sure we told him we were going to the bank, or for a doctor appointment for me, or going shopping. he sure wasn't comprehending the appointment was a neurologist for him. when in the docs office he was annoyed with the doc, and offended at being asked the 'stupid questions' that 'of course he knew' but couldn't answer. and thats how we got him his preliminary diagnosis and how we got him to all the other follow up appointments. this really works depending on how long they can retain a convo for tho. if your dad remembers a convo from yesterday, it might not work. if he cant retain for an hour, maybe? you could try taking him on an actual nice short day out and see how long he retains things from point to point. alternatively maybe you could luck out and find a doc who makes house calls? i do encourage you to try tho, mainly because of the chance that its *not* alzheimer's and is something treatable or even reversible. a lot of things can cause dementia and they need to be ruled out. sometimes, the earlier you catch a cause, the better the outcome too. one thing, has you or your mom looked into long-term memory care insurance? we just learned about this, but you can only get it before the insured person has been diagnosed with anything (with a broad definition of ‚Äòdiagnosed‚Äô). it might cost a bit now, but might really help you and your family in the long run. my husband does not  like to go to the doctor either. it‚Äôs probably best to make the appointment and not tell him until the day of. its not worth arguing with someone who has dementia , if he does have it. you could tell the doc about your concerns before hand and then tell your dad its just a routine check up . the doctor will just ask a few questions and judge his response. you can lie  to your dad about the reason for the appointment, if he asks . good luck . i  think i  know what you are going through. that was me for the last 2 years with my dad. two weeks later he had a referral for a senior eval. i accompanied him to the appt. and he scored a 22/30 on their exam recommended additional follow up, therapy etc. wouldn‚Äôt even commit to scheduling a re-exam in 12 months. so.. baby steps, i guess. now i work on follow up and recommended action (is his house safe to age in place, etc).	0
hey there, i've been following this sub for a while and i really appreciate that it exists. my grandma - who means the whole world to me - was diagnosed with pca/benson's syndrome (a rare, visual variant of alzheimer's) two years ago. but her health has drastically deteriorated in the past month. i‚Äôm not her primary caregiver but i check up on her every other day and make sure to cheer her up. we live in armenia where resources/awareness are very limited, so i‚Äôm hoping to engage directly with people who understand what i‚Äôm going through. ideally, i want to find or create a virtual support group for people who have a family member with pca or dementia in general. any words of encouragement or advice will be highly appreciated. thank you in advance. i‚Äôm so sorry, hun‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm all in for a support group, maybe on telegram? i'll join as well. contact a geriatrics department or agency on aging, letting them know you want to set this up. even with limited resources, it costs them nothing to post a flyer or connect you with an outreach worker.	0
nan it‚Äôs important to not remind her of the dog‚Äôs death if she asks where the dog is. when this happened to my dad, we always made up some excuse like the dog was at the vet or getting groomed. after a while, he forgot about the dog. sometimes it is best to fib for her comfort. you can say she went to the groomers. the excuse doesn‚Äôt even need to be a good one since she won‚Äôt remember it anyway. say the dog is out for a walk, or the vet, or at the dog park. my first suggestion is: give it time because sad to say, she may forget about her dog or forget how important it was to her. when my mom‚Äôs beloved cat passed away she kept forgetting too and would get sad every time. now she barely remembers the cat at all. she has pictures of him and sometimes she says what a great cat he was, but most of the time i don‚Äôt think she is clear on how much she loved it so it doesn‚Äôt bother her anymore. also, i have a cat now and she focuses on him now. so my 2nd suggestion would be to get her a new dog to help her focus on that, but only if there is someone living with her that can make sure the dog gets fed and walked in case she forgets to. when my mom would ask where he was, i'd choke up and she'd see my reaction and question me even more.	0
my dad received his diagnosis during covid. he had a virtual 2-session ‚Äúinterview‚Äù with a neuro-psychologist from the neurologist‚Äôs office. granted, the mri/ct did show some atrophy as well, but the actual diagnosis came after this virtual meeting. my dad is 70, isn‚Äôt the most social person, and isn‚Äôt used to virtual appointments. the whole thing didn‚Äôt go well. nonetheless, we toughed through. her findings were that he presents with alzheimer‚Äôs and general anxiety. just curious how else someone gets formally diagnosed. i'm a psychologist who diagnoses people with dementia. the gp refers them to us. we test their cognitive abilities (2h assignment) and talk to the family+client (1h). the testscores then get compared to people in their age and education bracket. the dementia diagnosis is usually quite clear from that. this may sound like it's too vague, but you can look up the mmse to get a sense of these types of tests. keep in mind that a score below 25 means something is definitely wrong, as the test is so easy that regular, healthy people should make it flawlessly. being unable to do simple math, remember 3 words, or know what season we're in says a lot about their minds already. this gets combined with the information from the family: can't remember appointments, unlearned how to work the tv, needs help with finances these days, confabulating stories, etc. all of these are outside the norms for normal ageing. i'm not sure i made a comprehensive or coherent response, feel free to ask for clarification. my dad was diagnosed with probable alzheimers, i believe in 2019, after an in person visit with a neurologist who specializes in cognitive decline. i know it involved an mri and i'm pretty sure it involved blood work. imo atrophy on an mri/ct is how the neurologist made the diagnosis. the facetime meetings were just to confirm he had the symptoms. i am not an expert, i just have my wife‚Äôs situation to base my opinion on. i started trying to get my wife diagnosed when she was 55. the neurologist said it was not likely she had dementia based on her age. in addition to the ungodly number of tests and appointments with specialists, she had three or four mri/ct scans. i have been told it is very difficult to detect early stage dementia with an mri/ct scan. finally the results from a radiated glucose pet/ct scan was interpreted for lewy bodies. a couple years later based upon her behavior the neurologist changed her diagnosis to ftd. my mother was diagnosed last year (the 1-year mark should pass any day now), about a month before i turned 19. i think they used spinal fluid. i‚Äôd had my suspicions of it since i was around 15-16, but getting the diagnosis and having my fears confirmed was like having a brick thrown at me. ‚ô° my mom was diagnosed after about 2 years of no pricing some mild symptoms (being forgetful, having trouble keeping up with conversations). it was june of 2020 when she got her initial mci diagnosis. we get her reevaluated this year and got mild alzheimer‚Äôs diagnosis which is what we were expecting. she currently cannot complete instrumental tasks without assistance (cooking, cleaning, filling pills, some driving) if progressed enough, alzheimer's can be fairly easy to diagnose and would not require more than an initial meeting. that said, i don't put much stock into telehealth/virtual neuropsych evaluations when it comes very early stage symptoms; especially in those of an age that are completely unfamiliar with the concept of virtual doctor visits and videocalls. late last spring my father had a uti. while they were treating the uti he just shut down. was stiff as a board for about a month in the hospital until they brought out other neurologists. in the process of trying to figure out what was going on (turns out parkinson's), they discovered that he does have alzheimers. prior his doctor just kept saying 'he's getting old that's all'.	0
just got this from mum after doing sunday lunch. looking after her is so challenging at times but fuck me that's made me well up. a rare moment of thinking i am doing something right mom was at my appointment. i know it never feels like enough but you're doing great. big hugs	0
had to go on a walk because grandma refuses to go to bed. but insists she will be up for church at 9am (she will not, then blame me for not waking her). had to cancel a 3pm remote piano lesson and a midday home haircut this week because she wouldn‚Äôt get out of bed. anyone got ideas for readjusting sleep patterns, or should i just cancel everything? bedtime and wakeup routines are your friends. they won't take effect immediately, but the body learns to adjust to patterns. examine what is going on evenings that might rev her up, like too much screen time. have wakeup time be the same every day. good luck.	0
nan early onset alzheimer‚Äôs runs in my family‚Ä¶i‚Äôm 35 and have been taking unisom for the past 2 years‚Ä¶i‚Äôve noticed not being able to remember if i fed my dog or not lately as well as cannot recall certain words (more than feels ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù) doing research and unisom is an anticholinergic which is linked to dementia risk‚Ä¶i want to go talk to a neurologist. has anyone gotten tested for the genes that cause early onset alzheimer‚Äôs? trying to do all the research i can and of course very worried if i myself will get this terrible disease. wtf. i'm pregnant and the one thing they recommend to sleep at night is unisom. why are people pushing these drugs if they have dementia risks? i was taking kirkland sleep aid (doxylamine succinate, same ingredient as unisom i think) which is considered to increase dementia risk. i stopped taking it and now i sleep like shit again, which is also linked to alzheimer's risk. and yes, i have a copy of the late-onset gene. not sure what to do over here. i exercise like mad to try to make myself sleep, including cardio and weights, but i wake at 2 am every fucking morning. look into the dian network they have great resources. it‚Äôs for dominantly inherited alzheimer‚Äôs and they have great resources for family members that are concerned they might have inherited it as well as studies and genetic counseling and forums on it. might not be helpful for your specific case but it was for me and my brother as early onset alzheimer‚Äôs has been in my family for a few generations. i think you should definitely talk to a neurologist. honestly, low chance but, might have a legal case against unisom if you suffered real harm from their product. medications like unisom( anticholinergic antihistamines) do worsen cognition in the elderly/dementia patients but it is unlikely that it actually contributes to or causes the disease itself. the data suggesting there is a causal link also included anti-depressants, anti-parkinsons drugs, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and so on and ranged from 55-year-olds to 100-year-olds. the 50+% dementia risk claimed is really talking about those other very powerful drugs and their anticholinergic properties are minimal, tbh. the other aspects of those drugs are likely what is damaging. the 12% difference in these numbers seems in line with the average % of dementia onsets within the age group studied and may just be circumstantial with the aging population. the study showed that antipsychotics have a 70% increased risk of dementia (interestingly 109% increase at lower dose) but this is misleading because the anticholinergic properties of anti-psychotics are minimal and likely unrelated. edit:   here is the study if you would like to check it out. table 5 is most useful. 'a total standardized daily dose (tsdd) was calculated for each patient with a validated assessment based on strength, daily dose, and length of use for each of 56 drugs with anticholinergic properties.' i just went through cognitive testing at my neurologist‚Äôs recommendation and they discovered i have eoa. i have other issues that led to the testing but the word searching/aphasia has been going on for over a year or so. the testing is long, a full day‚Äôs worth, it‚Äôs exhausting, but it was worth it to know where i stood. good luck!	0
any ideas appreciated! this month i (clinical researcher and prior mri training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family). it began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed tia?). since then, she‚Äôs been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. pcp told her to follow up in a year! i told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then i read through all the reports: mri shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says ‚Äúalzheimer‚Äôs‚Äù. but she was ultimately diagnosed as ‚Äúmild neurological disorder‚Äù and won‚Äôt get meds until she becomes severe. my friend said he was told there‚Äôs nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so i‚Äôve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. what else can be done for her that i‚Äôm missing?? thank you!! i‚Äôm in uk so it‚Äôs probably different but even now my dad is diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs rather than mci which is all they‚Äôd say initially, it hasn‚Äôt unlocked anything. the only thing he is prescribed is anti depressants. afaik there are meds which may slow decline but certainly won‚Äôt reverse it, and it‚Äôs unfortunately a disease with an inevitable decline. i‚Äôd suggest as an initial port of call too to start looking in to practical things like power of attorney, sorting financial affairs, looking at what support there will be for carers in home and out of home when the time comes the current approach to alzheimer‚Äôs (imo) is shameful. bureaucracy will close the door to alternative approaches and then make you feel stupid for asking. whoa, i thought alzheimer's drugs including memantine and donepezil are most effective in early stages! behavioral interventions are probably more important: adequate nutrition, social contact, fall prevention, things like that. if she's living at home, she's probably endangered. you don't mention where you are or what kind of funding. that is helpful in giving advice. if they are in the us and paying health insurance may as well use that mofo to the fullest.	0
need help please. my daughter is visiting for a long period with her dog. my mother keeps saying it‚Äôs ‚Äòher‚Äô dog and gets mad when my daughter takes her dog for a walk or feeds her. mom keeping getting upset and telling everyone to leave ‚Äòher‚Äô dog along. thanks so much. have you considered getting your mother a stuffed animal dog? maybe one that‚Äôs the same color as your daughters dog, if you can. that‚Äôs what worked with my mom, we got her the joy for all robotic cat that purrs and meows and everything and she‚Äôs as happy as a clam. is it possible to have something to distract her when your daughter goes out for walks and move the dogs food bowls somewhere that mom doesn't go often? this disease is frustrating because so often there are no solutions outside of redirection or changing our own behavior we're starting to have this issue with my sister's cat. we live at home with our dad to take care of our mom and lately mom has been claiming the cat is hers and gets authoritative over it whenever we take actual care of it. mom misreads its body language frequently so it's difficult to address her behavior and the cat's at the same time. she has her own stuffed dog and absolutely loves it but chooses the live cat whenever both are in the same room. i usually end up hovering nearby to supervise that their interactions are safe for both but that tends to agitate mom and gets more protective of the cat. how is your mom's balance? if she's able to walk much and the dog's properly leashed trained, maybe see if going out on walks together with your daughter might help? if that's not an option, perhaps keeping the dog and mom separate and out of eye sight during feeding and walking time might work. or ask your daughter to have someone else watch the dog. try not to tell your mom that it's not her dog as that will only make her more defensive. if she starts to get super possessive, maybe the dog should be kept somewhere else close while your daughter visits and can take care of her pet without your mom being upset. i know some patients do well with baby dolls too.	0
so, it‚Äôs a bit of a mess of a story, but my paternal grandfather was recently admitted to a facility because of dementia, and his kidneys have begun to fail so he doesn‚Äôt have much time left. i am currently 22, and i haven‚Äôt seen or heard from him since around 2010 due to my dad making the decision to cut contact with him due to other mental health problems of his to keep both of us safe. i have mental health problems myself, and they of course have gotten a lot worse since these developments. i feel selfish because i know how much being visited means to him right now, but all i do is freeze and lose the ability to speak when in the room with him, and then begin drinking heavily for the rest of the day after that. i‚Äôm hoping anyone out there has any suggestions or insight on the best course of action. should i try harder to suck it up and be there for him, both so he‚Äôs less alone, and so that i won‚Äôt feel like i didn‚Äôt do enough after he‚Äôs gone? or maybe i should stay away since it‚Äôs so high stress on my end and for the people around me worrying about my addiction problems coming back, and i‚Äôll just have the pleasant memories of all the things we used to do together when i was really little. i don‚Äôt know him very well anymore but from how i used to know him, i believe he would want me to only remember him as he was when i was little. thank you for reading, i know how awful dementia is, and i‚Äôve handled it before, but its completely different when it‚Äôs family. i‚Äôm very worried about your stress levels. it‚Äôs not worth it if your sobriety is at risk. could you honor your grandfather in some other way, that would not risk your sobriety? if there is a funeral, they will need memory boards. get black tri-fold poster boards at a craft store, and put pictures of your grandfather in better days on it? you could read to him, or bring some lotion and put rub some into his hands and onto his feet. that is very soothing. you could hum a song while doing it. this would be as much for him as it is for you. if you can picture doing these things for him, without your stress levels going up, then maybe you can do it. if picturing this makes you anxious, i feel that it is not safe for you to do it. your grandfather would not want you to risk your sobriety for this. good luck, and please keep us posted. could you try going with your dad? might help take some of the pressure off. also, maybe try not having high expectations when you go. just sitting there with him is more than enough. turn the tv on, read a book. maybe build up to the small talk once you‚Äôve sat there for a little while. you also don‚Äôt have to stay long. whatever you can endure is fine. if you are coping after a visit with him by drinking heavily for the rest of the day, you are damaging yourself. you have a responsibility to yourself and the people around you to keep yourself physically and mentally healthy. if your grandfather can still read or has someone who can read to him, you might consider sending a note or card instead of some visits. you want to let him know that he is loved, and you can do it this way. it‚Äôs probably better - for him and for you - than physically being present but not being mentally or emotionally present when visiting him. as someone who lives with liver disease, i want you prioritize your own health during this difficult time. i understand it‚Äôs hard; my step mother is dealing with dementia herself. the problem is that, there are no warning signs. you won‚Äôt feel any symptoms until it‚Äôs already too late. the liver is a miraculous organ that helps to regulate hundreds of functions in the body. many don‚Äôt realize that the damaged liver itself isn‚Äôt always the problem, but instead causes all kinds of other health issues in the body as a result of being diseased. if the disease progresses far enough to cause scarring (cirrhosis), there‚Äôs no undoing the damage. it will shorten your life, and you‚Äôll spend that time with significant health issues. so please take care of yourself during this difficult time. if you absolutely have to see your grandfather and risk your sobriety over it, consider having a buddy that doesn't drink and who you trust to stay with you before, during, and for some time after your visit. you could maybe also ask the people who tend to him if there's anything he'd like/need that you could send them? not sure how applicable that would be, but it might be worth it if you could help him and not risk your well-being simultaneously.	0
one of my parents has been leaving salt and pepper shakers in the microwave a few times and (from what i can tell) not thinking it was them who did it. i only brought it up the first time but am afraid to again. my mom‚Äôs family has a strong history of dementia and her own mom (my grandma) now has it. it seems like all women on her side at some point get dementia. so i think it‚Äôs my mom who did this but i don‚Äôt know. does anyone have advise on what to do? i need to be sensitive about it all. also my mom recently picked up smoking weird again for pain so i‚Äôm wondering if perhaps she‚Äôs just high, but given her close family history that seems unlikely.	0
grandfather is on oxygen, doesn't leave the house at all, he doesn't want to deal with her, so he lets her drive and do whatever she wants, she crashed 2 hours away from us and we only found out that she crashed because someone helped her at the crash. i know it‚Äôs almost impossible to have a doctor take a license away, i‚Äôve been through it and know other people who have too. i had a customer tell me to they removed the battery and the starter relay from their dads vehicle, that‚Äôs what i would do. if they catch on, or you don‚Äôt want to hide what you‚Äôre doing, tell them. tell them you cannot have your grandmas death, or the death of anyone else, on your conscience because of their negligence. as a mom with a toddler, this scares the hell out of me. would you rather have a mad grandpa and aunt on your hands, or a dead child? maybe i went to worst case scenario, but it happens. remember almost all ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù are preventable. i used to drive my grandma anywhere, any time i could to stop her from driving. maybe try to set a schedule so everyone can get grandma where she needs to go. be prepared for people like my shit uncle, who said, it‚Äôs not that i can‚Äôt help, i choose not to. thanks for caring so much, you‚Äôre a good person. what you can do may vary by your state. you can check your state's dmv to see who reports of a medically impaired driver may come from, but in general it would be a doctor or law enforcement. hipaa won't allow them to tell you what, if any, action they take but it doesn't prevent you from giving information to them. i'd keep the message short and succinct with as much supporting detail as you know. in the state of ny, when my dad had his accident and the paramedics/hospital recognized he had a cognitive issue, they filed it with the police and dmv. he was forced to take a road exam with an occupational therapist who works with the motor vehicles agency. only he could pass/fail my dad. removed a lot of the pressure from us on deciding if dad could drive again. he needs to go back every 6 months. see if your state has something like this. now my dad has lost all interest in driving. we had my mom evaluated by an occupational therapist who specializes in driving evaluations for dementia and alzheimer‚Äôs patients. you may want to mention, that because of her dx, and now a history of not being capable behind the wheel, your grandfather (or anyone who may have poa) could be held liable for any damages/injuries in any future accidents... try and convince her to stop driving and get other family members on board. report her to the state dmv. they'll take her license away.	0
for those of you interested in the science of treating alzheimer's, there was a multi-day conference over the past few days where a lot of companies laid out how they've been approaching these different neurodegenerative diseases. [  so far, biogen has a product that passed fda trials for treatment of alzheimer's called aduhelm. it was initially listed at $56,000 for a year's worth of medication which was a staggering amount of money. this was a obviously a real downer because i was initially excited to hear biogen get the nod from the fda until i heard about the price. if anyone has experience with it, i'd be interested to hear about it. what's great though is that time is running out on them being the only treatment. it turns out that there are actually a lot of other companies that want a chance to perform trials and get something to market which will likely reduce the price and the possibility that one of these companies will knock it out of the park and for a reasonable price. two other hopefuls:  promis: [  alzheon: [  merck had one get to phase 3 trials, but wasn't able to pass. i believe they're still working on it. i think there are other big pharma projects as well. the cruddy thing about the biogen drug is it did not actually show cognitive improvement in the participants, rather it showed that it can clear amyloid which they think can slow progression. while we wait for a drug that is a cure, there are great programs to help people with the symptoms they have. this is a great one sponsored by nia  not trying to imply support for or against, but if you wanted to get involved in trying to lower the cost of aduhelm, the alzheimer's association has been trying to get it accessible to all for a while:   you could see if there is an alzheimer's association near you, especially their local advocacy activity. in my state they have us talking to lawmakers to push local and, if you want, national issues like aduhelm pricing, and using social media or whatever you're comfortable with. science moves slow...its the nature of science. ..and legislation can be slow too, but advocacy is one way us ordinary folks can speed some types of help along.	0
my dad (78)is in the hospital as he has quickly advancing alzheimer‚Äôs and he wasn‚Äôt eating or drinking enough. it is no longer a medical emergency ( it was)but he‚Äôs still not getting around like he was or taking in as much food as he should. my mom can‚Äôt take care of him. problem is a few months ago he was so healthy and active and still driving etc. they are recommending a home. when i visit he constantly says he‚Äôs doing better and eating, doing his physical therapy etc etc. he‚Äôs asking why he‚Äôs still there and wants to be discharged. i haven‚Äôt told him yet but keep saying ‚Äú just a bit longer‚Äù and ‚Äú once you get your strength back‚Äù. or i play dumb like i don‚Äôt know either. how do i handle? tia in general, the recommendation is no, don't tell the person with dementia--it would usually be more for the person telling to feel better than for the person with dementia. 'just a bit longer when you get more strength back' sounds like a fine answer in the meantime. when it comes time for him to move, some people frame the move to memory care as 'your doctor wants you to be in a special rehab until you improve more,' but that's a case by case thing. we told my dad the house needed construction work and it was dangerous so he had to stay at the home. we never used the words memory care or nursing home and acted like it was a hotel or apartment. he's been there about a month and has stopped asking to go home. quick decline sometimes means uti. some doctors can remember stuff but aren't critical thinkers. did they check? morally, i think keeping the present pleasant and positive is the way to go. i'm caring for my father who has alzheimer's and as much as my brain has conflict with white lies my priority is his immediate comfort. his ability to grasp concepts are declining so keeping things simple is important. best of luck to you, it's a journey that's for sure. don't know what your folks money situation is like, cause every option is costly. is there any possibility of getting your mom some assistance and keeping him at home. wish there were good options, but there really are not. my mom has been in memory care for years and while it is necessary, it's horrible. if you dad is still somewhat functional he will probably be very unhappy. good luck, and prayers for you and your family. no chance of any younger relatives to move in with them? alzheimer's disease does not advance remotely that quickly. has he had a proper work up from a neurologist? i would assume they checked for uti? uti's are notorious for causing complete delirium in elderly patients and can mimic a fast progressing dementia, however most of the time the patient returns to baseline after some time has passed and it has been fully treated. other possibilities would include nmda encephalitis and other autoimmune encephalitis diseases which can progress rapidly. the most common finding though is that the patient has been declining for years but it just went unnoticed because people are so used to covering for them until they're unable to do more simple things. if he hasn't had a proper neurological workup that's what i would recommend. as far as the nursing home, i can't imagine it will go well if he just shows up at a nursing home and no one told him he was going there. it really depends on how well he would probably tolerate that news. but i have seen families just bring their loved one to a nursing home that they never knew they were going to and he became so combative that he was kicked out of the nursing home fairly quickly. i also recommend a very deep research into the nursing homes available as most of them have pretty shady reputations. by any chance did he experience a stroke? my grandmother on my dad‚Äôs side (both my grandmothers had alzheimer‚Äôs) had a stroke which led to her rapid decline. i would tell him what is going on and get his doctor‚Äôs recommendation as to what the next steps should be. if you can and if you have the support for it, i would suggest bringing him home to be cared by family. we did that with my maternal grandmother for 7 years.	0

has anyone dealt with moderate to severe incontinence in a parent with alzheimer's? we've taken my dad to the urologist and he's on 3 different medications to tackle the incontinence from every direction but it doesn't seem to be working as well as we hoped. at this point, the incontinence issue is probably worse than the alz, since he is in fairly early stages of it. any advice would be greatly appreciated! routine helps a lot. after a meal, have him go to the bathroom. every two or three hours, have him go to the bathroom as well. my dad has a lot of accidents at night, so his caregivers get him up after three or four hours of sleep as well. my dad will grumble and be mad about it, but it helps to prevent accidents. we got depends for my mom. she does remember to go to the toilet sometimes - but sometimes it just comes out. and the depends are a lot easier than cleaning up the mess, especially because she doesn't always realize she's made one. she's also tried to wash them in the sink and in the washing machine (they get really big!) and sometimes she will put regular underwear underneath them. but it's still better than no diaper at all. one thing that seems to help my mid-stage partner: reminders. sometimes the sound of my using the bathroom is also a prompt. it sounds ridiculous, but just askng 'do you have to use the toilet' may be able to break into the zone-out and get action started. of course, then it's on you not to be absent-minded. i increased the nightlight level in the bathrooms. that helped my partner's ability to use the bathroom at night. my advice is to talk about this straightforwardly and buy him some disposable briefs. unfortunately it'll slowly get worse, at some point it'll need diapers for both #1 and #2. constant reminders and a schedule help so you catch it before it happens. at some point they'll start missing the toilet even if they try to go, soil their clothes and not notice and walk around your house sitting on everything my mother in law developed double incontinence at the mid-ad stage - the part of her brain that tells her she needs to go to the toilet has been affected (common in ad). we tried taking her to the toilet more often but she was v reluctant and resistant. it got to the point where we had to get adult pull-ups. in the uk you can get them for free if your gp refers you to the continence clinic. i don't know where in the world you are, but perhaps there's a similar scheme you could utilise? as an aside, elderly people are more prone to utis, and they have a huge effect on dementia patients (my mil would become more aggressive/violent, paranoid, even forgot how to walk) - it's worth testing weekly (i bought the uti strips from amazon). wishing you the best of luck on this journey. yep. my mom would go in her pants while she was walking around. she‚Äôs had a couple of minor tias since then and seizures that robbed her of her speech and mobility. got the call today that she had another stroke and prob won‚Äôt last much longer. disease sucks father has the same issue, but his incontinence is due to the meds he's on. i live in a different country to my parents, so the only solution we've found is diapers ... dad is on the more affected end of the alzheimer‚Äôs spectrum and has a prostate issue. continence garments are a must at this point. routine is key until it doesn‚Äôt make an impact. if he is taking any anticholinergic medications for his incontinence it would exacerbate his dementia. typical ones are oxybutynin, detral, and toviaz  myrbetriq is the only incontinence medication recommended for dementia patients since it is not anticholinergic. a condom catheter is another option and of course depends. incontinence is usually pretty tough to treat in dementia. also be on the look out for doctors trying to label him with normal pressure hydrocephalus with his incontinence  it is commonly misdiagnosed in the alzheimer's population. routine can help. diapers too, but call it briefs so they feel less demoralized. a foley may be another option but that increase the risks of an uti. mum is incontinent and it started off slowly. she had some sort of episode the day before she went into hospital (never found out what - we thought it was a stroke, but wasn't) and from that day onwards she was urine incontinent 24/7. adult diapers are now the norm for my mum. it is very distressing for her as she is still aware enough to realise, but not understanding enough to know that it can't be fixed. very sad. forty years of dealing with alzheimer's, yes. i see my comment has been down voted. but, the fact is that out of control infections are the result negligence on the part of so-called 'caregivers.' i understand that it is hard to continually take your parent to the the hospital, but there is no answer on reddit that solves that. chronic infection is a sign of negligence. incontinence is usually due to infection in alzheimer's patients.	0
mom (91) passed last night. it came on quick. i live out of state and wasn‚Äôt able to see her the last three years. she had vascular dementia and had gotten to the stage where i couldn‚Äôt talk on the phone with her. i  prayed she would pass easily one day. i didn‚Äôt know she was taken to the hospital until she was gone. i was hoping i would get to see her one more time . . and what really sucks , is my husband has alzheimer‚Äôs and i can‚Äôt travel with him. last time i drove  long distance with him he tried to  find something to cut the seatbelt and he opened the car door while i was driving on the interstate. so going to moms funeral is out of the question. i don‚Äôt dare fly with him . i would love to have some closure. just putting it out there because ad sucks. so i‚Äôve been  talking to mom and letting her know how much she has meant to me and all the things i wish i could have talked to her about the last 8 years. i hope she can hear me. i love you mom . and fuck you dementia. my sympathies go out  for those who have also lost someone. we are all dealing with this everyday and i hope you all have bright moments and find your own little space of calm and peace . i‚Äôm so sorry for your loss, i hope that peace and closure find you in other ways ‚ô•Ô∏è i lost mom last tuesday morning to ad. she had stopped eating and drinking for weeks + she slept almost 24 hours a day. i wanted to hear mom say ‚Äúi love you son‚Äù one more time. i wanted her to say it but i wanted her to mean it too. so sorry for you. a mom couldn‚Äôt do anything less. fuck dementia, my mom is 61 and has early onset alzheimer's. i'm afraid to lose it the day she will leave. sorry about your husband too, i'm dealing with that myself right now and wouldn't even consider traveling with him. wishing you gentle moments.	0
my dad has dementia and is going to need full-time help soon enough. (driving, shopping, etc.) my mother is a half-functioning alcoholic (half the time sober and amazing, half the time binge drinking/in bed.) i wouldn't say they are in denial but they are 100% wanting to kick the decision down the road and don't seem motivated to face it. how would you deal with this situation? i live several hours away. plan a visit with them. prepare for a very difficult but necessary conversation about both of their end-of-life care. tell your mom in advance you plan to discuss this during your visit and ask if she can dig up a copy of her will if she has one, and if she would be willing to ‚Äúget some things squared away‚Äù with you ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. or if you dont think she‚Äôd take it well, dont mention it but it may make it easier if she is prepared as well for the discussion. ask her when she would like help caring for your father. at what point will she not want to be his only caretaker? discuss finances available for that care. maybe there is a neighbor or a friend that can stop in for a couple hours a day to watch your dad and do a couple of chores for her, and care could ramp up from there as he progresses. discuss medical proxy, and possibly be prepared to draw up forms to make you the primary person to make decisions on your mother‚Äôs behalf in an emergency, rather than your father. discuss what your mother would like the later years of her life to look like. this may also soften her up to the idea of caregivers if she is against them...thinking about her future as a full time caregiver 5+ years down the road. while you‚Äôre there, check their house for hazards. people with alzheimers do better in bright light, especially in the winter when the sun sets so early; ensure they have a lot of good light in their house. it also helps prevent falls and injuries since depth perception can go with alzheimers as well. discourage the use of thick area rugs that have edges that can be tripped over, as well as any other trip hazards. offer to install a bar or a chair in their shower if they need that. just do some general things so you know theyre a *little* bit safer on their own. i‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, and it might be hard to have those conversations with your mom but its the only way you can sleep soundly knowing you tried your best to get them to be safe short of uprooting your whole life and moving in with them. i'm in a very similar situation.... my step mother's drinking causes me massive anxiety as well knowing that she's my father's caretaker. i wish i had helpful advice. unfortunately i'm looking for some advice as well as this situation is a train wreck coming. i feel your pain. that‚Äôs a double whammy. i don‚Äôt know how to approach the drinking because people get super defensive when approached about that. but maybe if you get your mom into some support groups (even informal support groups) for people living with family with dementia she may start accepting his diagnosis and decline and perhaps get motivated to get herself together so she can be a better support for her hubby. the alzheimer‚Äôs association is a good resource for formal support groups. for something more informal you could try an online program- this is an nia funded movement program that includes some group interactions	0
i've never met anyone with alzheimer's before, but am visiting my aunt who was diagnosed in 2014 next week. i haven't seen her since 2011. although i will be with her daughter, whom she lives with, i am still nervous-- i know she won't know who i am, but what questions do i ask? how do i introduce myself? thanks in advance for the answers. this may sound crazy, but let her lead the discussion. don't ask questions, and i probably wouldn't even introduce myself -- just be friendly and warm. but let her lead the discussion and just be warm and friendly. follow-up thought: be prepared for her to say things that are uncomfortable, perhaps even to the point of being mean or rude. they both also get/got agitated very easily. also depends on the level but my dad likes to just make really random jokey chat. it‚Äôs his way to cover that he doesn‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on. so avoid referential conversations that need them to remember something you said a moment ago, like talking about your job, asking what she did yesterday etc. my advice is to just act like you normally would. they will probably ask you some of the same questions repeatedly, but each time just act like it's the first time they have asked. it's just really sad, my mom is in a memory care facility and all in all, it really sucks. looking after and care for family is necessary, even if it breaks your heart, everytime. you'll have to play it by ear, because you don't know at what stage in her illness she is. people with alzheimer's tend to be different person to person and even day to day. if you have time, a good youtube playlist is teepa snow's [making visits count. ]( (it's like an hour talk in total, it's just broken up into smaller chunks.) he's not great with questions, so we just take turns remarking on things that he takes pleasure in, like the view or the cats or his beloved wife. the conversation doesn't go deep, and we cover the same ground frequently, but that's fine--the point is the togetherness, not some intellectually probing discourse. if you can get tips from the family on things she currently enjoys or appreciates, that's a great place to go, and if not, just note what seems to draw her attention and go on with that. the best thing you can do for the both of you, is to play along. her time is more limited than yours is. just go with the flow. like someone previously said, if they start talking about something that isn‚Äôt true just go along with it. my dad and others at his facility really enjoy listening to music so sometimes when he gets frustrated i distract him with music on my phone. i‚Äôve noticed many people at his facility enjoy the little things. i was amazed to see that although my dad doesn‚Äôt communicate much, he loves hitting a balloon back and forth. there‚Äôs no one way to approach someone with alzheimer‚Äôs, i wish there was.	0
i found out that to 'manage' someone's social security benefits/payments, a power of attorney is not enough - you need to be the individual's representative payee. but i don't know what the ssa means by 'managing' benefits. does anyone have any experience in needing to 'manage' the benefits, so that becoming a rep payee makes sense? i don't understand the need, and why a poa wouldn't be enough for most cases? tia! i need to establish rep payee to sign my dad up for medicare in the next month (his diagnosis was poorly timed there). also pisses me off that poa isn't good enough for some financial institutions. i had to get notarized letters of incapacitation and shit to gain access to his assets to pay for care. this took over a month in some cases! just over this crap. for those who have poa, don't assume it won't be a circus to actually be able to use it. i'm rep payee for my parent. it's super annoying, and as you say poa isn't enough. neither is guardianship. you have to specifically go through a process with the social security administration that in my case resulted in the need for a recent statement from a doctor that my parent is incapacitated because the guardianship documentation was not recent enough. you also have to answer questions demonstrating that you're the best person to do it and you have to provide documentation. you also have to sign stuff that says you'll follow all their rules about how you can use the funds on the person's behalf (the managing part). you probably need a new bank account for the person to accept the funds, which you are required to set up direct deposit for, and you have to do a yearly accounting for what you did with the funds. we just added my wife and i to my mom's bank account. so between our poa and being on her account with our own cards, we've been able to handle everything. we are going through this now. my grandmother was the rep payee for my uncle for years. she just had his ssdi sent to his checking account, never filed reports or anything. now ssa just sent a letter saying that since she died, they won't send him money until a new one is identified. yes i have been rep.payee 15 yrs no issues	0
my dad has become increasingly forgetful. he frequently forgets how to get home, or he forgets a conversation that we just had 15 minutes ago. once i remind him, then he remembers. for example, he needs surgery on his carotid artery. i'm arranging it for him. i hung up, called and spoke to his doctor to set a pre surgery appointment. i called my dad back, literally 10 minutes or less later. i said ok dad we have to meet with the surgeon before they will schedule your surgery. your carotid is 80% blocked. stuff like this happens a lot. how do you tell the difference between normal aging, vascular dementia and alzheimers? you leave that to the professionals. get an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in dementia, or go for geriatric assessment at a department of geriatrics. you father's primary care doctor can refer him. it's a good idea to communicate either by mail/email or telephone ahead of time with some of your observations, to clue the doc in that a real assessment is needed. also it's best if you accompany your dad (or someone does), or he's likely to hear what he wants to hear and report back to you, 'doc says to just enjoy myself.' (that's not what doc said!!) alzheimers is a form of dementia. the only way to diagnose alzheimers is post death via autopsy. vascular dementia and alzheimers typically go hand in hand. my mom was dxed with both. my dad got in a pretty serious accident, lucky no one was hurt but two cars were totalled. he was just going to the grocery store about 1/2 mile from his house, his accident was about 3 miles from the store, he forgot where it was. basically alzheimers is the advanced progression of physical impairment of the brain via shrinking and other damage. the current state of the art for diagnosing alz is an amyvid pet scan, which looks for amyloid plaque. it was quite the task getting insurance to pay for it though. my dad was diagnosed w early stage alzheimer‚Äôs via a blood test and spinal tap. there are specific markers the dr looks for in those tests. he had several other cognitive & motor tests along the way as well.	0
my dad had a fall and his caregiver couldn‚Äôt pick him up. she called for a lift assist from the fire department and they wanted to take him in to the er just in case. when i got there, i asked them if they did a uti screen. the doctor said it‚Äôs not protocol. i knew a uti had to be the problem with his balance and increased confusion. fell on the carpet) i called his regular doctor and asked him to order a urine test. of course it came back as a major bladder infection. what would have happened if i hadn‚Äôt followed up and just let the infection rage?!? what could the hospital possible be thinking by not running such a simple test?!? ugh, so frustrating!! so, insist on a urine test! that‚Äôs insane. you can buy uti test strips even on amazon. i kept them in the house so i could check as my husband was prone to them. prior to that his primary care doctor just had me drop off urine to test. i combined these so i only had to get the doctor involved when i was sure it wasn‚Äôt just a odd turn. it‚Äôs not always a uti but it‚Äôs nice to rule one out before it becomes severe. my dad has had 3 bad accidents/falls on account of having a bad uti. first was a car accident (still early on in his diagnosis), another was a horrible face plant onto pavement, and lastly a tumble down the stairs. what is it about ad patients and uti? it‚Äôs crazy how much damage they can do to people with alzheimer‚Äôs.	0
i‚Äôm 21 and my dad was diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs when i was 17/18. i lived with only him from ages 14-18 and feel i missed out on many of those years and potential experiences due to worrying about/caring for my father. i had decided not to go away to college because he would say things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the only reason i‚Äôm here‚Äù all the time and ask if i was going to stay with him. i‚Äôm having a really hard time knowing what to do right now because i want to go back to a new school across the country next spring. i feel like i‚Äôve made so many decisions based on everyone else‚Äôs happiness instead of my own, it feels like it‚Äôs been such a battle to survive most of my life, and i‚Äôve finally been figuring things out for myself and feeling better. some things are going on right now with his potential guardianship which has been extremely difficult and is taking me back to those years when i was 14-18, feeling so stuck and helpless. it makes me feel terrible because obviously i want to do everything i can for my father, but i need to think about me. i want to have him in my life and have a good relationship, i want to be able to know what‚Äôs going on with him and help to make decisions. i guess i‚Äôm wondering people‚Äôs thoughts on that, whether you‚Äôre my age or someone older. am i being a bad person for wanting to go to school somewhere else? also if anyone has advice about experiencing a parent having alzheimer‚Äôs at a young age, or any life advice for someone in their 20s, i would greatly appreciate it. i think if my dad wasn‚Äôt sick he would be proud of me and excited for me. he always wanted to make sure i had the ability to do what i wanted with school and careers and express my talents. thinking about that makes me smile but it hurts. - my parents are divorced, my mother greatly cares for my father and they have lunch once a week imo, go. alzheimer's is already stealing what is left of his life. that being said, i'm a 45 year old man, missing out on many things, including things with my own child, to continue caring for my mom who is on hospice and could remain so for god knows how long. it sounds like you have already put your father before yourself. i think you should focus on yourself for a bit. ended up not going to go stay with my mom and try to care for her (no official diagnosis at this point but she was not able to hold a job and had very clear signs. we knew it was alzheimer‚Äôs)  you should go to school. my dad has it too. my mom thinks that he's had it for a while, but his symptoms started getting worse when i was 14ish. i'm in my 20s now and i'm in a similar situation to you. do what's best for you. i am glad i lived my life and if i had stayed 24-7 to care for my parent, i would be bitter considering it's a likely possibility for me. i echo every one else here - go and live your life to the fullest you can. i'm hopeful it will be what your father would wish for you. i'm 39 and cared for my dad for about 10 years - we tried to keep him at home for as long as we could but it came to the point that it was no longer safe or dignified for him to remain there. the respite provided to me since he has been in a care home has been significant - i feel like i can live my life again and do things i've been unable to for the past 10 or so years - and it feels good. you deserve to live your life now! you only get one life, you don't owe it to anyone but yourself. please let your parents make their own decisions for their own lives. alzheimer‚Äôs destroys everything. but alzheimer‚Äôs destroys everything and that will still be true even if you stay. good luck with your decision. live your life. sometimes the kinds of sacrifices that you would need to make can leave you feeling bitter and resentful for many years to come. i don't think your dad would want that for you. don‚Äôt do what i did and be afraid to live your life. that being said, you aren't just losing your father to this disease. and what ever you end up choosing, do right by yourself first. you can't 'do right by him' if you are burned out. your health, mental and physical, comes first. don't break your back.	0
would like to hear about everyone's experiences good or bad with small residential assisted living or adult foster care based in a private house. better or worst than long term facilities? do smaller homes have better staff to resident ratio? if you have worked in or own one i would love to hear from you. would love details about your facility and why it's better in your opinion. i have not used either of these, but there was a period where i was looking into them as an option (mom decided to keep dad at home in the end). im not sure but i *think* a major deciding factor would be more about what kind of care the facility is qualified to give, and what kind you need. like some facilities have staff that are allowed to administer medicine, and some may not have staff thats allowed to (patient has to give medicine to themselves). some facilities aren't allowed to keep someone from wandering out, and some have a special status where they can. you might want to see if your state and county have a dept on aging or elderly or dementia. they may have guides describing rules that may be specific for your state or maybe even a handy list of facilities identified by type of care. depending on the level of care, you could eliminate your options quickly.	0
my father (68) has alzheimers and up until recently was being cared for exclusively by my grandmother (87). over the past year, my father's condition has progressively gotten worse and he's started showing signs of anger, anxiety, and aggression. anti-anxiety meds helped some, but it still got to a point where it was no longer safe for either of them to be in that house together and we made the decision to move him into memory care. unfortunately, the transition to memory care did not go well. within 4 days of moving him in he had assaulted another resident, cornered and threatened a staff member, and refused to eat or take his medications, until the facility finally asked for him to be transferred to a hospital because they couldn't handle him. fast forward 6 weeks and in that time, he's been in 3 different hospitals and 2 different geriatric psychiatric facilities. he was transferred back to memory care after the first psychiatric stay when they thought they had figured out his medication, but after 4 days he had assaulted another resident, was tearing pictures off the wall and throwing them, and had defecated on the floor of another resident's room. he's currently on his second geriatric psychiatric stay as they once again try to tweak his meds but i' m not hopeful. we are one week into what is supposed to be a 1-2 week stay so he's going to be discharged soon. the memory care facility he was originally in won't take him back and so far we haven't found any others that will take him. i don't see how he could come home, even with in-home nursing help. i just can't see how it would be safe for anyone. i've checked into some nursing homes but supposedly they are going to cost between 10-15k per month and that's not something we can afford. i don't believe he will qualify for medicaid as he has a pension that would put him over the eligibility requirements. making all this worse is i live on the west coast and am having to manage all of this remotely. this last 2 months have been so draining and we seem to be out of options. what are we supposed to do? i'm posting in hopes that someone maybe has a solution or something i haven't thought of but it all seems so hopeless. with my mom, we had to private pay until she was bankrupt. in her case, the only med that worked to ease her rage (she broke her own and other people's bones in attacks) was injections of haldol. because they had to be injections, we had to have 24-hour skilled nursing, and the doctors reported that it was a must to keep her from being a danger to herself and others. once she was bankrupt, the way medicaid worked was they took her pension and ss and returned it was i think $70 per month for her to have personal spending money. if you haven't talked to someone in medicaid locally, it helps to at least have the conversation with them to see what happens next. i'm really sorry you're going through this, op. i was in the same hopeless boat back in october of last year. my dad has increasingly gotten aggressive. because of covid, no geriatric psych places would even consider taking him in. his doctor at memory care was having no luck tweaking his medications. his facility was kicking him out and we couldn't find a single place within the state that would consider taking a man with 'behaviors'. we began looking out of state. i also asked about hospice and they agreed to have him evaluated. hospice believed my dad was probably suffering from terminal agitation and we signed him on to hospice. they gave him dilaudid but it didn't slow him down one bit. one of my nurse friends (seeing how hopeless the situation was) recommended i ask hospice about contacting aps. they did and got some social workers involved to help us out in finding a new facility. in the meantime, we had to hire 24/7 caregivers to live with him in memory care. somehow we found a facility nearby that would give him a chance as they typically handle people with 'behaviors'. we moved my dad to the new place (having hospice on-board was nice because they provided  a hospital bed). i'm just sharing my experience. reaching out to aps can be scary but we got desperate. nobody would take my dad and i knew if he got discharged anywhere, that his current memory care would not allow him back in. i feel like i truly tried everything. sadly there just aren't many resources for when your loved one gets aggressive/violent. and no, you cannot take him back in to the home with your grandmother. i'm so so sorry. i was in your position only 5 months ago. i'll be thinking about you. what i did was enlisted my friends' help in asking them to make calls to facilities for me. having someone else make those calls and keep a shared spreadsheet was probably the most helpful. i hope you have friends you can call on. such a heartbreaking disease.. so sorry.. you should try posting this question on the forum at agingcare.com the people over there tend to give better advice about these kinds of situations and are more realistic. this is a long shot, but i was just getting a massage today and in the waiting room, i read something in a 'massage therapy' magazine about alzheimer's and massage. as little as 5 or 10 minutes of gentle massage, head, shoulders, neck, back or hands, reduced agitation and aggression in alzheimer's patients. it can be done by a cna, it doesn't have to be a licensed massage therapist. see if you can get his carers in the hospital to try that every day for a week. i'd also want to know if it happens only in the latter half of the day (sundowning) or if he has a uti. music might be useful. i was able to take care of my spouse who got alzheimer's in 2012. when the violence started the doctor perscribed risperidone .25 mg 3x a day. it was an amazing transformation and helped me be able to do everything at home until passing in 2020.   i got hospice involved in the last year and a half or so, which set us up with a hoyer lift, hospital bed,  and nursing care 3x a week all covered thru insurance and medicare, when walking no longer was an option. when covid started i voluntered to do bedbaths and the nursing was reduced to 1x a week to avoid unneeded traffic and risk of covid. this was during the time when it was so horrible in the nursing homes, before vaccines. i am grateful for the extra time i had, grateful that i didn't need to rely on any of the kids who all had jobs and families, grateful that i didn't need to bankrupt us or move out of this house we have lived together in for 35 years, grateful we never got covid. i miss my spouse so very much. hope this helps and god bless. i'm sorry i don't have a good or cheap suggestion, as we went through it with my mil when she was fist admitted to a mental care facility. we were finally able to get he placed into a facility which was able to manage her, both through medication, and through having 'large' skilled nurses and aides who could control her outbursts. once a lifetime of savings, the home, everything was gone, medicare stepped in and took over. facility received every dime, social security, navy (spouse retirement) pension, everything except a few hundred bucks a month we were able to use for upgrades in food, cable tv, and a room with a view of the plants/garden outside. what breaks my hear more than anything is i'm on the front edge of this journey with my wife, who was diagnosed with early onset, and is now 67.  i'm not emotionally ready to have to watch the love of my life disappear from me in slow motion while i remain helpless and heartbroken and incapable of making anything better for her. please speak with the hospital social worker (or have his poa do so). the reality is that dad is likely going to need further adjustments of his medications & an onslaught of behavioural approaches to try & find the balance whereby he's not a danger to himself or others. what i know to be true in my province is that a hospital cannot discharge someone who needs constant care if a sufficient solution is not available. is the hospital the right place for him, long term? probably not but until his situation stabilizes, and a home is found, then i would not be accepting responsibility for him to come home. it's an impossible position to be put in, & the system is so very broken & i'm so sorry that your family is having to wade through this walking nightmare. talk to the social worker & reach out to the local alzheimer's society/ society for the aged & ask them for advice as well. sending you such support over the interwebs. xo there‚Äôs an anti-psychotic medication that my fil takes that really helped his aggression. if you want to know the name, dm me, i would have to ask the wife. regarding ~~medicare~~ medicaid you should talk to an elder care lawyer. typically, if a person qualifies for  ~~medicare~~ medicaid funded care they pay all their assets first, minus a very small amount, and ~~medicare~~ medicaid covers the rest. this varies from state to state so be sure to find a lawyer in their area. good luck	0
if the loss of sense of smell associated with alzheimer‚Äôs would be studied towards restoring it first would memory return? does the pineal gland hold the answer? you're not likely to have heard about studies where things like this were researched and found not to be helpful. i‚Äôm a research patient. but wouldn‚Äôt do the loss smell thing because i smoke. how far outside the box?	0
my grandma is far down the rabbit hole and diagnosed with alzheimers or dementia. we are moving her to a care home tomorrow but one of her recurring issues is obsessively counting money. in her own home we just had her constantly pay us money, put it in a cabinet and then give it back to her each visit. now that she's going to a home with outside people, we don't want her having real money just in case. the bank of canada has a fake money printout for children but she can tell the texture difference between our plastic bills and complains.	0
my mom is well into the later stages of alzheimer's and can no longer do  any self care. her restlessness and excitability is really  tiring, so we requested a medication to ease her anxiety. to my surprise  an anti-psychotic ( aripiprazole ) was prescribed, and while she does  tell imaginary stories i do not see how this drug will address her fear  and anxiety. anyone got any experience with the effect of this meds with  alz patients, and any relevant advice? i thought something like  lorazepam would be prescribed. i do not have any experience with aripropazol in dementia patients. i will say that after my grandmother (probable alzheimer‚Äôs) started taking seroquel, her mood improved dramatically. i have a family member who is a neurologist who has also seen seroquel help quite many dementia patients. i bet many other people here can attest to seroquel‚Äôs impact as well. my understanding is that if the dementia is alzheimer‚Äôs it will have the intended mellowing effect, however if it is a different type (ftd or lb, don‚Äôt remember) it will immediately make the mood worse. my grandmother was also prescribed lorazepam while she was in hospice, but she was one of those minority of people for whom it did not have the intended effect. although it made her sleepy, she became extremely paranoid with the delusion that we had kidnapped her and were holding her hostage. my mil (moderate stages) takes hydroxyzine twice a day and it works well. she takes 10 mg in the day time, and 25 at night. it has certainly worked well  to keep her anxiety and temper tantrums at bay. since she has high blood pressure and takes meds for that, i doubt she'd ever be on seroquel.	0
anyone else experiencing their alzheimers loved one clicking when he/she can't remember how to say a sentence? earlier dad wanted to ask me if it would bother me if he turned on the tv but i guess he couldn't find the words. so he just walked over to the tv, pointed at it, and started making clicking noises at me like it was a recognized language. reminded me of that 80's old movie with the coke bottle. my dad went through a clicking phase and even a barking phase. hth mine says 5,5,5, a lot. it's getting to be a challenge. not so far. thank you all for sharing. no i understand better how this may progress.	0

my dad has been really struggling with being my moms primary caregiver. he never had to do much of the child raising and i can tell he‚Äôs cracking but am not sure how to help him emotionally. has anyone had success finding a counselor for their parent? he looked for support groups once and then never followed up so i think i‚Äôll need to find someone and give him the push. why kind of counselor has training in this kind of thing. would it be a grief counselor or family counselor? any advice is appreciated my biggest help has been a local alzheimer's group, unless people have experienced it themselves they just don't get it. even just sitting and listening to other people has helped me have some perspective on my own situation. i‚Äôm the primary for my mom. i have things covered, but from the outside it might look like i‚Äôm holding up way better than i am. you know what i‚Äôd absolutely melt for? if i came home from work one day and someone had arranged for my mom to be looked after so that they could take me out to dinner as a thanks for everything. i know there‚Äôs no medals for this, and i don‚Äôt really expect it, but making time to really acknowledge your dad‚Äôs dedication might really mean the world to him. go together with him to a support group or 2, whatever you can find, and folk there likely will know of counsellors / therapists specialising in carer support / grief processing. folk often research for support but then not follow through - if you find when & where & tell him you're going together with him, then that breaks the ice & starts him off. or ask your area alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org, they know for sure. good luck! get his blessings before you take the next step‚Äîbut my 2¬¢, select the counsellor, set up an appointment, make sure his 'shift' with mom is covered for the time he'll need, and gently push him out the door with enough time to get there. how to select: if there is a nurse who comes in, then there is some kind of institutional apparatus behind the nurse: hospice, hospital, medi-care/caid‚Ä¶ reach out to them for referrals, best kind of counsellor to seek. if not, contact his pcp for a referral. why you need to set wheels in motion: dementia is contagious. caregivers need to remember, sequence, execute millions of adl tasks for self *and* for loved one. lack of self care leads to lack of care for loved one, leads to lack of self-care‚Ä¶ vicious cycle. god bless you for caring for the caregiver. my dad was similar, caring for wife & emotionally reserved & struggling with his own issues, and he was a total mess. my dad found a class that he was able to take virtually through the local adult day care center. the class was perfect. the class included video examples, a handout binder broken into sections like 'eating', and a live instructor that was able to answer questions and also curtail some of the winding stories from other classmates. pm me if you want and i can share the local day care details - there may be something similar in your area. i find it almost impossible to be able to join and attend a specific group, but have gotten a lot of great information from this youtube channel, which i can watch anytime it's convenient for me. [www.alz.org](   this will help you find your local alzheimer's chapter. they have group meetings. he needs to attend. set it up for him. get him there. if he's financially stable, then hire an assistant to help out a few days/nights a week. nobody can be a care taker 24/7 and stay sane. ask the nurse for a list of recommended care takers. the nurse or the social worker can provide this. take care. it's a tough job to take care of the dying but even harder when we love them.	0
do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm struggling with. my family and i can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he‚Äôs already so sad i worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. we‚Äôve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. i am pushing to get it done but the more adamant i am about it, the more i wonder if it‚Äôs even the right choice. i have been insistent that we need to know what we‚Äôre dealing with but honestly i don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. thanks in advance for any advice. no; a diagnosis will not affect the disease. what i've had happen, though, is my loved one stopped trying to fake being neurotypical. in a word, she appears like someone with more pronounced dementia than previously. that's while she's around me. we talk about dementia‚Äîopenly, gently, with respect. having a diagnosis helps me know better how to help her maintain her dignity. helps me learn strategies which would violate norms for neurotypical people, but that have now become helpful‚Äîcompleting her sentences, tying her shoes, asking 'do you understand,' cutting her slack when she can't remember or do something. i've set down my experiences; ymmv. i get you‚Äôre worried your dad will feel sadder with a diagnosis, but in my case - my mom knew something was wrong with her, and it upset her not knowing why or what was going on. now that we have a diagnosis, i think it helps her to have an explanation. now when she gets upset because she can‚Äôt remember something, i tell her ‚Äúwell mom, it‚Äôs because you have alzheimer‚Äôs. the alzheimer‚Äôs makes you forget.‚Äù  it weirdly calms her, i guess because there‚Äôs a reason for what‚Äôs happening, and knowing what it is in that moment might be helping her confusion. i can tell you from my family‚Äôs experience, getting the diagnosis is the right choice. once you have it, you can move forward and get information and help on what to do next. odds are, though, they'll agree it's probably alzheimers. one side note worth mentioning: my mom was also called back for extra testing. at the advice of my bil, an md, my dad asked a lot of questions around what they were looking for specifically, and found out that particular neurologist wanted to enroll my mom in a very expensive drug trial. the extra testing (which my parents would have paid for) only would have shown whether she was a candidate for that trial. so... ask questions. what sort of further testing do they want? neuropsych testing is pretty comprehensive. if his neuropsych testing did not diagnose dementia then he may not have it. severe depression can mimic dementia as well. i experienced something similar to what you describe - i would just say treat it like it‚Äôs in your head ‚Ä¶ at the end of the day, your doing the best you can and make sound judgments while accounting for all evidence. my moms second round of tests showed major decline, enough for the neuro-psych to say ‚Äúmost likely dementia‚Äù, and then no follow ups or anything (after a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and small vessel ischemic)  there are times when it seems like a diagnosis makes it worse, mom is relatively lucid and any diagnosis would be perceived by her as straight up gaslighting (hence she refused to see the neuro psych again anyway). but a couple hours later she may think she is in her childhood home and wondering where her parents are ‚Ä¶   in sum, i think the diagnosis is critical to get help in the system (i just changed her doctors so she will be more comfortable) - but it may also lead to a lot of crazy fighting (especially if they think they are fine, or constantly forget about the diagnosis). with my one data point, i say no. i have tried changing things up numerous ways to try to manage and try to stay ahead of my wife‚Äôs decline. her decline has been a constant steady progression. it seems like every week i noticed a subtle little thing she can‚Äôt now do. when she can‚Äôt feed herself or use the restroom properly it seems significant, but i see the constant steady decline. staying on a constant schedule of sleep and meds seems to make for much better next days.	0

in december, my father p (m 78) who has stage 6 alzheimers got engaged to be married to his girlfriend of 18 months (f 72) n, who had managed to isolate p from his friends and family and gain control over his finances. in early january, we learned that p & n were meeting p‚Äôs longtime accountant and another lawyer to rewrite his will to remove his children and grandchild and give everything he had to n. p had the original will written in 2019 shortly after receiving his diagnosis. although p had failed a capacity test in december and could no longer legally sign his new will or sign his trust fund over to her, he could still get married as the bar is very, very low. despite his severe dementia, p still had many lucid moments and could seem totally fine for short periods. if p signed a marriage certificate, n would have legal control over his health decisions. it would also give her the cover she needed to drain away his financial resources in secrecy, a process she began even before the big day by redirecting the pension payments he received into a bank account she controlled. all n had to do is move him somewhere away from his meddling kids and take away his phone and he would be effectively incommunicado. something had to be done. scammers preying on the elderly in their community was nothing new to them. p‚Äôs friends and fam began to plan an intervention over zoom. the idea was that his younger son j (m 51) &  daughter in law s (f 52) would go over to p's house, surprise p with a meeting with all of his friends who would then confront him about their concerns about n and her diabolical plan. after that, j would show p the evidence that they had learned from the background check that n was a lonely hearts romance scammer who had already been convicted of fraud years ago and had lied to him about her own financial situation, telling him she was ‚Äúloaded‚Äù and did not need his money, despite having a huge tax lien on her house. they would also show p a [checklist ]( abusive behaviors to try to get him to see how terribly she was treating him. once he was convinced, they would call the locksmith to have the locks changed, help him pack up his stuff, and drive off to a prearranged airbnb out of state. we also worried she may become physically abusive if he resisted her. early on we had learned that n had quite a temper which worsened when she drank. what would she do if she learned her golden goose was going to break their engagement? timing was everything here. thankfully, p's caregivers gave us a heads up that n was out of town that weekend and that she would not see him until she returned on tuesday. j set the intervention for monday. he said he had no plans to marry n (n wanted this kept secret!) about an hour later i received a text from my sister-in-law reading: on our way to arizona with p!! it would be a difficult situation for any person to realize they wanted to break up with a partner and take the necessary actions to do this, but for someone with dementia they may well be helpless. the other thing we found was that p‚Äôs dementia was much much worse than we had known or suspected, despite the increasingly dire caregiver reports. since our contact with him was increasingly limited to short visits and conversations after n arrived on the scene, we had not been able to grasp the severe decline in his memory and communication skills. n took advantage of p‚Äôs confusion over his own condition to convince him that he only had mci (moderate cognitive impairment - his initial diagnosis), which was vital in constructing a reality where she was simply marrying a man she loved and who loved her, instead of financially abusing someone dying of a neurodegenerative disorder. on the drive to the airbnb, j reported p had become incoherent after nightfall and kept asking them who they were and where they were going. they learned they needed to keep him out of the kitchen as he would wander around and touch all the knives and even play with the oven burners. it became clear they needed to get him into a care facility as soon as possible before p could endanger himself. thankfully, even at his worst behavior, he continued to be a very sweet and loving person towards j & s.   it would take about a month to get p examined by his doc and admitted into care. until then, they had to keep a very active senior safe and happy in a relatively small space, arrange for a high quality yet affordable memory care, reconstruct p‚Äôs finances after n put them under her control and then trashed them, clean out p‚Äôs condo and arrange for sale, and do a ft wfh job. first, a man claiming to be a local police officer called asking if p was with j and could they speak to him? j: how could we trust you with p? the sheriffs were standing in front of j's door (they not home) and wanted entrance and to speak with p to verify his condition. we appreciate the supportive comments. wow, what a saga, and terrifying to realize there are people out there who will do this sort of thing. thank you for sharing, and so glad your father is in a better place! so sorry this happened but elated that you were able to rescue p!	0
my dad became unwell yesterday - very high temp, extremely confused, unresponsive at times, unable to walk. i called the gp who triaged over the phone and advised we call an ambulance as dad was deteriorating and needed hospital care. after 6 hours we called again and were told it would be several more hours. my parents live in a flat and we couldn't get dad up from the sofa, let alone down two flights of stairs in order to take him in ourselves. this morning i called the gp back in tears. he came to do a home visit and has decided that dad is ok to stay home under the care of the community team as his condition is improving. i'm relieved that dad seems to be better today but absolutely appalled. i work in the nhs but i've lost all faith that there's any support. so glad yr dad is better now, i hope he continues to improve. it's shocking that they never even came, must have been very stressful, i feel for you! we have ambo ramping problem here in australia, it's terrible. where are you? i hope you don't encounter this problem again. best of luck! big respect to you working for the nhs. both i and my grandma appreciate all the hard work you do.	0
i hope you‚Äôre all doing well. we are helpmate, a company run by phd and master's students with a mission to help caregivers and people living with dementia navigate their post-diagnosis journey. **   currently we are gathering expressions of interest for our free pilot cohort-based program which aims to educate and upskill caregivers. the program will run for 4-weeks, comprising of a live session each week led by a specialist in the dementia space (gp, occupational therapist, nutritionist, nurse consultant, neuropsychologist) as well as hearing stories from people living with dementia and their caregivers. we are currently looking to start this inaugural cohort in late april/early may. **are you interested? **   if you are a caregiver and are interested in being part of a tight-knit community of caregivers and want to upskill yourself, please fill in the form below and we will be in touch! **   our team has been navigating this space for months. we have spoken to over 50 different people including caregivers, people living with dementia, loved ones, clinicians, and academics and one thing was very clear to the team. we believe the dementia space lacks a medium for many new and existing families to learn about how to adapt to their new situation. it was also evident that for many families trying to find specific information for their situation, this can also be very difficult as dementia is different for every single person and family. we hope to offer caregivers and their loved ones access to necessary information and surround them with a community of people who share their journey, with our cohort-based program.	0
my grandma has alzheimer‚Äôs and she can barely see/hear so she ‚Äúentertains herself‚Äù by scratching and fidgeting with her nails. does anyone know of a fidget toy or ring or something that would be good for her? i googled fidget toys for adults but i‚Äôm wondering if anyone has experience with this and can recommend a product the person liked to use. we have the same issue with my mom and the best thing that works are these plastic shapes that i brought which you thread laces through..i have no idea what you would call them but i found them on amazon, i think they are for kids to learn how to lace things up.. basically it's a flat 2d shape with holes in and my mom threads shoe laces through..she can sit for hours doing them, it seems to really relax her too. hope this helps my dad gets a lot of use out of the [playschool fidget cube]( he now tends to put things in his mouth so the smaller fidget toys aren't safe. we also got him some of those silicon bubble pop things. those fidget blankets don't hold his attention because he thinks it's just a blanket. any catalog we got in we would give to him, until he started tearing it and eating the paper. so the toddler toys have been great etsy has a lot of fidget toys made specifically dementia sufferers. the dots can be picked off like scabs. my mil likes to play with pop-its. i think this a good tactile activity for your grandma who can't see very well. it's like an easy and reusable version of bubble wrap. hope it helps! lap blankets, fidget muff. the dollar tree has pop it‚Äôs and such for cheap that you can try. does see like animals or babies? try a baby doll or they have animals that meow and pure that might help my wife has a little pillow with rings, and velcro straps and other little things to manipulate. latest thing she likes is a stuffed dog.	0
my friend is in memory care. they would also constantly confabulate or retell the same story. his only story is 'going to get a car today'. both times his face went back to normal as soon as i started talking again. any thoughts would be well appreciated. he just happened to be a resident in the same facility, so i visit both. could be lewy-body dementia. lewy-body has attributes that are very similar to parkinson's. my mother had this and would often look surprised or almost in shock of things.	0
it's been a rough couple of weeks with my mom (64 f). the week before last, she was stuck at home with me because she developed a skin infection on her butt from her nighttime fecal incontinence, and couldn't go to daycare because they wouldn't administer the medication she needed to treat it. on thursday this past week, daycare called me to let me know that my mom was having a really difficult time and complaining of pain in her legs, crying more than usual and just not herself. 'okay,' i thought, i'll take her to urgent care when i pick her up. well, when i picked her up that day, they came out with three bags of clothes saying that she peed through her clothes i sent her in, her spare clothes, and walked out wearing pants that were loaners. the problem there was, she had not been exhibiting any uti symptoms at home. urgent care ended up not being an option because they all need appointments, and the only clinic that takes walk ins is closed now for the foreseeable future after an electrical fire that happened the week we were there for her skin infection. they got her triaged and we waited in the waiting room for a couple of hours before she started sundowning and just would not stop crying over every little thing. the sundowning actually ended up saving us, because we were able to get her into a bed faster, and who knows how long we would have continued to wait if i didn't bring it up. so we get her into the room, they cath her and say she has the cleanest sample they've seen in awhile, no uti. the pain is so difficult to help her with, because in the previous occasions i've had her seen for pain, it's really hard to pinpoint what's real and what's phantom, and then usually she's fine, but something does seem to be off. she screams as if i'm going to kill her when i try to swing her legs out to get her out of bed, or when i need to try and get her to sit up straight in bed, rather than hunched over to her right, or straining her neck, which will actually end up hurting her. anyway, the er doctor was really sweet and talking to me about life with her as it is now, and suggested looking into getting a hospice referral from her pcp. hospice had been suggested to me by a family friend, and that my mom doesn't actually have to be knocking on death's door, that we may be able to get the extra help just for comfort care. after the past two weeks, i feel like maybe these smaller conditions have just progressed her alzheimer's further, and it might just be the disease pushing her into a new stage (she's already progressed so fast this past year, and has been settled in moderate to severe over mild since after she moved in with me last february). i kept mom home with me on friday just because we were up way later than she's used to while at the er for hours, and i wanted to make sure she got some rest. well, friday morning after she woke up, she was really unsteady and unbalanced when trying to get her into the bathroom to change her, and she fell. i could not get her to understand how i needed her to help me help her get up. when she was a caregiver for a man with alzheimer's before she developed her own symptoms, the man she cared for fell all the time (not hard falls, usually he'd slip out of his recliner), and my mom could never get him up. the man's daughter told my mom she just had to call 911 each time he fell to have ems come pick him back up. it got to the point that ems told my mom that if she called one more time, she'd be reported for elder abuse and negligence. so imagine my immense dilemma when trying to decide if i needed to do the same. i did though, the guys who came were all great, and they were in and out in less than 10 minutes. but now i completely understand why my mom needed the extra help with the man she cared for. i'm thinking hospice might definitely be something i want to look into, but i was hoping to get any perspective from those of you who may have had similar experiences with hospice. any input, general information i might not know, suggestions or advice you may be able to offer would be really helpful! i'm also looking now into either a rollator or a wheelchair for her at this point, because the last thing i need is her falling at home, but also when we're not at home or she's at daycare. that's also kind of difficult to reconcile, because if she is at the point where she's not going to walk anymore, it's just going to make caring for her until i can get her into memory care, 10x more difficult, and it means that she is becoming further and further from who she used to be. i'm just going to share my experience with my dad, alzheimer's and hospice. we had moved my dad in to memory care february 2021. in september, my dad started having some aggression issues and violent outbursts. we tried really hard to get a geriatric psych eval but nobody was open due to covid. by late october, his facility told us we needed to find him a new place. unfortunately nowhere in the entire state would consider taking a man with 'behaviors'. we began looking out of state. i had been asking about hospice for a couple months and they finally agreed he should be evaluated for it. they told me in order to qualify for hospice, they have to have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. hospice came the following day to evaluate my dad and decided he qualified. they started him on dilaudid. we finally found him a new facility that would take him and very fortunately it was just a few miles down the road. we moved him in and the new place seemed great and much better equipped to handle my dad. i visited him a few times and they had a family thanksgiving gathering. my dad passed the day after thanksgiving and caught even hospice off-guard. i got a call that they thought he was transitioning to actively dying but i didn't need to rush down. 20 minutes later i got a call back to say that he'd passed. my dad was on hospice just under a month before he passed. it's worth an ask. their job is to help your mom feel better and be comfortable. i'll be thinking about you, op. geriatric social worker here. if your mom qualifies for hospice, go for it. get the care. get the nurse visits. get the social worker visits. get the chaplain and the art therapy and the volunteers and the pet therapy. welcome them to your home. in 6 months, if she qualifies again, awesome. if she doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôll have all these people from that hospice who know you and your mom who will be able to make recommendations on what to do next. i work in a nursing home and one of the biggest misconceptions about hospice is that the patient needs to be ‚Äúknocking on deaths door.‚Äù  they don‚Äôt! instead of getting help and care and support, the family puts it off until the person is literally dying, and then they have all these hospice strangers trampling in to help, which is weird and awkward when the family just wants to be with their mom. emt here. if you can‚Äôt pick her up without help, we will happily help you. we understand that the disease puts her more at risk for falls. you are one person, you can only do so much. if it does get to the point where we are being called too often, we won‚Äôt threaten you. we will have a conversation to make sure you can find the appropriate resources for your mom. thanks for sharing, sorry i don't really have anything concrete to add. i've read plenty of people's stories where they put their loved ones into a facility that specializes with memory care. do you have something like that in your vicinity? essentially, if you aren't capable of taking care of her yourself, you should think about it to lighten your load. where i'm from, we pretty much only have one hospice in the whole country (less than 2 mil pop though), but it's very much for actually dying people, mostly cancer. most elderly homes offer extra care for people with dementia (basically the more help you need, the more it costs). your story made me realize i need to take care of some holding bars around the bathroom for grandma asap. listen when it comes to dementia, there is no real downside to hospice. you get more support, and there aren't any medications you really cut, not the same way as cancer meds. my grandmother was in a similar way after she broke her hip. we got her signed onto hospice in mid-jan. she was still up and walking around, with a lot of help (lifting up onto feet with gait belt, one person in front and behind, and a walker). even as we got her out of bed and worked harder at the heavy lifting trying to 'exercise', she eventually was not able to take a step from standing, then could put her feet flat on the floor. we absolutely would not have been able to handle these fast drastic changes without the support of hospice. everyone says, they wish they started it sooner. i recently found out that people with dementia are eligible for hospice at a certain point, because it is a terminal illness-it does not necessarily mean they are close to death. they are another pair of hands (and heart) to care for your loved one and take a little pressure off of you. they have a lot of experience, give great advice, and are not only there to care for the physical/emotional needs of your loved one with dementia, they are also there to care for the needs of family members. it‚Äôs a great program, i can‚Äôt recommend it enough. best of luck. from what i understand a doc has to be the one to sign off on her being eligible for hospice care. they do it based on a reasonable expectation that the person has 6 months or less to live. my dad ended being on it for many years. when he got hospice care it was very helpful. he got a medical bed to help him sit up, wheelchair and other medical equip to help keep him clean. also nice to have access to home nursing. just because mom is eligible doesn't mean you have to use hospice. you can also pull her out at any time, and to put her back on it, the doc just has to approve, which im told is easy to get. i would 100% look into this. leave it up to doc to decide, and tell them everything. if she is eligible, id definitely look into all the options for starting up.	0
my grandmother is in her final stage of alzheimer‚Äôs disease. she hardly moves and is bedridden. her nurse sent a picture of her legs with mottling creeping up from her feet - said she would probably be with us for another two days. my mom, my husband, and i went to go see her. my mom sees her frequently, but this is the first time i‚Äôve seen her since january. after my husband and i got home, my mom calls saying she checked grandma‚Äôs legs and the colors has gone away. has anyone experienced this with their loved one? yes, and unfortunately it may last much longer than 2 days....try 2 years unless of course the nursing home is planning on 'helping along the transition process.' my mom is 87 and has had dementia since at least early 2006 and is now at stage 7 for over 5 years. she started to develop bedsores last summer until we got a hospital bed, and the in home care nurse helped treat and heal her wounds.	0
my dad has been in assisted living for a short while now, and that is going great. the problem is everything else that remains. my sister and i need to prepare his house and its contents for auction/sale. of course, there are some things we both want in the house, and there are the feelings i have to wrangle with of ‚Äúshould i keep this or not?‚Äù it‚Äôs like dealing with someone‚Äôs house after they have died. i‚Äôm overwhelmed. i just want to get this task over with and move on, but it feels like there‚Äôs so much to do. i live three hours away and have my own family, so it feels like an impossible task. i suppose i‚Äôm just venting. did the same with my mothers house. if it has no real sentimental value and i mean ‚Äúno real‚Äù do not keep it. set up 3 areas of a room. make a keep pile, a sell pile (estate sale, let go, etc), and a donate pile. the donation pile helped a lot with making decisions on things because i knew at least someone else could use it and it would do some good. once you start going you will be surprised how little you will keep and how fast the process moves. it helps. i still have boxes of my mom's things even though we emptied her house years ago and she passed away in december. i'm stuck with things that i don't want, but i know she cherished them. i'm in the same boat and totally feel you. we just put my dad in memory care a couple weeks ago and i'm so stressed about his house and all the crap he (and my mom) accumulated over the years. there are so many and i don't want all of them but i feel so guilty throwing them away. there are people who, for a fee, will go through all that stuff and hold an estate sale. that might not be the avenue you choose, but be aware that it exists. a senior center or local realtor could probably put you in touch with one. others have commented on the keep/toss/donate strategy. i've done that too, it's just that there's so much! my approach to big chores is break it down into manageable increments and keep going back to it when possible. since you live 3 hours away, you might put a couple cartons in your car with every trip and work on decisions from your home base. right where i am, too. my dad went into a facility two weeks ago. the kicker is we got a practice run. my dad had been keeping his dad's house for 15+ years his death. was 'cleaning it out' on his monthly and then twice-yearly trips across a couple states. last april, i saw my dad's condition and knew we had to get this house sold, so i got my brother and my dad on board (my dad was a bit resistant but knew deep down he couldn't hold onto the house forever) and planned a four-day trip to 'finish cleaning the house out.' had a realtor all set up. when i arrived it looked exactly the same as i remembered last time i visited like 10 years ago. some items cleaned, but mostly still a fully-crammed house full of stuff. we spent those four days frantically tossing, donating, and packing what we wanted to keep to take back home. packed a 40-yard dumpster to its gills. did a lot of emotional work with my dad trying to get rid of some stuff or get him to realize he has to take things back to his house. now it almost feels easier this time around because i'm practiced and he is not there to have to guide through things. it certainly helps me to read about how other families deal with this. my sister overpaid a cleaning/estate sale service to go thru our parents' house for us. we walked through together (i brought my best friend for moral support) and removed things we wanted. it's easy for us because i live in a different country, that limited what i could take home. i did have to sacrifice some small items to her crazy, and ultimately my friend just started putting some of my mom's knickknacks straight into her purse (my mom is still alive and now in assisted living) so my sister wouldn't keep them. my mom just put those things in a drawer so who knows if it was worth the subterfuge. be thankful you have a someone to help, i had to do this alone. although, i did not have the added ‚Äúi want that‚Äù headache with a sibling. i started by doing many many runs to goodwill but just ended up getting a dumpster. i felt bad about trashing useful items, but it would have taken weeks and no charity would pick up. an estate sale would have ended up costing more than the dumpster since i, of course, kept anything of value. but, i don‚Äôt want to freak you out or anything, the house clearing was the easiest part of my alzheimer‚Äôs caregiving experience. that is something that could be done and accomplished. i'm in the same, same, same situation ahhh  i'm in front of his new home now, texting my sister, about to check in, thinking about how in a week ill be on the floor of his house hours away going through boxes. and my sister is no help üò§ (her having a new baby and also being in another part of the country is a pretty good excuse though)  you and i and all of us will get through this, because our parents would have if they were in our position i hired a junk removal service and moved the sentimental/valuables to a storage unit. hired a relator and got that baby sold. you‚Äôll feel so much better when it‚Äôs done and you‚Äôll hopefully have some profit from the sale to be able to to help fund assisted living facility costs. to me it feels like a violation of their property, since my mother is still living in nursing care. it took me a while to even go there and have a look at what needed doing. if it wasn't for my daughters i would still be stuck. i opened a shed door yesterday and just stood there crying. why did they keep so much junk? we have one room to put all the household items in for sale as we go through each room, cupboard drawer methodically. we will hold a garage sale to get rid of what we can, use fb marketplace for any items left and then call a charity to bring their truck. my biggest problem is getting rid of the clothes. all the donation bins are still full most of the time thanks to the great ovid cleanout everyone seems to have had, and the charity shops no longer want things. if worse comes to worse it will have to go to landfill but i would rather not have to do that. when my grandpa died (of cancer), i did most of the cleaning. keep some clothes you can wear, that's my favourite memento, because i actually use it often (kept a couple of shirts). i have a garage full of stuff i can't part with. maybe we should switch houses and clean each other's parents' stuff. i think i just created a new reality show. my brothers and i will likely be having to do this too in the near future and i dread it, i can see how you would be overwhelmed.	0
my great grandmother, recently diagnosed with alzheimer‚Äôs, was very fond of her two dogs, a pug and a corgi, however she couldn‚Äôt take care of them after the dead of my great grandfather, and has been living alone ever since. i was looking for robotic pets she doesn‚Äôt need to take care of, and saw two nice brands. perfect petzzz and joy for all. anyone know if there‚Äôs some hybrid with realistic breathing and sleeeping and the same functions as joy for that‚Äôs a pug or a corgi? set aside 180 pounds for this, hoping i can give the dog to her before her birthday of april 28. i would think just a nice cuddly stuffed dog would be great. i am going to visit my mom in memory care and was thinking of getting her a stuffed cat toy as she always loved cats. your live, time and caring is your greatest gift. i have seen some folks in memory care with stuffed animals that they hold and love on. i know its a recent diagnosis and you want to do something nice, but id be a little cautious with a pricey niche gift like this. its possible the other commenter is right, your time (or maybe your assistance to her primary caregiver) would *probably* be the better gift now, unless you 100% know shes going to love it, or itll have a great return policy. i got my alz grandma a stuffed dog that looked *realistic* and like a dog she used to have, around the same time i got her a baby doll that looked like a life-size toy.. she thought the *doll was real* and coddled it like a real baby, but was angry and offended that i would give her a toy dog doll. i had to return it. on top of that she did love the baby but it gave her a little bit of anxiety because she was afraid of waking it all the time. in any case good luck, its nice you want to be nice. my mum has a sleeping breathing dog toy. she prefers the more ordinary but lifelike soft toy dogs. she cuddles and talks to them..and it doesn't matter if they fall on the floor or get a bit messy.. the best gift you can give her is time. do things like take her on long walks (if she is capable of doing so). i feel like my grandma would be offended, if i brought her a toy dog (although she doesn't like animals as it is), because she'd still know it's a toy dog. i did encounter articles about pets helping a bunch and i am interested in having a dog myself, although grandma is resistant at this point. i'll keep these robotic pets in mind, thanks for bringing it up!	0
none of the major risk genes for alzheimer's are in the sex chromosomes, so females can pass those genes to male offspring just as well as they can to female offspring. that said, alzheimer's is approximately twice as common in females than males. how old were they when they became ill? elderly alzheimer's is not hereditary. young-onset alzheimer's is/can be genetic. most alzheimer's patients are elderly. also, women live longer than men on average. men are likely to die younger of other causes before elderly alzheimer's starts to happen.	0
how do you handle this? my dad (alz, mid-way-ish through disease process) has diseased toenails that are difficult to manage. should i have a medical professional assist in trimming every 2 weeks? it‚Äôs painful for him, but i‚Äôm always worried about possible infection. additionally, best shoes for alz. he has these no-tie sketchers but they‚Äôre getting harder for him to push on. maybe crocs? think he‚Äôd be up for a pedicure? i take my mom in when i visit every few weeks. it‚Äôs a huge help and the team at her local salon is amazing. it has become a nice socialization thing for her. or if you think they‚Äôre really diseased maybe a podiatrist could clean things up first, and then they‚Äôd be easier to manage? following for shoe recommendations. podiatrist/chiropodist home visits - they can treat and cut his nails. crocs for outdoors, rubber soled velcro slippers for indoors. get a podiatry home visit every few weeks. gran is less squeamish when they do it. also has the added bonus that she perks up a bit with someone else to talk too. she wears sandals round the house that are easy to wear but can get cold. there are travel nurses at home specific for foot care. my grandmother is doing very well with birkenstocks made from eva foam, try the arizona model. very comfy, clean very easily (i wear them myself as well). we don't do her nails every two weeks, they grow way slower than mine do. she doesn't want to go to a salon, but she enjoys when i do her feet. i first soak her feet in hot water with salt (very salty, probably around twice the amount as i would use for pasta), squeeze of lemon juice (you can use any other acid on hand) and a pump of soap. 30 minutes is a nice time, but the water is gonna get cold, so check in-between. i got the recipe from a friend that does old lady's nails and feet professionally. after the soak, i first scrub her feet with that black sandpaper thing (i don't even know what's it called in my own language :d) and remove any harder stuff with a rougher stone. sometimes she gets these little blister like things on the tips of her toes. then i clip what i can, her big toes probably have fungal infections because they are very thick and crumbly, but that was before i started taking care of her, so it's probably too far gone to really do anything about it. i'd recommend good clippers, the big ones that kinda look like pliers are a lifesaver with the thick nails. for the end, i use a good foot cream and that's that. i used to do it every couple of days, because her soles were shot (really dry, flaking all over, she also has light diabetes, so that was a worry, etc. we had the same problem! took him to the podiatrist, and they cut his toenails, recommended some fungal cream, and gave us a list of people who can do monthly maintenance for him, including people who could go to where he lives (in memory care). get him the meds if his doctor says it‚Äôs ok.  in 3 months his nails will be better. my mum goes to a podiatrist and my dad goes to. my mum is the one with alzheimer's but dad goes with mum and they both have their apps so mum is more comfortable. before that i was cutting her nails and doing fungal nail treatment for her. we just did a foot bath this week, then i trimmed her nails. we used to do it monthly, but hadn't for several months recently. i could tell a difference, as she didn't want to leave her feet in the water for 20 minutes and kept taking one out, so i started after 10 minutes. when she was more lucid, she asked to go to a podiatrist to get her nails trimmed. i had never heard of that and thought it was weird, to but her sister told me that is a normal thing. i too use the pliers type clippers. i had seen them at pedicures before, but my grandmother bought them at walmart. those are the ones i have the best luck with. i don't know about shoes. when she goes out, a rare thing, she usually wears a pair of my easy spirits that zip up. they were too tight on me, to do i had given them to my grandmother who wore a size smaller. i bought some men's memory form slippers that are warm and big enough, but turns out they slide off the hardwood floors something awful. i guess she'll need a larger size or different style in the future. i just go to the nail salon and leave a big tip (like $10-20), which is double or more than what they charge for a trim.... just so they don't hate us going in.	0
i‚Äôve gone through early-onset with family for decades. first my mom when i was pretty young 12/13 until 31) and now my sister from who knows when - past 20 years. my sister is now late stage. i don‚Äôt know how much longer she will hang in. i hate it for them, and i hate it for me. heartbreak my whole life. trying to be positive, but some days are so bad. you don‚Äôt have to be positive everyday. sometimes you need a break from being strong. give yourself that break, tomorrow‚Äôs another day. oh my...that's a very heavy burden on your heart from such a young age. i'm so sorry,this is such a cruel time taker of a disease. my family has it as well, i am scared how do you manage thinking about it happening to you? will you have kids? my wife, 54 was just diagnosed. i feel for you- having to deal for so long. i would love to know more about the varying stages and most specifically what are the indicators for which stages. your story and bravery can really help people. i'm all ears. much love	0
my moms pretty bad off and believes that my dad who has heart issues ran off to die because he didn‚Äôt want her to find him. she also thinks the man taking care of her is her best friend mj. my dad has never left her side and i know it‚Äôs killing inside. is there anything we can do to help her kinda snap out of it or is it all just down hill from here? 'hi, i'm [name], your husband of x years.' also maybe a 'loving couple' photo portrait in her line of sight, his arm around her or some affectionate pose?	0

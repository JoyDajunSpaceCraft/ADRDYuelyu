my grandfather has alzheimer’s (or possibly dementia) and is in full care by my grandmother (who admittedly is not the best with pushing for better medical care or testing from doctors). this morning he had an episode where he was laying down in bed, seemingly awake (eyes open and moving) but unresponsive to her calling him, touching him, etc. they took vitals and said that he was all good in that are and my grandfather refused to go to the hospital so they didn’t push it and left. my grandmother took him to his regular doctor today and said that it was just another stage of his decline. i am still concerned that it could be something else because i have never heard of it. i am the first point of contact for them but i am living out of state and trying to do my best from afar. does anyone have any experience with this? or can provide any more insight on what i should be doing next time i am there? my mom had a few episodes like this before we knew she had actual alzheimer’s. i actually think they co tributes to quicker cognitive decline, but the doctors always tested for stroke and other things and said they couldn’t find anything. i do believe it is a form of stroke, maybe medicine just hasn’t caught up with it yet.	1
my dad received his diagnosis during covid. he had a virtual 2-session “interview” with a neuro-psychologist from the neurologist’s office. granted, the mri/ct did show some atrophy as well, but the actual diagnosis came after this virtual meeting. my dad is 70, isn’t the most social person, and isn’t used to virtual appointments. the whole thing didn’t go well. nonetheless, we toughed through. her findings were that he presents with alzheimer’s and general anxiety. just curious how else someone gets formally diagnosed. i'm a psychologist who diagnoses people with dementia. the gp refers them to us. we test their cognitive abilities (2h assignment) and talk to the family+client (1h). the testscores then get compared to people in their age and education bracket. the dementia diagnosis is usually quite clear from that. this may sound like it's too vague, but you can look up the mmse to get a sense of these types of tests. keep in mind that a score below 25 means something is definitely wrong, as the test is so easy that regular, healthy people should make it flawlessly. being unable to do simple math, remember 3 words, or know what season we're in says a lot about their minds already. this gets combined with the information from the family: can't remember appointments, unlearned how to work the tv, needs help with finances these days, confabulating stories, etc. all of these are outside the norms for normal ageing. i'm not sure i made a comprehensive or coherent response, feel free to ask for clarification. my dad was diagnosed with probable alzheimers, i believe in 2019, after an in person visit with a neurologist who specializes in cognitive decline. i know it involved an mri and i'm pretty sure it involved blood work. imo atrophy on an mri/ct is how the neurologist made the diagnosis. the facetime meetings were just to confirm he had the symptoms. i am not an expert, i just have my wife’s situation to base my opinion on. i started trying to get my wife diagnosed when she was 55. the neurologist said it was not likely she had dementia based on her age. in addition to the ungodly number of tests and appointments with specialists, she had three or four mri/ct scans. i have been told it is very difficult to detect early stage dementia with an mri/ct scan. finally the results from a radiated glucose pet/ct scan was interpreted for lewy bodies. a couple years later based upon her behavior the neurologist changed her diagnosis to ftd. my mother was diagnosed last year (the 1-year mark should pass any day now), about a month before i turned 19. i think they used spinal fluid. i’d had my suspicions of it since i was around 15-16, but getting the diagnosis and having my fears confirmed was like having a brick thrown at me. ♡ my mom was diagnosed after about 2 years of no pricing some mild symptoms (being forgetful, having trouble keeping up with conversations). it was june of 2020 when she got her initial mci diagnosis. we get her reevaluated this year and got mild alzheimer’s diagnosis which is what we were expecting. she currently cannot complete instrumental tasks without assistance (cooking, cleaning, filling pills, some driving) if progressed enough, alzheimer's can be fairly easy to diagnose and would not require more than an initial meeting. that said, i don't put much stock into telehealth/virtual neuropsych evaluations when it comes very early stage symptoms; especially in those of an age that are completely unfamiliar with the concept of virtual doctor visits and videocalls. late last spring my father had a uti. while they were treating the uti he just shut down. was stiff as a board for about a month in the hospital until they brought out other neurologists. in the process of trying to figure out what was going on (turns out parkinson's), they discovered that he does have alzheimers. prior his doctor just kept saying 'he's getting old that's all'.	1
he'll take money out, then forget that he took money out and then take more out. (you shouldn't even be driving himself to the bank where the atm. we do the best weekend to stop him but it's not easy to keep track of him 24/7)  he gets a state issue disability check every month. and our mortgage payments are set to automatically withdraw from his account. always has been. takes out 400 to 600 a month to buy pot. in the comments section of a different post someone suggested contacting social services about having his check split between him and someone else. something about how his bank has an overdraft thing. which means social services can't give him a certain amount of money knowing that it's only going to pay off the negative balance and then he won't have any left. i hope i'm explaining this right. i hope i'm making sense. we were trying to ask them to put $400 into his account as an allowance. and then put the rest of it into my mother's account. but because his account's always in the negative, they wouldn't do it. could we ask the bank to cancel the overdraft service? i know typically no one else can make changes to a bank account without the account holder there. but if we explain the medical situation, and we're not asking to take any money from him. or if we had some kind of doctor's note explaining he's incompetent, could we then take that to the bank and put my mom's name on his account as well? sorry if this is long and rambling. the various things you want to do would require him giving you durable poa (legal, business things). i take it you haven't had that discussion yet? what is your mom's role here? if your dad has been diagnosed with alzheimer's, he shouldn't be driving. it would be good if somehow the topic of diminishing capacity could be broached, or you have many large fights ahead of you. cut up his cards with scissors, take his tires off and roll them to a friend's house. seriously, he could kill someone driving. get serious. my dad used to do something similar. he was taking out cash every week because he only understood cash as really money any more. at one point the bank wouldn't even let him take out as much as he wanted. not sure if they were really allowed to do that... but they were aware of his issues. his car got taken away soon after that so i would have to take him to the bank. does he have a poa or anything in place? if not do it now while he's still somewhat with it. i used to have to drag my dad to the bank because he has a trust which makes everything a pain. he would just sit there and smile while i did everything for him. the bank was aware of the situation and was pretty nice about it. i think they're used to elderly customers having issues and in the end if it's a good bank they want to do what is best for their customer. you need power of attorney and to prevent him from getting to the assets in the first place. absolutely file for that asap. explain the situations to his doctors - they may not realize he’s as far gone as he is. you may also need to switch doctors and see someone who can properly evaluate him, because that is exactly why power of attorney was invented. to address situations like this. absence an incompetence hearing, and judgment, you need his signature for poa. you get it set up first, and then take him to the lawyer or whoever can do it for you, in our case, it was the bank. i don't know where you live, but cannabis is one of the most beneficial treatments for alzheimer's patients. far better and safer than anti-psychotic drugs. unfortunately, when it comes time for a care facility, that will not be available to him. that's my opinion and my experience. here's a good article :   move up the day that the money is taken out of the bank so it doesn’t sit there. speak to the branch manager about removing the overdraft protection.	0
short version (i can add info if needed), my fil is stage 4 dementia. roommate almost died and is still recovering. family member who was helping lost her husband. i am the legal guardian and i made arrangements for fil to go into assisted living. he can’t afford in home care and he doesn’t own his house (it’s in a trust, so he can use it until he dies but he doesn’t own it). he initially agreed with the move but now he’s changed his mind. the problem is that his house is rented to help pay for his care and the help he needed to live alone is no longer available. the reasons he gives for wanting to leave al are not grounded in reality. he’s not progressed enough for memory care, but al is optional and so they won’t keep him there against his will. i keep seeing advice not to try to correct someone with dementia, but if he walks out of there i don’t know what to do with him. see if you can visit the place a few times and tell him he lives there and you will be back to move his things there. maybe you and the al social worker could sit down with him and go over all his concerns. additionally, you need to remind him it's not as simple as going back to his old house, because it's rented out to someone else, and the roommate/caregiver is no longer available to help him with day to day affairs. explore options - maybe he would prefer a different al placement? you and the social worker can also go over some of his deluded beliefs (don't call them that in front of him!). show him where the eye drops are, and ask if he'd like someone to administer them to him. my dh who i am trying to put into memory care at present, has had similar delusions. and when he has lost a wallet by leaving it somewhere, he states that someone 'stole' it. he can't locate most of the things he needs (constantly losing toothbrushes). good of you to look out for this man. my dad is in memory care and went through a similarly tough patch where he was paranoid, angry, argumentative, and distrustful. he worried about people taking his car and money (this included my mom, who he said his lawyer would be contacted, because she needed to get out of his house.) this passed after time, but it was a tough roughly 2 years. keep your fil a little more comfortable by finding lies that will calm him down. i'm constantly saying this to my mother during every conversation i have with her and she's been in memory care for almost a year. now that she is settled (she still isn't happy about it), she fears change and when i bring up finding a new facility for her, the thought of changing her routine scares her and she stops complaining (for a little while)  i was staunchly against medicating my mother for behavioral reasons because i didn't want to lose what little was left of her inside. move him, medicate him one thing i did with my dad is tell him we found him “an apartment with help” that was just a home base for him. i drove back there with him in my car, and when he saw the building, he said, “that’s a bad place.” i parked and he asked, “what are we doing here?” i said, “i need to speak to the lady at the front desk.” “should i stay in the car?” “no, come with me, i said.” he came with me, i checked us both in, walked him to his room, and we said goodbye like everything was fine. also, if he’s paranoid he may not want to take additional medications, but if he’s already taking medications, you could speak to his doctor about adding something for his mood (assuming you have medical poa?). that has helped my dad. good luck! my husband and sil try to logic her out of these delusions with evidence. she refuses to discuss assisted living and lives in the same town as sil. they check on her a few times a week, and my husband will stay with her 2-4 weeks at a time. (we are in another state) the other 2 siblings are no help. (she was also not the nicest person in younger years so they see her 1-2 times a year out of duty.) if he is a danger to himself, you can gain power of attorney and guardianship. my grandmother had moved al twice and both times she has gone through a phase of this when she first moved in. it went on months the first time, but she had progressed by the second move and it lasted a few weeks.	0
is there any want to stop/help a grandparent from leaving the house especially at night? i think they’ve tried locks but she figures it out. we bought some of those toddler door handle safety covers and that really did the trick. we also put those cheap slide locks at the base of the door and dad never noticed it to open the door. we had those cheap alarms on the doors but the rest of us would always forget about them and scare the crap out of ourselves when we went out the door. dad wasnt too bad about wandering at night but there was a short time he would get up. double keyed deadbolt. depending how far along your grandparent is, you may try one of those door decals that makes it look like a bookcase or something. also, an alarm on the door is wise. my fil installed double-keyed deadbolt locks and always keeps the keys hidden. door alarms - not terribly expensive and they wake you or an overnight attendant who can then intervene;	0
my dad has been in memory care for a couple of months now. recently he had backpain and wouldn't leave his chair. so they sent him to the hospital to be checked on. they didn't find a source of the backpain (which seemed to go away on its own) but they did find blood clots in the lungs (blood thinners prescribed) and he was dehydrated so they pumped him with liquid. he was in bed for 3 or so days. when i came to pick him up from the hospital he couldn't walk. i was really annoyed that the hospital wasn't helpful in that regard, but i chalked it up to his feet being swollen from the fluids. with a lot of effort we finally managed to get him in the car, and back to the home. so i called today to see how he's doing and they said not great and that he's not walking on his own. apparently they can get him upright with assistance but he can't walk. the memory care doctor will be seeing him tomorrow so i know i just need to sit tight and not karen until then, but i'm just so frustrated. dr. google is telling me older people lose that function a lot faster after bed rest, but it just blows my mind. it’s not uncommon for this to happen after a hospital visit, but it’s dependent on a lot of factors. previous conditions obviously contribute but it could just be the new phase he is entering. or could it pass in the following week, as this happens too. the doctor should be able to determine what’s going on. i know edema causes a lot of issues with this population’s mobility, but exercise and compression socks can help fix that; a pt or ot could be suggested as well. i’d say wait to hear what the doctors says. keep us posted. look into massage. it helps my husband with his arthritic spine. medicare covers it under certain conditions, which includes chronic back pain. also, if your patient has been hospitalized for three days, medicare covers 100% of a nursing home stay as long as discharged directly from hospital to nursing home. (check your insurance but we recently did this.) if you can't swing that, maybe physical therapy. good luck. i had a similar experience with my mom. within a few days of moving into memory care she had several falls and then could no longer walk. that was right around new years and she has not walked since. sorry to say this was the beginning of the end for my grandmother. the muscles deteriorate fast and ingrained muscle memory that is not exercised for a couple days evaporates. remember that alzheimer’s attacks the brain’s ability to make conscious choices first. the decision of lifting your foot to step; planting it firmly, feeling confident enough on the first foot’s ability to bear weight 100% for a moment, that you lift the other… this is where she got frustrated and yelled. we tried asking her sweetly to let us help and she yelled and refused for hours.	0
hey guys. my father-in-law is under 60 years old and was diagnosed with early onset alzheimer’s about 10 years ago. my mother-in-law had always said that she would like to put him in a secure safe assisted-living facility if/when he starts to get violent or too difficult to deal with. well, now it is “well he didn’t mean to hit me, he thought i was the dog” or “he isn’t going to hit me. he’s just making those motions with his fists.”  let me preface this by saying she has “read all the books“ and she even leads an alzheimer’s support group. i know she knows what she’s doing but i think her judgment is clouded because it is her husband. she is not admitting to her kids the full extent of what she has to deal with on a daily basis. she’s not in denial about the fact of the disease is progressive, and that eventually he will be beyond her capacity to help, but i don’t think she is ready to admit that he is far beyond that point. she wants to have kids and grandkids over but also does not want her husband to be upset and stressed and angry. her kids legitimately had to have a meeting with her to convince her to get help just two times a week with an outside service that can come and give her a break. the hardest part is that she has told me that she doesn’t want to put him in a home because it will make her feel guilty. i know it is hard for me to understand because it is not my husband, but it is so hard to watch her lose control of him and have to take care of him or take him for drives when she really wants to spend time with her children and grandchildren. are we being insensitive in thinking that he is more than ready to be in a secure facility? how do we navigate the conversation that she no longer has the capabilities as one woman to care for a 6 foot 200 pound relatively healthy otherwise man with early onset alzheimer’s? side note: the facility has an excellent reputation and we have family that works there. any guidance or suggestions would be appreciated. there's a saying that by the time a family is ready to consider placing someone in assisted living what they need is memory care. for many people with dementia getting medication right can help a lot with agitation and violence, too, and it doesn't sound like there's a geriatric psychiatrist in the mix. it's definitely worth consulting one. and on a practical note, is it clear that there's money for this facility? that may be a part of your mil's reluctance that she's not voicing. a visit to a certified elder law attorney (even though he's under 65) would also be really important in figuring out how to preserve what she has if medicaid is going to be involved, as it is for most people. in my state also facilities have to have a special license for people under 65, and those who have that license and also accept medicaid patients are few in number. (though those facilities may accept private-pay patients who will switch over to medicaid when the money runs out--that's something that needs to be explicitly asked, and it's also worth asking whether there's a difference in services when they move to medicaid (shared rooms are likely, for instance). has your mil seen the facility you are considering? does the facility have a social worker with whom she can speak and voice her concerns? not a sales counselor but a real social worker. has she discussed her situation with her support group? i have a friend who was hospitalized after her husband with dementia assaulted her. once the person with dementia becomes violent it is past time to make a change. it is my husband who has alzheimer's, and i expect to have him enter a memory care facility in the next ten days. i feel no guilt! he always told me 'i want to stay home, i don't want to go to an institution' and i always answered 'i will keep you at home as long as i can, but the time may come when i can't do it any more.' that time is now. actually an admissions coordinator asked when i would want him to move in and i said meekly, 'yesterday?' having to make that call to move a loved one to a memory care or other secured facility is incredibly difficult even knowing it's the best thing for everyone when you get to that point. my mom struggled with it the most and wanted to talk to my dad about it. i discouraged it as it would only make my dad angry (he was too far long at this point) and wouldn't remember. what finally helped my mom realize was when i told her my concern was if something happened to her, his primary caregiver, we'd be forced to put him somewhere and rushed. if we decided as a family, we could research places and coordinate his move for it to go as smoothly as possible. we moved my dad in to memory care february 2021 and he passed in november. my mom broke her arm and needed surgery three weeks after we moved my dad in to memory care. i had to move in with my mom for the first few days as she could not do much on her own then her sister had to come stay with her after surgery. so, had we not made the decision, the decision would have been made for us when my mom broke her arm. mom and dad are on the short end. both were rns for 25-30 years. dad, the one with alzheimer’s, has amazingly reduced mobility. (he had polio in his teens, so he got off with a limp.) mom is his caregiver until she makes up her mind. personal pride still reigns. you know, until dad falls again…  i’ve volunteered to help out, but it is up to her to accept help of any kind. so... he hits the dog? i would say gently that i would like to take over care decisions. if not, i would have a social worker come for an evaluation of both parties.	0
hi all,  sorry in advance for this rant but it’s half two in the morning and i realized i just need to get things off my chest in order to sleep. i’ve been caring for a 92 year old family friend with alzheimer’s for the past couple years. i (m22) live in the upstairs of her socal home and have been doing so for just over 10 years. my dad had to move here for work, but socal is very expensive. thankfully she allowed us to rent her upstairs at an incredible price. my dad passed away in 2017 so i’ve been here alone with her for almost 5 years. her alzheimer’s is getting to be quite advanced e.g. i keep getting this awful feeling like i’m catching alzheimer’s just by caring for her, being around her, or touching things she’s touched. i know you can’t catch alzheimer’s and i know those suffering from alzheimer’s need just as much love and attention as we all do, but it’s like a horrible phobia that i can’t shake! i’ve been distant with her, and her daughter only comes to visit for a week or so every couple months. all she really has is me and a few friends who visit for an hour here and there once or twice a week. i just want to do what is right for her and care properly, but it’s impossible with whatever this is i’m experiencing. thanks for reading and any advice would be much appreciated. you definitely can’t “catch,” alzheimer’s, but stress and depression can certainly cause you to be forgetful or have “brain fog” temporarily. i would have a real talk with her daughter about plans to keep her mom safe by bringing in a caregiver or moving her to a facility. i'm 67 and caring for my 81 year old husband who has alzheimer's. since the early days of his diagnosis, i've wondered 'is this contagious? my support group reassures me that it's due to picking up all the cognitive load that is cast off by the patient in this picture. my latest stressor is my husband likes to wander around the house picking things up and putting them elsewhere. he is teetering right at the border between middle stage and late stage, so he takes a lot of structuring, prodding, reminding, etc. i am hoping he can go to memory care within the month. and i could use a little more of an empty nest. good luck to you. one day your selfhood will return! stress, less sleep than usual, all things that can cause what you're feeling. for your sake and hers, i hope you have an idea of your future plans because if something happens, you may be homeless real quick. try to make sure to get some time to yourself where you can rest, relax, etc. best of luck op! and from such young age caring for an elderly alzhms person on your own, wow super very tough, i don't know how you manage - what a legend!. seems you're developing a stress-induced issue? actually, most if not all sole carers do. depression, anxieties, insomnia, eds, ocds, other & all sorts of mental health issues carers develop. so sorry eh, i feel for you, it's great you are aware & reaching out! i guess, your memory issues are result of stress, and the worry about that, is tripping another stress reaction. (some similar things have happened to me a few times too, over the past years i've been caring for my mum, lost my whole life & all my friends & job to move countries back here to care for her. not even trained well paid professionals can do this sort of thing alone for indeterminate years on and on, it's intense. and unless the family are paying you an adequately substantial amount of money to help out, you need to have time to  be living your own life, right? ok you're getting a great deal on rent - but how much of your time and emotional & mental health are you losing? like i get the strong bond you have with kind old lady, and you want to be a good human, but you can't run yourself into the ground for other people and cheap rent. i think for a start you need respite time-off, for sure. some counselling, would also probably be helpful. a proper talking with the daughter to get some other solutions organised. and are you connected with carer support orgs? so often, in the caring for someone else, the carer themselves are left by the wayside. they endure & suffer being the main pillars of support, they also need aid & assistance to remain healthy happy & strong! alzheimers .org or dementia .org can assist you with finding options & details for all those things. they are experts in all aspects of memory-loss diseases & conditions, have tons of free resources, information, counselling, telephone helplines, etc etc. contact & speak with or visit yr area alzhms / dementia org asap! they were life-savers for me, & my mum. of course it's the daughters responsibility to actually organise & arrange services / respite / in-home care / going residential / whatever for her mother, but who knows sometimes family members who live at a distance haven't really got around to finding out all that information - it might be helpful if you can at least get some printed literature / pamphlets / booklets whatever for her, to get things at least productively starting moving along somewhat. and she needs to start organising some more help sooner, not later, not in 3 months 6 months time. it's great you're persevering with college, good on you! i hope alzhms org can help you out with lot of options & info. hang in there, best of luck to you! give an update some time, i'll be thinking of you! \* hugs \* i lived in a house with a very old woman that had dementia. i provided the evening meal and did some laundry until she had to go into a home. i was desperate for help and nobody understood. even the health nurse didn't bother pressing her to see how far gone she really was. i found out how woeful the system is for coping with things like this, even the professionals other than in the hospital. because an ambulance came to pick her up one day when it got too much. only a week before i told her gp that her mental deterioration need urgent attention and i stressed the urgent part. i feel for what you're going through, it's bitterly tough. i found a new level of misery living there. i'm also sorry you lost your dad, i lost mine in 2016.	0
hey all. new member here. i guess i’ll give a quick background story; my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimer’s back when i was in late grade school/early middle school. i was relied upon heavily as her caregiver (assisting my mom and a daytime aid we had most weekdays) and it was traumatic, to say the least. my mom was diagnosed officially last month, but i knew it had been coming for at least two years. the pandemic and some bad doctors really prolonged the diagnosis finally being on paper. i guess i y need to talk to other people who get it. my boyfriend, whom i live with, isn’t as supportive as i need. i do not speak about her like she’s dead, but i can’t call my mom for advice. or to gossip. or to joke about our weird family anymore. we can’t go shopping and try on clothes together anymore. it’s simple things. i feel that (he is a bit abusive but i’m looking for a way out of this, i wish we hadn’t moved in together, it’s so complicated right now for various reasons…) he almost tries to minimize my issues because my mom “is still here”. some days he’s very loving and consoling but most he’s cold and is very critical of her doctors. he’s never met them, but he always makes sure to tell me every negative assumption he’s made. i finally have her with an excellent geriatric neuropsych, and he’s insisting that more could be done medication wise. i feel diminished. like, you don’t think i’ve discussed these things to death with medical professionals?! i’m the only child and my dad is no spring chicken and i worry about how this will take a toll on him. but more than anything… i miss my mom. and my partner is not comforting about it. he has a slew of his own family issues which he expects me to always help with, and i do, but him insisting i’m wrong because i use past tense for certain things regarding my mother is irritating. i’ll never be able to go to a broadway show with her again or bake together at christmas like we did every single year. i’m just so deeply  drained physically mentally and emotionally and all i don’t know how much more of his crap i can take while i handle my mom’s needs. i hate alzheimer’s and i hate the lack of empathy among people. thanks for reading, love and strength to you all 💜 i’m so sorry you’re dealing with such a double whammy of losing your mom and an unsupportive partner. i’ve tried to explain to my partner how many seemingly intangible things i’ve lost with my mother over the last few years (advice, consoling, shopping), and he doesn’t get it either. all i can say is get support where you can, from therapy and a caregiving/alzheimer’s community. i believe men don’t understand the connection between a mom and daughter. my husband (75) has ad and although i was able to see my daughter , we haven’t been able do do any of the fun things we use to do together . it must be harder on you not having those mother / daughter talks and joking around. my best advice is to enjoy the time you do have and  maybe get some videos of her while you can . also a book that gets recommended that may help you. it’s called the 36 hour day your dad may find it helpful as well. best wishes to you and a big hug from a mom. i am sorry you have to go through this and not get the support you need. you said so much of what i felt when my mom went through the progression of alzheimers. i grieved the loss of the mom i knew for 72 years. i missed calling her when i just needed my mom to comfort me and sympathize. i missed so much. then i thought i was so prepared when she did pass away last month. i grieved for her when she was alive,but then when she was actually gone, i couldn't even hug her or kiss her cheek or stroke her hair. i know for myself i had to find some acceptance that i couldn't get the old mom back, so i did my best to find ways to be with her. honestly, some times i really struggled to visit her,but i did usually feel better afterward, knowing i spent time with her.	0
growing up i didn’t get to see my dads side grandmother a lot. she lived a state over, and so i only got to see her maybe once a summer and over a holiday, unless she drove to see us, and those weeks always went by way too fast. she sold that house and moved to florida when i was in middle school. over my time in high school she developed alzheimer’s, and we only ever talk when i call her, and it’s dependent on her being at the phone or not having lost her phone. and i loved the talks we had. it took her a minute to realize it was me,but when she reconnected those dots she cheered up, unlike any conversation she has had with my dad, mom, or sister the past year, and she started asking all kinds of questions about things i didn’t think she’d know about or remember. after we hung up the phone, i cried, it’s been two hours, and i’m unable to do anything else but think about the conversation we just had. 😭 with alzheimer's, you grieve the loss of your loved one long before they breathe their last breath. i'm sorry you are experiencing this. a lot of elderly people really value cards and letters. you could make a nice difference in your grandmother's life if you would send her one card or letter every week. it probably doesn't come naturally to you because of your generation, but i think it would have a big impact. firstly, i want to say i’m so sorry this is affecting your grandmother and now by extension you so badly. my grandmother developed alzheimer’s when i was in middle school and i spent a good chunk of my teen years being a caregiver. i wouldn’t change my circumstances as i, like you, just wanted to see her. i’m sad reading this because i have been in your shoes (in it again with my own mom atm but this ain’t about me) so i fully understand and feel your pain. as the commenter above me said, alzheimer’s is hell because we are grieving the loss of someone who isn’t physically “gone” yet for a long time. i’d also agree with them that cards and letters would be a nice thing to consider. if this isn’t too personal to ask, can she still read ok? only asking because my mom is at a stage where she’s losing that ability, but i’ve discovered that if i can make her a small painting or piece of art, she really cherishes it and it’s something they can always look at and find new meaning in, and even subconsciously make a connection to you in it in their minds. you can dm me if you ever want to talk to someone, i’m sadly no stranger to this evil illness. i wish i could give you a big hug right now (if you’re into hugs, that is lol) but i hope at least me letting you know that you’re understood and not alone can provide some comfort. sending tons of love to you and your grandma and family 💜	0
if anyone can understand, it’s you guys. i (33f) am my dads only caregiver. he doesn’t need full time care necessarily at this point but it’s coming. i teach 75 minutes away from my home so my dad can stay in the home he’s lived in for nearly 30 years and i fully financially take care of my dad except for his small ssi check. my sister was going to visit from the other coast and take my dad for a few days while i was on spring break so i could live a few days of my adult life in my own home, getting things done around the house that i can’t get done otherwise. woke up to a text that she’s been covid exposed and is waiting on a test but most likely won’t be able to come out and visit. i’d be lying if i said i didn’t lay in bed sobbing at 6am because i’d gotten my hopes up at having a few days of freedom. tonight, went to check the mail and got the notice that the doctors office didn’t get the form in to ihss for our initial assessment and so he’s been denied. there’s no end in sight and once again i’m laying in bed sobbing. i have no help, i can’t get help, and i don’t have hope. i’m beyond burnt out and i’m doing this alone. my friends can’t understand because they don’t live this life. i can’t get to a support group and so my entire therapy sessions are just me desperately crying to my therapist. i don’t need advice. i just need someone to understand what this is. for what it's worth, as caregivers, we do relate to what you're going through. it feels like you're using yourself up taking care of your loved one, missing out on your best years. i wish i could offer more than to say hang in there, it's not forever, even though it might feel like it. take the small moments to yourself when you can, and take some solace in knowing you're doing the right thing. the role of a primary caregiver is usually a lonely one. family members may have good intentions, but are not involved on a daily basis, and soon tire of the intrusion into their lives. what's more, they tend to offer advice when they are not familiar with the real circumstances. because of that they have not been able to develop coping mechanisms to stay in the game. in ten years, i had about a total of two weeks away, and most of that time was spent in the hospital for surgeries and other things, and the family, frustrated by my mother's behavior brought her back to me, the same day i was released from the hospital. in the beginning, i had a knee replacement and because i couldn't get around, elected to take ten days in rehab, so i could partially recover, but my family could not handle my mom, so they brought her back home and dropped her off, and left her with no way for her to get around or anyone to help, so i got two days of rehab before i had to go home. you will be criticized for your decision making by family members who feel guilt for their own inabilities. in my case, they've talked behind my back about how she should have been in a nursing home long ago, even though they were not willing to take on that process themselves. bringing professional caregivers into a home where you also live is usually not practical, and as the patient advances they may become hostile to strangers in their home. in my case, two of my sisters are nurses, and when the time finally came, i threw up my hands and forced them to make the arrangements for the care facility. caregiving for a parent is a noble undertaking that is full of surprises and changes along the way, and only the exceptionally strong are fit for the job, so know that. i am sorry for your difficulties, but steel yourself, because you have only begun on this journey that's full of twists and turns. my wife and i worked hard all our lives and had such grand plans for retirement and this damn disease changed all that. i get up really early so i can have a little me time. see if you qualify for some in home help. is there anything you can do to give yourself a treat or reward? some method of self-soothing or relaxation? my mom died four months ago now and i'm still getting myself together. i'm so used to taking her from one appointment to the next and eventually her needing nursing home care where the phone rang multiple times a week regarding her rage, i still can't hear the phone ring without panic kicking in. i feel your pain 😞  i've been taking care of my parents for 3 years now as an only child with not much help from my own family. both have dimentia and i was just told two days ago my mom won't be able to ever come back home unless she has 24-7 care at home. that's going to be impossible for me to do so it's a crap shoot getting the help from dss. i also just had my first kid and he's only 6 months old so dealing with it all has me literally burnt the fuck out. praying for you in these tough times sister. my mom always said what you put in into life you'll be rewarded in other things that surround you. love your dad. your doing a great job thus far and god will repay you in many other ways. there's no playbook or guide for what we're doing but it's the least we can do for the people that raised us to be great people in life. goodluck. patience is a virtue 🙏 .hugs. i also understand the just crying at the therapist. mine had hearing aids and discreetly turned them down during our sessions. hah! i understand. teaching is also high stress and requires a lot of giving as well. will sister reschedule her visit? even though you won’t be on break-you could get some relief/normalcy? do you have summer off? can she come then? the form—can you re-start the process? the paperwork and appointments can be so overwhelming and they seem to come in waves. one step at a time. write things down and cross them off when done(helps me so i can see progress). find small things you can do for yourself. sometimes it may be having a good cry in the shower. or a quiet cup of coffee. wishing you well. i’ve cried my eyes out more times than i can remember. and for sure, siblings can’t really understand what we go through - they can say they appreciate all you do, and you can tell them all the stressful things you’re dealing with, but they truly don’t get it. i hope soon your sister will be able to come give you those few days off, and then not only do you get time to yourself, but she can also see firsthand what it’s been like for you. take care  eta: i know you said you don’t want advice, but i noticed you said you can’t get to a support group - the alzheimer’s association has free zoom caretaker support groups - it’s helped me to talk to people that get what’s going on, but also have been dealing with it all for a long time and have wonderful advice 🤍 i very much understand! i’m 30 f dealing with sharing responsibility with my sister for my mom (70 f) and her care. my dad died about 6 months ago and my mom is still living at home but unable to do instrumental tasks (cooking, cleaning, filling her own meds). it’s been a massive struggle especially since i’m expecting my first baby in about 6 weeks. i get burnt out very easily and it’s so hard to not get frustrated. it’s hard, just starting out in your life, and having to take care of a parent. denied for what? big hugs. and if health insurance, etc. the disease i could almost cope with, but the shit system of us laissez-faire capitalist mangled hell care is the thing that's really messing me up. i understand.	0
hello so trigger warning i guess is in order but a week ago we had to put our dog down as she was in pain from a tumor and that night my grandma stopped eating and the morning after she stopped drinking so it was obvious she was starting to decline and looking to be entering the death process on  wednesday she seemed to get worse and worse by the day and by that morning her 02 sats were 'low 90s high 80s' friday she calmed down enough to have her go to a nursing home because her care was overwhelming mom and she required almost 24/7 care so we had her transported there and we came to visit that night and they had a o2 tube in her nose which confused us so we asked and they told us her 02 during transport was 71 so they put a tube in and then they just kept it going at the home i get them doing it during a transport but not at the home they say its for her comfort and wont prolong death but i dont buy it to be honest it seems like a part of death and i feel some people with alzheimers die this way so it seems like eliminating a way of death which to me is prolonging death at a certain point her body just wont function on that low of a oxygen level so giving her oxygen seems like prolonging i get that it might be for comfort but to me death is uncomfortable the body doesnt like dying i can understand the morphine and haldol because those dont do anything other than help with pain and restlessness it doesnt help life but the oxygen seems like it would help her live longer she needs to pass soon and quickly she wouldve hated living like this and she would want it to be as quick as could happen also this nursing home is questionable i went to check on her today and the door was wide open which would be fine if i didnt walk in on her completely naked on the bottom edge of her bed just sprawled out and she had a few visitors earlier shes supposed to get morphine every hour an haldol every two hours both people said in the few hours they were there they never had a nurse come in and they had to get them to go give her her medicine which irritates me so im kinda questionable on their opinion so id like an outside opinion  tl;dr: my grandma is dying shes at a nursing home and they have her on o2 which confuses me since it seems like it would prolong life the home says its just for comfort but it seems as if it would prolong life im all for comfort but death is uncomfortable and it seems like they are preventing that way of death so does o2 prolong life not an expert. my understanding is that oxygen just makes it easier to breathe, it doesn’t heal infection or damage to the lungs it just makes it so your lungs don’t have to work as hard for basic breathing. it’s not the same as intubation. my grandma died at home in march. she will just need a doctor referral, i'm pretty sure. also do you guys have a medical directive? we have one for my dad that covers all types of care and we made a decision as a family what we would allow and not allow. takes the pressure off last minute decisions. i am an rn on a dementia unit. i see this a lot. current belief is that supplemental oxygen is for comfort. in addition, we administer ativan liquid and morphine at scheduled intervals. most of my residents pass quietly and (i assume) comfortably. i assume your parents or other relatives are your grandmother's medical poa, and have already had end-of-life discussions to know what she would want. you don't need to understand the reasons for the interventions. if she is not being medicated on schedule, call it to the home's attention and ask for an explanation. also inform the medical poa, usually a relative.	0
hi there, my dad lives in a memory care unit. he has become aggressive with staff which is so opposite his personality. i know it’s just the dementia progression. he got admitted to psych this evening and they called me to tell me they had to restrain him to his bed because he assaulted a nurse. i am the only one responsible for his decision making/care and i just want to know what to expect. this is so painful; i can’t even believe this is a real illness. without having any information on your father's case: what other care options have been tried? we frequently have aggressive patients who only get combative during personal care. the kind choice can be to deal with a smelly resident, and reduce the amount of showers given etc. sometimes hygiene care really can't be avoided, but often the frequently can be turned down by a lot. same goes for 'having to sit at the table' or being woken up/ sent to bed/ interrupted from wandering etc. often the nurses are trying what they think is best, but it's not always what's right for the patient. your permission to adapt his care can go a long way. so sorry you're dealing with this aspect of the disease. is he on any mood stabilizers? i know what you mean about not being able to believe it’s a real disease. i am a nurse and we get situations like your dad very frequently. physical restraints are used temporarily until chemical restraints (mood stabilizer and such) are adjusted to a new level required to keep the patient calm. this stage of the disease lasts for a wide variety of time from person to person, but it doesn’t last forever. some it’s just a short time, they respond to medication quickly, some needs multiple readjustments of medication. allow the doctors to medicate your dad as much as necessary. in my experience, some doctors are too conservative with medication and the patient ends up in physical restraints for days. but finding that balance is hard, because you also don’t want the patient “snowed” or asleep for days due to medications. still, being asleep is better than being awake and restrained. it may trigger him more to have you visit so sometimes it’s a good idea to hold off, but you can check with his nurses about what his mood is prior to and after your visits to see how it affects him. when you do see your dad, try to think of him not as your dad but as someone who is afraid. it may help you to disassociate, at least during the visit. i would sign him up for the cassava sciences pre-screening for their drug in trial. every patient has shown improvement from as little as 27 days. it is on their website. please take a look. link for pre-screening ^^   above is a youtube link of testimonies from patient’s family members that are currently on the drug “simufilam”	0
my mother is a resident in a really nice memory care facility. last week she had another resident (a male who is a wanderer) come into her room in the middle of the night and crawl into bed with her. we got her calmed down and got her out for lunch so they could clean her bedding and make everything 'clean'. mom is usually really focused on keeping her door locked to keep anyone from getting in her 'apartment' (there are a few residents who wander in if the door is open during the day so she keeps it closed and locked whether she's in there or  not), but she must have not locked it. we talked to the staff (they're great) and they said that they'd check her door every half hour at night and also if they happened to be walking by. so all seemed to be under control. however - my mother needs to feel secure in her room. i am looking for ideas or thoughts on how to handle this so mom feels safe - without making a big deal and getting this man in hot water, if possible. tia. my husband who gets into my personal stuff at home, is now doing the same thing at adult day care. staff informed me yesterday he has been going through other people's purses or backpacks and taking items out. i asked him about this and he denied doing it, but i trust staff's memory of events better than i trust his! i know it's not the same as wandering, but kind of similar. no advice, just wanted you to know this is definitely a feature of the disease. good luck to your poor mom. could the facility alarm her door during sleep hours? i'm sorry, i find it totally unacceptable that patients are allowed to wander at night. there is all kinds of alarms/technology to prevent this. i saw one little old lady that would just up and slap other residents. it's on the facility to make sure residents are safe. you must stay on management, most are profit driven, but you are a vital link in oversight. raise hell if necessary, i'm sure your paying$$$_. your mom’s right to feel safe trumps this man’s freedom to wander at night. i have no doubt he has no clue as to what he is doing; nonetheless, the facility needs to control this behavior or he needs a new level of care. if this were happening to my mother i would be most unhappy. they need to handle it. you need to raise hell with the facility. that it happened once, you were understanding, they told you the solution they would implement, you accepted that, and then it happened a second time and that’s entirely unacceptable. it sucks for the family of the man, but you have your own loved one to worry about so i would say that if the staff isn’t capable of protecting your mother from another patient, either those staff members or that patient needs to be removed. and you want monetary reparation on top of that since you’re paying $$$ for the safety and security of the room and its occupant and you’re not getting that, twice now. say you’re considering leaving a couple of reviews online about the negligence of the staff there, and how unsafe your mom feels because they apparently have no alarms, locks, safety measures or competent staff in place to prevent people from wandering at night. that’ll get their attention. don’t *expect* them to give you any compensation (and dont threaten to remove her, i’m sure they have a waitlist a mile long and will gladly take you up on that threat), but reminding them that you’re financially invested and have the power of google reviews might put a fire under their ass to do better. honestly though, get her on a waitlist for another facility. it seems as though you can’t trust the staff at this one to do their jobs. if the night staff get fired over this, and i say this as a professional caregiver myself, they absolutely deserve to lose their jobs for this level of negligence. it is not hard to prevent this situation with 24 hour awake staff plus modern technology...i’d worry about where they are dropping the ball in other places. or that despite the crazy amount of money each resident pays to stay there they are purposely understaffing to make more money. i know moving someone with dementia is hard and expensive but this is so unacceptable to me and would raise so many concerns about the quality of the staff and the safety measures they have in place. that man should never even be able to leave his room after bed time. ridiculous. i hope you get this sorted promptly, they give you a discount for her disrupted month, and they hire new night staff. oh my god.. i’m sorry but your poor mother, i can’t even imagine how terrified she must have been. this is unacceptable my dad was the wanderer but i sort of think he was doing it on purpose because the only part of his mind that worked was the, 'where da ladies at?' i sure hope he didn't scare anyone. bed alarm for him. maybe one of those child safety locks for her door.... so she can get out but it takes a non-dementia person to figure out how to open it what facility? i am looking for a good one for my dad. feel free to pm if you want.	0
phew, documentary filmmaking is running me ragged, but i got some time this week to write a couple of caregiver tales! [don't-care-caregivers: what are the options when you feel like you're out of options? ](  [what's the scoop, poop? i spill the dementia family caregiver beans on the rodgerthat podcast. ](  p.s. wow, i'm still reading but i had to stop to write this:   i'm just after another crazy episode with my mother, scrolling through reddit. with one hand on my head thinking of post here this exact same question! i just can't do it anymore. my life is ruining, i lost my job, i've depression, nobody want's to be with her because she was a horrible person all her life let alone stay and live with her. i lost my job, i  lost my gf, my family doctor already knows that i got depression because of this. she kick me out of the house at least 30 times during these 3 years after i spend a day collecting my stuff, hiring movers she then calls me anytime between 2 hours to 10 hours later begging me to come back. i've reached the point that i just can't do it anymore. i lost so many things in the process, i basically will have to rebuild my life when this is over. don't care caregiver should be a community flair. thanks for sharing as always!	0
my grandpa has been slowly losing his memories as alzheimer's takes its toll. he's recently been moved into the memory care unit of his nursing home, and myself and the rest of the family do what we can to visit and talk to him regularly. the thing is, grandpa has been a wickedly funny man his whole life, and yesterday he commented on his memory loss and the loops himself. i don't know who needs to hear this today, but growing older and losing one's memory is tragic and funny, all rolled up in a confusing yarn ball. its ok to do both at the same time. i was watching news with my grandma and bringing her cut up apples, smack dab in the middle of an ukranian war segment. i held my breath, this is it, a truth about life is coming. we look for the humor too. my grandma is still in assisted living. she getting closer and closer to needing more care. but so far she's able to stay pretty safe and independent in her little apartment. my grandpa passed almost 10 years ago. my wife and i have found out we are going to be parents. telling my mother in law that she is going to be a grandmother gets her excited everytime. it has its moments very rarely. we skyped with our daughter a few days ago and every time my wife walked past i would show her the phone and it was a new experience every time seeing the kid.	0
my grandma got diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia something like that  please tell me how bad it is im shaking she’s only 60   is it true she will only live about 6-7 more years? im 13 she won’t even live to have my first drink with me  is it really one step down from full alzheimer’s??? it's different for each person. i've heard of people who were diagnosed with alzheimer's and still living 20 years later! not the most common outcome, but i think i made my point. if a drink with your grandma was something you were looking forward to, you can do it now. one drink won't hurt anyone, even if you are just 13. i recommend reading the book “somebody i used to know” by wendy mitchell. she was also diagnosed with early-onset dementia around the same age. one possible benefit to an early diagnosis is that decline can be slower. my mother was diagnosed four years ago at 64 and while she has lost some cognitive abilities, her progression so far has been slow. guessing someone with dementia’s longevity is hard, but i would say enjoy the time you have with her now. having a loved one with dementia forces you to really live in the present moment with them. i believe you are asking about frontotemporal dementia (ftd)  with my wife it has been a vicious and fast progressing disease. i know at 13 you are ready to start talking about adult things, but the details and the way this disease changes a person is something everyone should avoid learning about. watching what this disease has done to my wife has been the toughest thing i have had to deal with in my life. my advice to you, is make memories with your grandma now, knowing that very soon this disease will change her into a different and very unpleasant person. all cases are different in terms of speed of progression. know this....your grandma will eventually act out in ways she can't control. remember it's not her, but her diseased brain. cherish the good times.	0
how does everyone handle things with their siblings when it's a parent who needs care? i don't know how to get conversations and plans going about my dad's care without starting a fight. hello,  i had a very similar situation with my sister. i was the live-in caretaker for my mom and step dad and she was in the same city. i was drowning in caring for them, having some mental health issues because of the toll of caregiver fatigue. we sat down with a social worker and talked about how i needed her support. progress was slow, but 4 years later she is my best friend and we depend on eachother a lot. our mom is now in the late stage and in a memory care unit. please give your sibling the offer of support before they reach that point. literally same scenario, my wife and i are the caretakers to my mother in law with mid stages alzheimers. her son who lives 10 mins away visits once or maybe twice a month. hasn't done much for her care and i believe doesn't like seeing his mother in her condition. unfortunately you cannot change them to make them care more, either they are willing or not. it's a bad situation and i would wish all parties put the same effort in. it's like every bad sibling interaction from childhood on is happening again with my sisters. it's tearing us apart and i'm thinking it'll not be repaired. my brain is tired tonight but it's like family roles, our roles as siblings and roles with parents have created patterns that got worse with ailing parents. if i could redo the last few years i'd ensure that my step up sister didn't take on so much. i'd also care less about worrying that i'd step on toes or hurt feelings and care more about stuff just getting done. the sibling who is good with your dad:  support her every way possible. bring meals, do chores, drive dad places, give her money and ask if there's anything else you can do. hint:  most caregivers could you use a respite caregiver so they can get to the dentist or have their hair cut. mention if he's losing weight, is he sleeping well, what goofy thing has he done lately (my dh recently peed in a wastebasket in the night, but didn't remember doing it). don't ask her for help, but at least she's in the loop when possibly bigger decisions need to be made. first we had to identify who our parents had put in charge if any. hunted for papers to find out who was the power of attorney. you could have a social worker come to your parents house with or without a nurse and evaluate your parents needs. once the social worker knows what is needed, a seperate meeting could occur with all family members present to hear what mom and dad need. responsibilities can be assigned to each in the sw presence to avoid conflict. remember though, you need to consider the life of each person. for example, i had a brother who was currently taking care of his inlaws. three of us really worked to help our parents out and we were successful. & tears. where there strengths were with our parents. if you don't have a poa then ask the social worker what can be done to do this. it might take a day in court to be established but will give you legal access to handling their affairs. i hope this helps.	0
my mom has been seeing a neurologist and a few months ago she took some kind of written test to see whether she has alzheimer's or not. i'm not entirely sure what the test results were as my mom can be rather private about her health and down play things, but the doctor ordered a brain mri for her. my mom sat me down yesterday and told me that the mri does show alzheimer's. she has not been back in to see the neurologist yet as the doctor is booked out pretty far, but my mom is on the wait list for an appointment so hopefully she gets in soon. i'm not sure how far along the alzheimer's is or if they can tell that from the mri, but my mom seems to think she only has 4-5 years left. i have suspected for a few months now that she may have alzheimer's as she has been having memory problems for a while (started when i was in high school) but have noticeably gotten worse recently. also, alzheimer's does run in her family. she did have a brain mri done 2-3 years ago (i'm not sure if it was related to her memory issues or not) and they said that everything was normal; i'm not sure if maybe they missed something or if there really were no signs on the mri yet. she forgets things we have recently spoken about, sometimes as close as ten minutes ago. she forgets what she was doing. she doesn't clean things up around the house (i.e her dog pooped indoors and she just left it there). she forgets to bathe. however, i do think things are worse than that. she wasn't even going to tell me the results of the mri and was going to pretend that everything was normal but my dad convinced her otherwise. she has not told my younger brother yet. i feel very lost. i'm about to be 24, so i know that i'm an adult, but i'm still finding my footing in the adult world and trying to figure out my place. i don't want to lose my mom. i know i have to step up and help her, though i have no doubt that she will try to leave me out of everything and handle it herself, as she doesn't want to feel like a burden though i have assured her that she is not one. i'm sure my dad will help her with things but, while they are still friends, they have been divorced for over a decade and he works long, demanding hours. i wouldn't mind moving in with her to help her but she will not let me. she says that she will stay in her house for now, and hire someone to come during the days to help her. and when that no longer works/helps, she will move into a care home. i just wanted to confide in y'all and hopefully get some advice. my mom has told me not to tell any of my friends, which i understand and respect, but it means that i have no one outside my family to talk to about this. for those who have a parent that has been affected by alzheimer's, what was it like? what should i prepare myself for? what is something that you wish you had been told? how do i help someone who feels bad about asking for help? any and all advice is helpful. going forward, you will find that unless someone has a parent with dementia, especially early onset, they just will not truly get what you are going through. having a grandparent with dementia is not the same thing. you will find that the best support and understanding you receive is from others in the same boat as you. hiring caregivers and then going into a facility and not looking to young-adult children to take on caregiving is 100% what's best for her and you. her words right now are very important - don't forget them. she wants you to remain her daughter, not become her caregiver. many adult caregivers of parents with dementia are totally breaking down under the stress of caregiving, and wondering what our parent would want if they were in their right mind, or if our parent would understand if we need a break and have to hire professionals or place them in a facility. you already have all that information right from your mom's own mouth. dementia varies a lot from one person to another so keep in mind that your mom's symptoms and experience may be different from what other people tell you about. also, unless your mom has vascular dementia and a history of strokes, i think her 4-5 year life expectancy prediction will probably be wrong. i'd like to go back to times that i previously was complaining about - because i didn't realize at the time how good things still were. i’m 20 years old, my grandma had dementia from around 70 i would say. she’s 80 now, however i haven’t had to take care of since 2 years ago. i wish i could give lots of great advice, but i’m still learning myself. also, it gets easier, you learn what works and doesn’t i was a few years older than you when my dad diagnosed. i’m so sorry you have to go through this. being young makes it even more unfair. i highly recommend getting an elder law attorney as soon as you can. they can help you get durable power of attorney, health care power of attorney, etc. they can also help you navigate your mom’s assets. its important to do this while your mom is still mentally capable. one thing that’s not fun to think about, but important, is to talk to your mom about her final wishes. you can plan and prepay for her funeral. you can ask the funeral home to store the funds in a way that makes it so medicaid can’t take them. it’s also important to make sure there’s nothing left unsaid between you and your mom. the alzheimer’s association helpline (800-272-3900) has helped me a few times when i had questions and i wasn’t sure where to turn to. they are extremely caring and helpful. i also recommend starting therapy and making sure you take care of yourself. it’s also important to make sure you still live your life, you only get one. i dont have much advice but ill share my story in hopes something resonates with you. i was 29 when my dad was originally diagnosed with ad in 2019 (since then was diagnosed with cbd/cbs). every day for a month straight after diagnosis, i cried. all day. i felt so lost too. i went to work at cried at my desk. but every time i saw my dad, i was okay. i didnt cry. things have progressed (or regressed) and its now hard to see him but i can cherish every second im with him. having him keep talking about childhood memories and music makes him light up he is so happy when he remembers the life hes lived. its such bs though that we have to go through this. i get so jealous when i see my friends with their parents, enjoying retirement. sometimes its oddly comforting to know that others your age are also dealing with this. my mom is much older than yours and she was diagnosed a year ago. i'm not sure how you can prepare yourself, but there are a lot of resources out there. [  i found the attached to be helpful. best to you and your family. my dad was diagnosed in 2015 when i was 19 and he was 62. he had been showing symptoms for many years. my dad is now in a full time care facility and he has lost all his abilities. i want you to know that it will be hard. you will be grieving and you will be frustrated with your mother. please be patient with her. i wish i knew how little time we actually had. sorry if my comments doesn't make sense. i dont really know what to mention as there's so many things. ask me anything if you want. in 2019, my mom, 61 years old, was diagnosed with early onset ad -- which, like your mom, ran in her family. unfortunately it's impossible to know exactly how much longer someone with eoad has, but generally, in the case of eoad, the long-term prognosis is not great. you're going to be taking things one day at a time. and then later it'll become one hour at a time. it's very likely she'll lose any social filter and start saying mean, hurtful things. prepare yourself now for these things so you don't end up taking them personally when they happen. my mom has just fairly recently lost track of her grandkids' names (there's only 3 of them) and about a year ago lost track of who's kids are who's and who's wife is who's, but she still seems to very clearly know my brothers and i.  it's the disease that's doing this to your mom and mine, and it's a fucking awful, no good, bag of shit disease. help out subtly when and where you can. if the dog pooped in the house and she's skipped over cleaning it, then just clean it and keep life moving on. keep tabs on her rx and daily intakes to make sure everything's happening as it should -- and nothing's happening that shouldn't be happening. do what you can to be as present and patient as possible. it's very, very hard on the family, but also it's our moms that are the ones constantly confused, disoriented, and trying to figure out day-to-day life when nothing makes sense anymore. another thing... be kind and patient with yourself too. take breaks when you need them. my dad was not diagnosed until 2018 with alzheimer's and we suspect he'd had it since 2009 or so. he had a severe decline over 2020 and we ended up needing to move him to memory care early 2021 as my mom could no longer care for him. my dad passed away at 71 in november of 2021 and the last few years of his life were some of the most challenging. if you have personal friends/family who have experience, reach out to them. i found this subreddit to be particularly helpful in my darkest moments. ask all the questions and get all the history and life stories while you can. good luck and god bless. i’m only 19, but my mother was diagnosed about a year ago (the date should pass any day now) through her spinal fluid. at the time she was a registered nurse, but just before the diagnosis she lost her job at trader joe’s. at that point, my father was giving her a lift to work and home every day. when i was 18, she destroyed her car in a wreck because she somehow completely missed seeing someone right in front of her. we managed to hide it from the insurance company but she no longer drives, which i think was the best decision. **if this hasn’t happened a lot yet, expect it to start. 🤍 the whole process is brutal. she had already stopped driving 3 years earlier. 2 years later she was already getting lost in her own neighborhood, wandering in parking lots when told to wait, and telling outlandish stories that made no sense and her memories were already bad at that point. by late 2016 (literally 10 years later), she was clearly already in late stage dementia and had no idea what was going on anymore. prior to that i was fortunate that i had older tenants that rented rooms in her house that kind of looked after her. my father who was divorced since i was a child also came around so that helped too. i finally had to move back with mom along with my family when she got to the late late stages of the disease in 2018. she got to the point where she would just wander mindlessly in circles around the house, talking to her delusions, and go to bathroom in trash cans, or on the floor at times. later that year she had no idea who i was anymore and i am her only child. in late 2020 she lost the ability to stand and has been bedridden ever since. she is currently 87 and is completely motionless for over 17 months stuck in a hospital bed and just mumbles to herself all day long. to say her existence is downright horrible is an understatement and we all suffer right along with her because we really can't go anywhere now and haven't done much of anything for about 4 years and i have to do literally everything for her. i truly believe my mom's case is an outlier case as most patients don't last this long from what i hear from others (even her own doctor put her on hospice 2 years ago and didn't think she would make it far along into 2021), yet here we are still. nothing about this disease is predictable or easy. some days are better than others, the worst years for me were 2018-2020 when she was basically an out of control angry zombie like personality and would try to cause damage with any items or furniture that she passed by. now she can't do anything so it's a more controlled environment with lots of downtime, but very hard to watch none the less. the hardest part for me now is juggling her care while trying to offer a normal childhood for my two kids, but fortunately my wife helps me alot with the things i just can't do right now. hope this helps, good luck! my best advice is a second opinion with a memory specialist neurologist. misdiagnosis is common in the 50s age group and a brain mri cannot show alzheimer's. they are not very diagnostic and at most you can try to appreciate patterns of atrophy typically seen in alzheimer's but it's not too absolute. a spinal tap looking for ad markers or an amyloid pet scan would be much much more useful than an mri. everything that you described is also seen in pseudo dementia as well so it is important to make sure a miss diagnosis has not occurred. my father is now mid to late stages and while i’m older than you this might help. try to spend plenty of quality time with your mom now and take pictures. eg go to parks, zoos, beach, hikes. make some nice memories for yourself. try to get your mom on a good diet now. decent nutrition will help keep her mind healthy longer, whether it’s meal delivery service or whatever. do those legal things, even though it will likely be awful. also find the care home she likes now so there are fewer questions later. best wishes i appreciate you sharing your story. 30 years old here with my mom getting diagnosed with eo a few months ago at age 59. it has rocked our world as it has not run in her family up until this point. i had joined a support group for a meeting but all the caregivers are also older and just felt like i couldn’t connect with them. if you or anyone else would like to connect just to talk and vent about being a young adult who has to deal with this shit situation, i’d love to find a way for us to find a forum to do so.	0
personally i'd rather see the alz association focus on getting long term care covered by medicare, using the same force and energy they're using for this drug. or they could do a better job of creating more local support groups. or publishing more useful guides - it's interesting to me that many of the great guides or books like teepa snow never seem to be recommended by them. rather than bankrupting medicare for a drug that doesn't work, money would be better spent on research into preventing dementia and providing care for people with this god awful disease and others that require long term care. heck, money would be better spent on covering dental care.	0
we too have gone to all finger food and an air fryer has helped quite a bit. wife gets ensure for breakfast. i bet dad would love that. thanks for posting! 😊 really nice. for my mom, we found that small portions really helped. 💕 yep, finger-food grazing plates are the way to go! a few years ago i got my mum sporks (spoon/fork) for when cutlery is needed - also makes it easier.	0
tl;dr: mom's sick and hostile towards me. how best can i help her, and keep us both safe, until the doctor sees her? my mom gets incredibly agitated when she's sick and with a fever. i do my best to remain calm and try to tell her reassuring words but it seems like it falls on deaf ears. i can't redirect her or distract her like the resources i've been find online say as she only gets more worked up and tells me things like i'm faking being nice to her. i've also tried being in a different room than she is so she can calm down on her own, but she meanders and eventually finds me again and gets worked up. i've tried looking around for other tips but it's not for anything as drastic as her pushing me. she's sick again and we're working on getting an appointment set up with her pcp asap. i don't mind so much that she's taking her frustrations out on me, granted i do get shaken up by it, but i just want her to be feeling better. generally she's been very sweet since she got diagnosed with early onset three years ago so the sudden mood changes are quick to be noticed and the four of us, my dad, two sisters, and myself, work as fast as we can to give her care. does your county/city have palliative care?palliative care has helped so much more with my dads mood issues that his primary care doctor. it might be worth it to see if they can help with your mom. her psychologist prescribed three basic antipsychotics that really helped, for my wife zoloft worked the best. but i started giving her more and more pills chasing good behavior. the psychiatrist adjusted her program and it has worked fairly well up to this point. she is taking eight pills a day and she does everything she can to avoid taking them.	0
this question was posed in 2017 and 2018 in this sub, but now that a bit more time has passed, i'm wondering if more people have read the book and tried the recommendations? i'm especially confused about how 'extreme' of a diet do we need to follow? and since  damage starts occurring in the brain starting in 30's / 40's, my partner and i want to make sure we follow a brain healthy lifestyle, given his family history. thank you!!! it’s not grounded in repeatable science. in other words, you can’t prove a causal relationship between the proposed diet and alzheimer’s progression. it’s unfortunate, but anything that claims to solve or cure alzheimer’s is unlikely to be real unless it’s brand new, and coming from a major medical institution or medical journal. sadly it is as horrible as bredesen, perlmutter, or oz. if you want a diet to help alzheimer's, cut out as much processed oils (canola oil etc) and with it, fried foods as possible. the genetic link between alz and dementia is explicitly tied to the oxidative byproducts of fats (all kinds). the last group is 5% of the population, and account for ~1% of cases (protective variant). the differences are related to the protein's ability to detoxify the lipid oxidation byproducts. exercise, sleep well, heart healthy diet while knowing that it might not work. saved you many pages.	0
i have a parent who tells me they've been diagnosed with alzheimer's. my relationship with the parent has been trying for my entire life due to their mental illness and, i believe, extreme narcissism. the issue i have is that i'm on my own and they're in one of the poorest states of the country, so, i'd be looking at some pretty limited options in terms of work and life, to say nothing of the fact that they've never really willingly been there since i graduated in terms of safety net or helping me in my career. the parent has a partner but they're in their 80s so... honestly, and i may get tons of shit for this. i would suggest avoiding completely uprooting your life, career and future for a parent you are not close with, and harbor any amount of resentment towards. i honestly don't believe just bc you birthed a kid or two, that you're entitled to their time/effort and anguish..... especially if you were  a shit parent. and taking care of a much loved relative w/ alzheimer's is hard on the good days. i would see about taking family leave for as long as you can, in order to try and get a sense of what they have going on now/what she needs & how to set things up for management from afar. get medical poa at minimum, switch all physician contact info to you, also look into financial poa if possible. (may be much harder w/ a spouse or partner involved) if she is still fairly self sufficient, i would try and find a facility that starts with assisted living, and has steps for future memory care. (we wish we could have gotten my grandma into her facility sooner, when she was more 'with it' she's always been very social, and if she had more time to adjust prior to decline, we think she would be more comfortable now) if you can get her set up where she's comfortable, and manage her care from afar i would, in your situation. that or find a facility close to where you are now, and move her there for you. if career prospects and everything is as bad as you say, i think avoiding it would be overall better. they moved closer to me, a nearby city where 2 siblings live so i don't get the brunt of it. it's a lot of work, tons of paperwork and research as they decline. from my own experience, a rocky relationship gets worse. i have a really hard time fighting my own feelings and being kind when i just want to walk away. maybe it'd be different if my mother liked me but who knows. if it's affordable this is the time to look into transitional living, independent to memory care. it can be complex, so much to factor in. oh jeez i'm sorry to sound so negative! it's just a struggle i'm currently dealing with. i have the opposite situation as you, my dad is the kindest, sweetest man i’ve ever known. he’s in an “apartment with help” (memory care) 10 minutes away which is centrally located between my siblings and i. and it can still be really stressful. my mother died suddenly in november 2020. i believe it was due to the stress of caregiving. add to that the narcissism of your parent and other mental health issues you’ve mentioned, and uprooting your life and moving to a place with limited career options sounds like a dream come true for a narcissistic parent and a nightmare for the child of a narcissist. unless they’re willing to give you poa or move to “an apartment with help” i personally wouldn’t move there. if they expect you to move there and be their whipping boy/girl for the rest of their life i would make it clear it’s not happening. and then i would expect them to say what an awful son/daughter you are because that’s what narcissists do. i’m so sorry you have to go through this. please keep us updated! i found a local support group for adult children of alzheimer’s patients through alz.org. if you have to be the primary caretaker, move them to you, or both of you move somewhere with max. options and support. my family and i did exactly this about 1.5 years ago. don't give up your job and social network to become a caretaker to an aging narcissist. nope, you'll simply get verbally abused.. we moved my mil from florida to nc to live with us instead.	0
my dad is 50. i’m his primary caregiver, he has early onset alzheimer’s and every day i see him get worse. every day when i wake up i feel this gaping hole in my chest, and by the time i go to bed at night it’s so bad i can barely breathe from it. had to get therapy for it still working on this. end of last year my wife started asking me things that made it clear that at certain times, she didn't know who i am. 'where do you live? but every day is a little worse: more uncertainty, more people and places gone. (it is right next to the bed). so coping is really, so far, just a matter of keeping perspective. i fear that one day, probably very soon, reality will hit. i think coping is a matter of letting go of how you want it to be and instead, knowing  what to expect. (and, of course, acting accordingly)   ^(not sure this is helpful. i think i just wanted to type this out to read it back to myself) i try to remember simple is better. simple answers, simple expectations and try to care for myself. i help my mother with my dad, they live with my husband and myself. i vent regularly to my husband. but i also take antianxiety meds. in started then not long after my dad was diagnosed i did try to wean off them butt i got cancer and went back on. make sure you get assistance. it can be a family member taking over for an evening or an side. you gotta take breaks, even if you do absolutely nothing during those breaks. it's mostly a slow process. my mother struggled with expecting my dad to still be able to do things and communicate but she adjusted. just remember to take care of yourself. my dad got diagnosed at 61/62 for early onset but he was showing signs before that and let me tell you, coping is really hard. try to put yourself in the mindset of ‘they cannot help it, they’re not trying to annoy you’ …being primary caregiver is a huge burden to carry so try to get as much external support as you can. my brothers and i would work from my parents’ house 1-2 days per week to take care of him while my mom worked, my aunts and uncles would all come by as often as possible to help too. he’s now in a nursing home at 66 because he couldn’t walk and my parents house was becoming a huge danger to him but we visit him every day and feel a little lighter knowing he’s in a place where they have the tools and machines to get him through the day. i try to remember simple is better. simple answers, simple expectations and try to care for myself. i help my mother with my dad, they live with my husband and myself. i vent regularly to my husband. but i also take antianxiety meds. in started then not long after my dad was diagnosed i did try to wean off them butt i got cancer and went back on. make sure you get assistance. it can be a family member taking over for an evening or an side. you gotta take breaks, even if you do absolutely nothing during those breaks. it's mostly a slow process. my mother struggled with expecting my dad to still be able to do things and communicate but she adjusted. just remember to take care of yourself.	0
my father (m, 70) has been confined to a wheelchair for about 15 years, and is reliant on help for even getting out of bed and going out and about. my mother (f, 61) is there to assist him, and we are lucky to be able to afford carers who tend to him. recently, over the last few years, he has become noticably forgetful - from both small things, such as what day it is, what he had for lunch, or what time someone is supposed to come over, to other more things such as my brother's birthday, his cousin's name, whether people are dead or alive, etc. sometimes he will ask the same question 2 or 3 times during lunch or dinner, not realising that we have spoken about it already barely 5-10 minutes earlier. it has reached the stage where it is noticable even to people who don't live with him, but are meeting him socially. the problem is - he is refusing to acknowledge these things happening. in one instance, even when on text message he mentioned something unfathomable, and we tried to show it to him as 'proof', asking him what he was trying to say, he just shuts up and shuts everyone else out. looking at early symptoms of alzheimer's, he is displaying a number of them: forgeting about recent conversations or events; forgeting the names of places and objects; asking questions repetitively; becoming less flexible and more hesitant to try new things. but he refuses to see a doctor. i really am not sure how i even proceed with this - i do not live in the same city as my parents, and i know that my mother is quite anxious about what the future holds. in her opinion, even if we just know what is happening, either way, at least it makes it easier to deal with - if a diagnosis can be confirmed, wouldn't it be better to start treating with medicines as early as possible? and if he is being this stubborn now, and he does indeed have alzheimer's, what is it going to be like as it progressively gets worse? in the last month itself i have felt it get worse. any advice is appreciated, both on how to approach my father and try to make him see a doctor, as well as how i can help my mother cope better with this. thanks in advance! you can't really treat it very effectively, so i wouldn't stress about getting a diagnosis, unless you expect you'll need it to get subsidized care or some other form of government help. does your father visit the doctor at all? my grandma got a mental ability test during a routine checkup at her usual general practice doctor. you do just a couple of things, doesn't take long and it's enough to get the papers. have your mother talk to the doctor beforehand about what's been happening. i would request that the doctor tells him what kind of test is being done, my grandma felt entrapped a bit, because it wasn't explained clearly to her. does he take pills as is now? it's more important to start figuring out how you'll deal with more and more advanced care your father will most likely need. can you mother handle it alone or should you start looking for help? do you have to enroll him in a home sooner rather than later because of waiting lines? best to be prepared. start educating yourself and your mom about the disease (and i mean dementia here as a broad umbrella term, i don't think a specific diagnosis is very useful in patients with gradual onset over a couple of years), it's more about coping with it for carers. you have to stop caring about repeating things and getting asked the same questions, takes a little practice to get used to it. for example, my grandma always has this one story about someone stealing her bed sheets (partly true story, partly i removed some when i moved in with her). i stopped convincing her that it didn't happen, i just listen to her, confirm that stealing is horrible and that a bad thing did indeed happen to her, but that she is safe now. that way we both remain calm and move on with our day. the patients usually don't really know what's going on anyway (my grandma doesn't really remember, that she doesn't remember, if that makes sense). you gain nothing (i'd argue that you often end up achieving the opposite, just causing stress to both parties) by making your father admit he has memory issues, because he'll forget about it anyways and you'll be doing it all over again the next day. i'm sorry you're going through this. i've been going through this too, and it is probably the hardest part of the condition... the fact that they can no longer be reasoned with because reason doesn't get through. there's an account that i follow on instagram (i am in no way affiliated with them, it's just been a really helpful account) that posted something recently. when my dad was at a stage that it sounds like your dad was at, he was already out of it enough that we could lie or just not tell him we were taking him to a doc. i think we booked the appointment (you could explain to the docs office what was going on so they'd be ready for complications or resistance) and we might have told him but he forgot. then on the 30 minute trip there, im pretty sure we told him we were going to the bank, or for a doctor appointment for me, or going shopping. he sure wasn't comprehending the appointment was a neurologist for him. when in the docs office he was annoyed with the doc, and offended at being asked the 'stupid questions' that 'of course he knew' but couldn't answer. and thats how we got him his preliminary diagnosis and how we got him to all the other follow up appointments. this really works depending on how long they can retain a convo for tho. if your dad remembers a convo from yesterday, it might not work. if he cant retain for an hour, maybe? you could try taking him on an actual nice short day out and see how long he retains things from point to point. alternatively maybe you could luck out and find a doc who makes house calls? i do encourage you to try tho, mainly because of the chance that its *not* alzheimer's and is something treatable or even reversible. a lot of things can cause dementia and they need to be ruled out. sometimes, the earlier you catch a cause, the better the outcome too. one thing, has you or your mom looked into long-term memory care insurance? we just learned about this, but you can only get it before the insured person has been diagnosed with anything (with a broad definition of ‘diagnosed’). it might cost a bit now, but might really help you and your family in the long run. my husband does not  like to go to the doctor either. it’s probably best to make the appointment and not tell him until the day of. its not worth arguing with someone who has dementia , if he does have it. you could tell the doc about your concerns before hand and then tell your dad its just a routine check up . the doctor will just ask a few questions and judge his response. you can lie  to your dad about the reason for the appointment, if he asks . good luck . i  think i  know what you are going through. that was me for the last 2 years with my dad. two weeks later he had a referral for a senior eval. i accompanied him to the appt. and he scored a 22/30 on their exam recommended additional follow up, therapy etc. wouldn’t even commit to scheduling a re-exam in 12 months. so.. baby steps, i guess. now i work on follow up and recommended action (is his house safe to age in place, etc).	0
hey there, i've been following this sub for a while and i really appreciate that it exists. my grandma - who means the whole world to me - was diagnosed with pca/benson's syndrome (a rare, visual variant of alzheimer's) two years ago. but her health has drastically deteriorated in the past month. i’m not her primary caregiver but i check up on her every other day and make sure to cheer her up. we live in armenia where resources/awareness are very limited, so i’m hoping to engage directly with people who understand what i’m going through. ideally, i want to find or create a virtual support group for people who have a family member with pca or dementia in general. any words of encouragement or advice will be highly appreciated. thank you in advance. i’m so sorry, hun… i’m all in for a support group, maybe on telegram? i'll join as well. contact a geriatrics department or agency on aging, letting them know you want to set this up. even with limited resources, it costs them nothing to post a flyer or connect you with an outreach worker.	0
nan it’s important to not remind her of the dog’s death if she asks where the dog is. when this happened to my dad, we always made up some excuse like the dog was at the vet or getting groomed. after a while, he forgot about the dog. sometimes it is best to fib for her comfort. you can say she went to the groomers. the excuse doesn’t even need to be a good one since she won’t remember it anyway. say the dog is out for a walk, or the vet, or at the dog park. my first suggestion is: give it time because sad to say, she may forget about her dog or forget how important it was to her. when my mom’s beloved cat passed away she kept forgetting too and would get sad every time. now she barely remembers the cat at all. she has pictures of him and sometimes she says what a great cat he was, but most of the time i don’t think she is clear on how much she loved it so it doesn’t bother her anymore. also, i have a cat now and she focuses on him now. so my 2nd suggestion would be to get her a new dog to help her focus on that, but only if there is someone living with her that can make sure the dog gets fed and walked in case she forgets to. when my mom would ask where he was, i'd choke up and she'd see my reaction and question me even more.	0
just got this from mum after doing sunday lunch. looking after her is so challenging at times but fuck me that's made me well up. a rare moment of thinking i am doing something right mom was at my appointment. i know it never feels like enough but you're doing great. big hugs	0
had to go on a walk because grandma refuses to go to bed. but insists she will be up for church at 9am (she will not, then blame me for not waking her). had to cancel a 3pm remote piano lesson and a midday home haircut this week because she wouldn’t get out of bed. anyone got ideas for readjusting sleep patterns, or should i just cancel everything? bedtime and wakeup routines are your friends. they won't take effect immediately, but the body learns to adjust to patterns. examine what is going on evenings that might rev her up, like too much screen time. have wakeup time be the same every day. good luck.	0
need help please. my daughter is visiting for a long period with her dog. my mother keeps saying it’s ‘her’ dog and gets mad when my daughter takes her dog for a walk or feeds her. mom keeping getting upset and telling everyone to leave ‘her’ dog along. thanks so much. have you considered getting your mother a stuffed animal dog? maybe one that’s the same color as your daughters dog, if you can. that’s what worked with my mom, we got her the joy for all robotic cat that purrs and meows and everything and she’s as happy as a clam. is it possible to have something to distract her when your daughter goes out for walks and move the dogs food bowls somewhere that mom doesn't go often? this disease is frustrating because so often there are no solutions outside of redirection or changing our own behavior we're starting to have this issue with my sister's cat. we live at home with our dad to take care of our mom and lately mom has been claiming the cat is hers and gets authoritative over it whenever we take actual care of it. mom misreads its body language frequently so it's difficult to address her behavior and the cat's at the same time. she has her own stuffed dog and absolutely loves it but chooses the live cat whenever both are in the same room. i usually end up hovering nearby to supervise that their interactions are safe for both but that tends to agitate mom and gets more protective of the cat. how is your mom's balance? if she's able to walk much and the dog's properly leashed trained, maybe see if going out on walks together with your daughter might help? if that's not an option, perhaps keeping the dog and mom separate and out of eye sight during feeding and walking time might work. or ask your daughter to have someone else watch the dog. try not to tell your mom that it's not her dog as that will only make her more defensive. if she starts to get super possessive, maybe the dog should be kept somewhere else close while your daughter visits and can take care of her pet without your mom being upset. i know some patients do well with baby dolls too.	0
so, it’s a bit of a mess of a story, but my paternal grandfather was recently admitted to a facility because of dementia, and his kidneys have begun to fail so he doesn’t have much time left. i am currently 22, and i haven’t seen or heard from him since around 2010 due to my dad making the decision to cut contact with him due to other mental health problems of his to keep both of us safe. i have mental health problems myself, and they of course have gotten a lot worse since these developments. i feel selfish because i know how much being visited means to him right now, but all i do is freeze and lose the ability to speak when in the room with him, and then begin drinking heavily for the rest of the day after that. i’m hoping anyone out there has any suggestions or insight on the best course of action. should i try harder to suck it up and be there for him, both so he’s less alone, and so that i won’t feel like i didn’t do enough after he’s gone? or maybe i should stay away since it’s so high stress on my end and for the people around me worrying about my addiction problems coming back, and i’ll just have the pleasant memories of all the things we used to do together when i was really little. i don’t know him very well anymore but from how i used to know him, i believe he would want me to only remember him as he was when i was little. thank you for reading, i know how awful dementia is, and i’ve handled it before, but its completely different when it’s family. i’m very worried about your stress levels. it’s not worth it if your sobriety is at risk. could you honor your grandfather in some other way, that would not risk your sobriety? if there is a funeral, they will need memory boards. get black tri-fold poster boards at a craft store, and put pictures of your grandfather in better days on it? you could read to him, or bring some lotion and put rub some into his hands and onto his feet. that is very soothing. you could hum a song while doing it. this would be as much for him as it is for you. if you can picture doing these things for him, without your stress levels going up, then maybe you can do it. if picturing this makes you anxious, i feel that it is not safe for you to do it. your grandfather would not want you to risk your sobriety for this. good luck, and please keep us posted. could you try going with your dad? might help take some of the pressure off. also, maybe try not having high expectations when you go. just sitting there with him is more than enough. turn the tv on, read a book. maybe build up to the small talk once you’ve sat there for a little while. you also don’t have to stay long. whatever you can endure is fine. if you are coping after a visit with him by drinking heavily for the rest of the day, you are damaging yourself. you have a responsibility to yourself and the people around you to keep yourself physically and mentally healthy. if your grandfather can still read or has someone who can read to him, you might consider sending a note or card instead of some visits. you want to let him know that he is loved, and you can do it this way. it’s probably better - for him and for you - than physically being present but not being mentally or emotionally present when visiting him. as someone who lives with liver disease, i want you prioritize your own health during this difficult time. i understand it’s hard; my step mother is dealing with dementia herself. the problem is that, there are no warning signs. you won’t feel any symptoms until it’s already too late. the liver is a miraculous organ that helps to regulate hundreds of functions in the body. many don’t realize that the damaged liver itself isn’t always the problem, but instead causes all kinds of other health issues in the body as a result of being diseased. if the disease progresses far enough to cause scarring (cirrhosis), there’s no undoing the damage. it will shorten your life, and you’ll spend that time with significant health issues. so please take care of yourself during this difficult time. if you absolutely have to see your grandfather and risk your sobriety over it, consider having a buddy that doesn't drink and who you trust to stay with you before, during, and for some time after your visit. you could maybe also ask the people who tend to him if there's anything he'd like/need that you could send them? not sure how applicable that would be, but it might be worth it if you could help him and not risk your well-being simultaneously.	0
one of my parents has been leaving salt and pepper shakers in the microwave a few times and (from what i can tell) not thinking it was them who did it. i only brought it up the first time but am afraid to again. my mom’s family has a strong history of dementia and her own mom (my grandma) now has it. it seems like all women on her side at some point get dementia. so i think it’s my mom who did this but i don’t know. does anyone have advise on what to do? i need to be sensitive about it all. also my mom recently picked up smoking weird again for pain so i’m wondering if perhaps she’s just high, but given her close family history that seems unlikely.	0
grandfather is on oxygen, doesn't leave the house at all, he doesn't want to deal with her, so he lets her drive and do whatever she wants, she crashed 2 hours away from us and we only found out that she crashed because someone helped her at the crash. i know it’s almost impossible to have a doctor take a license away, i’ve been through it and know other people who have too. i had a customer tell me to they removed the battery and the starter relay from their dads vehicle, that’s what i would do. if they catch on, or you don’t want to hide what you’re doing, tell them. tell them you cannot have your grandmas death, or the death of anyone else, on your conscience because of their negligence. as a mom with a toddler, this scares the hell out of me. would you rather have a mad grandpa and aunt on your hands, or a dead child? maybe i went to worst case scenario, but it happens. remember almost all “accidents” are preventable. i used to drive my grandma anywhere, any time i could to stop her from driving. maybe try to set a schedule so everyone can get grandma where she needs to go. be prepared for people like my shit uncle, who said, it’s not that i can’t help, i choose not to. thanks for caring so much, you’re a good person. what you can do may vary by your state. you can check your state's dmv to see who reports of a medically impaired driver may come from, but in general it would be a doctor or law enforcement. hipaa won't allow them to tell you what, if any, action they take but it doesn't prevent you from giving information to them. i'd keep the message short and succinct with as much supporting detail as you know. in the state of ny, when my dad had his accident and the paramedics/hospital recognized he had a cognitive issue, they filed it with the police and dmv. he was forced to take a road exam with an occupational therapist who works with the motor vehicles agency. only he could pass/fail my dad. removed a lot of the pressure from us on deciding if dad could drive again. he needs to go back every 6 months. see if your state has something like this. now my dad has lost all interest in driving. we had my mom evaluated by an occupational therapist who specializes in driving evaluations for dementia and alzheimer’s patients. you may want to mention, that because of her dx, and now a history of not being capable behind the wheel, your grandfather (or anyone who may have poa) could be held liable for any damages/injuries in any future accidents... try and convince her to stop driving and get other family members on board. report her to the state dmv. they'll take her license away.	0
for those of you interested in the science of treating alzheimer's, there was a multi-day conference over the past few days where a lot of companies laid out how they've been approaching these different neurodegenerative diseases. [  so far, biogen has a product that passed fda trials for treatment of alzheimer's called aduhelm. it was initially listed at $56,000 for a year's worth of medication which was a staggering amount of money. this was a obviously a real downer because i was initially excited to hear biogen get the nod from the fda until i heard about the price. if anyone has experience with it, i'd be interested to hear about it. what's great though is that time is running out on them being the only treatment. it turns out that there are actually a lot of other companies that want a chance to perform trials and get something to market which will likely reduce the price and the possibility that one of these companies will knock it out of the park and for a reasonable price. two other hopefuls:  promis: [  alzheon: [  merck had one get to phase 3 trials, but wasn't able to pass. i believe they're still working on it. i think there are other big pharma projects as well. the cruddy thing about the biogen drug is it did not actually show cognitive improvement in the participants, rather it showed that it can clear amyloid which they think can slow progression. while we wait for a drug that is a cure, there are great programs to help people with the symptoms they have. this is a great one sponsored by nia  not trying to imply support for or against, but if you wanted to get involved in trying to lower the cost of aduhelm, the alzheimer's association has been trying to get it accessible to all for a while:   you could see if there is an alzheimer's association near you, especially their local advocacy activity. in my state they have us talking to lawmakers to push local and, if you want, national issues like aduhelm pricing, and using social media or whatever you're comfortable with. science moves slow...its the nature of science. ..and legislation can be slow too, but advocacy is one way us ordinary folks can speed some types of help along.	0
my dad (78)is in the hospital as he has quickly advancing alzheimer’s and he wasn’t eating or drinking enough. it is no longer a medical emergency ( it was)but he’s still not getting around like he was or taking in as much food as he should. my mom can’t take care of him. problem is a few months ago he was so healthy and active and still driving etc. they are recommending a home. when i visit he constantly says he’s doing better and eating, doing his physical therapy etc etc. he’s asking why he’s still there and wants to be discharged. i haven’t told him yet but keep saying “ just a bit longer” and “ once you get your strength back”. or i play dumb like i don’t know either. how do i handle? tia in general, the recommendation is no, don't tell the person with dementia--it would usually be more for the person telling to feel better than for the person with dementia. 'just a bit longer when you get more strength back' sounds like a fine answer in the meantime. when it comes time for him to move, some people frame the move to memory care as 'your doctor wants you to be in a special rehab until you improve more,' but that's a case by case thing. we told my dad the house needed construction work and it was dangerous so he had to stay at the home. we never used the words memory care or nursing home and acted like it was a hotel or apartment. he's been there about a month and has stopped asking to go home. quick decline sometimes means uti. some doctors can remember stuff but aren't critical thinkers. did they check? morally, i think keeping the present pleasant and positive is the way to go. i'm caring for my father who has alzheimer's and as much as my brain has conflict with white lies my priority is his immediate comfort. his ability to grasp concepts are declining so keeping things simple is important. best of luck to you, it's a journey that's for sure. don't know what your folks money situation is like, cause every option is costly. is there any possibility of getting your mom some assistance and keeping him at home. wish there were good options, but there really are not. my mom has been in memory care for years and while it is necessary, it's horrible. if you dad is still somewhat functional he will probably be very unhappy. good luck, and prayers for you and your family. no chance of any younger relatives to move in with them? alzheimer's disease does not advance remotely that quickly. has he had a proper work up from a neurologist? i would assume they checked for uti? uti's are notorious for causing complete delirium in elderly patients and can mimic a fast progressing dementia, however most of the time the patient returns to baseline after some time has passed and it has been fully treated. other possibilities would include nmda encephalitis and other autoimmune encephalitis diseases which can progress rapidly. the most common finding though is that the patient has been declining for years but it just went unnoticed because people are so used to covering for them until they're unable to do more simple things. if he hasn't had a proper neurological workup that's what i would recommend. as far as the nursing home, i can't imagine it will go well if he just shows up at a nursing home and no one told him he was going there. it really depends on how well he would probably tolerate that news. but i have seen families just bring their loved one to a nursing home that they never knew they were going to and he became so combative that he was kicked out of the nursing home fairly quickly. i also recommend a very deep research into the nursing homes available as most of them have pretty shady reputations. by any chance did he experience a stroke? my grandmother on my dad’s side (both my grandmothers had alzheimer’s) had a stroke which led to her rapid decline. i would tell him what is going on and get his doctor’s recommendation as to what the next steps should be. if you can and if you have the support for it, i would suggest bringing him home to be cared by family. we did that with my maternal grandmother for 7 years.	0

has anyone dealt with moderate to severe incontinence in a parent with alzheimer's? we've taken my dad to the urologist and he's on 3 different medications to tackle the incontinence from every direction but it doesn't seem to be working as well as we hoped. at this point, the incontinence issue is probably worse than the alz, since he is in fairly early stages of it. any advice would be greatly appreciated! routine helps a lot. after a meal, have him go to the bathroom. every two or three hours, have him go to the bathroom as well. my dad has a lot of accidents at night, so his caregivers get him up after three or four hours of sleep as well. my dad will grumble and be mad about it, but it helps to prevent accidents. we got depends for my mom. she does remember to go to the toilet sometimes - but sometimes it just comes out. and the depends are a lot easier than cleaning up the mess, especially because she doesn't always realize she's made one. she's also tried to wash them in the sink and in the washing machine (they get really big!) and sometimes she will put regular underwear underneath them. but it's still better than no diaper at all. one thing that seems to help my mid-stage partner: reminders. sometimes the sound of my using the bathroom is also a prompt. it sounds ridiculous, but just askng 'do you have to use the toilet' may be able to break into the zone-out and get action started. of course, then it's on you not to be absent-minded. i increased the nightlight level in the bathrooms. that helped my partner's ability to use the bathroom at night. my advice is to talk about this straightforwardly and buy him some disposable briefs. unfortunately it'll slowly get worse, at some point it'll need diapers for both #1 and #2. constant reminders and a schedule help so you catch it before it happens. at some point they'll start missing the toilet even if they try to go, soil their clothes and not notice and walk around your house sitting on everything my mother in law developed double incontinence at the mid-ad stage - the part of her brain that tells her she needs to go to the toilet has been affected (common in ad). we tried taking her to the toilet more often but she was v reluctant and resistant. it got to the point where we had to get adult pull-ups. in the uk you can get them for free if your gp refers you to the continence clinic. i don't know where in the world you are, but perhaps there's a similar scheme you could utilise? as an aside, elderly people are more prone to utis, and they have a huge effect on dementia patients (my mil would become more aggressive/violent, paranoid, even forgot how to walk) - it's worth testing weekly (i bought the uti strips from amazon). wishing you the best of luck on this journey. yep. my mom would go in her pants while she was walking around. she’s had a couple of minor tias since then and seizures that robbed her of her speech and mobility. got the call today that she had another stroke and prob won’t last much longer. disease sucks father has the same issue, but his incontinence is due to the meds he's on. i live in a different country to my parents, so the only solution we've found is diapers ... dad is on the more affected end of the alzheimer’s spectrum and has a prostate issue. continence garments are a must at this point. routine is key until it doesn’t make an impact. if he is taking any anticholinergic medications for his incontinence it would exacerbate his dementia. typical ones are oxybutynin, detral, and toviaz  myrbetriq is the only incontinence medication recommended for dementia patients since it is not anticholinergic. a condom catheter is another option and of course depends. incontinence is usually pretty tough to treat in dementia. also be on the look out for doctors trying to label him with normal pressure hydrocephalus with his incontinence  it is commonly misdiagnosed in the alzheimer's population. routine can help. diapers too, but call it briefs so they feel less demoralized. a foley may be another option but that increase the risks of an uti. mum is incontinent and it started off slowly. she had some sort of episode the day before she went into hospital (never found out what - we thought it was a stroke, but wasn't) and from that day onwards she was urine incontinent 24/7. adult diapers are now the norm for my mum. it is very distressing for her as she is still aware enough to realise, but not understanding enough to know that it can't be fixed. very sad. forty years of dealing with alzheimer's, yes. i see my comment has been down voted. but, the fact is that out of control infections are the result negligence on the part of so-called 'caregivers.' i understand that it is hard to continually take your parent to the the hospital, but there is no answer on reddit that solves that. chronic infection is a sign of negligence. incontinence is usually due to infection in alzheimer's patients.	0
mom (91) passed last night. it came on quick. i live out of state and wasn’t able to see her the last three years. she had vascular dementia and had gotten to the stage where i couldn’t talk on the phone with her. i  prayed she would pass easily one day. i didn’t know she was taken to the hospital until she was gone. i was hoping i would get to see her one more time . . and what really sucks , is my husband has alzheimer’s and i can’t travel with him. last time i drove  long distance with him he tried to  find something to cut the seatbelt and he opened the car door while i was driving on the interstate. so going to moms funeral is out of the question. i don’t dare fly with him . i would love to have some closure. just putting it out there because ad sucks. so i’ve been  talking to mom and letting her know how much she has meant to me and all the things i wish i could have talked to her about the last 8 years. i hope she can hear me. i love you mom . and fuck you dementia. my sympathies go out  for those who have also lost someone. we are all dealing with this everyday and i hope you all have bright moments and find your own little space of calm and peace . i’m so sorry for your loss, i hope that peace and closure find you in other ways ♥️ i lost mom last tuesday morning to ad. she had stopped eating and drinking for weeks + she slept almost 24 hours a day. i wanted to hear mom say “i love you son” one more time. i wanted her to say it but i wanted her to mean it too. so sorry for you. a mom couldn’t do anything less. fuck dementia, my mom is 61 and has early onset alzheimer's. i'm afraid to lose it the day she will leave. sorry about your husband too, i'm dealing with that myself right now and wouldn't even consider traveling with him. wishing you gentle moments.	0
my dad has dementia and is going to need full-time help soon enough. (driving, shopping, etc.) my mother is a half-functioning alcoholic (half the time sober and amazing, half the time binge drinking/in bed.) i wouldn't say they are in denial but they are 100% wanting to kick the decision down the road and don't seem motivated to face it. how would you deal with this situation? i live several hours away. plan a visit with them. prepare for a very difficult but necessary conversation about both of their end-of-life care. tell your mom in advance you plan to discuss this during your visit and ask if she can dig up a copy of her will if she has one, and if she would be willing to “get some things squared away” with you “just in case”. or if you dont think she’d take it well, dont mention it but it may make it easier if she is prepared as well for the discussion. ask her when she would like help caring for your father. at what point will she not want to be his only caretaker? discuss finances available for that care. maybe there is a neighbor or a friend that can stop in for a couple hours a day to watch your dad and do a couple of chores for her, and care could ramp up from there as he progresses. discuss medical proxy, and possibly be prepared to draw up forms to make you the primary person to make decisions on your mother’s behalf in an emergency, rather than your father. discuss what your mother would like the later years of her life to look like. this may also soften her up to the idea of caregivers if she is against them...thinking about her future as a full time caregiver 5+ years down the road. while you’re there, check their house for hazards. people with alzheimers do better in bright light, especially in the winter when the sun sets so early; ensure they have a lot of good light in their house. it also helps prevent falls and injuries since depth perception can go with alzheimers as well. discourage the use of thick area rugs that have edges that can be tripped over, as well as any other trip hazards. offer to install a bar or a chair in their shower if they need that. just do some general things so you know theyre a *little* bit safer on their own. i’m sorry you’re going through this, and it might be hard to have those conversations with your mom but its the only way you can sleep soundly knowing you tried your best to get them to be safe short of uprooting your whole life and moving in with them. i'm in a very similar situation.... my step mother's drinking causes me massive anxiety as well knowing that she's my father's caretaker. i wish i had helpful advice. unfortunately i'm looking for some advice as well as this situation is a train wreck coming. i feel your pain. that’s a double whammy. i don’t know how to approach the drinking because people get super defensive when approached about that. but maybe if you get your mom into some support groups (even informal support groups) for people living with family with dementia she may start accepting his diagnosis and decline and perhaps get motivated to get herself together so she can be a better support for her hubby. the alzheimer’s association is a good resource for formal support groups. for something more informal you could try an online program- this is an nia funded movement program that includes some group interactions	0
i've never met anyone with alzheimer's before, but am visiting my aunt who was diagnosed in 2014 next week. i haven't seen her since 2011. although i will be with her daughter, whom she lives with, i am still nervous-- i know she won't know who i am, but what questions do i ask? how do i introduce myself? thanks in advance for the answers. this may sound crazy, but let her lead the discussion. don't ask questions, and i probably wouldn't even introduce myself -- just be friendly and warm. but let her lead the discussion and just be warm and friendly. follow-up thought: be prepared for her to say things that are uncomfortable, perhaps even to the point of being mean or rude. they both also get/got agitated very easily. also depends on the level but my dad likes to just make really random jokey chat. it’s his way to cover that he doesn’t really know what’s going on. so avoid referential conversations that need them to remember something you said a moment ago, like talking about your job, asking what she did yesterday etc. my advice is to just act like you normally would. they will probably ask you some of the same questions repeatedly, but each time just act like it's the first time they have asked. it's just really sad, my mom is in a memory care facility and all in all, it really sucks. looking after and care for family is necessary, even if it breaks your heart, everytime. you'll have to play it by ear, because you don't know at what stage in her illness she is. people with alzheimer's tend to be different person to person and even day to day. if you have time, a good youtube playlist is teepa snow's [making visits count. ]( (it's like an hour talk in total, it's just broken up into smaller chunks.) he's not great with questions, so we just take turns remarking on things that he takes pleasure in, like the view or the cats or his beloved wife. the conversation doesn't go deep, and we cover the same ground frequently, but that's fine--the point is the togetherness, not some intellectually probing discourse. if you can get tips from the family on things she currently enjoys or appreciates, that's a great place to go, and if not, just note what seems to draw her attention and go on with that. the best thing you can do for the both of you, is to play along. her time is more limited than yours is. just go with the flow. like someone previously said, if they start talking about something that isn’t true just go along with it. my dad and others at his facility really enjoy listening to music so sometimes when he gets frustrated i distract him with music on my phone. i’ve noticed many people at his facility enjoy the little things. i was amazed to see that although my dad doesn’t communicate much, he loves hitting a balloon back and forth. there’s no one way to approach someone with alzheimer’s, i wish there was.	0
i found out that to 'manage' someone's social security benefits/payments, a power of attorney is not enough - you need to be the individual's representative payee. but i don't know what the ssa means by 'managing' benefits. does anyone have any experience in needing to 'manage' the benefits, so that becoming a rep payee makes sense? i don't understand the need, and why a poa wouldn't be enough for most cases? tia! i need to establish rep payee to sign my dad up for medicare in the next month (his diagnosis was poorly timed there). also pisses me off that poa isn't good enough for some financial institutions. i had to get notarized letters of incapacitation and shit to gain access to his assets to pay for care. this took over a month in some cases! just over this crap. for those who have poa, don't assume it won't be a circus to actually be able to use it. i'm rep payee for my parent. it's super annoying, and as you say poa isn't enough. neither is guardianship. you have to specifically go through a process with the social security administration that in my case resulted in the need for a recent statement from a doctor that my parent is incapacitated because the guardianship documentation was not recent enough. you also have to answer questions demonstrating that you're the best person to do it and you have to provide documentation. you also have to sign stuff that says you'll follow all their rules about how you can use the funds on the person's behalf (the managing part). you probably need a new bank account for the person to accept the funds, which you are required to set up direct deposit for, and you have to do a yearly accounting for what you did with the funds. we just added my wife and i to my mom's bank account. so between our poa and being on her account with our own cards, we've been able to handle everything. we are going through this now. my grandmother was the rep payee for my uncle for years. she just had his ssdi sent to his checking account, never filed reports or anything. now ssa just sent a letter saying that since she died, they won't send him money until a new one is identified. yes i have been rep.payee 15 yrs no issues	0
my dad has become increasingly forgetful. he frequently forgets how to get home, or he forgets a conversation that we just had 15 minutes ago. once i remind him, then he remembers. for example, he needs surgery on his carotid artery. i'm arranging it for him. i hung up, called and spoke to his doctor to set a pre surgery appointment. i called my dad back, literally 10 minutes or less later. i said ok dad we have to meet with the surgeon before they will schedule your surgery. your carotid is 80% blocked. stuff like this happens a lot. how do you tell the difference between normal aging, vascular dementia and alzheimers? you leave that to the professionals. get an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in dementia, or go for geriatric assessment at a department of geriatrics. you father's primary care doctor can refer him. it's a good idea to communicate either by mail/email or telephone ahead of time with some of your observations, to clue the doc in that a real assessment is needed. also it's best if you accompany your dad (or someone does), or he's likely to hear what he wants to hear and report back to you, 'doc says to just enjoy myself.' (that's not what doc said!!) alzheimers is a form of dementia. the only way to diagnose alzheimers is post death via autopsy. vascular dementia and alzheimers typically go hand in hand. my mom was dxed with both. my dad got in a pretty serious accident, lucky no one was hurt but two cars were totalled. he was just going to the grocery store about 1/2 mile from his house, his accident was about 3 miles from the store, he forgot where it was. basically alzheimers is the advanced progression of physical impairment of the brain via shrinking and other damage. the current state of the art for diagnosing alz is an amyvid pet scan, which looks for amyloid plaque. it was quite the task getting insurance to pay for it though. my dad was diagnosed w early stage alzheimer’s via a blood test and spinal tap. there are specific markers the dr looks for in those tests. he had several other cognitive & motor tests along the way as well.	0
does anyone know how much can be deducted from taxes that is spent on a memory care nursing home? i would think it would be qualified care since it's memory care as opposed to regular care and my parent definitely can't take care of themself anymore? i just finished filing my parent's taxes, and with my mom in a memory care nursing home for the last few years, we have been including that as a qualified medical expense on their itemized deductions, as per irs rules about [qualified long-term care]( (ltc). we only deduct the amount not covered by her ltc insurance reimbursements, but we do also deduct the premiums my dad pays for his ltc insurance policy which has yet to be activated. also, here is a [link to a turbotax q&a]( that specifically mentions alzheimers. i'm not an accountant, and this isn't tax advice. are they your dependent? how did they file last year? has a judge given you guardianship? hire a cpa and take them your last year's expenses to see if they meet the threshold to qualify as a dependent.	0
hi everyone,  i know both being stubborn and having trouble making decisions are symptoms of alzheimer's but i wanted to know why this is, if anyone knows. as time goes on my grandma has been getting increasingly disinterested (?) the other problem recently is stubbornness. for example she saw something in our neighbor's yard and asked my mom if it was in neighbor #1s yard or neighbor #2s yard. another example is taking showers. my mom asked her why not and she eventually said it was difficult...to open the shower door. we are lucky to get her to take a shower once a week at this point. does anyone know anything about these? why this shows up in alzheimer's, how it's a part of it and what we can do to address it? thanks for any suggestions. i really recommend teepa snow for understanding more; she's a very respected name in alzheimer's caregiving, and she's practical and funny and smart as a whip. i got into her via [this playlist]( but there are lots of other videos. for me it could be college-level calculus (or any calculus at all, really). imagine being in a family where everybody does this breezily and then being asked to solve a calculus problem--that's likely to be how your grandmother feels when asked to make a decision. not only can't she do it, it's stressful to be asked. the shower thing could be any number of things, and i wouldn't overfocus on what she *says* is the reason. the same could be said for drilling a cavity without novocaine, but not many people sign up for that either. so maybe it hurts her hand, or she's not sure if she's opening the door correctly and that's why it's not opening, or the bathroom lighting is confusing or the floor is slippery or it's cold, or she's struggling to get clothes on and off, or she forgets why she was in the bathroon, or she doesn't give a damn about taking a shower now because she can't smell anything bad and she doesn't enjoy them, so why bother? addressing it often means letting it go. good spotting.' for the shower, it might be time for assistance in the process, not just the direction to take the shower. the decision issue is because thought is much harder when you have dead brain cells. i try to be sympathetic about it, or sometimes order for my husband and he seems relieved. i don't agree that alzheimer's people are necessarily stubborn. two other things to know about dealing with dementia. it's okay to lie, as long as it's something not likely to be found out; and redirecting is much better than direct confrontation. good luck! never argue with a dementia patient, even over something as simple and clear to you as the property lines of your neighbours. as their brain changes due to the dementia so does their perception, understanding and ability to communicate effectively about the situation. as for making decisions, lets say the question is steak or chicken for dinner? does she remember what the choices are? has she forgotten how to eat a steak dinner? does she think she needs to help cook, but can't remember how? many dementia patients hate taking showers as the disease progresses: one of the big reasons is due to not liking the water hitting their head and the other is not remembering what to do. things that can help: don't give her a choice, make sure the bathroom is warm, have warmed towels or robe ready for after she is out, you may need to get in with her so be ready for that, treat it as very routine. stubbornness and the other problems are going to seem minor when she can't feed herself or walk anymore. the most difficult thing to accept is that alzheimer's is progressive, and there is no rationale that changes that. the way to handle this is to say “would you like chicken or steak for dinner?” rather than “what would you like for dinner?”. simply stop asking open ended questions! either-or, or yes-or-no will be relieving for both of you. for the stubbornness: similar reason, its because they can tell they’re missing information and it makes them angry/frustrated more often than not, no one likes to feel like they’re forgetting or they’re wrong about something they *think* they’re sure about. try reaching out to your local alzheimer's chapter. they even have support groups for you to share your experiences and ask questions. first you get scared. then you go to fight or flight mode. just keep it simple. my mom has had cognitive decline since before the pandemic but was able to hide it pretty well, no socializing probably accelerated it. april ‘21 i visited after being vaccinated (she in sc, me in nyc) i knew she needed someone to come in to help but she still refused so i let it go. fast forward to january 22… she had a heart attack in the shower and was down for about a day before i sensed something was wrong (spoke with her on a saturday, she was very disoriented, didn’t return my calls a few days later) & asked a neighbor to check on her. i’ve been here at her house caregiving since; she is and has always been stubborn and hard headed as hell. i’ve learn to deflect and redirect just like when i hang out with a drunken friend. dementia is brain damage… it won’t get better. good luck 🙂	0
hi guys,  i hope this post is fine. basically today my mum has been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, most likely alzheimers but we will find out more on a second round of tests in 3 months. it's heartbreaking for her because she has worked in the nhs in the uk on dementia wards for the last 15 or more years and has said it's her biggest fear to forget who her kids are. i'm out drinking at the moment (just a disclaimer against typos) but i wanted to ask some advice. of course part of that will be emotional support but another part is practicality. i want to start a conversation about doing things to make her life easier because she is okay at the moment but things will be different in ten years time. for example, she had recently talked about selling her house and mortgaging two to rent out to make passive income. i don't think this will be sustainable with everything in mind so i wanted to advise her to buy something outright that she can own and not have having over her if that makes sense? similarly i would advise her to live close to myself and my brother so if she needs us we are close by. this isn't at all intended to be patronising or anything i'm honestly just trying to start a conversation around ways to make her life easier for the years that are ahead. with all that preamble i wanted to ask if you had advice of things we could think about or start talking about in terms of preparing for the future to make sure she is comfortable, happy and independent for as long as she can be. i'm sorry if i am wrong or stupid with anything that i am saying; she is an amazing woman and my hero and has been a mum and a dad to me and i am just searching for anything i can that will make life better and give her less stress if that makes sense? if you were in the us, i would tell you to get a durable power of attorney and living will. i don't know if you need that in the uk. there are a bunch of resources pinned to the top of the dementia subredit. i would recommend you have an honest conversation about what she wants for her future while she is still able. i'm so sorry you were just hit with the probable diagnosis. between my grandmother and my mom, i've been dealing with alzheimer's for forty years, and when i read these sad stories, i want to be in support, but i still never know what to say. this is going to be a tough time, and keep it simple as possible, but if your mom is still lucid, take care of the financial matters as soon as possible, with an eye towards the very real possibility that living in her own home will not be permanent. the more you can prepare for in advance, the better. having other family members to help, is very important, as well, if you have them. 🥂 don't rush her talking about extended decisions. one thing that has worked well for me is to involve a social worker in some difficult discussions. you might also want to get in therapy yourself to help you cope with the stresses and sadness. it doesn't have to be weekly, maybe monthly or quarterly would feel right to you. i see a psychologist monthly and find it very helpful. i second the top comment. get a power of attorney and a will. im in the uk and helping my nana with it now. it covers both finances and health. i know it sounds controlling and patronising right now - but down the line there will be a point when shes no longer in capacity to make decisions and that is where you as a family will need to step in. this is as a safeguard for her wellbeing and assets knowing its someone she trusts managing this when she cant in her best interest. it doesn't have to come into effect until she's without capacity if thats a concern right now too! there are loads of options. i'm in scotland so if youre in another nation im not sure of the protocols, but speak to the memory clinic about all of this (they usually have handy info packs for both patient and family/carers). most importantly, look after yourself as well as mum! its so exhausting doing all of this at times, as much as you love them. reach out to carer and family support services for advice on how to proceed. theyre the experts at the end of the day. but ill also add that your own mum is an expert in herself; having a frank, open and empathetic conversation (while acknowledging there may be conflicts of opinions or difficulty in accepting diagnosis) is the best way forward to ensuring things are done the way your mum sees fit for herself. its still her and her life, youre just helping making things a bit easier. other little helpful things, you may or may not use them yet depending on how troublesome her memory can get at present:  -leave notes for all important stuff like brushing teeth twice a day next to mirror in toilet, how long and what temp to cook food in micro or oven. keep a notepad by the phone for her to write things as soon as the call ends. - buy a big digital clock that says the time and full date and the time of day it is in full display in common area (nana loves this!) - have a weekly wall planner that has reminders to do things like go food shop or do a bit of dusting  - speak to occupational therapy through social work to get adjustments to the home that make appliances and things more user friendly and safer to ensure shes independent at home as long as possible  - continue with stable routines/habits e.g. leaving keys by table at the front door, going to see you for coffee at the same day and time  - if she takes medications, get the gp to change them to blister packs that portion it into the day of week and time of day which js delivered to her home weekly. call to remind and wait until shes taken it, if this is a point of issue. good luck and stay well all of you xx	0
firstly i want to apologise in case i use any terms or anything incorrectly, i don’t know a lot about alzheimer’s so i’m going with what i’ve read. i (18) have noticed my dad’s changing behaviour since around 2020. at the start of the pandemic specifically he became irritable and argumentative, we assumed it was just him being bored and angry about covid so he was taking it out by saying outrageous things and fighting with me and my siblings about them. in fairness, a lot of his behaviours sound like symptoms of dementia although he has never really gotten “worse”, is always just the same eg he gets very stressed about things like making dinner, giving lifts or going on trips. recently he forgets things like what i’m doing, eg a couple days ago i had to travel to a different city and told him i needed a lift to the bus, and on the day of he forgot and i had to jog his memory quite a bit before he remembered. basically, i can’t tell if this is just him getting old or if it’s signs of early-onset alzheimer’s. or if the term “getting old” actually stems from a misunderstanding of what alzheimer’s is? the thought of it affecting my dad petrifies me and it weighs on my mind a lot. i’m scared to “lose” my dad since i am so close to him and my siblings and i are still pretty young. i don’t want to bring it up with my younger siblings or my mother who works 40+ hrs and is also pretty much full time studying, as i don’t want to scare any of them especially if i’m just overthinking. thank you for taking your time to read :) some of these things could be indicative of dementia, but honestly, what you are describing does not sound like dementia to me. only a doctor can say. forgetting to pay bills, paying them twice because she forgot she paid them already, ordering things she already had, then not knowing where her money would go. issues with short term memory. forgetting what day/year it was, what state she was in, whether she had eaten or not, forgetting recent conversations or events. asking the same questions or telling the same story over and over. hygiene issues. things like not bathing or brushing her teeth for days. when we would bring it up she would insist she had just taken a shower or brushed her teeth. forgetting what to do or how to operate during normal daily activities like using a computer, her phone, using the tv remote, the microwave, etc. she hid it well at first, but over time it became more and more obvious she was struggling. again, i am no doctor, but what you are describing sounds more like age-related forgetfulness, but it's hard to say without getting him to the doctor to be checked. alzheimer’s is really difficult to diagnose just by symptoms so there’s no real way for you specifically know he has it, there’s so many things that have to be ruled out before a neurologist considers it alzheimer’s (coming from someone whose dad was diagnosed with it at 61/62). the symptoms he’s showing could be caused from other things that maybe should be looked at by a primary care doctor first (i’m not sure exactly what but there’s plenty of possibilities)   if he shows more serious signs of forgetfulness you can and should encourage him to go to his primary care doctor and/or neurologist. he will probably fight against going or roll his eyes but if he is experiencing dementia there is help out there to slow things down so getting to the root of it sooner rather than later is a great move. i wouldn’t jump to conclusions but i very much empathize with your situation, hope all is okay with your dad ♥️ i am not an expert but if you are noticing those things at his fairly young age, it is worth looking in to. try talking with your mom about it; this is a lot for you to carry alone. your mom could be noticing things but she’s afraid to worry you about it. ideally you or mom could talk to dad about it. if he is willing to talk w his dr about seeing a neurologist that would be best to sort things out and get treatment if needed. you are an intuitive person and your dad is lucky to have someone like you in his corner.	0
my mom's neighbour is getting worse and her half sister and friend are doing next to nothing to help her, instead, just leaving it all to my 81 year old mom to worry about. the neighbour, who i'll refer to as f, does not look after herself, wears the same clothes for days, repeatedly goes to the bank to withdraw money, which she then secretes somewhere, forgets where it is, then goes back for more, and is often lost, dazed and confused in the street, a mile or so down the road. meanwhile, despite my mom relaying all this back to her half sister and friend, all they say is that, because f is adamant she doesn't want strangers (carers) in the house, their hands are tied. they also just say 'she has safeguarding in place'. uh, ok.  so, it's all on my mom. you can call adult protective service and have someone check on her. when my mom had memory issues and was living by herself, she fell. when the doctor checked her she was ok but  he had a social worker visit the house w  they were actually very helpful with us getting the care she needed and some physical therapy. we had talked to mom before her fall and she insisted on living by herself. well, if it's too much for your mom, she can always step back - she isn't family, after all. but maybe your mom likes to feel needed? if you call the local social service agency, and describe the above, they most likely can have a social worker make a friendly visit. they won't drag the neighbor off in chains, it's more social. they can perhaps offer that there are free rides to lunch at the senior center, or something like that to get her involved. nice of you to care!	0
there are a lot of you on here that ask for resources to help you as a caregiver. i just wanted to plug that the alzheimer’s association has a free 24/7 helpline that can be translated into over 100 languages. the people answering the helpline calls are all social workers with a masters degree and can help with any question you have - ranging from “what is alzheimer’s” all the way to you being in a crisis and need guidance on how to handle the situation. they can also help connect you to local support, like support groups, care consultants, education, etc. it’s an amazing resource that i highly recommend. thank you so very much this hotline saved me when i was navigating my mom’s first steps into her alzheimer’s. they are so kind and so helpful. if they don’t have the answer, they are great at directing you where to go to get one. 10/10 give them a call if you need help!	0
i wanted to share in this group for others with questions, specific to the impact of covid on their lo. tomorrow marie pasinski, md of [harvard medical school]( and [massachusetts general hospital]( and susan wehry, md of [university of new england college of osteopathic medicine]( are taking questions and discussing the connection between [\#covid19]( and dementia. live q&a (tomorrow 1:30pm est): [is there a link between covid-19 and dementia?	0
i ended up having a talk the week before last with my mom’s (64 f) daycare about her general decline, they agree she has declined, and said they didn’t think it would be any trouble for her to be evaluated and qualify. we had the hospice referral appointment with her pcp last tuesday, and it hit me harder than i was anticipating. so much so, i ended up calling out sick for work the next day, and took a me day while mom was at daycare. the first hospice agency referred to us by the pcp was not a first choice of the woman who runs the support group that i’m in, and i trust her opinion. my mom really qualified without any second thought. they’ll provide a shower chair, a wheelchair and a hospital bed as soon as i have room for them to. i got her a rollator last week that has been helping at daycare. other supplies will be provided as well. of course i just did a pretty recent big restock of diapers and wipes…  i’m a little nervous that i’m not actually going to get the extra help and relief i need. a nurse will come out twice a week, and an aid can come out 5, but only for an hour to get her ready for the day. she can still go to daycare and be on hospice as long as she does not become completely hard to care for in their facility. she will be assigned a social worker who may be able to help me figure out more in home health services or short term respite care. i know i need to see how this even plays out to start. they can arrange a 5-7 day skilled nursing facility stay for respite otherwise. my mom doesn’t understand much anymore. what do i tell her about this? do i keep it simple and just say they’re new friends coming to help, or do i tell her that she’s on hospice? i have a feeling it’s the former, but want to get some input. is this a sign she knows it could be happening, or is it just the insecurities of the disease? i mean, she’ll say it at the most random times sometimes. i could be putting her socks on or getting her out of bed, and she’d say it. i probably need to have a physical scheduled as soon as possible. hey there. i am in a very similar situation, my mom (67) was diagnosed with alzheimer's 7 years ago. she has been on hospice for the last 3 months and they have been wonderful. accept the extra help, yeah you can shower your mom but it's great to be able to hand off some care. caregiver fatigue is a real issue, please make sure you're taking care of yourself. i am deep in this too, message me if you want to chat. it's great for you both that you'll be receiving additional hours & help, well done! i'm in australia so our system is different, idk. probably a 5-day break would be really good for you, give some time to catch up with yourself. best of luck with everything! just put your mom in hospice. tough go. u did wonderfully!!! my dad passed from dementia. mom elected to keep him at home, for familiarity. before mom passed, she & my brother arranged for 24/7 care. i kept praying for our lord to take him home. on day he was brought to hospital, he even complimented an employee of his tie. i applaud your efforts getting your mom into hospice. best of luck.	0
i don’t know if ptsd is the right word i’m sorry if it’s not. in 2020 i lost my grandmother to alzheimer’s and that was hard but just last month i lost my second grandmother to alzheimer’s i was much closer with her and saw her decline first hand since then i’ve been having panic attacks and freak out when my mom or other family members forget things. i’m laying in bed crying worried about having to go through that ever again does anyone else have this problem? this is apparently an evolutionary adaptation to help us see potentially dangerous situations ahead of time, and take appropriate action to avoid the same danger in the future. that's ptsd in a nutshell. (i'm not a doctor or psychologist). another direction might be reaching out to a grief therapist. my sincere condolences on your losses; and big, warm internet hugs to you. other commenter is right, i definitely had diagnosed ptsd when my dad had it and after he died it changed but it was still there. i would also suggest you consider joining a support group. they are free, and they used to be in person, but since covid there are many online:  . the anxiety you describe is similar to what many folks experience.. you may find comfort that its not just you. maybe you can find a good fit for you. . good luck.	0
my grandmother was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago, but we knew long before she finally agreed to see the neurologist. since the diagnosis it just feels like everything has now progressed so rapidly. just last week things were bad, but after going away for the weekend i returned to the news from my mother that she had gotten substantially worse in the few days i had been gone. a couple days ago my grandmother was barely capable of holding a conversation, but now she isn’t even able to string together a couple of words coherently. the scariest part is i’m sitting in the er right now, and i can swear i hear the death rattle. she has also been mumbling what sounds like my grandfather’s name. so far we have ruled out a stroke, and they don’t seem to think she has any sort of infection. i just can’t wrap my head around how quickly this is all happening. i just sort of needed an outlet for my feelings with some people that understand. alzheimer's is a fucking awful disease. my first thought was a uti. my mother has alzheimer's and she would get very, very bad when she had an uti. she made sandwiches for my dad who died in 2011. she couldn't read a clock, understand the time, or why it was dark outside. i sincerely hope your grandmother is just going through a bad spell. so sorry for you! my mother is also rapidly getting worse in the last few weeks. stay strong for both of you. every timing is different, my mom has been calling for her mom for a few years now and she died 45 years ago. my mom has been bedridden and immobile for almost 17 months now and her limbs have been 'frozen' for well over 6 months now. it really does seem like she is near the end now but we said that throughout all of 2021. she is 87 and has been at stage 7 for well over 5 years and with obvious moderate stage dementia for over 15 years. my mom definitely has the prolonged version of the disease and it's been terrible for several years now. memories usually go back to where they remember people from their past, that’s maybe why she’s saying your grandfather’s name. definitely check out the uti connection tho!	0
my dad has been really struggling with being my moms primary caregiver. he never had to do much of the child raising and i can tell he’s cracking but am not sure how to help him emotionally. has anyone had success finding a counselor for their parent? he looked for support groups once and then never followed up so i think i’ll need to find someone and give him the push. why kind of counselor has training in this kind of thing. would it be a grief counselor or family counselor? any advice is appreciated my biggest help has been a local alzheimer's group, unless people have experienced it themselves they just don't get it. even just sitting and listening to other people has helped me have some perspective on my own situation. i’m the primary for my mom. i have things covered, but from the outside it might look like i’m holding up way better than i am. you know what i’d absolutely melt for? if i came home from work one day and someone had arranged for my mom to be looked after so that they could take me out to dinner as a thanks for everything. i know there’s no medals for this, and i don’t really expect it, but making time to really acknowledge your dad’s dedication might really mean the world to him. go together with him to a support group or 2, whatever you can find, and folk there likely will know of counsellors / therapists specialising in carer support / grief processing. folk often research for support but then not follow through - if you find when & where & tell him you're going together with him, then that breaks the ice & starts him off. or ask your area alzheimers .org &/ dementia .org, they know for sure. good luck! get his blessings before you take the next step—but my 2¢, select the counsellor, set up an appointment, make sure his 'shift' with mom is covered for the time he'll need, and gently push him out the door with enough time to get there. how to select: if there is a nurse who comes in, then there is some kind of institutional apparatus behind the nurse: hospice, hospital, medi-care/caid… reach out to them for referrals, best kind of counsellor to seek. if not, contact his pcp for a referral. why you need to set wheels in motion: dementia is contagious. caregivers need to remember, sequence, execute millions of adl tasks for self *and* for loved one. lack of self care leads to lack of care for loved one, leads to lack of self-care… vicious cycle. god bless you for caring for the caregiver. my dad was similar, caring for wife & emotionally reserved & struggling with his own issues, and he was a total mess. my dad found a class that he was able to take virtually through the local adult day care center. the class was perfect. the class included video examples, a handout binder broken into sections like 'eating', and a live instructor that was able to answer questions and also curtail some of the winding stories from other classmates. pm me if you want and i can share the local day care details - there may be something similar in your area. i find it almost impossible to be able to join and attend a specific group, but have gotten a lot of great information from this youtube channel, which i can watch anytime it's convenient for me. [www.alz.org](   this will help you find your local alzheimer's chapter. they have group meetings. he needs to attend. set it up for him. get him there. if he's financially stable, then hire an assistant to help out a few days/nights a week. nobody can be a care taker 24/7 and stay sane. ask the nurse for a list of recommended care takers. the nurse or the social worker can provide this. take care. it's a tough job to take care of the dying but even harder when we love them.	0
do any of you in the pre-diagnosis stage worry that getting a diagnosis will cause your loved one to deteriorate faster? that’s what i’m struggling with. my family and i can tell something is wrong with my dad (and has been for sometime) but he’s already so sad i worry he will give up all hope if he finds out for sure something is wrong. we’ve already had a neuropsych consult and they want him to come in for further testing. i am pushing to get it done but the more adamant i am about it, the more i wonder if it’s even the right choice. i have been insistent that we need to know what we’re dealing with but honestly i don’t know what to think anymore. thanks in advance for any advice. no; a diagnosis will not affect the disease. what i've had happen, though, is my loved one stopped trying to fake being neurotypical. in a word, she appears like someone with more pronounced dementia than previously. that's while she's around me. we talk about dementia—openly, gently, with respect. having a diagnosis helps me know better how to help her maintain her dignity. helps me learn strategies which would violate norms for neurotypical people, but that have now become helpful—completing her sentences, tying her shoes, asking 'do you understand,' cutting her slack when she can't remember or do something. i've set down my experiences; ymmv. i get you’re worried your dad will feel sadder with a diagnosis, but in my case - my mom knew something was wrong with her, and it upset her not knowing why or what was going on. now that we have a diagnosis, i think it helps her to have an explanation. now when she gets upset because she can’t remember something, i tell her “well mom, it’s because you have alzheimer’s. the alzheimer’s makes you forget.”  it weirdly calms her, i guess because there’s a reason for what’s happening, and knowing what it is in that moment might be helping her confusion. i can tell you from my family’s experience, getting the diagnosis is the right choice. once you have it, you can move forward and get information and help on what to do next. odds are, though, they'll agree it's probably alzheimers. one side note worth mentioning: my mom was also called back for extra testing. at the advice of my bil, an md, my dad asked a lot of questions around what they were looking for specifically, and found out that particular neurologist wanted to enroll my mom in a very expensive drug trial. the extra testing (which my parents would have paid for) only would have shown whether she was a candidate for that trial. so... ask questions. what sort of further testing do they want? neuropsych testing is pretty comprehensive. if his neuropsych testing did not diagnose dementia then he may not have it. severe depression can mimic dementia as well. i experienced something similar to what you describe - i would just say treat it like it’s in your head … at the end of the day, your doing the best you can and make sound judgments while accounting for all evidence. my moms second round of tests showed major decline, enough for the neuro-psych to say “most likely dementia”, and then no follow ups or anything (after a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and small vessel ischemic)  there are times when it seems like a diagnosis makes it worse, mom is relatively lucid and any diagnosis would be perceived by her as straight up gaslighting (hence she refused to see the neuro psych again anyway). but a couple hours later she may think she is in her childhood home and wondering where her parents are …   in sum, i think the diagnosis is critical to get help in the system (i just changed her doctors so she will be more comfortable) - but it may also lead to a lot of crazy fighting (especially if they think they are fine, or constantly forget about the diagnosis). with my one data point, i say no. i have tried changing things up numerous ways to try to manage and try to stay ahead of my wife’s decline. her decline has been a constant steady progression. it seems like every week i noticed a subtle little thing she can’t now do. when she can’t feed herself or use the restroom properly it seems significant, but i see the constant steady decline. staying on a constant schedule of sleep and meds seems to make for much better next days.	0

in december, my father p (m 78) who has stage 6 alzheimers got engaged to be married to his girlfriend of 18 months (f 72) n, who had managed to isolate p from his friends and family and gain control over his finances. in early january, we learned that p & n were meeting p’s longtime accountant and another lawyer to rewrite his will to remove his children and grandchild and give everything he had to n. p had the original will written in 2019 shortly after receiving his diagnosis. although p had failed a capacity test in december and could no longer legally sign his new will or sign his trust fund over to her, he could still get married as the bar is very, very low. despite his severe dementia, p still had many lucid moments and could seem totally fine for short periods. if p signed a marriage certificate, n would have legal control over his health decisions. it would also give her the cover she needed to drain away his financial resources in secrecy, a process she began even before the big day by redirecting the pension payments he received into a bank account she controlled. all n had to do is move him somewhere away from his meddling kids and take away his phone and he would be effectively incommunicado. something had to be done. scammers preying on the elderly in their community was nothing new to them. p’s friends and fam began to plan an intervention over zoom. the idea was that his younger son j (m 51) &  daughter in law s (f 52) would go over to p's house, surprise p with a meeting with all of his friends who would then confront him about their concerns about n and her diabolical plan. after that, j would show p the evidence that they had learned from the background check that n was a lonely hearts romance scammer who had already been convicted of fraud years ago and had lied to him about her own financial situation, telling him she was “loaded” and did not need his money, despite having a huge tax lien on her house. they would also show p a [checklist ]( abusive behaviors to try to get him to see how terribly she was treating him. once he was convinced, they would call the locksmith to have the locks changed, help him pack up his stuff, and drive off to a prearranged airbnb out of state. we also worried she may become physically abusive if he resisted her. early on we had learned that n had quite a temper which worsened when she drank. what would she do if she learned her golden goose was going to break their engagement? timing was everything here. thankfully, p's caregivers gave us a heads up that n was out of town that weekend and that she would not see him until she returned on tuesday. j set the intervention for monday. he said he had no plans to marry n (n wanted this kept secret!) about an hour later i received a text from my sister-in-law reading: on our way to arizona with p!! it would be a difficult situation for any person to realize they wanted to break up with a partner and take the necessary actions to do this, but for someone with dementia they may well be helpless. the other thing we found was that p’s dementia was much much worse than we had known or suspected, despite the increasingly dire caregiver reports. since our contact with him was increasingly limited to short visits and conversations after n arrived on the scene, we had not been able to grasp the severe decline in his memory and communication skills. n took advantage of p’s confusion over his own condition to convince him that he only had mci (moderate cognitive impairment - his initial diagnosis), which was vital in constructing a reality where she was simply marrying a man she loved and who loved her, instead of financially abusing someone dying of a neurodegenerative disorder. on the drive to the airbnb, j reported p had become incoherent after nightfall and kept asking them who they were and where they were going. they learned they needed to keep him out of the kitchen as he would wander around and touch all the knives and even play with the oven burners. it became clear they needed to get him into a care facility as soon as possible before p could endanger himself. thankfully, even at his worst behavior, he continued to be a very sweet and loving person towards j & s.   it would take about a month to get p examined by his doc and admitted into care. until then, they had to keep a very active senior safe and happy in a relatively small space, arrange for a high quality yet affordable memory care, reconstruct p’s finances after n put them under her control and then trashed them, clean out p’s condo and arrange for sale, and do a ft wfh job. first, a man claiming to be a local police officer called asking if p was with j and could they speak to him? j: how could we trust you with p? the sheriffs were standing in front of j's door (they not home) and wanted entrance and to speak with p to verify his condition. we appreciate the supportive comments. wow, what a saga, and terrifying to realize there are people out there who will do this sort of thing. thank you for sharing, and so glad your father is in a better place! so sorry this happened but elated that you were able to rescue p!	0
my dad became unwell yesterday - very high temp, extremely confused, unresponsive at times, unable to walk. i called the gp who triaged over the phone and advised we call an ambulance as dad was deteriorating and needed hospital care. after 6 hours we called again and were told it would be several more hours. my parents live in a flat and we couldn't get dad up from the sofa, let alone down two flights of stairs in order to take him in ourselves. this morning i called the gp back in tears. he came to do a home visit and has decided that dad is ok to stay home under the care of the community team as his condition is improving. i'm relieved that dad seems to be better today but absolutely appalled. i work in the nhs but i've lost all faith that there's any support. so glad yr dad is better now, i hope he continues to improve. it's shocking that they never even came, must have been very stressful, i feel for you! we have ambo ramping problem here in australia, it's terrible. where are you? i hope you don't encounter this problem again. best of luck! big respect to you working for the nhs. both i and my grandma appreciate all the hard work you do.	0
i hope you’re all doing well. we are helpmate, a company run by phd and master's students with a mission to help caregivers and people living with dementia navigate their post-diagnosis journey. **   currently we are gathering expressions of interest for our free pilot cohort-based program which aims to educate and upskill caregivers. the program will run for 4-weeks, comprising of a live session each week led by a specialist in the dementia space (gp, occupational therapist, nutritionist, nurse consultant, neuropsychologist) as well as hearing stories from people living with dementia and their caregivers. we are currently looking to start this inaugural cohort in late april/early may. **are you interested? **   if you are a caregiver and are interested in being part of a tight-knit community of caregivers and want to upskill yourself, please fill in the form below and we will be in touch! **   our team has been navigating this space for months. we have spoken to over 50 different people including caregivers, people living with dementia, loved ones, clinicians, and academics and one thing was very clear to the team. we believe the dementia space lacks a medium for many new and existing families to learn about how to adapt to their new situation. it was also evident that for many families trying to find specific information for their situation, this can also be very difficult as dementia is different for every single person and family. we hope to offer caregivers and their loved ones access to necessary information and surround them with a community of people who share their journey, with our cohort-based program.	0
cleaning grandmas bedroom today. i wanted to change her bed clothes. when they did arise at 4pm, i was told i should’ve been louder :) stealth vacuuming, eh?	0
my grandmother has been living alone for about 2 years and at that time more things have had happened that wad worrying as such. ashe has gone away for 2 times already in which my father just bought an gps tracker for her so that she wont go again. after this my dad was much more worried about my grandma, and made her stay here by lying to my grandma that she needs to wait for my uncle. in the first few weeks it was fine and my uncle was able to come to our home again and again, but then in the fourth week or so my uncle left to go to america since he lives there nowadays. this time it was different, it was today where she went out of our house and tried to go to her home. right now my grandma is arguing with my dad on trying to go home, she just wants to go home and me and my mom are very stressed about this situation because it is very irritating and since my mom is a baker, she always gets in the home. and my dad has had enough and had a mental breakdown about my grandma and surprisingly my grandma was fine about it and said sorry afterwards. what do i do in this situation? i desperately need help because it is very stressing for my entire family and my mom wants to leave and rent an apartment somewhere so that she can work in a nice enviroment. does your grandma have memory issues? can someone move in with her so she can be at her house? if she really can’t live alone and she likes to bake, maybe try baking with her so she is supervised. i am sorry i can’t be of much help. i have more questions than answers. i assume your grandmother has alzheimer's disease or something similar. there is a point where someone with that condition cannot live alone. from what you described, she could be at that point. i don't know where you live, but you could see if your local community has any daycare programs for someone like your grandmother. then show your parents the options. you could read with her or do crafts with her while your mom is trying to get something else done.	0
my grandma has alzheimer’s and she can barely see/hear so she “entertains herself” by scratching and fidgeting with her nails. does anyone know of a fidget toy or ring or something that would be good for her? i googled fidget toys for adults but i’m wondering if anyone has experience with this and can recommend a product the person liked to use. we have the same issue with my mom and the best thing that works are these plastic shapes that i brought which you thread laces through..i have no idea what you would call them but i found them on amazon, i think they are for kids to learn how to lace things up.. basically it's a flat 2d shape with holes in and my mom threads shoe laces through..she can sit for hours doing them, it seems to really relax her too. hope this helps my dad gets a lot of use out of the [playschool fidget cube]( he now tends to put things in his mouth so the smaller fidget toys aren't safe. we also got him some of those silicon bubble pop things. those fidget blankets don't hold his attention because he thinks it's just a blanket. any catalog we got in we would give to him, until he started tearing it and eating the paper. so the toddler toys have been great etsy has a lot of fidget toys made specifically dementia sufferers. the dots can be picked off like scabs. my mil likes to play with pop-its. i think this a good tactile activity for your grandma who can't see very well. it's like an easy and reusable version of bubble wrap. hope it helps! lap blankets, fidget muff. the dollar tree has pop it’s and such for cheap that you can try. does see like animals or babies? try a baby doll or they have animals that meow and pure that might help my wife has a little pillow with rings, and velcro straps and other little things to manipulate. latest thing she likes is a stuffed dog.	0
my friend is in memory care. they would also constantly confabulate or retell the same story. his only story is 'going to get a car today'. both times his face went back to normal as soon as i started talking again. any thoughts would be well appreciated. he just happened to be a resident in the same facility, so i visit both. could be lewy-body dementia. lewy-body has attributes that are very similar to parkinson's. my mother had this and would often look surprised or almost in shock of things.	0
it's been a rough couple of weeks with my mom (64 f). the week before last, she was stuck at home with me because she developed a skin infection on her butt from her nighttime fecal incontinence, and couldn't go to daycare because they wouldn't administer the medication she needed to treat it. on thursday this past week, daycare called me to let me know that my mom was having a really difficult time and complaining of pain in her legs, crying more than usual and just not herself. 'okay,' i thought, i'll take her to urgent care when i pick her up. well, when i picked her up that day, they came out with three bags of clothes saying that she peed through her clothes i sent her in, her spare clothes, and walked out wearing pants that were loaners. the problem there was, she had not been exhibiting any uti symptoms at home. urgent care ended up not being an option because they all need appointments, and the only clinic that takes walk ins is closed now for the foreseeable future after an electrical fire that happened the week we were there for her skin infection. they got her triaged and we waited in the waiting room for a couple of hours before she started sundowning and just would not stop crying over every little thing. the sundowning actually ended up saving us, because we were able to get her into a bed faster, and who knows how long we would have continued to wait if i didn't bring it up. so we get her into the room, they cath her and say she has the cleanest sample they've seen in awhile, no uti. the pain is so difficult to help her with, because in the previous occasions i've had her seen for pain, it's really hard to pinpoint what's real and what's phantom, and then usually she's fine, but something does seem to be off. she screams as if i'm going to kill her when i try to swing her legs out to get her out of bed, or when i need to try and get her to sit up straight in bed, rather than hunched over to her right, or straining her neck, which will actually end up hurting her. anyway, the er doctor was really sweet and talking to me about life with her as it is now, and suggested looking into getting a hospice referral from her pcp. hospice had been suggested to me by a family friend, and that my mom doesn't actually have to be knocking on death's door, that we may be able to get the extra help just for comfort care. after the past two weeks, i feel like maybe these smaller conditions have just progressed her alzheimer's further, and it might just be the disease pushing her into a new stage (she's already progressed so fast this past year, and has been settled in moderate to severe over mild since after she moved in with me last february). i kept mom home with me on friday just because we were up way later than she's used to while at the er for hours, and i wanted to make sure she got some rest. well, friday morning after she woke up, she was really unsteady and unbalanced when trying to get her into the bathroom to change her, and she fell. i could not get her to understand how i needed her to help me help her get up. when she was a caregiver for a man with alzheimer's before she developed her own symptoms, the man she cared for fell all the time (not hard falls, usually he'd slip out of his recliner), and my mom could never get him up. the man's daughter told my mom she just had to call 911 each time he fell to have ems come pick him back up. it got to the point that ems told my mom that if she called one more time, she'd be reported for elder abuse and negligence. so imagine my immense dilemma when trying to decide if i needed to do the same. i did though, the guys who came were all great, and they were in and out in less than 10 minutes. but now i completely understand why my mom needed the extra help with the man she cared for. i'm thinking hospice might definitely be something i want to look into, but i was hoping to get any perspective from those of you who may have had similar experiences with hospice. any input, general information i might not know, suggestions or advice you may be able to offer would be really helpful! i'm also looking now into either a rollator or a wheelchair for her at this point, because the last thing i need is her falling at home, but also when we're not at home or she's at daycare. that's also kind of difficult to reconcile, because if she is at the point where she's not going to walk anymore, it's just going to make caring for her until i can get her into memory care, 10x more difficult, and it means that she is becoming further and further from who she used to be. i'm just going to share my experience with my dad, alzheimer's and hospice. we had moved my dad in to memory care february 2021. in september, my dad started having some aggression issues and violent outbursts. we tried really hard to get a geriatric psych eval but nobody was open due to covid. by late october, his facility told us we needed to find him a new place. unfortunately nowhere in the entire state would consider taking a man with 'behaviors'. we began looking out of state. i had been asking about hospice for a couple months and they finally agreed he should be evaluated for it. they told me in order to qualify for hospice, they have to have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. hospice came the following day to evaluate my dad and decided he qualified. they started him on dilaudid. we finally found him a new facility that would take him and very fortunately it was just a few miles down the road. we moved him in and the new place seemed great and much better equipped to handle my dad. i visited him a few times and they had a family thanksgiving gathering. my dad passed the day after thanksgiving and caught even hospice off-guard. i got a call that they thought he was transitioning to actively dying but i didn't need to rush down. 20 minutes later i got a call back to say that he'd passed. my dad was on hospice just under a month before he passed. it's worth an ask. their job is to help your mom feel better and be comfortable. i'll be thinking about you, op. geriatric social worker here. if your mom qualifies for hospice, go for it. get the care. get the nurse visits. get the social worker visits. get the chaplain and the art therapy and the volunteers and the pet therapy. welcome them to your home. in 6 months, if she qualifies again, awesome. if she doesn’t, you’ll have all these people from that hospice who know you and your mom who will be able to make recommendations on what to do next. i work in a nursing home and one of the biggest misconceptions about hospice is that the patient needs to be “knocking on deaths door.”  they don’t! instead of getting help and care and support, the family puts it off until the person is literally dying, and then they have all these hospice strangers trampling in to help, which is weird and awkward when the family just wants to be with their mom. emt here. if you can’t pick her up without help, we will happily help you. we understand that the disease puts her more at risk for falls. you are one person, you can only do so much. if it does get to the point where we are being called too often, we won’t threaten you. we will have a conversation to make sure you can find the appropriate resources for your mom. thanks for sharing, sorry i don't really have anything concrete to add. i've read plenty of people's stories where they put their loved ones into a facility that specializes with memory care. do you have something like that in your vicinity? essentially, if you aren't capable of taking care of her yourself, you should think about it to lighten your load. where i'm from, we pretty much only have one hospice in the whole country (less than 2 mil pop though), but it's very much for actually dying people, mostly cancer. most elderly homes offer extra care for people with dementia (basically the more help you need, the more it costs). your story made me realize i need to take care of some holding bars around the bathroom for grandma asap. listen when it comes to dementia, there is no real downside to hospice. you get more support, and there aren't any medications you really cut, not the same way as cancer meds. my grandmother was in a similar way after she broke her hip. we got her signed onto hospice in mid-jan. she was still up and walking around, with a lot of help (lifting up onto feet with gait belt, one person in front and behind, and a walker). even as we got her out of bed and worked harder at the heavy lifting trying to 'exercise', she eventually was not able to take a step from standing, then could put her feet flat on the floor. we absolutely would not have been able to handle these fast drastic changes without the support of hospice. everyone says, they wish they started it sooner. i recently found out that people with dementia are eligible for hospice at a certain point, because it is a terminal illness-it does not necessarily mean they are close to death. they are another pair of hands (and heart) to care for your loved one and take a little pressure off of you. they have a lot of experience, give great advice, and are not only there to care for the physical/emotional needs of your loved one with dementia, they are also there to care for the needs of family members. it’s a great program, i can’t recommend it enough. best of luck. from what i understand a doc has to be the one to sign off on her being eligible for hospice care. they do it based on a reasonable expectation that the person has 6 months or less to live. my dad ended being on it for many years. when he got hospice care it was very helpful. he got a medical bed to help him sit up, wheelchair and other medical equip to help keep him clean. also nice to have access to home nursing. just because mom is eligible doesn't mean you have to use hospice. you can also pull her out at any time, and to put her back on it, the doc just has to approve, which im told is easy to get. i would 100% look into this. leave it up to doc to decide, and tell them everything. if she is eligible, id definitely look into all the options for starting up.	0

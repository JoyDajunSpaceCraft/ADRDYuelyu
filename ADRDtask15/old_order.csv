ht22nh,"hey guys, joined this sub for a little advice. my great grandma is 95 and has had alzheimers/dementia for a few years but it’s only gotten kind of bad the past year or so. me and a few other family members take turns coming to her house to watch her, and also have cameras at the house for when no one is there. 23 years ago, she moved out of the house she had been in for most of her life, and moved into her current house when she married her husband (he’s now passed away). her old house was sold to my aunt but it looks nothing like it used to, anyway. sometimes, like today, she’ll constantly say she wants to go home. when i say this is home, she’ll say something along the lines of “this is my home yes but i don’t live here, i want to go where i was this morning” even though she slept here the night before. i don’t have a car so i can’t bring her to my aunt‘s house anyway to go along with it, but even when someone else was here my aunt got tired of having to deal with her coming up there almost daily. what should i do in this situation?"
8a9l8p,"first i should mention she is in the nursing home, so she is at least safe and taken care of.it's interesting because she has what i guess they would consider fairly severe and advanced dementia, however, she still remembers people. she almost always remembers us, friends, other family, neighbors from 40 years ago. every once in awhile she'll need reminding but over all that part of her memory is somewhat intact.she doesn't remember places, homes, towns, anything like virtually at all and thinks north is south and vice versa. she's been in the nursing home for over a year now, but never remembers her room and constantly thinks she's in a different room.  for some reason the last month or two she's latched on to the idea that every time my dad and i come to visit we're there to take her home, even though she doesn't even remember where ""home"" supposedly is.  her issues are further complicated by the fact that she was in a freak accident at the nursing home last year and had a lot of trauma from it. just to give a short idea - her back was broken, her pelvis was broken in two places, she had 7-9 fractured ribs, her left leg was broken in 4 places with two major compound fractures one which required a skin graft and her heel was crushed, and the other leg was broken in 2 places i believe. i don't know how much metal she has in her legs now but it's a lot, in addition to already having two false knees from before. after hours and hours of multiple surgeries, she recovered remarkably well, especially for being 86 at the time of such a traumatic accident. however, she did lose the ability to walk so she can't use the restroom on her own, etc. she is wheelchair bound now though she actually is in fairly good shape physically. she just never regained enough strength and mobility after the accident to walk again.this creates a problem in itself because she can't remember that she can't walk anymore and tries to stand up to ""prove us wrong"" all the time or show people that she can walk. we didn't really worry about it too much because we didn't think she had enough upper body strength to pull herself out of the wheelchair but apparently that is not the case because the other day she managed to get out without hurting herself and was sitting on the floor putting her shoes on getting ready to ""go home"" when the staff found her.we haven't been able to get her out of that delusion. so now any time we visit she becomes inconsolable and varies between violent anger and crying the entire time while yelling at us, staff, other residents, and anyone who's around. she's still verbal but limited in that a lot of what she says is delusional or non-sensical. it's impossible to reason with her or calm her down because she can't hold conversation anymore. we used to be able to just steer the conversation a different direction or remind her that she used to be happy at the nursing home, but it's not working anymore.at this point it's getting more and more aggressive (kicking things, kicking her wheel chair, throwing things) and we're afraid she's going to start lashing out at us, the staff, or the other residents.she is on ativan as needed but it's not enough anymore. at this point dad and i don't know what to do anymore. do we just stay away completely in case we are triggering the upset? then she's just sad and asks about us and is mad thinking we don't care. we can't just go visit her and be yelled at and abused the entire time, that's not good for anyone involved. the staff is frustrated, we're frustrated, and i'm sure she isn't happy as well and that's the most heartbreaking thing. our goal has been to preserve whatever quality of life she can have for as long as possible, especially after the accident, but i know she's miserable all the time right now.did any of your loved ones go through this stage? any recommendations or advice would be super helpful!   edit: i should mention - surprisingly she's in fairly little ongoing pain from the accident. her worst leg and her back does get sore sometimes, in addition to arthritis in her hands but she is still very good about speaking up when she has pain and we and the staff make sure to ask frequently if she's in any pain. so they're fairly certain she's not lashing out in response to physical pain."
lb0jpk,"my grandparent has vascular dementia and lives at home with one of her older children. i go over to help give company when i can, and i think the hardest part is making her feel at home. she constantly asks when we are leaving to go home, as she thinks she isn't in her house and wants to go back to what we assume is the house she grew up in with her parents in a different state. how can i answer her questions to make her feel at home? she mostly asks when we are leaving, if she needs money or how to pack for the trip. every day when it's not freezing outside and in some that it is she packs her car with random things like she is going somewhere or brings things up and down the stairs trying to get ready. we of course have the keys hidden but leave the car doors unlocked because she can get angry when her car isn't available to her. i've made a sign for her bedroom door that says her name and plan on making a memory book with a picture of her in her house with some family so she can maybe make the association on her own. but nothing really seems to make her feel better and she gets more and more restless and hard to deal with by the day.i usually try to answer that she is home and that her family lives with her, and try to point out things in the house that she knows are hers -paintings she has done, or take her to her room to give her a tour. sometimes she realizes that it is her house but usually not and she often answers with ""i didn't know that."" this is how every conversation goes and i just wonder if anyone has any tips for how to answer or make her feel more comfortable without trying to force the information on her?"
io70fz,"hi, i'm new to this sub. i just wanted to ask those of you who have parents or loved ones with dementia or alzheimer's what you say to your loved one who is asking to go home. my grandmother-in-law is getting to late stages, and every day she asks to go home, or says she's going home soon. she's been living with all of us (mil, wife, and me) for nearly 4 years, and we moved to tennessee almost exactly a year ago. she insists that she has friends somewhere else and she's going to go visit them... or something. i don't believe she has a troubling amount of anxiety during the day, not enough to say she wants to be safe, and they why she's asking. we think it's most likely that she's just remembering house she lived in before the stroke in florida, since it's the last place she had friends and such.  what do we tell her when she keeps begging and begging to go to a place she hasn't owned in half a decade?"
jfcw38,"my grandma is staying with us and sometimes she might think she's at her old home. she even sometimes think that long past relatives are still alive. this infuriates my mom. she yells at grandma and calls her names. she keeps trying to explain things to grandma as if they'll stick, but obviously they won't. she's treating grandma like she knows what she's saying. seriously, my grandma could say she met abraham lincoln and my mom will actually sit there and explain to her, in detail, how that isn't possible. people say it's my mom grieving, but i don't really get it. please help :("
vrxgk6,"my grandmother is mid stage, and in the past month or two, something new that has come up, is a couple times a week she will get upset and insist she's not in her house, despite living there for 51 years.  this will go on for hours, sometimes the whole day.  she gets very depressed and upset over it.  she remembers her address, she remembers the city, but she insists she is living in an apartment in ""a town i don't know the name of"" and goes on and on about how much she hates it there and wants to go home.  telling her it is her home, and trying to get her to recognize some of her belongings doesn't help, it just makes her very mad and she starts yelling that she's not crazy.  telling her she will be going home next week, and everything will be back to normal then doesn't help either.  she remains depressed and upset and lamenting about wanting to go home right away.  trying to redirect the conversation to another topic doesn't help either, she goes right back to talking about wanting to go home.  we're not sure *what* to say to her on the days she gets like this.  is this one of those things where there is nothing to do?  we just have to deal with her being upset/depressed on these days?"
lskmfe,"i’m venting, this is long but i need advice and someone to tell. i’m 20 and my grandma has had dementia for the last couple years, she’s slowly deteriorating but this year has been the hardest for me. mainly because of how aware i became of the issues and her situation. she lives in the midwest and i live and grew up on the east coast so i didn’t get to see her a lot when i was growing up. i didn’t love going to her house as a kid because i just always felt a homesick and there wasn’t a lot going on over there and i could never sleep. as i became a teenager it definitely became more manageable but i still didn’t see her a lot because i was in sports and school and whatever the excuses. she lives with my grandpa still who is just a old fart and used to order her around the house all the time and her son (my uncle) has lived there his whole life and he’s just a lost soul who drinks, he means well. the dynamic of that house is the last bit ideal for someone with dementia too. it’s just low vibes and my uncle doesn’t really get along with my grandpa and it’s just a mess. there’s not enough interaction or high energy to keep her wheels turning. i’m also 1/2 grandchildren and the only girl in my family since my grandma had all boys, and the other grandkid is a boy. anyways i feel an immense guilt and responsibility to go and help her and take care of her. from never seeing her a kid and knowing she always wanted a daughter and i was the closets thing to a daughter and i never even got to see her. and i didn’t like calling her when i was kid and i wish i would’ve just called her. i feel like i missed out on years of love and stories from her and she missed them from me. i didn’t even give her a chance. or so it feels. my only problem is that i would have to pick up my whole life and move to missouri, i’m in arizona. and it just feels like i could be doing so much to help her and make these last years really amazing for her. and if i don’t go i’m going to live with the guilt of not being the best granddaughter i could’ve been, i don’t even feel like i was a good one at all. it took me 20 years to realize how much i truly love and care about her, i just wish i would’ve called her more growing up and seen her more. it was just because i didn’t want to or feel like it or just because it was awkward sometimes. i call her as much as i can now but it’s hard and draining. i always cry and spiral and she always mentions to me that i should come visit her. she deserves the world and i just wish i could give it to her. i hope this all made sense, i just got off the phone with her so i’m emotional and all over the place and conflicted. i just need some advice or a sweet message lol"
8a726n,in addition to the title we have a young couple that are providing day to day services for my mother so she can stay in her house. the problem is that she is now constantly convinced that my dad should be home any minute and calls me looking for him. it takes a few solid minutes of explaining that he passed away about 30 years ago and that i'm here for her. my question is...what is the best way to answer her questions? do i just keep explaining the current situation to her? is there a better option? i'm not a big reader but i'm open to suggestions on reading material regarding this situation. thanks reddit.
kc18vq,"a few years ago my grandmother was in hospital (aged 88) and because of the medication she was under, she kept showing common tropes of that of a person with dementia (delusion, forgetting peoples names, etc.) and was placed in a ward with patients of the same illness.she checked out of hospital after about a month and went back to normal every day life. she broke her hip last year and had to be in hospital again for about three months. she behaved the same kind of way she did last time and it took her a few days to fully recognise her house when she finally returned home (for the most part she would only recognise a couple bits of furniture).she's 91 now and she's aware her memory isn't what it used to be. she'll spend a great deal of time when i visit talking about the exact same things (religion, what she's watching on tv, etc.). i noticed last time i was there she confused me for my brother and kept referring to us by the wrong name. she also told us that she's lived in her house for the last sixty-odd years and raised six children there, as if my brother and i never knew that.a few months ago she asked to take a picture of my granda and brighten it up in photoshop since she never liked how it came out, and i brought it back a few months ago. last time i was down at her house with my brother she was convinced it was my brother that had altered the picture and even gave him money for it.i want to try and visit her as often as i can and i want to know what i can do to when i visit her (how to stay patient when she gets confused, how to keep her on track with the conversation, etc.). i know this may sound insensitive to some people on this sub and i apologise for that, but i don't know where else to go"
e8yls8,"she is in the late stages of alzheimers, and every night she asks me ""have you ever been here before?"" and i say of course and explain to her that we are still in the town we have lived in for over half a decade, which just confuses her and then she will ask again in a minute or two.my question is what can i do to make her realize that she is home?"
cb4h2j,"my great grandmother has been battling with dementia for the past couple years and just recently got officially diagnosed. i’ve been going over to her house a few times a week to help take care of her and i didn’t know it would be this hard. i love her to death and seeing her like this breaks my heart and i guess i’m just looking for other people who are experiencing the same thing. sometimes she has an idea of who i am but most of the time i’m pretty sure she has no idea. when i first started it wasn’t terrible because i didn’t mind talking about the same three things for eight hours straight but over time it has made me feel very sad and just.. brain dead i guess is the only way to describe it. she always thinks she still lives in arkansas where she grew up which i understand is very common in people with dementia and alzheimer’s. i’m not really sure what the point of this post is, i guess just to get these things off my chest and if anyone has any advise it would be greatly appreciated."
l56in5,"my grandmother's mother (my great grandmother) died over 20 years ago. my grandmother becomes confused and asks me where her mother is. i'm unsure how to respond without causing her more distress. do i explain as gently as possible that her mother died over 2 decades ago? or say something along the lines of her mother being out shopping/living elsewhere/etc? when i've told her that her mother passed away a long time ago, she seems upset. when my gm asks whose house she's in, i have no trouble explaining that it's her house. likewise when i explain other things like what day it is or where different living relatives live. i'm just not sure how i should answer when she asks about her deceased mother. any advice?"
o1j3lh,"hi all, looking for advice.my grandma has short term memory loss that has progressed within the past 6 months.we had an at-home doctors/memory facility visit yesterday. she’s currently livid with my father for taking her car so she’s resentful of anything he does.long story short, today i asked her what she remembered about yesterday and she said “nothing.”so, with that being said, she’s on schedule to move within the next few weeks but due to her forgetting when she gets angry whenever her independence is questioned, we’re afraid of how to approach breaking the news to her.any advice would be great. thanks in advance!"
3l6fa7,"hello , i have just turned 18 , my mother has alzheimer's and the situation is looking dire . she is only 52 , but im guessing its a pretty late stage . she has been repeating the same things for a long time now , she started packing/unpacking/moving things around for no reason the last month . she has a caregiver in the morning when i go to school and my dad is working , my grandma and i look after her in the afternoon (especially my grandma) and when my dad comes back home in the evening he stays with her. this whole responsability juggle works in theory , but its really breaking me , talking to her is really hard , she basically only says hello , and then asks when is my dad coming back home , is he gonna come back home , can she call him to know when he's coming back etc... she seems really troubled all the time my dad is not here and i dont know how to ease her up anymore , i researched and tried a lot of things (asking her about old photos , happy memories , trying to distract her ) but none of them seem to work anymore . she was literally shaking today because she wasnt sure if my dad was going to come back home... at this point i dont know what to do , i feel useless , and the thought that she is only going to get worse scares me a lot (i really fear the day she is not going to be able to recognize me). my grandma already had an heart attack last may because of this whole situation (she was the primary caregiver back then , now i help her out and it is only in the afternoon) so there is also that . sorry for the wall of text , but i am honestly getting desperate at this whole situation , and i see nothing but sadness in the next months/years of my life , if someone has any suggestions i would really appreciate it ."
3ttjvb,"im not sure if there's another subreddit maybe i should post on, but here goes.in the past year, both my parents (dad 78, mom 75) have been diagnosed with dementia. dad's is more mild (mostly cognitive impairment), mom is alzheimer's. we had to move them into assisted living this summer—separately, because mom's dementia and delusions and agitation was pulling dad down a downward spiral.its been a few months now, and things have settled down a bit—though i now realize things never really ""settle down."" but i can't bear to see or call my mom much. now that i know shes being taken care of i find that i'm trying to close the door on her to save my sanity.i see my dad at his residence every other week—we laugh, and have lunch and talk, sometimes do puzzles and stuff.  he's changed a lot, but is still a person and i feel like its worth the hour-and-a-half trip to build on the relationship we have. mom is declining fast. when i visit, she's just fixated on leaving and being reunited with my dad, her husband of 55 years. (they get together once or twice a week—either i or my brother bring him over).she knows who i am, but nothing really sticks, and its the same 2-3 questions over and over. shes not really clear on where she is, or whats happening to her. i feel like 10 minutes after i leave its like i never came.my mother was an over-intellectual, opinionated, demanding spitfire of a woman. seeing her like this is eating me alive. i want to do everything and anything i can to bring her any relief or comfort, but i also pray for her to die.i feel like i'm slipping in quicksand. i get anxiety attacks just calling her—and the calls are just 5-6 minutes long with nothing really said.i have a brother who lives closer, and is very involved in both my parents lives. he hasn't given me a hard time, but part of my issue is trying to make sure i'm doing my share.how do you find the balance between obligation and survival? i feel like i'm at war with myself—part of me says ""you're selfish, you're lazy."" and part of me says ""save yourself."" i know thats normal in this situation, but how can i least start to heal, and find that balance?"
8egcx4,"my mom is 64 and has been experiencing dementia since feb 2016. from then until aug 2017, she was in a nursing home. she had a head injury and combined with her medications, she was super out of it in the beginning. over time, she improved to the point where my dad believed he could care for her at home. it quickly became apparent that her being home wasn’t going to work - she has no impulse control... she’s going to get what she wants, come hell or high water, regardless of what anyone says. one day, she snuck out of the house and took a ride from a stranger because my dad wouldn’t take her shopping.  after several weeks of stress, arguments, drama, and police intervention, we finally got her into a new nursing home with a locked dementia unit. she’s been in the new location since late october, and absolutely hates it. she is still in the “earlier” stages of dementia... she’s pretty with it most of the time. every time we visit, she’s constantly telling us she doesn’t belong there (most of the residents are significantly older and have much more advanced cases of dementia), and asks when she can go home. she’s in total denial that she has dementia, even though the doctors have told her she does. since october, she has caused quite a stir at her nursing home. in january, she tried to pack up all her stuff - she thought she was going home, even though nobody told her she was. she tried to reach something on a high shelf in her wardrobe, so she stepped up inside the cabinet. it wasn’t anchored to the wall, and fell over. mom ended up with a broken toe.  a few weeks later, she was repeatedly throwing herself out of bed. the nurses were concerned that she would injure herself beyond her toe, so she ended up staying in a mental hospital for a week. she has been known to scream for help when she needs something, rather than turning on her call light. in a recent care conference, i asked the social  worker if mom was going to be kicked out, and while she didn’t come right out and say yes, she did imply that if the behavior continued, it would be a possibility. last year, she had some baseline cognitive assessments done, and recently underwent the testing again to see if any progress was made.  in response to her latest queries about when she could go home, my dad told her we would see what the doctor had to say at her next appointment, and we’d go from there.  she translates this to mean that she can go home after her appointment. the doctor has already called my dad with the test results and has informed him that he recommends she stay in a locked dementia unit. mom is not going to take this news well.  i’m concerned that she is going to resume her negative behaviors and potentially get kicked out of her nursing facility. it was so hard to get her into this one, i don’t know what we’ll do if she gets kicked out... there are only so many facilities with locked units, and not all of them accept medicaid. just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and how you handled it... thanks for reading this long rant!"
ew9s02,"sorry if this is a long post....my mom's dementia leaves her with pretty much zero short term memory.  approximately 2 months ago she fell and was put in hospital.  my dad has done his best to care for her but he is 85 (mom is 83) and he just can't do it.   she is going to be pannelled and is in a transitional unit in a hospital.  all she wants to do is go home, she doesn't know why she is there (she had broken her shoulder, had an infection, and we found out she has lung cancer).   she consistently thinks she is leaving that day, she thinks she has been fine and doing everything at home (my dad has been doing everything for the last few years including meals, cleaning - all she would do was stay in a chair in her tv room as much as he tried to get her involved and go out).   visiting mom now consists of explaining why she is there (she doesn't have any recollection from minute to minute it seems of what we tell her), where she is, that we are always there (she is so lonely because no one ever visits - she doesn't ever remember anyone visiting her even though my dad is there twice every day and my sister and i try to be there alternating every 2-3 days).   she doesn't remember the people she sees every day at every meal.   i have been trying to do the distracting thing, telling her just gentle basic info that won't upset her (you are almost ready to go home, etc - although she will probably be in a pch) and then talking about the grandkids, family, weather and whatever else,  but it is getting harder and harder to distract her.   we don't know how much time she has left, and it is breaking my heart that all conversations just consist of ""i want to go home? what time is dad picking me up? why am i here?  i don't understand"" etc.   i don't care if she thinks i'm her sister (she does that a lot, and i'm fine with that, i don't even correct her - - if it makes her happy and talking about good memories, i'm all for it) but it is harder to get her on other topics.   also, her comprehension in general seems to be getting worse.     i know that everyone here is dealing with some form of dementia, alzheimers and so forth, and i'm hoping that you can let me know how you deal with a parent or loved one in this situation, and how do you get beyond it emotionally?   i hate myself for saying this, but it makes it so difficult to visit her.  thank you for any advice you can give."
hdzgfi,"smells like it sounds, folks, and if it sounds jaded, forgive me. not alot of time for sentiment here.dad is in a facility and probably wont be with us much longer. she normally takes her ques from him but he is practically non verbal at this point.stage 4/5 alzheimers.she refuses to let me move in.she refuses to move out.kicks out the in-home caregivers.she refuses medication, bathing, and social interaction.in process of conservatorship (via attorneys) per dads directive but that takes time.social services is assisting but they can't force her either it seem.yes, she is a danger to herself. look, i can't exactly pick her up, yuck her in the back of the truck, and force her to a memory care home. in a million years i'd never want to force her into anything but this is getting out of control. options?tactics?"
8r2kdc,"this is going to be a lot, and probably really long... i appreciate anyone who manages to get through some of it. i've only very rarely frequented this sub reddit, as i've kind of just felt lost and didn't feel up to reading it all. i hope that my less-than-sugarcoated approach to writing about my experience with my mom does not offend anyone. i also wrote this over the course of several, sleep-deprived hours. we all have our coping mechanisms. i'm not great at finding humor in this still. there's a lot of dirty laundry from the past that prevents that, still. i'm 26 (27 in a couple months), living with my parents, and my mom has early on-set dementia. she has pretty much three settings:1) desperately loyal housewife: she goes to extreme lengths to please my dad, which recently included forcing her bedroom door closed while i was trying to get in to get toilet paper so i could pee at 2 in the morning. when she's like this, she's extremely paranoid about doing something to upset my dad (even though he really doesn't get mad at her.) when she's like this, she'll often make sweeping statements about how ""oh we all love him, he's so wonderful, aren't we lucky?"" considering the past problems our family had before my mom got sick, it's pretty tough to hear.2) bitter, vicious bitch: self-explanatory. yes, i know it's not ""really"" her, and no, i generally don't let it affect me. our family has always had a pretty screwed up power dynamic, and my mom always had her passive-aggressive side and a hot temper. trying to discern in my memories which times were really her and which weren't have been a thorn in my side. 3) confused child: meek and confused, very much needs help to get a basic command done. we see a lot more of this these days. so yeah, that's my mom in a nutshell. she's been deteriorating for years, but my dad wasn't on board and was in denial right alongside her. my sister and i ended up feeling like we were in some twisted twilight zone where we were seeing things, maybe *we* were the ones going crazy, because no one else would admit to seeing what we did. eventually my sister got a chance to move out, i didn't, and here i am. i've finally figured out what i want to major in and pursue in my life. i've been at the city college on and off for years, working on and off at crap jobs, going back for a semester, rinse, repeat. i've been massively depressed for more than half of my life and fell into the trap of ""well i can handle it."" now i've aged out of my dad's insurance, i have no job, and am living off of about $800 left of financial aid until i find a job. i'm gonna be fine; my dad doesn't let me starve. he will pay for gas if he needs to. but i still feel like i'm just incredibly stupid and useless and doing it all horribly, stupidly wrong. it feels like life isn't worth living when up against the utter crap i can't seem to fix or get out of. my mom is dying, my family is screwed up, my dad is still in denial in some ways, and i just can't seem to find it in me to love anything about myself enough to think i have what it takes to have a good life. the person i always thought would be there to help me figure things out is gone. i have to work so hard to keep my emotional state hidden from my mom because all it does is make her feel upset or scared. i'm so tired.i'm trying really, really hard to prove i'm useful to my dad, because you guessed it, living at home and not having life figured out is a huge self-esteem downer. i do as many errands as my dad throws at me, and will do them at the expense of my time, my gas, and plans i previously had. i handle all of the grocery shopping, i take my mom to appointments if he can't, i am the primary caretaker for our four animals, two cats and two dogs. while i cannot afford to pay for any of them, i schedule their vet appointments, i take them in, i medicate them for fleas and anything else that pops up. i make sure they have food and water, i clean up the litterbox and any messes. i keep my dad apprised of anything going on with them. i make sure my mom eats something. i let him know when we're low on things like dish soap, toilet paper, and paper towels. i cook cold dishes that can last for a few days at a time, most often something like a pasta salad. i try and keep track of what my mom is eating and what she isn't (anyone else have dementia family members who have new cravings every few months?) i notify him of anything out of the norm with my mom. i have worked really, really hard to avoid getting upset with my mom or losing my temper. i'm much better than i used to be, but of course could always use improvement.none of it feels like it's ever enough. i'm still stuck at home. despite the few moments where i feel like i'm doing enough to prove it's okay for me to be home still and figuring things out, there are always the long patches of me telling myself no, you're doing it wrong, you're useless. i live in a very expensive state, so moving out by myself is really not an option. some days i struggle to get myself out of bed, let alone to look for a job. it induces such panic and anxiety in me to even think about going back to the dead-end jobs i used to work, but what else is there when you just have a high school diploma still? i just wish i could feel like what i'm doing is enough, but i don't. tldr: my life is a mess. triangle of take care of mom, get a job and work to save and live, and go to school are constantly at odds with each other and out of balance and i honestly just feel like i'll never be able to feel like i'm doing anything enough. my dad insists he never wanted my sister nor i to be responsible for my mom, and yet when we go over the list of everything that wouldn't get done if we stopped being involved... it goes on. we're afraid he'll wake up one day and lose his mind.is there anyone out there who has anything remotely similar to this situation? thanks for reading up until now. this has all been coming on for months, and it just kind of boiled over last night with me feeling really, really awful about not having a job and my own income. i feel like such a failure, and my mom is gone and not here to help me figure out life. she walks around like a ghost with greasy hair, unkempt clothes. i can't force her to shower. i can't force her to wash her hands. i don't think she's even on a single medication related to dementia, like anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers. i can't force my dad to get a caretaker. and when we finally get one, the relief i'll feel will quickly be replaced with the realization that i no longer have a purpose in this house, and that i'm just wasting space.thanks."
odorsi,"my father and i can't come to an agreement on what to do with my mother.i love my mom very much, but her dementia has progressed, making her extremely difficult to deal with.  lately if you suggest anything at all, she wants to pack up everything and move in with her last surviving sibling who lives 3000 miles away.my father frequently texts and asks me to call my mom to try to calm her down.  it doesn't work.  all she does is end up screaming at me, telling me to shut up, that i'm a horrible daughter, etc. i know this is the disease talking, but it's getting increasingly difficult to deal with, especially in the middle of my workday.  she now refuses to shower and threatens to leave almost daily.  she's actually left a few times and walked over 2 miles.   i think memory care is best, but my dad wants to keep her home.  i see where he's coming from, but we're all losing our minds in the process. how do you remain respectful to your parents as an adult child and stay supportive while keeping your sanity?  i'm exhausted and this has impacted my quality of life in multiple areas."
vte8ql,"my grandmother is 89 years old and got diagnosed with alzheimers last year. she lives in her own seperate house on our (me and my parents') property. she is my dad's mother. she is ""on the list"" for the local nursing home meaning if she'd end up in hospital or we *really* can't take care of her anymore she can go there if there's a free room.me and my mom are so sick of taking care of her, so beyond fed up with it. my mom has dealt with this incredibly stubborn woman for 30 years, and now that her mental state is declining rapidly its all way too much. my dad is retired but he spends a lot of time out with his friends and my brother and he generally has a ""just let her be, it's not that bad"" attitude towards my grandma, easy for him considering he's not the one dealing with her most of the time.me and my mom both work part time and take care of grandma.  i'm 29.we get groceries for her, cook her food, take care of her cat, clean her house when we're allowed, take care of the garden. but ofcourse in her eyes we don't do anything for her and don't care for her. she always asks for my dad cause he's the good guy. we also steal everything from her and especially me, she ""knows what i'm doing"" whatever that may be. she comes to our house at 3am, not knowing that its nighttime, and we have to get her back to her house. she loses her keys all the time so we had to take those. every saturday my mom goes to our vacation house with parents to relax and im really glad she can do that, but it also means i have to stay home so grandma isn't alone. the odd time i also get to go to the vacation house grandma has to come along cause wherever i go, she goes. whenever she comes along she also insists on doing whatever i'm doing.i'm so fed up and so is my mom.we've told my dad that something needs to happen but all we get is a ""well.. she doesn't want to go to the nursing home so, yeah"" and that's it. done.it's come to the point where we're both hoping she just won't wake up one day, or she'll get sick so we can take her to the hospital and she has to go to the nursing home.it seems so cruel. i don't want this for my grandma, but this isn't right either."
3prph4,"my mom has had alzheimer's for the last 5 years and it's gotten progressively worse, to a point where she needs 24 hour care. she shows all the symptoms of stage 5, but thankfully hasn't gotten much worse over the last year. at her best, she remembers who i and my kids are but perhaps just sames and us being familiar faces. at her worse, she thinks her husband (my dad) is still alive (he died 25 years ago) and she lives back at her parents house (40 years ago).anyway, after moving her to a nursing home a few months ago and admittedly i delayed this for too long as i didn't want to admit she was that badly off. we had live-in help stay with here prior to this and probably has a rose-tinted view of her condition.anyway, she's been at this nursing home for 4 months and she's transitioned beautifully. she looks happy, eats on time, sleeps and has even started back watching tv and reading!however, her sister (who doesn't live near us and has only a vague idea of her condition) wants to come visit her, but also wants to take her back home and to places she used to visit.i get she has some noble intention, but my mother is very easily confused, so much so that 2 months ago when i brought her last live in caretaker to visit her. she kept looking at her, and every 5 minutes would say ""you look so familiar, do i know you?"" everytime we explained who she was to her, but after a while she kept getting increasingly agitated. she sometimes does this to my kids and my son, in his innocence,  said ""i think i should stop visiting grandma, i think she gets confused and upset trying to remember how she knows me and i don't want to cause her any more pain"".i've explained this to her sister (my aunt), and even told her that her visit alone could be upsetting to her (however, i'm not going to stop her from seeing her).however, my aunt and i had a big blowout last night when i told her i don't want her taking her out of the nursing home. she accused me of being selfish, and not allowing my mother to have a 'smooth transition' etc. she even said i was being lazy and just preferred to leave her and forget about her.reddit, i live 45 mins from my mom's home and i visit her almost every single day (i got a bad flu recently and didn't see her a few days). i'm even paying fully for the nursing home, my aunt isn't pitching in one red cent and has never offered. i just feel so f*cking pissed at her for this. she's also the kind of person who will tell the rest of my family about my apparent 'cruelty' to my mom. before this blowout i've her some many alzheimers's care guides that reccomend trying to confuse them as little as possible. one even went as far as to say, once the transition to the new home has been made, it is critical that no more abrupt changes be presented as that can lead to mental disassociation, causing undue stress.so reddit, should i give in to my aunt's wishes? or should i stand firm.i'm honestly, afraid that she does this, my mom gets upset, stressed out and confused and has a heart attack (as she does have heart issues). some advice please!"
q7vg93,"my mom (63) is taking care of my father (78) who's alzheimer's has been getting worst and worst quickly since he retired and the pandemic started. lately he has not recognized her much and thinks she is ""another rose."" he asks her to take him home most days even though he is home so he can go back to his wife rose. today my mom said he wouldn't go to bed and was mad that she wouldn't ""take him home."" he told her to make sure she closes her door because he might come and hit her. and that she doesn't know what she has done and that she has created so many problems.my mom doesn't know what to do in these situations. does anyone have any advice i can give her?"
8ihlxu,"my grandmother has dementia (my dad's mom - i live at home while attending college). she lives in a retirement home in our city. at this point, she's very much ""out of it"" - it's very difficult, if not impossible, to hold a conversation with her, as her communication is severely limited (a lesion was recently found on the speech center in her brain, although we don't know how old it is). she has memory issues as well and seems to be confused chronologically. no one really knows just how much she's aware of. a speech therapist came recently to work with her, and my grandmother struggled with very basic questions (things like ""how many children do you have""). pretty much the only time she shows emotion nowadays is when she a) cries at random, or b) begs my dad not to ""take her back to that place"" when he's bringing her back to the retirement community after a doctors appointment. she obviously doesn't want to be there and we feel as if she's depressed. it makes me feel awful thinking about what her quality of life is - she essentially sits on her couch all day long until someone comes to take her to her meals or give her medication and other care. she was previously diagnosed with lewy body dementia and takes antipsychotics to control delusions. before moving to the retirement community, her communication skills were still quite good, but she had issues with persecutory delusions and some smaller lapses of confusion. is there anything that can be done for depressed patients like her? even if it's some novel drug treatment that will help her feel better (even if the happiness - or at least sedatedness - is ""fake""). everyone in my household is very busy. though a big part of why we don't visit her too often is because of our hectic schedules, it's also because seeing her is so difficult. in addition to her very diminished communication skills (sometimes spending time with her feels like hanging around a brick wall), what further complicates the situation is past baggage. my grandmother was very narcissistic when she was younger, and while she didn't alienate her family completely, there was definitely bad blood between her and all of her children. her daughters in law also have a lot of bad blood with her - it's hard not to, because she could be very nasty before the dementia set in. she was not an easy or pleasant woman to be around and refused many of the measures that were taken to try and help her before her decline (didn't want to take her pills, didn't want to exercise and would skip her classes, didn't want to be social or reach out to the friendly people in her facility, etc. - and it's a *very* nice facility). as such, her other two children - my aunt and uncle - have essentially abandoned the situation. they don't come and visit her ever, and have placed the burden of her care on my father, because he's always been her ""favorite"" son (he's the oldest). does this situation resonate with anyone here? i want to visit her more often, but being around her aggravates my own depression greatly and puts me in a very morbid mood. both of my parents are older, so thinking about how this could happen to them makes me feel sick to my stomach. being around someone who's quality of life is so poor, particularly when we weren't very bonded to begin with, is also hard - i feel like i'm too weak to deal with this. i also get the feeling that everyone is just waiting for her to die, because she doesn't seem to enjoy life anymore. i've tried talking to my parents about possibly trying to find a therapist/counselor who works with dementia patients, even if it's only for the social interaction, but they aren't sure if it would help because of her memory and communication issues. i wish there was some antidepressant or other drug she could take to improve her mood, but i don't know if that would help either, especially since she's already taking such strong psychiatric medication.advice? "
p70eyt,"my mom is in her third year of diagnosed dementia and she does a lot of things that annoy and agitate me. i try to be good but it's hard. she keeps calling me on the telephone and inviting me to dinner and i tell her that i don't live at home and i'm thousands of miles away. she'll say ""well you can go home and just use the key and get in"". i'm like ""mom, i don't live at the house anymore"" and she's just falls stone silent, doesn't understand, and then says ""well, where are you""? and i explain it to her again.  she'll ask where do you sleep and i'll explain it to her again. i don't even want to pick up the phone anymore when she calls but if i don't she will literally call and call and call and call and each one she'll leave a message. i'll have eight or nine phone calls with messages to scroll through. they're all like 5 minutes long and she's just rambling. i wish my father would take the phone away to be honest or just let the plan expire on her but then she would probably just use his phone and do it. i just wish he would put her somewhere or get her help to keep her distracted and have her mind put to work. it seems he wants that + 1  so he doesn't feel lonely when he goes out to eat or events. he doesn't actually want to have a conversation he just wants to make statements about things. he doesn't listen to myself or my brother about getting her help or putting her somewhere he's just like whatever. i'm going on a trip with them in another couple of weeks and i'm kind of dreading it now because i think she's going to be overbearing and horribly annoying. i think one of the main reasons that i was invited was so my father can go off on his own and leave me with my mom. well fool me once shame on you. i'll keep my fingers crossed that's not the case but i know my father all too well. sorry this was a rant but the situation is driving me crazy."
fp3kwe,"i found out today from my sister that my mom has decided to move my grandma into a memory care facility. for some background, my grandma has been suffering from alzheimer’s for several years, but in the last couple of years it has really advanced. she was living alone after my grandpa died 6 years ago and was doing fine for a while, but in the last year and a half it became really clear that she couldn’t and shouldn’t live alone, her alzheimer’s was advancing so fast and she was incredibly lonely. my mom moved her in with her and my dad almost exactly a year ago. my parents also raise my 14 year old nephew so their hands really are full. my mom also has caregivers come for about 5 hours a day 6 days a week. her sisters don’t help. i try to help as much as i can. but my mom has gotten to the point she is miserable and can’t do it anymore. my grandmother is to the point where if you aren’t right in front of her, she doesn’t remember you exist. and even if you are in front of her, she’s not totally sure who you are besides her daughters (and that’s sure to change before long). i understand where my mom is coming from, i do. she can’t ever go visit her own young grand babies out of state if someone can’t stay with my grandma. she can’t leave the house really unless my dad or one of my grandmas caregivers are there. my grandma is constantly arguing about the same things: she never believes that she’s been fed, even if it was 5 minutes earlier. she will hardly bathe. she never remembers that she lives there or who she lives with.  i guess my mom has now decided she can’t continue living like this, i just worry about my grandma moving again. my mom knows that moving her into memory care will cause her to decline further quickly. i hate the thought of her being even more scared and confused than she already is, with no familiar faces to look for at any given time. of course we will visit her as much as possible, and luckily the place they are trying to get her into soon is 2 miles down the road from me. i guess i’m just wanting to know what you alls experience has been with moving a loved one into memory care. i can certainly see the benefit of having 24/7 care from people experienced with this disease, as well as daily activities and other residents to spend time with. i’m not surprised my mom hasn’t told me yet and my sister had to tell me. i help my mom the most with my grandma and i’m sure she’s scared i’ll judge her for her decision. i don’t judge her, i see the sacrifices she’s made to be there for her mom while her sisters have failed to step up to the plate. my sister said my mom cried when she told her.any words of wisdom in this situation? it’s nice to find this community on reddit, i hadn’t found this sub until tonight."
jkg9uu,"my mom was officially diagnosed with alcohol induced dementia today. i talked to her on the phone for over an hour, and she was in her own little world. as much as it hurts to hear her talk about things that aren't real, she seemed the happiest she's been since i can remember. unfortunately, i live in a different state and covid has put a hault on any visitations for the nursing home she's currently in. i guess my question is how should i talk to her? should i just let her play out what's going on in her head and go with it, or calmly and patiently try and bring her back to a more ""normal""  state than what she's in now?sorry if it's a dumb question. i'm just trying to wrap my head around all of it and try and be there the best that i can for my mom."

eo539k,"my 71 year old mother has been dealing with alzheimer's for many years. i've been bathing her about a year now. dad turns off gas and locks doors ( supplying details to give a frame of reference ).she often talks about going home to check on her parents (gone for 20 years) or kids (i'm her youngest at 34 years old) or whatever. she yells at my dad to take her home all the while saying their current home  is actually her house her dad got for her (it isn't).we are managing, but what's best to say to her? when she pleads to me to pick her up and take her home? most if the time, i can change the topic and she forgets eventually, but sometimes she gets fixated. do i go pick her up and drive around? do i gently remind her she is home? do i just listen? what's best in your experiences?"
jdlndz,"throwaway because i don't want such a personal text on my main account.i'm  35m. my mother (59f) has finally been diagnosed with early-onset  alzheimers a few weeks ago. she had been having symptoms for a few  years, which we always attributed to the strong medications she takes  for a rare vascular disease she has. her dementia progressed very, very  quickly. just two years ago she was a little forgetful but you could  have a normal conversation with her, she still drove herself to errands,  etc. one year later she's completely taken by the dementia, having very  aggressive episodes (she tries to hit my father constantly - she's  never been aggressive before), paranoia, can't hold a memory for more  than 5 minutes, forgets she's already home and gives tantrums wanting to  ""go home"". you know, all the symptoms of alzheimer in a moderate to  late stage.i live about 200 miles  away from her. she lives in a small countryside town with my father and  my elderly grandmother (her mother). i had been sort of a distant son  for the past decade because of relationship issues i had with them  growing up. nothing really traumatic, but my upbringing drove me away  from them. i moved to a big city and visited them about 3 or 4 times a  year, talking weekly-ish on the phone. now this is happening and i'm  getting closer to them again, especially my father, to give him support.  he is taking this pretty badly and is getting desperate, not knowing  how to deal with her condition. nobody is prepared for this. i'm trying  to visit them at least once a month, but covid makes me very afraid to  go. they're in a small town with very few cases, while i live in my  country's largest city with tens of thousands of cases. my fear is  unknowingly bringing the virus to them, since they all have high-risk  conditions if they're infected.my  father (63m) had to quit his job to become her 24/7 caregiver.  thankfully i have a good job in the city and i'm able to help them  financially, but i'm not rich by any means. he's still a few years away  from being eligible for retirement. i feel like she's getting quite  close to having to be put in a long-term care facility, which is crazy  expensive in my country. at the same time, she still has some good days  and we'd feel awful to send her away.to  add insult to injury, she has a lot of sisters but apart from one,  they're all ganging up against my father and making the situation worse.  we don't want their help, we just need them to not be part of the  problem. this is the hardest situation we have ever dealt with in our  lives and they keep making it worse out of pettiness, ignorance and  family drama.anyway, i guess i  just wanted to vent. i know plenty of people here are or have been in  similar situations. i'm open to advice or any kind of feedback.thank you for reading."
5cgsho,"my grandma is 83 and has had early dementia for the past two years and she keeps telling us she wants to go home to her ""house in the woods."" she tells us this multiple times a day, when she's at the house she's lived in for 50+ years. nothing's changed at the house it still looks the same etc. she starts to get agitated and insists we take her home. this is really the only thing that she does besides asking the same thing over and over and it only happens early in the morning or late at night. i don't get frustrated at her, because i know she can't help it, but it does make me sad because she's like a second mom to me and has been all of my life.does anyone know why she does this and how to help? it makes me sad because i wonder why she doesn't recognize the home she's lived in for so long. thanks for any help."
p0p72z,"to start off, i have some experience with this dementia nightmare.  my dad had alzheimer's.  when he asked for a ""ride across the bridge"" to take him ""home"", i would tell him i couldn't drive at night (white lie).  i'd happily drive him tomorrow (another white lie).  he accepted excuses and diversions easily. my mom has lived in her senior building with hired help for 10 years.  she suffers from dementia.  she normally can be distracted from requests to go home.  today, no matter what i did, she kept asking to go home.  ""let's eat lunch!""  ""let's go to the park!"", i suggested.  she literally would not say anything else but ""will you take me home?  how will i get home?  is there a bus to take me home?"" (i don't think my mom has rode a bus in 50 years). over and over, nothing but home.  i finally just called my brother.  told her i would take her home but first, we were stopping at her son's.  it diverted her enough.  but it was a difficult day with the constant pleading of home.  she's normally interested in home but no so fixated.  she wouldn't even hold a conversation today so i couldn't even distract her with different topics.   this is hard, folks!"
hahcz7,"hi all,i want to start this by saying, i think you're all incredible. this community has been so lovely to me when i've reached out and it making all of this feel more manageable.my grandma has mid-late stage alzheimers. we finally got her assessed last week by a geriatric care team as recommended by her gp. they ruled out a uti or any other infection and have placed her on an antipsychotic to help with her delusions (was seeing intruders in the house). my mom has kind of taken the lead with all of this, with her siblings kind of falling in line even though there have been a few missteps. she's been incredibly strong and the biggest complaint i've heard from her was ""i wish i could fix it"".tonight my mom hit a wall and the floodgate was released. my heart broke when i heard her say she missed her mom. i miss who my grandma was too, she was a spitfire, witty, naughty and so cheeky, an amazing story teller and loved to giggle with me on the phone. but i also know the way i'd feel if this was my mom would be different.my mom is also devastated for my grandad. my grandma has some awful sundowners and is horrible to him and i can only imagine how hard it is for him. she was also pretty bad to my mom last week, convinced that she was my grandad's illegitimate daughter and told my mom that she would never love her. so reddit, i turn to you. what do i do? what do i say to my mom? especially when a lot of the good in my grandma is gone and there are only small moments and flickers of it. i'm just wondering what you wish someone had said to you if you went gone through this grief process.my mom knows there's no fixing it and that all we can do is make sure my grandma is healthy and safe, and if some happy comes, that's great too.thank you for reading my ramblings. much love and good vibes to you and yours &lt;3"
u3aiaa,"i'm not even sure how to ask about this. short-ish version:i want to know if it's ok to have my mom over to *her own house* for holidays. my only experience with this sort of thing is with my spouse's family situation. with their family, they do not let the grandma go to her old house any more. she gets upset and doesn't want to leave. i was told by my wife not to bring my mom back to her old home, as it would cause trouble or upset her like how her grandma got upset. both my wife's grandma and my mom have to go back to their nursing homes each day, so they can't stay at their old homes. they both have alzheimer's, but it hasn't progressed so far for them not to remember their old houses. long version: my mother is in skilled nursing / memory care. i sometimes take her out to places for lunch, ice cream, or go shopping. i have to make sure to get her back to the nursing home every time, because it's important for her to always take her scheduled medicine (and have nurses available around the clock). she still owns her house, and i've been taking care of it for years.since she hasn't been there in a long time, most of her possessions are gone, things have been fixed up, some rooms have been repainted, there are new appliances, and the yard looks different. i basically tried fixing it up, just in case we had to sell it to pay for my mom's care. well, medicaid took care of things, and they said that we can keep the house. so then we had this nice house, all fixed up. we have been wanting to do more things there. we did halloween there, and we want to do easter over there. my wife and i have been looking into selling our house for a while (since before my mom went into memory care), so it actually works out well for us to stay at my mom's house. i talked to my mom about this already,and she thought it would be a good idea for me to stay there to make sure it was taken care of. i was thinking about getting my mom for easter and having her join us, but i don't know if that is a good idea. i don't want to make her upset. i would also feel real guilty about doing stuff with family but not have my mom there at her own house. but i'm afraid that she might see her old house and not want to leave. or maybe she will see her old house, realize how much of it has changed and get really upset. it's also possible that she won't remember the house at all. has anyone else been in a situation like this?"
l10qa9,"i live with my grandma, 82, and my mom. my grandma has pretty bad dementia but its just recently been getting worse and worse and we sometimes don't know what to do about it. we are struggling hard at not snapping at her when she sees stuff or tries to do things. its hard but we are trying. one concern is when she tries to do things she physically can't. how do i get her to stop without getting her upset? she thinks she's young and can do it all. the biggest problem we are having right now is she thinks she isn't home some nights when its the worst. she will scream at us and cry and persist that she isn't home and she needs to be taken home right now. she will refuse to take off her shoes and won't listen to us trying to calmly tell her she is home. i've gotten her to calm down a couple times by walking with her to her bedroom, showing her all my deceased grandpas things and making her understand she is home but there has to be a better way. she sat and cried for 15 minutes straight tonight bc she didn't understand why we wouldn't just take her home. im younger, 25, and i think she's beginning to not recognize me, so she thinks i'm a stranger and it fuels her thinking she isn't home. its breaking my heart. i think her head is about 20 years back rn, which would make sense as to why she can't recognize me and why she thinks she isn't home, because she didn't live here then. any advice? i'm becoming lost as to how to help her."
rhr2e8,"forgive me for this is going to be a long story.hi! so for context, i have a grandmother who’s probably 100+ years old (father’s side) with insanely terrible dementia. my parents are the only caretakers despite my dad having older siblings (he’s the youngest). she’s been staying with us for several years now as she was in a different country before and it’s just getting worse. i feel incredible sad and sorry for my parents who have sacrificed their time and insanity to take care of someone who’s extremely loud and abusive (verbally and physically) to everyone. she screams calling for her older son who lives literally next door. they refuse to take her in because of her behavior. they’ve completely ignored their responsibilities of taking care of their mother and thus my parents have no other choice but to keep her with us. i wake up early in the morning because of her screams. oftentimes, she does not sleep and will talk and scream for about 3 nights in a row. i know my parents are fully exhausted to the core which is why i keep telling them to ask my dad’s brother to take her even just for a few months but they don’t even try asking. it frustrates me that i want to be able to help them and lighten their responsibilities but it;s like they refuse to be helped. my mother does everything for her; cook, wash her, do her laundry, etc. she always verbally (even physically) abuses my mother, sometimes my father, and i just can;t take it anymore. it also affects me and my sisters because our house isn’t big so we can hear her all the time. my sisters are studying and i work at home. my family is also traditional so they will never have her live in facilities.i’m frustrated and want to cry looking at my tired parents because i know they want this to be over. i’m about to cry as i type this because i just have a lot of emotions. today was too much for and i’m at my limits. i want to run away from this house and live far away where i can’t hear her screaming for her other son. i feel angry, tired, and guilty of all this and i don’t even know what to do or think anymore. i love my parents but i don’t want them suffering from a this. if you’ve reached the end thank you very much.tldr; i’m going crazy trying to help my parents because of my grandmother with the worst case of dementia possible"
9o0rq5,"my mom has been on the decline with alzheimer's for the past 10 years or so.  within the past year her symptoms have gotten much worse (she's 71 now).   until the past couple of weeks her moods ranged from confused, but chipper to confused and depressed.  but increasingly she just wants to go ""home.""  she packs and unpacks constantly.  and the past few days her mood has become staunchly defiant and angry --- she believes her delusions are real (she talks to inanimate objects all day) and that all of the real people around her are trying to fool her.  she's told me that i and my dad deserve to die.  i have had to physically restrain her from breaking windows with whatever heavy object she gets her hands on.  even lately though she's calmed down around dinner time to eat and take her meds, but not tonight.  she went to bet at 6:30 without food and refused to eat or take her pills.she is clearly at the point where everyone (including her) would be happier if she could be in a quality care facility.  (we seriously try to accommodate her in every way we can).  but we simply don't have the funds to do so. in fact, we rely on her ss income just to help pay the bills.does anyone know good ways to deal with a loved one with dementia who becomes increasingly hostile while still being able to provide care at home?  we really just try to be nice to her, take her for drives or give her hugs (when she'll accept them)."
e170gy,"title really says it all... my dad (69) is now in a state where he's unable to function on his own, forgets who people are, does weird stuff, and all the usual alzheimer-y stuff. my mum (66) is the one taking care of him, essentially babysitting him 24/7, and she's mentally and emotionally exhausted.every time i call her, i can tell that she's been crying recently. it breaks my heart and i have no idea what to say or do to somehow make it better for her.so if anyone has any experience with this, i'd really appreciate some advice... :("
nl9dvj,"hello. this post is not like me but i feel like i need it. i was raised by my grandparents from the time i was 8 till 18. my mom left me and my brother and they took us in. my dad was a jobless alcoholic during that time. growing up, my grandma was always distant. she suffered from mental illness and depression. there were times where she would stay in bed for months, she never loved us unconditionally, it was always conditional. since i moved out and started college, she hasn’t called me once. i love her like a mother, yet experience so much confusion. her dementia is getting really bad, she has forgotten so much. for her, however, at this point she is more paranoid. despite how distant she is, i don’t think much of it. we never celebrated holidays, she never told us she loved us, she’s like that to everybody. still i go over there maybe once every few months. this time was different. she said my dad doesn’t live with them anymore (he was because like i said he’s a drunk). i simply expressed how i think that is for the best. she felt as if i was attacking her son and lost it on me. she called me every name in the book, called me worthless, and said i’ll never amount to anything. my face went white, i was so hurt. she said my dad is an amazing man and with every bit of courage i had in me i told her i’m 4 times the man my dad is (he beat my mom, never worked, done nothing for us, and does drugs). she pointed her finger in my face and told me to leave her house (the house i grew up in) and never return. before this, i never knew where my dad got it from, but seeing the wantonness on her face, i now know where he gets his anger. i went straight to my car and cried, my grandfather said her meanness has been a constant lately. that she simply forgets losing her cool and acts like nothing happened.how do i get past that? how do i not take it personally? i want to go back but i can’t put myself through that again. i am not worthless. everything i do i do to make her proud, she was an educator so i am in school to be one. her calling me nothing might not be my last memory of her but it will forever be the most prominent and i’m angry."
2kthc2,"my recently widowed 83 year old mom has vascular dementia, though she is still pretty functional. i've moved back in with her at our family home and we have an in-home care provider twice per week. we want to keep her engaged as much as possible, so we take her to attend various activities about 5 days per week. except for church, she grumbles about why she has to do this and why we want her to, saying that she just wants to stay at home by herself, excepting for my presence. most of the time she'll participate once she's there but has been becoming a bit more resistant to going lately. what's a good strategy to overcome her objections and/or convince her that getting out of the house isn't a bad thing?"
2rgki6,"my mom married my wonderful step-father 6-7 years ago. he is 56 years old, and it is believed he is in stage 4 of his alzheimers.i'm thirty years old, and i'm not too sure how to help out. my step-dad is still highly independent and can still act like himself around other people. i can often have a conversation with him and if i didn't already know it, i wouldn't be able to guess he has alzheimers. he struggles with things such as remembering how to log onto the computer, he can't tell time on an analog clock, but he can still go out on his own to shop and visit people. i'm seeking out for my mother. she is struggling, because for 3/4 of their marriage it has been a challenge for her and things have slowly been going downhill after the first couple of years of their relationship. she says he isn't the man she fell in love with, though she can see glimpses of him every now and then (which is understandable).he is verbally abusive to her often (never in front of any one else), and is angry all of the time. i know she is suffering, and that it is hard for her because everything is all about the person with alzheimers, and not the spouse. her self esteem is suffering and she feels trapped. she says everything sets him off (yelling and berates her), and he becomes focused on things and often freaks out at her if she says or does the wrong thing.i don't know what to do to help her. i love my step-father so so dearly, but it is so hard to watch my mother in this. a big part of me wants to tell her to leave before it's too late and he loses his independence, because she is so young and has so much ahead of her still and the other part feels so guilty to even think of wanting her to do that. every outcome for both of them breaks my heart.is she doomed with a life where she has to walk over egg shells and ""be agreeable"" to prevent his freak outs? this is the advice she's been given multiple times. she says he has never been physically violent, but that his anger is very unpredictable/severe and the littlest things set him off. she has also been told to ""always carry a cell phone, even at home"" just in case things get bad. she isn't interested in going to a support group because she doesn't want to sit around and talk about all of the crappy things happening.can anyone relate to this? i feel helpless."
l35efw,"my mother (not quite 60) has always been super sweet and loving, very athletic, gorgeous, with a really broad mind, and full of intellectual conversation, a real social butterfly. now, she's angry at the world and at her loved ones, constantly. she finds no pleasure in anything she used to. she is becoming more and more reclusive, and her decision making seems to becoming childish. she is even becoming violent with the animals, who she has always adored. i see a doddering, angry, bitter, old woman where my mother used to be, and it breaks my heart.i have just come to the realization that dementia is likely behind the change. i feel it's pointless to argue with her anymore. i just need to help her as best i can. what do you do with a parent who is still with it enough to function, but is losing ground by the day? what can i expect? what can i do?i have already devoted a significant portion of my life to her because of other illnesses she had when she was younger (cancer, ptsd, endometriosis that was left undetected too long and nearly killed her, the subsequent hysterectomy, and early surgical menopause). i feel like my life has always been on pause, and that i've never had a chance to be young. now, this is just one more punch in the gut. i'm sorry for me, for my dad, for my family, for our pets, and mostly for my mom, who seems trapped in her own hell. what can a child do? i don't even know how to approach this realization."
v65ziz,"in the past year, my 94-year-old grandmother has slowly started to forget things. we recently brought her to live with us and she still thinks she's at her home in mexico. she truly believes that she's in her home even though she's actually in the u.s living with my family. luckily she still remembers my family but has forgotten a lot of other people. my question is what do i do to help her? are these the early stages or are we way past that? should i let her think she's in her home so she won't want to leave?"
bbq3bb,"my lo with dementia wants to move every few months.  someone will do something (small) to upset her and then she'll start talking about wanting to die and about how horrible she's treated there and it's the end of the mother loving world.  then she'll start demanding to move out.  i'll get multiple calls a day.  she'll call all her friends and tell them how horrible it is.  then her friends will call me and tell me how unhappy she is there and that she needs to move.  today, the horrible treatment she received was that she was told she had to wait to eat breakfast until it was ready. \*boom\*  she has vascular dementia and so she's been pretty stable for a few years now. her memory is pretty good - some things she remembers, other things she doesn't remember.  it's pretty hit or miss for most mundane things, but for things that are emotionally charged - she remembers vividly.  this limits my ability to brush things off or redirect or minimize.further complicating things is that she lives thousands of miles away from me.  i've flown out to her 11 times in 3 years to move her or put out some fire.  each time, my spouse has to take off work to watch our kids and take care of our other relative with dementia while i'm gone.  i tried multiple times to get her to move near me but she would say ""no"" every time. the most recent time, this past fall, i thought i had her coming out to me for sure.  i visited 18 homes in my area to find one that suited her and that she could afford.  i searched out and sat with multiple attorneys, and ended up retaining one so that i could transfer all of her paperwork and healthcare to my state.  i lined up companies to help me clear out her apartment and came \*thisclose\* to getting plane tickets - but held off because i had a feeling.... as it got closer and closer to time for her to move to me, she became more and more anxious.  she was fixating on the furniture she would have to get rid of.  i told her i would not move her furniture to me but would buy her new stuff for her new place.  she insisted on keeping her stuff and me driving her and her stuff thousands of miles just so she could keep her stuff.  i held firm and told her that i would not be doing that.  so she decided to stay where she's at.  this whole scenario happened 3 times over the course of 3 years. each time, it was some dumb reason why she couldn't go.so, i move her again but keep her local.  this requires me flying out and hiring help and etc. etc. i've invested countless hours doing all this stuff for her.  i can't do it any more.  i can't spend so much time on her and to her friends who call me all the time.  i have kids and another lo with dementia that i care for as well. she's already called me a few times today about her mean caregiver who told her she had to wait... and other calls about how she refuses to eat... i would love nothing more than for her to be happy, but i can't jump through all these hoops every time she gets her feelings hurt.  does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this?  i'm exhausted with this and there's no end in sight."
4zkqfm,"the sidebar says ""don't suffer in silence."" and aside from close family members, i have been.my mother was diagnosed around 3 years ago with mild vascular dementia. now it's moderate. my dad and brother have been taking care of her, but my brother has a family and my dad is exhausted and can't keep up with the shopping, yard work, etc and keep an eye on her.sometimes she doesn't know where she is (at home) and doesn't know him. she can't see very well (although her eyes are apparently fine). she has extremely poor short term memory. she will ask me several times in the course of a conversation the same questions, and say the same things. she seems to remember old memories when i bring them up, but doesn't have much to add to the conversation other than to seem happy/surprised/etc. my phone calls with her are breaking my heart. i want to be there for her as she was for me, and i'm always strong for her on the phone, but it's hard to hold back the tears. she's getting worse and worse.the biggest hurdle for me is that i last saw her about 20 months ago since i live in the us and she's in the uk. affording plane tickets and getting time off is difficult. last time it was a struggle to get childcare for my kids (i only brought the youngest). she misses me. the most i've been able to do is call regularly. she can't use the computer, can't read/write, etc. even if i did visit, my help is temporary and i can't be there for emergencies. she has an emergency button on a necklace that's tied to a service that i help set up for her when i was last there, but she wouldn't know to push it now.to give my dad a break, after him resisting for a while, he had her admitted into a care home for a week. i just got off the phone with her today and she's not happy there and misses him terribly, and i felt so awful that i couldn't do anything for her. her voice was so sad, and she's never really been one to show any sadness to me - she's protected me from that until now. i don't feel i can tell my dad what she said since i don't think it'd do any good. he needs a break anyway, and it'd just make him feel bad. my brother is on vacation, which he also needs.we've set up power of attorney (financial and health).1. what can i gift to her overseas? i didn't do anything for her last birthday as i couldn't think of a single thing besides beauty parlor vouchers and sending flowers. she's beyond jewelry, books, movies, and many other things that involve sight, thinking, etc. i don't know her clothing tastes well enough. she may not remember a gift that i got her 30 minutes afterwards, but it makes me feel better.1. my young kids used to speak to her over the phone, but she struggles to hold a conversation even with me now, and the kids generally aren't great on the phone. how do i ensure they have lasting positive memories of her? i blame myself for the distance, but there's not a lot i can do. she has a grandchild, my nephew, that she sees regularly, which i'm glad for.1. i know dementia is a terminal disease. i don't know what her life expectancy is, and i don't know if it's possible to tell? not sure i'd want to know. she's recently started not eating as much and that worries me.1. how should i use this time now to prepare for the future? how do i prepare emotionally? what happens when she no longer knows my name, or me? she can't remember my kids names or ages already. those that have been through this, what did you wish you had done that you can no longer do? she was the one that knew my birth weight and time. i can never get to ask her that now.1. have any of you gone gotten professional help for yourself, someone to talk to? i have thought about calling my insurance's nurse line, but the hassle and stress of going through that may be counter-intuitive.i want my mum back :("

sw2a2b,"hi all. my mom has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia at the age of 73 and is struggling badly with the diagnosis and her changing cognitive ability. she is likely experiencing some sundowner-like symptoms. she is crying a lot, often in the evenings, repeating things like ""i just want to be me"". she's always been a powerhouse in the family, thinking of herself as a bit of a matriarch--always caring for others, taking care of house and home, etc. very ""in control"" of herself and, in her eyes, her family. that said, she's clearly not coping with me needing to take over handling the finances, or my sibling and i doing more around the house. i've tried to get her to talk about what she's feeling. i imagine there is a grieving process involved here, voluntary or involuntary, for all of us. she's also been a caretaker for our father for a few years now--he is not in good shape physically, and we are faced with the fact that we will need to move them out of their house and into a place that is equipped to care for them. my wife and live out of state, but i'm within a day's drive and am spending more time with my parents as i can. my sibling lives in here in the same town with them.last week, her doc told her that this could be the most difficult time of her illness because she is still alert enough to be aware of it and of her mental struggles. she even hinted that things would get easier when she is no longer cognitively aware enough to know of her illness. i don't know the truth of that, but i'm reaching out here, with tears in my eyes, asking for kind words and any advice."

nb7fbq,my grandma has had dementia a few months. she’s always confused why she lives with us and is trying to go home but her house has been sold since she’s not allowed to live alone. i posted this about my mom a while ago. i think she’s abusive. my grandma will tell me how my mom complains about things and me when she’s out with her- i’m not sure how to tell my grandma not to listen to things my mom says bc they’re lies. i am not sure how to handle a person with dementia. i don’t know if it’s appropriate to tell her my mom (her daughter) is a bad mom bc i think it makes her sad and i don’t think it’s healthy to put her in a stressed out state mentally but i don’t know what’s appropriate  bc idk much abt dementia
s3vqo,"my grandma has alzheimer's disease. every night, she would always say  that last night she slept across the street at some stranger's house with my mom. we tried to tell her that she never spent a night there, but she insisted that she is right, and she would get mad every time we tried to convince her otherwise. she said that every morning, my mom would greet her outside our house. i'm not sure what i should do with this situation. should we comply with her and agree that she spent every night sleeping across the street? or should we continue to try to convince her that she never slept across the street. i am really confuse. help?"
r5p1j7,"hi! i’m looking for advice - i’m going to stay with my grandpa for a week or so to help him with my grandma who has pretty bad dementia. long story shortish, our family rotates through since he refuses outside help and this is my first time. my grandma is constantly terrified that she’s about to be admitted to a home or the hospital. my understanding is that in general with dementia i’m supposed to go along with her stories, and validate instead of correct her - but when she’s screaming that they’re coming to take her away and lock her up.. i’m unsure how to best react. my family just tells her she’s being crazy but i feel like that’s super not helpful? any advice would be appreciated, thank you so much!"
emaqpa,"we are taking my grandma to a care home residence tomorrow. what are some suggestions you can offer me to make the transition easier for her and my grandfather? we are afraid she'll realize we are leaving her there since she has some lucid moments when she gets a grasp about what's going on. is there any way we can make it so she feels comfortable being there ? this is a big step for us, and just want to make things go easy  for everyone ."
sgkvbt,"so my great grandmother hasn't been diagnosed clinically with dementia, but we're 99 percent sure she having early stages of it.sometimes she'll ask us who lives in the house with us, where she is, that the house doesn't actually feel like our home. she's having a hard time recognizing voices aswell"
h80j9y,"hi reddit,my grandparents are stuck with us because of covid-19 and have been in the us since february (they live in mexico). they were staying with my aunt up north and recently came down to try to get back home. they have been staying with us for a couple of weeks, and it is so tough watching my grandmother. she is in mid to late stages of alzheimer's, and it deeply saddens me. she looks for my grandfather when he is right next to her and very visible. when she goes to the rr, she can't find the toilet, forgets to wipe and wash her hands. she forgets she eats right after she eats. she wakes up distressed, trying to figure out where she is and who the heck is around. she's clueless a lot of the times and doesn't notice when people get home or when they are speaking to her. she doesn't remember who i am, or who her children are. when she speaks to us, she mostly thinks she's speaking to strangers. i don't know how to deal with this. i apologize if this sounds rude or something; i have never been in this situation. throughout my years of studying psychology, i have learned a lot about alzheimer's but never had to witness it firsthand. i am afraid of what's to come as i know that it only gets worse from here. i wonder if she knows she's a little lost or if they lose that part of themselves too. i wonder how much it tears her children apart (my mother and aunt included) if it's affecting me too. they are much closer to her."
hvjl8g,"hi. thanks for taking the time to read (and maybe respond) to this. 5 days ago i moved my mother, 80, into dementia care. she has alzheimers and had been living alone. she was kind of managing, with me doing everything, plus a cleaner to deal with all the food she'd leave rotting in the sink etc, but had no short term memory (eg we'd order food somewhere and 30 seconds later would try and order again) and very confused long term memory (couldn't remember her brother had died, or where i had grown up, for example). she was right on the precipice of getting lost; couldn't remember her address and would frequently ask how to get home from the one local restaurant she would go to—50m from her flat. she  often gets confused about whether she was awake or dreaming etc.so, based on that and advice from doctor and family (my aunt is a retired aged care nurse) moved her into a home. she thinks it temporary while work is done on her apartment. she is very unhappy and i can understand why. it's a really nice home in a modern building with a garden, hair dressers, cafe and quite a lot of residents; certainly not cheap. but despite her memory issues and confusion, she is still quite alert and in much better shape than most of the residents; lots of people in wheelchairs nodding off etc. of course, she thinks she is totally fine and looks around at all the ""old people"" who ""have dementia… or worse!"" and is very disturbed. she's refuses to try and talk to anyone and just hides out in her room.basically she is caught in the grey area between not being able to safely operate in the world, but not being so out of it that she just takes it all in her stride. with covid re-spiking in sydney (by 'spiking', i mean 12 cases yesterday), the homes have all gone back in to lock down so only window visits and no taking her out.my great fear is that i have put her in too early. the home and her friends say no. i'm struggling with a lot of guilt, grief and anxiety about what i've done. does anyone have any experience they could share about this issue—ie a parent being put in care who can't seem to find other residents at 'their level' and how to maybe make her life easier for her?thanks!"
ilaj06,"hello all,in short my family and i have started to notice that my grandma (84 years old) may have become slightly congitavely impared to the point we are worried she may have dementia. she retells stories and shows me things that she has told me about 3 or possibly 4 times over a period of maybe two weeks. she now struggles to drive - something she used to do a lot - and she also has trouble learning how to do new things like answer the intercom in her new flat, use her tv to surf channels (although this maybe due to her servere arthritis). she lives by herself however and manages fine. she shops, cooks, cleans, washes clothes, remembers birthdays etc etc for herself which is promising. she also has reasonably good medium term recall talking about things shes done and places shes been in the last 5 years etc.the main reason why we are now concerned is that she was recently convinced that i had never met my aunt who died from cancer \~3 years ago and tried to show me a photo of her. she lived far away when she died but had previously lived in the same town as us and i had spent plenty of time together with her in the presence of my grandma and even in my grandma's house. it was quite gut wrenching to hear her say this and i am convinced she now needs clinical assesment.i would appreciate anyone else's input and experiences, does this sound like somone suffering from the early stages of dementia? or is this just a minor episode of temporary memory loss inkeeping with someone of her age?thank you"
5q2li7,"shortly after my grandfather died, my 83 year old grandmother chose to live with my family. the last few years have been fine until just before christmas. after researching the subject, she has what i would consider dementia and her regular doctor would agree but has not written a formal diagnosis as of last week.this last week has been a frightening experience for my whole family. she has begun wandering around the yard disoriented and wanting to call 911 because ""nobody is around anymore.""i've come to the realization our family is not equipped to face this challenge. she has access to the outside from her room and i'm waking up after 2-3 hours in fear of what happens next.we have intentions of moving her to a memory care facility. tonight i could not sleep, thoughts of her screaming at me for betraying her for moving her to a safer environment.what are my steps? what do you wish someone would had told you in this situation? what things do i have to know?thank you for your time and advice."

3drjwd,"my grandma has alzheimers and has been declining mentally for about 5 years now. in the last couple of years or so, there have been a few occasions in which i had the chance to visit my grandparents in spain (i live in the uk) and i instead stayed at home because i had exams coming up or other things that seem very trivial now. in the last two months, i fear she has basically completely gone. she now often struggles to remember who my grandfather is and the last time i saw her, she seemed to be under the impression that i was one of her sons. obviously i don't really want to see her in her current state but i know she's not going to get better and it wouldn't be right to miss another chance to see her. basically, what i want to ask is how do i go about talking with her? do i pretend to be her son or remind her that i'm actually her grandson? if she doesn't recognise me and is afraid, do i walk away? if she talks about going home (they're moving to sheltered housing), what do i say? i've read that music can be very good for reanimating people so i'm going to burn a cd of her favourite songs and bring that with me. sorry this is so rambling, i find it difficult even to talk about it online. thanks in advance"
adtm6y,"my grandmother has dementia, i’m not 100% sure as i don’t think anyone has officially had her tested, it’s just “dementia”. i don’t think my family really understood until recently how bad it was.  from my research, she’s a late stage 5, early stage 6 alzheimer’s. she’s been “a bit forgetful” for about 10 years now, but in recent years we learnt that she doesn’t shower, doesn’t cook, has regular accidents etc. when she’s stressed or anxious she has difficulty with names/faces, but is generally good with her family or people she’s known a long time. my grandfather recently passed quite suddenly and we had to move her into an aged care facility as she can’t live by herself.  this also revealed to us how much she relied on him to not look sick. her condition has significantly worsened since being there, she’s always confused, upset, angry. it’s not a dementia friendly place at all and the nurses aren’t the best at handling it. there’s no cues as to what time of day it is, the building is confusing and hard to find the dining/lounge room, etc. she has regularly said that she may as well not exist anymore as she has nothing to live for and she’s mad at the family for dumping her there. a couple of times i have found notes in her room with her name, my grandfathers name, their address and phone number, kids names, and usually the words “help” or “take me home”. my parents have a “guest house” that they currently use as an air bnb, and are considering moving her in there. from my mum and my research, it’s a dementia friendly space and there are slight modifications we can make to make it more enabling for her.  we’d also get home help, a morning or overnight nurse etc. we could bring her furniture from home, give her simple tasks, take her out for activities. more important than that is that she’d be around family more, have more independence and get her self confidence back. from my research she’s a late stage 5, early stage 6 alzheimer’s we’re aware that as she moves through stage 6 and into stage 7, she will get worse and will need to go into a dementia specific care place. is it worth moving her now, to my parents, only to move her again in a year or so?if she does move in to my parents (it’s actually a separate unit, self contained but with easy access to their house), what extra care would she need that we might have overlooked. or should we look at sending her straight to a memory care unit?"
awpv92,"my (24m) gram is 84 years old and has dementia. she played a very significant role in my upbringing and i love her to death. she made us and especially me her priority growing up couldn’t be any more kind, gentle and caring. my grandpa died three years ago and really set things in motion i think for the disease taking control of her life. she no longer can live by herself and has been moving back in forth between my families house and my aunt and uncles house 4 hours away, staying for about 4 months each time. she stays in a room next to mine which is connected by a door. each night, sometimes up to nine times, she opens that door and peeks in to see who is there. the disease doesn’t allow her to remember that it is my bedroom, therefor every time it’s as if she is seeing me for the first time that day, and is relieved. she asks if i want to come in and watch tv or look at pictures with her because she doesn’t like being alone. she was married to my grandpa for around 63 years and honestly was not alone very much of her life, so this i understand. i also understand that she no longer recognizes our house our house. when i watch tv with her in her bedroom at night, she will say things like “why are all my things here? we’re leaving tomorrow morning to go to the next house”. she also has paranoia about other people being in the house, so she will say she needs to pack her things just in case the people think about stealing something of hers. her bags will be packed in the morning. she will often times pace the house late at night, and i will sometimes find her and take her back to bed and explain to her that we are home. “my parents are asleep, my siblings are asleep, and your room is right next to mine. it’s okay gram, it’s just us and we are perfectly sound and safe, let’s get back to bed”. she will go back to bed and feel better after that. every morning she wakes up and does not know where she is. sometimes it’s as if it is 2008, sometimes it is 2000 or sometimes it is 2019. she will peek through the door to my bedroom in the morning and see me and be instantly relieved she sees someone she knows. it makes me really happy to see her happy in that moment. my gram is also to the point where bathing and self care has declined. she can go weeks without showering but when asked says she showered this morning. it’s also to the point where she doesn’t brush her teeth, and when she goes to the bathroom it is always diarrhea, so cleaning herself is a necessity. when asked to bathe or shower she gets defensive and counters with remarks such as “you’re the one who needs to shower, you smell.” it has become an extreme stress for myself and my family. my gram also has glaucoma so her eyesight is iffy, causing her to have paranoia with what she sees combined with dementia. she will think she sees people in the yard while looking out of the window, and think they are stealing things out of the shed. she hasn’t driven in years, but thinks on the daily her car was stolen because it’s not in the driveway and she drive here this morning. her overall personality is changing, along with her memories and perspectives. it is hard to think positive most days because dementia is a disease that has no positives, only negative declines. i am mostly a reader here on reddit, but for some reason felt the need to post what is going on an what i’m feeling. with past dealings of depression and anxiety within myself, dealing with the progression of dementia within my gram has been really difficult."
6ohvbz,"hi there, there is a trip to a camp that our family has made every year for 50 years. it's a regional conference for churches which my grandparents have always loved. however, many people in their generation have passed on or are not able to travel. also... grandpa passed away a few months ago from a very brief bout of cancer.most of the time grandma does not seem to be aware that grandpa has passed away, she is calm when we don't mention him outright and can get very very upset sometimes when his illness and death are recalled. it's like she's experiencing it all over again, with the added pain that she can't go visit him or see him again. they were married 65 years.this will be the first year without grandpa. she is 88. she can walk around and is very familiar with this camp in one sense, but in another sense she doesn't even remember that she still lives in her own home. she is aware that she has a relationship with her daughters and me, but does not recall the type of relationship (mother/daughter, granddaughter) or our names or how long we all know each other or, again, where she even is at the time (one of our homes which she should know)... so any tips please?! how to keep track of her while retaining her dignity and self respect. we have a room in the lodge right across from the bathroom and i want to hang a sign on the door with her name or our family name so she will think to herself ""well, this must be my room.""is it realistic to ask friends from the camp to keep from talking about grandpa's illness and death too much? i would rather have her recall happy memories/her emotions about being near him and connected to him."
pe7fv8,"my grandmas dementia has gotten really bad and she requires 24/7 care. we have a live in caregiver but family still visits daily. in spite of this any time family isn’t around she is even more confused and insists she’s being held prisoner somewhere by the aide. she doesn’t recognize the house she’s lived in for 70 years.her doctor initially wanted to keep her at home because the thought was that that would be safer, as even though she doesn’t recognize the house she at least intuitively knows how to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night.the concern is that if she goes to live with a relative, she won’t know the house lay out and may be more apt to have a fall. but i do wonder if mentally she would be better than she is if she had a familiar face around.thoughts? how have others here handled similar situations where the person no longer recognizes their house?"
buwe56,"hello!&amp;#x200b;my 90-year-old grandmother has dementia. she lives in a care facility and is visited by one of her children once a day- we have a schedule set up for her so she never has a day without a visit.&amp;#x200b;the problem is, she doesn't remember being visited, and will tell whoever is there that day that no one ever visits her, that she hasn't seen x person in months (they were there two days ago), etc. i know we are not supposed to correct her as this causes confusion and distress, but she is already highly distressed. she has always been all about her family, and she gets extremely distraught feeling like her family is gone and no one ever comes to see her. ""where is everybody?"" ""why does john never come visit me?"" and occasionally aggressive- ""why haven't you come to see me in so long?""&amp;#x200b;what can we do in this situation? how can be reassure her that her family is there for her without making her more upset? it's so upsetting to us to see her so upset, i just wish she could comprehend that her children do come to see her every day."
kdcxcj,"for context, my mom, grandma, and i have lived in the house we currently live in for 9 years. the past few months, my grandma has mentioned going home every night. she seems to think someone brought her here sometime during the day. it gets bad to the point where she has packed suitcases of her stuff so she could go home. i'm worried that she is going to try and actually ""go home"". thankfully, we do not have a car so i don't have to worry about that but i'm still scared she's going to run away in the middle of the night.does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this?"
5kavr1,"my grandmother is 81. for the past two or three years she has had short term memory troubles. i don't believe it is alzheimer, but my sister says i'm in denial. she hasn't gone to a doctor about it because she is extremely stubborn about doctors and my grandfather doesn't insist much either.anyway, she forgets things very quickly after being told but she eventually remembers if you tell her often enough. she frequently misplaces things but stilli knows how to cook with no problems. she knows who everyone is and remembers everything from her youth. the main problem really is that she won't remember something the first few times you tell her. for instance, she will repeatedly ask what time it is.as i said, i'm not sure it's alzheimers. the symptoms don't seem to have worsened in these past years. she has lost her appetite but i think that she might be depressed, as she frequently complains of being bored (her day to day life is. very routine and she doesn't gave much in the way of hobbies.) my sister recently moved and my grandma keeps forgetting she doesn't live in her old place anymore, which my sister is, convinced is evidence. but i have observed that my grandma does remember things if you repeat them a few times calmly and without telling her you've already told her. my sister and grandpa immediately fly off the handle and yell that they've already said the same thing a bunch of times and i notice my grandma becomes ashamed of not remembering and, being a very anxious person, it just adds to her confusion.anyway, i'm not trying oto find excuses, just giving my observation and asking for opinions."
hz2kfb,"hey. my grandmother (88) has alzheimers/dementia. it was at an okay stage but it deteriorated when my aunt, her youngest daughter who lived with her and her kids, got cancer and eventually died less than a year later. she saw her body so that she would believe us and grieved and cried and everything. afterwards, my other aunts started having her stay with them for a while and she was basically moving between like 3 houses every couple of months which i now realize is really bad as this destroys routine and consistency but what's done is done. anyway, she finally returned home yesterday which she didn't remember at all or her grandkids who lived there until she actually saw the house. when she got there she began to ask about my aunt. she can't speak very well and her sentences are very very loose and vague but we can make out that she's asking about her. it's been brought up a couple of times and no one know show to address. we just switch conversations and try to distract her. we're not sure if we should keep doing this or show her a picture of her and ask her if this is the person she's asking about? but to do that we'd have to be ready to tell her she's no longer around and deal with the circumstances of that.i think it wouldn't hurt her to forget about her as incredibly painful as that sounds considering she took care of her all her life. it would only cause pain and confusion. i'm not sure what to do."
82mpl4,"so, my grandfather passed away this sunday and my family didn't want to tell my grandmother until a better time as her blood pressure and mind was calmer. come tuesday night, her sons came to tell her that her husband has passed at the age of 90+. my grandmother is about 86. it has only been around 10 hours since she was given the news. as a family, we know that she has memory issues. at about 3:00am, she got up and started walking and i got in front of her by asking what you are doing. she asked me where her husband is. i'm not sure how bad her dementia (or if it's alzheimers) is. she sort of has a fixed schedule throughout the day where she would eat at certain times, start cooking rice and etc. she doesn't do anything but sit around, nap, sleep or stare into the distance. she does ask a lot of questions as to where everyone is. if i was working overnight (which i don't anymore) and etc. she knows when my mother comes home because she works a fix schedule. how do you cope with this? (i fear that continually telling my grandmother that her husband has passed away is bad for her health and that we have to continue to say he is at the hospital).

of8itl,"my grandparents lives together in the same house for about 40+ yers.. recently my grandfather passed away and my grandmother who has dementia is now alone with a nurse at their home… the thing is this house is really big just for her and my mother is thinking of moving her to an apartment with this nurse. i’m really worried because i think we should’t move her from her house , i’m afraid this may cause her more harm than good.. has someone been in this position before? or has any advice? ps: her dementia is pretty advanced, after my grandpa died she has been saying she wants to go home (she refers to her childhood home)… because of this my mother says she won’t notice if we move her out of the house because she doesn’t recognize her home right now"

qa9jux,"hello. my grandmother has dementia, i recently found out. although i kind of knew that she was showing symptoms of it, now i realize how bad it actually is. my mother doesn't really have a strong relationship with my grandmother, they normally see each other once or maybe twice a year, they also live pretty far away from one another. i think when we visited my grandmother in 2018, she was already being a bit forgetful: occasionally repeating words and phrases in sentences. in 2019/begin 2020 we visited her again, she did not seem to recognize me at first when she opened the door. she went upstairs, and showed us cabinets and wardrobes full off unnecessary stuff, which she compulsively bought. rows and rows of the same cleaning product, toilet paper, et cetera. i don't think that we really visited her after that. (until recently)just a few weeks ago, my grandmother (she is usually very cold and blunt) called my mother in a deeply emotional state, begging her to come by once. my mother asked if it was okay to see her that same day, which my grandmother initially accepted.however, just 30 minutes or so before the appointment she said she wasn't 'feeling well' so my mother shouldn't come. she didn't, but a couple of days later she did. when my mother arrived, she found her own mother lost in dementia. my grandmother has formed this narrative which she says every single time when she's talking to someone: ""oh, did you know i got fired from my job? the business closed down."" this was 15 years ago.""hey, i renovated my kitchen."" 10 years ago. yesterday, i went with my mother to see my grandmother. she did not recognize both of us. we brought some food, because she is terribly skinny and keeps forgetting to eat. my mother had to explain that she was her daughter, i think she understood that. she kept asking for my age, and awkwardly asked me what my name was, and where we lived. care: she can not live by herself without help anymore. we can't go there every day to take care of her, but, there is a friendly neighbour at the other end of the street who helps her and chats with her occassionally. he is truly a kind man, but it is also very strenuous for him. he is getting literal physical pain because of the intensity of taking care of my grandmother, poor soul. we have contacted my grandmother's doctor (she has not been officially diagnosed yet) who is very, lazy i would call it. he refused to get help for my grandmother and was overall just lacking. after some pushing, we have managed to get a caretaker to take care of my grandmother, but onfortunately, it starts in januari! my grandmother still has a driving license and is still driving, which should be taken from her. i don't know what stage she is in, however, i would guess stage 5 of alzheimer's. damn, i just realized how much i wrote. if anyone actually read all of that: thank you. i don't know what we can do at this point."
ijkey3,"so my grandma (75) on my mom’s side has alzheimer’s and it’s been a while now. my grandpa takes care of her but my mom (47) does a lot too to help such as cooking food, cleaning her house and all that. and then there’s me (21) i see my grandma a couple of times a week because we live super close. basically my grandma keeps forgetting that she is retired from work and so everyday she gets dressed and goes walking to her “work” (it’s a 5-6 mins walk from her house). we always tell her that she’s retired everyday but it doesn’t seem like she’ll ever understand or remember and i understand that there isn’t much we can do right? but my mom is having a hard time accepting all this and all she does is yell at my grandma. i can’t take it anymore. i can see my grandma being confused and i see that she’s getting dizzy. i know for a fact that you should not show anger or frustration in front of someone who had alzheimer’s and definitely to not yell at them. she is making her feel bad that she can’t remember. just now she told my grandma “are you trying to punish us?”am i wrong for being absolutely disgusted with what she is saying. i have told my mom over and over again that we can’t act like this in front of her and that it is not her fault that she’d forgetting. we cant make her feel bad for it, she doesn’t know. and when i explain this to my mom she yells at me because i’m not the one really “taking care” of her and says “maybe you should cook and bathe her maybe you’ll understand”. okay like i get it it’s hard but like you’re not helping at the end if you’re talking to her aggressively. my mom also forces her to put on manicure when my grandma says that she doesn’t want to. idk man there’s other things but i don’t know what to do..."
40becj,"my grandma is in a nursing home after breaking her hip (a blessing in disguise as it finally got my parents and aunt to understand she couldn't live at home even with a 24h nurse anymore). anyway now that she's there, she's much happier, and doesn't cry and beg you to take her home, so it's much easier to go visit. i love to see her, we talk about what nail polish we like and all sorts of girly fun things. but she doesn't know that i'm her granddaughter all the time so she'll talk to me about more serious things too sometimes. i always feel she's much happier when i just talk to her and go along with whatever she is saying. i never correct her unless she asks me a question and i feel like it makes her happier. however my mom and aunt still try to remind her of things, like that my grandpa died or that she's not at home/work/wherever. i just feel like why tell her, why remind her of these things? i wouldn't want to find out every day that my husband died. but i don't know. am i wrong in playing into her delusions so much? i just want to make her as happy as possible but i don't want to do something that would adversely affect her either. this is all so confusing and i guess i just need an outsiders opinion because i don't really have anybody to ask."
pa9ebv,"my grandmother has been living with alzheimer’s for about 6 ish years now. it has become clear that she is entering her final stages of life, as she is no longer mobile.the one question i ask is what to explain to her when she asks about my deceased grandfather? it breaks my heart, and she asks about him every few minutes during visits. often she thinks that he has left her. i’ve tried different approaches to answering her, but if anyone has experience i’d like to know what may be most comforting for her to hear."
snhq8e,"my grandmothers memory has been deteriorating for a while now but recently she has started forgetting a lot of conversations we've had and i'm starting to think she's forgot my visits too. she angry with me all the time, thinks i'm doing nothing to help her but i've been supporting her a lot. she's scared, i understand that but its heartbreaking knowing she is so angry when i'm trying my best. it's just me and her and i'm so out of my depth. we're no where near her needing to go in a home but she says she never wants to and i can just move in with her. but i know there will come a day i can no longer handle it by myself. i'm terrified of the future and i'm worried it's more than just bad memory due to her age."
ksgi94,"my grandma has dementia/alzheimer well something of the two, really wired form of it. she remembers who we are and everything but she is getting more angry/aggressive lately. me and my mom are the primal car-takers of her. it’s starting to become to much to care for here at home and we think to get her into a home lately but are still not to impressed about it, it just fells wrong. bit all of our family has a full time job, and are not home all the time. what are some techniques to calm her down when shes angry? should we just leave here to cool off or talk to here? she just gets extremely frustrated and still has some good days. she even dresses herself and everything apart cooking.any advice appreciated."
rgk9zg,"hi everyone, i'm a bit torn about this so i thought maybe someone here had some helpful advice.my grandma (92) lives in a nursing home, and has dementia. she hid it for a good while, but it became apparent just how bad it is when my grandpa died last year. she thinks she is temporarily in the hospital and wants to go home, but by home she means the family farm, where she hasn't lived since she was a teen. she sometimes recognizes my dad and aunt, but often she doesn't, since she thinks they are kids. other than them i don't think she recognizes a lot of people very often.and here is my dilemma: my dad recently mentioned to me that she might be getting close to death and if i would want to visit her a last time i should do so soon. my grandma was a lovely part of my childhood and it pained me so much that i didn't get to see my grandpa before he died. but on the other hand, she will most likely have no idea who i am, but she will fake it since she has gotten used to that after hiding it for so many years. so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? right now my last moment with her was at my granddads funeral where she in a clear moment marched over to me, took my hand, looked deeply into my eyes and said ""he loved you very much you know?"" which is quite lovely.so yeah, i'm torn about if i should go see her or not, thoughts and advice is appreciated"
k050x8,"my 86y old grandma has been battling dementia for nearly 5 years now. it started with her repeating stories but it went downhill after my grandpa died.her short term memory is horrible. she will ask the same question many times, forgets my name sometimes (but knows who we all are) and generally acts like a child most of the time.she seems to always be very happy, doesn't understand tv shows but finds it amusing to watch and the most interesting thing - she's completely capable of living by herself.she lights fire in the fireplace, eats food we leave her and takes meds (i have to call her to remind her of everything tho). we visit her 2 times a week.the only thing that's gotten progressively worse is her short term memory and even her long term but she still knows who we all are and understands everything we tell her. it's been a slow decline during these past 5 years.what to expect in the future?"
jvvmep,"hi everyone.just like the title says, i'm looking for some tools and advice to helping, redirecting, and calming my grandma. she was officially diagnosed with alzheimer's several years ago. at first, i think most of us were in denial, but as the disease progressed, we came to terms with the fact that it had taken hold of her. earlier on, it was easily dismissable things, like misplacing items, or forgetting if she had said something to someone. later, it became telling the same thing multiple times in a conversation.now, it has progressed so much, she's more often ""lost"" than she is lucid. it seems like, within the past few months, her disease has revved up and progressed much faster than it had previously. she doesn't remember where she keeps her dishes. she'll put the cups in the drawer with the casserole dishes. you'll be engaged in a conversation with her when she'll suddenly walk off and wander around. she's confused so much of the time. it's gotten to the point where she can't remember many of my family members' names. she refers to my grandpa (her husband) as ""this guy"", and often doesn't realize who he is, or where she is.every morning, my grandpa has to walk around and show her pictures on the wall to bring her back and help her feel comfortable and recognize that she's in her home, however, it's not working like it used to. last week, my grandma was distraught and called my dad, angry and asking him when he was coming home. she thinks he's still a teenager, not a grown man. then, the other night, my grandma woke up, walked out into the garage, came back inside, and asked, scared, and angry who the man was in her bed. she wouldn't accept that it was her husband, so my grandpa moved out onto the couch. later that night, she came back out and asked him if he was coming to bed, as she forgot what had just happened. things are being put in motion to get her into a home. grandpa has been an absolute saint with her, but it's too much. i want to know what are some things that i can do when i am around to keep her occupied and happy. puzzles, coloring, etc. how can i calm her down when she gets confused or if it escalates, how do i redirect her attention to something that will keep her calm? she has been such a wonderful grandma to me. it breaks my heart to watch this disease slowly chip away at her. i want to be for her, everything she has been for me. any advice is truly appreciated.&amp;#x200b;tl;dr: this disease has progressed to the point where she is often confused, doesn't recognize her husband, and is upset. what tools or advice can i use to keep her happy and occupied?"
4v3tpj,"my grandmother has alzheimer's. sometimes when we do certain things she gets very irritated, like touching and moving her stuff around. we (my parents and i) know that we do not have the time to be primary care givers, and now that my grandfather has passed, we have to move her into a memory care unit of a nursing home.do we involve her in the moving? do we tell her or just move her one day? we are in fact allowed to bring some of her furniture, so i'm not sure we should involve her, but i'm asking for my parents' sake.thanks ahead of time, folks. "
a19y2o,"i recently found this subreddit and i’m hoping to pull support and well as support others going through similar situations. i just needed a place to vent and clear my thoughts. please let me know if this isn’t right place. my grandma was diagnosed with both dementia and alzheimer’s back in the late 1990s. i understand how lucky my grandma and my family are that she didn’t show tell-tale signs until 2008-ish. my whole life, my grandparents helped raise me and my three siblings. my father’s house was conveniently next door to them. my brothers and i loved it! eventually, my grandma wanted to move 6 hours north of where we lived. their home would be in the middle of no where. we simply thought they wanted to spend their golden years in a area similar to both of their home states. when we would go up for visits, we realized she was having more and more difficulty in the day to day. she would feed her mini-horses 5 or more times because she would simply forget. it  would get worse. she wouldn’t follow a conversation and get frustrated. as a young child, i didn’t know much and i got frustrated with her. a cardiac event in 2016-ish caused her and my grandpa to move back to the city. she was flown from her property to the hospital near her. it could have been much worse. we are forever grateful this was done before the golden hour was up. unfortunately, things got worse. in december 2016, i remember getting a call from my aunt, explaining a terrible incident that had happened. i had to rush over to practically baby-sit my grandma. my grandpa desperately needed a break. skip to the next week, we had no choice but to place her in a group home. she had completely forgotten who her husband was. it was now a unsafe place for him. she believed he was a terrible man, doing terrible things to her. my grandpa was a sweet, caring man. i saw her occasionally but it wasn’t enough. i kept kicking myself to see her but it was so rough. i couldn’t do it. i just couldn’t. my grandpa’s health was worsening too. he was in and out of the hospital all throughout 2017. unfortunately he passed in january 2018, just shortly after his 79th birthday. it was rough and my own resentment to myself was only getting worse. i did not see her from early 2017 to literally today. i forced myself to drive to her. her group home is in my own neighborhood. i’m so glad i saw her. she remembered my face and we talked about whatever she wanted. of course, the conversation didn’t flow but i didn’t care. i was with my grandma. i couldn’t believe i had forgotten what her face looked like with her wrinkles, how her blue eyes shined bright when she was happy. i realize i am lucky to have her remember me and i promised to her i will see her more often."
inx0j2,"okay so i'm going to try and get to the point. she's been ""difficult"" as a younger woman and girl from what i've learned. not sure if there's a condition that worsens and develops into dementia at some point? but it's gotten worse over time. especially since she's alone now (grandfather passed in 2016 at 86). i did everything i could considering i live a couple of hours away now. i'd come to town and just fight through the negativity to help. every little thing she notices out of place makes her think someone is coming in the house just to mess with her. honestly there's a rat issue that still hasn't completely resolved, and they might be the culprit. she had been saying for almost a year or longer someone is coming in, even accused me and another family member. i insisted she got cameras inside the house to monitor anything unusual. i have access to her security system, and found her to do some strange things when she alerted me of someone coming in. like, she made coffee, poured it into a bowl, and just .. idk what she did with it? she insisted someone came in to cook food, another time someone left dishes she didn't recognize, left dirty rags, moved some things, put clothes on the floor, etc. the list goes on. security company finds nothing unusual, but she just gets angry and accuses people of trying to ""make her like she's crazy"". i always tell her she can call the company if she wants to review footage of a particular time, see if they see anything. she never wants to anymore because they will tell her nothing happened. she started covering the cameras so no one could look at her when she didn't want them to. of course i never checked footage unless she insisted something happened.sometimes i feel uncomfortable taking any action because when police came after getting an emergency call, they suggested calling adult services and i quickly learned how terrible it can be dealing with them. they came in a vehicle with a flashing yellow light on top and made her feel totally uncomfortable. she fears someone wants to ""take control"" of her. this isn't a lie actually, because 3/4 of her kids excluding my mom and one grandkid took advantage of her financially. long lasting family business basically went to shit over time and died bc of mismanaging funds and taking out loans under grandparents noses. i never did nor do i now want to take advantage, and i don't want her in a nursing home. i also understand she needs help, but a special kind of help abs support that won't stress her. my mom and aunt will not bother to call her or return calls (aunt lives next door in house grandparents financed and rented to her about 30 years ago). they are her only surviving kids (one uncle died in 2015 and the other earlier this year), and the other 4 grandchildren don't bother checking on her at all. it's just me trying and it's stressful (23) feeling as if i can't do shit. i haven't been able to emotionally take all of the things she's been saying (she can get quite verbal and personal unfortunately) without having to end the convo and i feel bad because i know she can't help it. but as i've seen, continuing the conversations have lead to health issues with other family members who have now passed (uncles, grandpa). there was a time i actually felt myself getting deeply stressed and unhealthy trying to save a failing business/deal with the fact that part of it failing had to do with her being irrational majority of the time (being rude/personal with customers and employees etc.) and had to step away and find my inner peace again. the business was dead by the time i tried to fix it all, and was financially drained. it started to work fine for a couple of months but ultimately the plug was pulled.she hasn't even been diagnosed with it and i know she won't get tested willingly. she's given me durable poa over properties, business, etc. (excluding health) about a year ago or less, but revoked it after a mischievous family member got involved (they disappeared when they found out grandma had nothing to give). she's mentioned that her doctor suggested having someone look after her, but of course she was enraged at the thought. so yeah.. probably hasn't gotten tested. my ideal circumstance is to have someone look after her at home where she's comfy, and not doped up on meds. also, she's in bankruptcy and having a difficult time understanding things but wants no poa activated out of fear she'll be put away (even though i never had health poa). she will end up losing everything and my fear of her dying from stress will still be a threat if i don't get involved.im sorry if it seems like i'm all over the place, i can barely think straight! i just want her at home, and to know the property etc. she wants to keep are safe so that she's happy. how do i get this ideal scenario for her? i know she'd still be furious about someone aiding her at home but it can't be as stressful as a nursing home. how do i ensure my poa is active again? this is hard."
dhvdgq,"i live with my 85 y.o. mother. she’s been having issues with memory for the last 6-8 months that is getting worse. i think it’s been a problem more than i knew; now i feel she’s been hiding it. for a while it seems she has the impression that i am two different people taking care of her. she can’t explain it, but i inform her it’s just me living here with her.two weeks ago, she became too confused to manage her rx, so i took over with a pill organizer. she now needs to be told where and when her pills are. then a week ago, she asked what my first name was.last night, it came to a head. she doesn’t really know who i am. it was very hard to get her to go to bed (i was hoping a night’s sleep would get her back to speed, but it didn’t.) it’s coming out this morning that she doesn’t really know i’m her son. as i’m explaining our relationship, she thinks it’s like a movie that she has found out she has a son. i do have an estranged brother that she is aware of, but somehow the person she sees every day is a mystery.i go with her to her doctors appointments every month. i told him of her failing memory for the last 6 months, but he feels it is normal aging memory loss (he did do a verbal test i thought she failed, but guess not.). i pushed for medication to help, and he went with it. it didn’t help, obviously. i’m waiting for a call back on what i should do about this. she doesn’t know me – that’s not normal aging.i could use some guidance on where to go from here. can anyone point me in a direction? websites or recommend what specialists i should push for…"
mubl3c,"my grandmother is 88, she was formally diagnosed by her pcp with dementia about 1.5 years ago, we started noticing some minor issues maybe 2.5 years ago.  the thing is, she doesn't really fit into any of the ""stages"" of dementia.  if you go by the 7 stages, or just a more broad early, mid, late, she's all over the place with symptoms.  in the last few months there's been a handful of times she hasn't been able to recognize me, my mom, or my grandfather.  she doesn't think we're strangers, but confuses us with someone else.  two month ago i picked her up for a doctor's appointment around noon (usually she is very good at this time of day) and she thought i was her brother for the entire ride there.  on the way home though, she knew i was her grandson.  two weeks ago she thought my mom was her sister.  just last night, she woke up in the middle of the night and refused to believe my grandfather was her husband, she thought he was her father.  but in between those incidents, no problem.  she recognizes everyone just fine.  even this morning when i stopped by she knew exactly who i was, and was back to knowing who my grandfather was.  honestly, these more severe issues are an outlier.  i'd say 75% of the time she's relatively fine, and things come across are simply more age related forgetfulness that you would expect from someone who will be 89 in six months.  for example, if i go over when the news in on, we can talk about current events.  she knows what's going on, and she understands it.   the majority of the time it might just be mixing up what day it is, repeating some family gossip she already told me a few days before (so she still has the ability to make new memories), or screwing up while cooking dinner because she forgot something in a recipe.  on a day to day basis she gets dressed on her own, she cleans the house, she goes up and down from the basement to do laundry (though sometimes she forgets the right settings on the machine), she goes grocery shopping, and she even still writes out the checks to pay the bills when they come in the mail. but she's got these off and on periods of severe confusion, and her pcp has diagnosed her with dementia.  it just doesn't make any sense to me, and i've begged my grandfather to take her to a specialist or just *anyone* for a second opinion to make sure there isn't something else going on (maybe a medication issue) but he refuses.  not because he's an asshole, but he's just very old school.  their pcp of 30 years gave a diagnoses, she gets mad if he talks to her about her symptoms, so he just deals with the issues and placates her.  so i'm just wondering, maybe i'm in the wrong here, and something like this is common....the ""stages"" are more mixed and not rigid, and this is just a normal case of dementia.  it's just....""fishy"" to me.  i want the best for my grandmother in her final years, and i feel like i'm the only family member who is researching this and not just accepting the opinion of a 75 year old pcp diagnosing an 88 year old with dementia and not looking into it further."
5au0vr,"hey guys, i'm looking for a little advice. my grandmother is one of the most intelligent people i know, she's an accomplished lawyer, a self sufficient woman, and an all around great person. i love her dearly, but i'm becoming concerned about her cognitive abilities. she's beginning to repeat the same stories over and over, sometimes only a day apart.  she often forgets her wallet, her phone, or the location of her car keys. she's even starting to forget the names of the streets she drives on every day. my accounts have all been confirmed by other people in her life. so i guess the root of my question is, am i right to be concerned. and if so, how do i bring it up to her? do i go over her head to her sons who live many states away? i'm just feeling a little lost right now, and any advice you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated.

5ici7w,"crosspost from r/alzheimershello everyone,i am in a bit of a jam.my grandmother stopped driving about 4 years ago. her driver's license has expired in that time. does anyone know how or what i can do to get a new form of id for her?i have a durable power of attorney for her in order to manage her finances and bills. is there anything i can do myself without trying to drag her into a state id facility? i doubt she would be able to answer any questions... she has deteriorated quite a lot in the past few months. i assume to even get a state id you have to answer questions...documents of hers i do currently have:social security cardexpired licencepoa signed by her as well as mei might be able to get a copy of her birth certificate... though i am unsure.i am just kind of stressing out, because i only realized today she has no ""real"" form of picture id and this may be come a big problem later.thank you all for any help, and i hope you are doing as well as possible. the holidays can be a hard time for people affected by this terrible illness."
ss4ies,"for background, my 82 yr old mil has dimentia (i don't know the specific level or formal name). she isn't able to drive, cook, she forgets names, she can't be left alone,etc. she lives 1000 miles away and we haven't been able to spend much time with her over the past few years. the past few years have been tough, but the past few months have been extremely challenging for her. she lost her husband two weeks ago and because of her condition we decided to sell her house and move her into a memory care facility. because we live out of state, living with her is not an option. as i write this it sounds horrible that we haven't included her in the detailed conversation, but she wasn't able to understand and contribute to conversations with her husband and family months ago.my wife and family quietly packed up part of her house without discussing it with her until the end. they explained that she was moving to a place where she can be cared for and safe. my wife and her flew to our house and told her that she was staying with us for a while. the reality is that we're getting her place at the memory care facility ready for her to move in shortly after her things arrive. she only remembers a few pieces of the conversation (s) about moving, and incorrectly remembers the details frequently. she will tell us that someone (she knows it was family but doesn't remember who) came in last week and started packing up the house. then she said that someone told her that she was moving but she didn't have other details. my wife will explain that they packed up their house and they're trying to figure out the best place for her to live. luckily, she understands that she can't stay in her house alone which is very helpful. this conversation happens again and again and again. my mil brings this up somewhere between once an hour and as frequently used every five minutes. my wife had that conversation 10 times in less than an hour and a half tonight. she also wakes my wife up multiple times per night to have the same conversation. how can we either help her understand and remember the plan, or reduce the frequency of having the same conversation? we have been truthful with her about the plan (except that we have decided on moving her to a facility) but she forgets within minutes....not sure what to do from here."
q5h5wr,"i have a friend(about 80 years old) who looks like is on the way to alzheimer's or already has it. i don't know for sure because she didn't have a diagnosis until the last time i had talked to her about a month ago. she had moved out of state with her partner about 3 years ago and i wasn't really in touch with her much over these years. her partner passed away a couple of months ago and when i called her, whatever she was saying wasn't making sense at all which worried me. fortunately, someone was with her who i could talk to and they told me that it looks like she has alzheimer's that she has been hiding pretty well since her family and friends were not around. she has now moved back but the city she lives in is about 1.5 hours away from me. i have gone to see her a couple of times and i can tell for sure it is not just grief causing her memory issues. she has all the symptoms of alzheimer's that i read about - repeating herself over and over, not remembering what she said 5 minutes ago and not remembering some people at all. she didn't even remember the condo that she lives in is owned by her. the only family she has is a brother and a sister, who pretty much don't want to deal with her situation. there is someone local who helps her go to doctor's appointments etc. since i went to see her a couple of times and took her grocery shopping etc.(her driver's license is taken away), somewhere she assumed that i am going to do this every weekend and i am taking on the responsibility of being her caregiver. i gently tried to tell her that i will try to do what i can and that she should look into someone coming in to help her on a more regular basis but i don't think i was clear enough. i have a full time demanding job and am going through a lot of my own mental health issues at this time. i am struggling to take care of myself and while i do feel awful for the situation she is in, i just don't have the mental and physical bandwidth to take on anymore than what i am dealing with right now. she calls me regularly and leaves me messages to make me feel guilty that i must be having fun out there and so on. she has made it clear that she will not go into a home, no matter what happens. i don't know what to do. any advice?"

bqnvf7,"my mother (69, f) is suffering from very noticeable decline in cognition over the last two years or so. she has seen a neuropsychiatrist and a psychiatrist who have not diagnosed her with alzheimer's but who have not ruled out early dementia.she is starting to date online and has already spoken with a few scammers. thankfully, she has allowed me to be involved somewhat and i've been able to show hee how these scammers work, and end communication before any kind of financial information exchanged.she doesn't understand how they can use/spoof phone numbers and doesn't understand how identity theft works. for example, she has bought spokeo-type reports on these men and ""there is a person by that name who lives where they say they do.""she also doesn't seem to understand the danger of sharing even some casual personal information with people online without assurance that they aren't scammers, as many accounts use items that could easily come up in innocent conversation as security questions (name of first boyfriend, first concert attended, etc.). there's no way she would be able to tell when someone might be asking questions to gather information for this purpose.no matter how much i explain, it doesn't sink in like it should because of her cognitive difficulties and because she is so desperate for love.i am writing to find out if anyone knows of some ""safer"" online sites with minimal scammer activity. so far, she has tried match.com and firstmet.my mom is bound and determined to use dating sites (she started to do so around 2004 and stopped in 2013, just started again after death of husband she met in 2013.  i am not in the position to tell her not to online date or to take control of her online activity. i can only help moderate. i am trying to help her connect with social groups for seniors here in town (she's new in town) to meet people in person but she doesn't like most because the age range is usually 80+.any other advice or suggestions are welcome.thanks!"
umc6pd,"a year and a half ago my wife fell. she hit her head so hard it bounced. along with thus, she broke her shoulder and dislocated it. she has always been one to not do anything she didn't like. so the home therapy was pretty hit and miss and the use if her arm and hand has deteriorated. she started  ""misplacing "" wallet, purse, phone, charger, money, underwear, etc. not a day goes by without  a search being conducted, as sometimes several. she will sob and cry and ask why i would do such a thing as to hide whatever the ite. is at the moment. she hides these items and then forgets where she put them. then she yells and screams and uses vulgar language and says terrible things. she never remembers any of her actions. i  called  her dr to setup an appointment for load tests and mentioned my concerns  about her behavior. finally, after very much persuasion she went to the dr's. she ended up with the pa who gave the blood test result and wished her a good day. at least that is what she said. i asked if she wanted me with her when she went in and she declined. i made appointments for eye care, follow up on her arm etc and she cancels them. i have to work and worry about what is going on when i am not there. thanks for listening."
gnq9lr,"my mom lives with me (and has lived with me for many years), and she was diagnosed with alzheimer's about two years ago. mostly, she had just been very forgetful; basically no short-term memory, but about two or three weeks ago, she started not recognizing me. she accepts that i'm her child, but she thinks she has another child with the same name as me who's a lot younger (no exact age, but probably somewhere between 8 and 20-something).the problem is that she's very concerned about where young me is, saying that she hasn't seen him for days, and she thinks something bad might have happened to him; she's wanted to call the police a few times to file a missing person report (luckily, she doesn't know the phone number). i have no idea what to say to get her to stop worrying about young me; i can't convince her that i'm the one she's looking for.what sometimes works is if i suggest she call my cell phone, and while she's dialing, run off to my bedroom, shut the door, and answer the phone from there. she seems to recognize my voice; i tell her that i'm in my room, she comes over and finds me there, and all is well for a bit (sometimes only for a couple minutes though... she'll be glad that i'm safe, we'll talk for a bit, then she'll ask ""but where's little \[my name\]?"" and the process starts over again). if she calls me and she sees me answer my phone, she'll get mad at me and tell me not to answer—she's trying to call young me."
6gqqa6,"it's been a tough 48 hours. my mum is struggling to make sense of the situation, although is more often understanding it's her husband of 64 years who has died. she still wants to tell his mother and aunt, both of whom died 20 or more years ago, and her own mother who died 40 years ago.  it's hard to see her feeling so lost. we're being super patient, and helping her cope, but it's so tough to have to keep reminding her that we're it now. i also have to move her into a home now, as dad was her carer. so much change in so little time. we lost him suddenly, with little warning. as mum keeps saying, you never what is going to happen next."
bi73ug,"i’m fortunate in that my grandmother still recognizes us. however, she is, like most with this disease, quite prone to timeline confusion. we don’t live in the same country (or continent), so while we visit several times a year, my main form of communication is by phone.  the other day on a call, she wouldn’t believe that i was who i said i was, because “you’re telling me a little 3 year old has managed to ring me?”  so she thought it was 1997. she was lighthearted about it all as she thought i was my cousin pranking her. most of my cousins on that side of the family are at least 20 years older than me so it made sense. had she seen me in person during that incident, i’m a full grown adult. i suspect she wouldn’t have recognized me nor believed who i was. so i wonder-is not recognizing people more of an issue of timeline confusion? if one thinks it’s 1960, it makes sense that they wouldn’t recognize their now much-older spouse in that moment. i imagine it’s different for each person with dementia. but i wonder if anyone has experienced similar."
afzgl2,"i know this is a part of dementia. please don't waste your keystrokes. it's weird in a way but so is dementia. my grandmother's caretaker said that this morning she was talking about her mom and i think she mentioned something that alluded to her being alive but the caretaker (a distant family member) said she had long passed and said her mom had passed too. this kinda upset my grandmother who asked her to go ask my mom as if this would prove she's still alive. the caretaker mentioned that she seemed on the verge of tears. my grandmother was super close to her mom. i remember growing up, the only person she talked in detail about in terms of passing was her mom. she said she never thought she'd be able to live without her and that she has and was thankful for her mom for raising her and reassuring her she'd be fine when she left the earth. knowing this, just saying she's no longer here isn't going to work and obviously isn't advised. she's aware that my mom is still around, she knows i and my sister are her grandkids. i never met my great grandmother. she passed when my mom was a child. my mom is going through an illness herself so i don't want that mental weight on her of seeing her mom decline more or have these distressing moments (they were close). what can i do to help her through these ""blips""? what happens if they become more persistent? thank you all!"
rtt3di,"hi,my grandmother passed away on friday after a period of illness. my grandfather is very progressed in his dementia and has regressed to childhood memories only and his native language. he understands to some extent that we are family and sometimes that he has a daughter (my mom).. he has glimpses where he is more lucid but for the past months of my grandmother's illness, he seems to have thought that she was his mom. when he was informed of her passing on friday he broke down, by the time they arrived t the hospital to see her body he had to be reminded about why he was there.he seems to have lost the ability to form any new memories.. how should we approach this? is it more merciful to not inform him as he gets so upset? or should we keep at it?"
q1oadn,"my mil is 65. i made a post earlier today about this incident on another sub. the more i think about it, the more i get a gut feeling that something is wrong other than her ""just being crazy"". i'm not looking for a diagnosis, but how can i get her the help she needs if she refuses to look into it?long story short, she is spiraling put of control. she's lost all her money (around 700k in just a few years) and my wife and my bil have said the past few years that ""mom isn't really mom anymore"". she's moved 4 times in the past 5 or 6 years. i looked up the symptoms and she fits 90% of the list of symptoms associated with dementia. she's burned bridges with everyone in her family in just the past few years and, as i learned today, there is a massive family history of dementia. what brought this all on is she hit me, physically, in front of my wife and two kids today in my own house. she through food at me, hit me, cursed at me. what can i do to get her help? i don't want to press charges, but i don't want her to hurt herself. never in a million years did we think she would strike a family member. i don't believe she will get help willingly because everyone she was close to told her to and she refused and got angry and defensive. any advice would help me, i've never gone through something like this before."
kal5db,"my grandmother has had dementia for a couple of years now but in the last year it’s gotten really bad. one of the few things that gets her out of bed is thinking about her mom (died 25 years ago), her husband (died 13 years ago) and her brother (died tuesday). everyday she tells us about the adventures she went on with them that day (all hallucinations) but it’s one of the only times we see her smile. if she ever asks where her mom or husband are we usually tell her they’re out shopping or fishing and she takes it well. if we tell her they’ve passed she spirals out of control and doesn’t comprehend what’s happened. we haven’t told her about her brother in fear of another spiral. she’s also been diagnosed with lung cancer recently and now has a sinus infection that she can’t get over. we’re worried her time might be coming soon as well. do we tell her about her brother and if so, how,"
rak5zu,"she's 93. he passed away about two months ago at age 98. she and both of my parents were right there with him, in bed with him and holding him as he slipped away. my grandparents were married over 50 years. her dementia is getting worse by the day. she keeps asking my mom where he (grandfather) is. things we've tried and their results thus far:* telling her the truth, option 1. this results in her sobbing and shaking with fear for hours into the night. then my mom is a mess too because having to retell it all and go through her mom re-learning this info is so awful. this one is happening less often now, being replaced by....* telling her the same truth, option 2. this results in her getting angry and wanting to know why we would tell such a lie, and demanding to know why we're treating him so poorly. this one is happening more often now.* telling her he's at an appointment or some other kind of ""away and not here right now"" fib. this results in her being upset that he's abandoned her and she freaks out that he's mad at her. i guess this anger/abandonment stuff was kind of a theme in their marriage for a while? i know he had a lot of ptsd after being in wwii and the korean war, and would always openly talk about how much he missed his (deceased) first wife.we're out of ideas on what to tell her. and i'm not of the opinion anymore that the truth is the best option, as it seems to cause her so much repeated unnecessary distress. has anyone else here been through something similar? if so, what did you tell them? how did you handle it? my mom can't keep doing this, her mom can't keep doing this, and i don't live with them so i'm not there to provide any in-person help. i also worry that inconsistencies in what she's being told might be adding to her confusion and distress. i think it might be best for a story to be chosen and then stuck to. thoughts?note: my dad is present in this and does his best to be supportive and helpful, but when my grandmother starts roaming the halls in the middle of the night looking for my grandfather, it's often my mom that she's looking to for help. it's also my mom that she looks to for confirmation of whatever's being told to her. plus, she and my mom speak cantonese together (she's defaulting more to cantonese now as it's her first language) but my dad only speaks english."
eyciol,"my mom has dementia and as many have posted before, she has delusions.  i usually go along with her delusions (or take it with a grain of salt), but how do i handle accusations?she left me a message yesterday saying that she called the bank and that they said it's illegal to throw her id away and that she'll have to get a new one all thanks to me. first, i don't know if she called the bank - i'm pretty sure she doesn't have the wits to dial a long distance number and provide identification.  i also don't know where she got the idea i threw her id away.  how do i respond?  my instinct is to tell her that's crazy, but i know that won't help.additionally, she will sometimes tell me that she doesn't want me to be her caregiver anymore.  she's in a nursing home, so i'm not directly providing care, but i am her poa and i think that's what she's talking about.  again, my instinct is to tell her i really wish i didn't have to be her poa either and that i was pushed into this by circumstance, but there's no point in doing that.  any thoughts are appreciated!"
qkgqrg,"i’m not sure where else to go.my (25f) grandma (81f) got diagnosed with vascular dementia about 6ish months ago. however, i noticed her personality has slowly changed over the years (for the past 7ish years she has become more angry, says things that aren’t socially acceptable to say/says offensive things, talks about death often or how old she is, cries more often, etc.) - i watched her turn into a different person for the past few years &amp; it’s been weird. idk if it was the dementia slowly developing or if she just had a personality change.now, knowing she has dementia her behavior makes a little more sense. but over the past 1-2 months it has gotten really bad. she would call me 5-7 times a day so i had to block her number &amp; unblock it when i had time to talk. also, i will mention that i moved out of state from my family about 7 months ago, but went back to visit a couple weeks ago and got to see her. it was hard because she just looks like a shell of who she used to be. last night i got a call from my dad (her son) that she was in the hospital &amp; he broke down. i have never heard him cry like that. apparently she wouldn’t eat or drink anything &amp; became unresponsive. i also broke down &amp; immediately felt so much guilt for blocking her number &amp; felt bad i couldn’t be there. i just got home from visiting a few days ago. i was begging the universe to give me a chance to talk to her. an hour later she randomly woke up &amp; started cussing out the nurses (sounds about right for her), but i got a chance to talk to her &amp; this was the first time i had ever heard her not make any sense. she was saying my grandpa beat her with his cane (he can barely walk on his own, let alone pick up his cane). she was beaten by her husband in her first marriage (not my grandpa) so i’m wondering if her dementia is causing her to experience ptsd or something? i couldn’t help but burst into tears hearing her talk like this. her voice was full of suffering &amp; i can barely stand to watch her deteriorate like this. i’ve never lost a close loved one before. i have no idea how to cope with the guilt, fear, sadness, etc. i’m going to therapy this week, but i wanted to hear what other’s on here had to share. thank you in advance."
f17k55,"my grandmother's sister passed last night. my grandmother has dementia, she knows my name still but her short term memory is gone, she can't make coffee or get something, she passes the room and she'll forget what she went for. i am an ftm and have been very much passing as male for 4 years but she still calls me ""she"" so that's how far it's gone i guess (for reference, it's unimportant to the story, i don't mind it).she won't remember that her sister is dead i think or will she? what if she asks about her? should we remind her or should be be like ""we'll visit her soon"" and then never go and she'll forget we promised? or do serious things like this make an impression deep enough for her to remember it?"
runv8t,im a care taker for a dementia patient and sometimes she asks me to call her mother for her (who passed away years ago) how should i respond when she says these things? obviously telling her shes passed isnt a good idea but i also feel bad lying?
eg1b1g,"i dont want to try and unpack it all because it's far too much but it's the classic case of she denies anything is going on, blames me etc.. if i try to ask her how she feels about what is happening, i might get 10 words out of her. but if a little thing does go her way on any given day, she will talk a lot about that. in other words, she will be chatty about things like politics, religion, complaints but not anything that is really serious. she has also been making a lot of poor decisions when it comes to managing her own funds. she spends every other month in another state and i fear that her daughter (if she hasnt already) might be trying to make a move for personal gain of some kind. we have several properties but everything is either in my name or llc. she has agreed to some testing but lets just say the tests come back that she does in fact have cognitive issues, then what? im having a lot of struggles here. thank you."

e9brzs,"in the last 6 months to a year, it has become increasingly obvious that my mother is suffering from memory problems. she routinely forgets conversations we've had in the recent past, as well as events and conversations from long ago. a couple of quick examples (though there are many more) are: &amp;#x200b;1. there is a story my grandfather told about a very notable event that happened in his farming community when he was a child. it has been told multiple times over the years, by many different family members, including my mother. when i recently brought this up (over the summer) she claimed to have never heard the story, nor recounted it herself (but i have a video of her talking about it 2 years ago!)  2. she has started to repeat things she's already told us, sometimes multiple times within a few hours. i first noticed it when we met up for lunch one afternoon and she recounted to me a long story from work that she had already told me via text earlier that week (this was a couple of months ago). just this past week, she repeated the same anecdote about a doctor's visit the same day we met for dinner, three times during the meal. &amp;#x200b;my grandmother (mother's mother) ended up being diagnosed with dementia (not alzheimers) in her early 70s, though she had probably been suffering from the symptoms for close to ten years before it was finally named. at the time it was attributed to her suffering from many ""mini strokes"" that were probably the result of her 50+ years of cigarette smoking. it eventually killed her at 78.my mother has not smoked a cigarette since the early 1990s. she is also extremely physically active several times a week and has been for close to 20 years (yoga, cross-training and running). she has a very high responsibility job (though planning to retire in 2020) and as far as i know, her memory issues don't seem to be affecting her professionally. it is only in personal interactions that i've noticed these issues.   how likely is it that this is the beginning of dementia? to be honest, i feel like i've been in a bit of denial about it; and am secretly hoping that someone will say ""it's normal for older people to become slightly forgetful and repeat themselves. it may not be dementia at all!"" she lives alone, so there is no one to monitor her behaviour and report back to me, but i do talk to her a few times a week and we usually get together on the weekends (i live about an hour's drive from her, have 2 kids and work full time, so it's not possible to see her more often.)i want to talk with my mother about what we've noticed, but i'm feeling stressed out about it and hoping that folks in this sub can help me figure out a way to broach the topic in a sensitive manner. i'd also be open to hearing from any other people who've dealt with this in their own family, especially with a parent, about what steps you can take with health care providers and if there are any treatments that can at least slow down the process.thanks in advance for any advice/commiseration."
tpoqy8,"my current job is taking care of an elderly couple in their home. both are 89. the wife has dementia (likely alzheimer's in my opinion, but not officially diagnosed as of yet) that has been steadily progressing in the year i've been with them. she's still pretty aware, but has moments of confusion, including a consistent belief that she is in the wrong place and wanting to go home. i have plenty of experience managing these symptoms, and if it's just me and her i'm easily able to placate or redirect her before she gets upset. the problem is her husband. he is very aware with only minor lapses in short term memory, and very headstrong, which leads to him constantly arguing with her. it's an incredibly draining cycle: wife mentions wanting to ""go home tonight,"" i overhear her and start trying to change the subject, husband interrupts me to insistently tell her that they are home, have lived here for decades, she can't drive to go anywhere anyway, etc., which greatly agitates and upsets her, and i am left to deal with the fallout as she goes to bed and cries. i enjoy caring for these two, but the worse her symptoms get the more this becomes a daily occurrence, and it's making me dread coming to work in the morning. i regularly have conversations with the husband explaining the right way to handle her, and he seems to understand at the time, but the next time she says something wrong he's right back to it. it's absolutely killing me. i know it can be hard to convince older people to change in their ways, but is there anything i can do to help this man react better to his wife's dementia?"

p1t5tg,"(sorry in advance for the long story…) my mother is 92 yo and was diagnosed with alzheimer’s and vascular dementia 3 years ago. my 94 yo father was her caregiver until he unexpectedly died three months ago. i did not see my parents for just over a year due to the pandemic. after they and i were fully vaccinated i made the trip to see them the end of april, just one week before my father’s death. during that visit i realized my mom’s dementia had progressed over the previous year, but she was still able to walk with assistance of a walker and she could carry on a conversation although many of the things she would say were not true or did not make sense. she was starting to have difficulty finding the words she wanted to say. she could still dress herself and use the toilet without assistance. my father died at home, in his sleep on mother’s day. my mother kissed him before he was taken to the mortuary. later that day she started to ask where my dad was. we discovered she was less likely to get upset when we told the truth. but she would ask dozens of times a day. she went to his memorial service and did well considering she hadn’t been around many people for a few years. my brother and i both stayed at the house to care for her until we moved her to a memory care facility three weeks later.her transition to memory care went better than we expected, but she kept thinking she was in jail or was being punished for something. she continued to ask about my dad but started to get more agitated when told he died so we switched the story to him being in the hospital which seemed to be more acceptable to her. a few weeks after moving to memory care, she was taken to the er for symptoms resembling a stroke, but it turned out to be a severe urinary track infection that required iv antibiotics. this is when she lost the ability to walk and had to use a wheelchair. she could no longer stand unassisted and she had more difficulty talking. she returned to memory care and was having trouble eating and swallowing intermittently, but most of the time she could eat and drink. i stopped calling her about a month ago because she no longer recognized my voice or accepted it was me on the phone. when i saw her in person around the same time she did not recognize me and kept calling me “mom”, or called me by her best friend’s name. she could not talk or respond to questions. just this week we were told she now sleeps only one out of three nights and is scared, confused and yelling for my dad when she is not sleeping. this is how she is now after just three short months.some people have said the rapid decline is due to my father’s death or the move to memory care or the uti, or all of the above. her doctor has seen her twice and says she is physically healthy. my brother is having a very hard time accepting her rapid decline being due to the disease, but he hasn’t really educated himself about the disease and how it progresses. so, i would appreciate hearing what others have observed or experienced with their patients and loved ones when the disease takes a rapid turn for the worst. do you think one or all of these issues could be to blame and is this decline permanent? her infection was cleared up by the antibiotics."
ozg0sh,"so my grandmother’s dog passed away this tuesday. and at first we tried to hide it because we know how heartbroken she will be and we know don’t know how she will react after learning that her dog died. so basically her dog died on the bed beside her without her knowing that she is already dead. my mother found out that she is already dead while trying to get clothes from her drawer to take my grandma to a bath. so now we tried to hide it from her and told her that we will take it to a vet. (thinking about it now it’s a bad idea because now she can’t wrap her head about it and just plain confused.)but really we will take it to funeral. and now she just cries half of the day. asking where her dog went and saying she’s not dead basically repeating it we bought her a new puppy to try and give her like emotional support. but she just want to find where her dog went. obviously it’s dead and we tried talking to her about it and she’s in denial about her dog’s passing.and it’s sad to see my grandmother memory deteriorates. seeing her like this it’s like she lost her sense or common and she remembers only her clothes, money, dog, and hairbrush. she don’t really remember us her grandkids even worse her daughters “my mom”. and seeing her not knowing how to properly wash herself when pooping makes me sad about this damn disease. i don’t know why did i type all this it’s already 5:28 am. i don’t know anymore i just wrote what came in my head."
ej0xjj,"hi everyone, i'm hoping to get a little guidance on where to begin with my mother.  i live in texas.  my 76 year old mother lives with me &amp; my spouse.  her only income is social security &amp; it's not very much.  she is on medicare.  alzheimer's &amp; dementia run strong on my mother's side of the family.  my grandmother had alzheimer's and several of her siblings have dementia.  my mother's short term memory has gone from bad to terrible within the last year.  anything out of her routine &amp; i have to explain it to her over and over, writing it down, etc., and then she still gets confused.  her personality is changing &amp; she has starting lying, becoming manipulative and then promptly forgetting any of it.  my spouse took her to her doctor a couple weeks ago and was present during the visit.  the point of going with her was to voice concerns to the doctor about her memory issues.  they gave her a memory test and she did well.  then she went to the restroom and after leaving the restroom, became completely disoriented and had no idea where she was.  nothing came from the doctor visit and i feel like i'm in a slowly moving train wreck.  is there anything i can do or research to try to get an idea of options available for my mother?"

m1yu5k,"my mother in law is 80 and her only child is my husband. her husband passed away 5 years ago. she has extreme anxiety over the smallest things that turn into fits of anger. she repeatedly calls my husband and says she wants to die because this is no longer her world. she is convinced that everything is wrong with her when in fact other than high blood pressure and cholesterol, she is pretty healthy for her age. other members of the family used to reach out to her to chat but they no longer want to because she tells them how horrible life is all the time. she has, for many years, created drama that is unnecessary. lately, she will randomly forget a word for something. yesterday it was hanger. she referred to it as the thing you hang your clothes on. she forgets sometimes how to spell her granddaughters name. we spoke to her about seeing a psychiatrist and she said she knows too many secrets to go. my question is, where do we begin with her?  i really think she needs to get evaluated professionally. she sees her gp but i think pulls it together enough that he doesn’t notice. any advice would be appreciated"
smqmvo,"sorry i dont know where to go for question, i don’t understand dementia. im 17 and was adopted by a now 82 year old with dementia. hes throwing away my birth certificate, my driving permit, my social security, some physical records, and even my entire adoption book that told me everything about my biological family. he isnt mad at me, he doesnt hate me. why is he doing this and is there anything i can do to stop this? i dont live with him anymore but i was told by someone in his house that he did all that and isnt even explaining why. i cannot bring important stuff like that with me to keep safe right now. i have to go through the process of proving my identity now to get everything back.he did this same thing a few years ago when his grandson passed, he lived in the house and as soon as he passed, he started throwing away everything in his room in trash bags after everyone had discussed to keep it the same.his wife is having her important stuff found in the trash and some are even gone for good like physical bank records and her other important pieces of paper like some that are medical. thought about hiding these things and locking them up, but his wife is old too and cant move far so it wouldnt be fair to make her go through the extra trouble of hiding things when shes done or unlocking it all the time. is this a thing with dementia? is it common they throw away things that aren’t even theirs? he doesn’t throw away his trash but doesnt have a problem throwing away legal papers.either are at a point where they need in house care or nursing home. every time i mention dementia people reply with nursing home but that is not nice. he can do basic things on his own still, hes just a bit odd with behaviors like this. the one thing i cant seem to get around. he refuse to get help for his dementia. he is diagnosed but has refused to get tested again to see the progression. is there a way to persuade someone with dementia not to do these behaviors?"
nwt9xf,"mom has been doing the slow, but steady slide into dementia for a while now.  it seems to be picking up speed.  in the past few weeks she has been confused and accused my wife of things that never happened.  at the same time she had also made a fairly serious accusation of sexual impropriety and harassment against a family member several weeks back.  this accusation seems out of left field, she cannot really remember the details, but she has “remembered” the initial event and now has claimed it happened again.  it also does not fit what i know of this family member.  again, she was very vague with details, but adamant that it happened.  now, i am stuck between wanting to believe and comfort my mother and feeling this is a false memory that can cause some familial issues (accused family member is also one of the main helpers/point people).  thoughts or possible next steps?  thanks!"
6ruqds,"i love my wife to distraction.she's in her mid-50's, and has early onset alzheimers.up until 2 weeks ago or so, her symptoms turned her into a kind of goofy, good-natured bimbo. i guiltily admit to appreciating those symptoms. it was kind of fun, in a dark kind of way. at least, we could joke together about stupid stuff, listen to our old favorite music, and watch stoner movies (*dude, where's my car*) and laugh together, knowing that each understood what was going on.about 2 weeks ago, her behavior changed. she would wake up in a foul mood, accusing me of trying to kill her, physically striking me. this mood would typically last an hour or so, and then she would calm down. but for the past week, it's been an ongoing saga throughout the day, and indeed, she's begun waking up at 3am and begging me to call her father, or the ambulance. and of course physically assaulting me.her behavior is also such that she has become incredibly obsessive. touching things and naming them: ""eso is mi camisa"", ""this is from my daughter (when it isn't)"", etc. hitting her teeth and saying ""these are my teeth"". pulling her hair and saying ""agua, agua"". if i weren't actually living this nightmare, i would swear it was a bad impression of actual insanity.i've had to cancel her emergency appointment with her neurologist because i couldn't dare let her out of the house into a taxi in her state. he suggested i call emergency psychiatric services, but i dare not, because i don't know if here in south america what the hell they will do with her.tonight, it was the worst, i think. i put her to bed, and after i tucked her in, she looked at me with a most earnest gaze, and asked ""sos real?""**are you real?**my heart has been broken a score of times before. but with that question, it feels well and truly beyond repair."
m32ob3,"glad i found this group in addition to my regular virtual support group and occasional therapist telehealth visit. for about four years my adult kids and i have been dealing with my wife’s (their mother) clear cognitive issues, combines with an overwhelming denial and anger when trying to talk about it. refusing to see a doctor, even for other issues such as renewing a statin rx, or an unknown skin lesion. just a horrible situation that we’re all so sad (and of course frustrated and angry) about. don’t see any way out until the inevitable train wreck. our daughter even did an instagram live with a podcaster friend, that with her permission i shared with my wife. last night during a particularly stressed conversation, i did that, with poor results. a few friends have talked to me, but mostly to each other that i eventually hear about. new suggestions would be great, but mostly just to share. thanks"
t7ijbd,"idk if this is the right place to post this, but i’m done. i am a grand daughter who has been constantly abused, accused and not appreciated for almost 9 months caring for my gma. and i’m not sure if she is experiencing dementia but she has hallucinations, extreme anxiety, extreme, memory issues and paranoia plus more and i just can’t. not to mention she also is a narcissist on top of that so that’s been fun. i have tried to be patient, kind, understanding and accepting. it just makes me think back to this post i saw where this person was shaming family who left their elderly relatives behind and wouldn’t come see them anymore. some people are pure rotten, even in old age. i know my grandma could hide it well when she wanted. refuses to go to doc appts she previously agreed to, accused me of anything even if it doesn’t make sense. accuses me of not telling her information i have repeated many times. refuses to accept any responsibility if she is ever wrong. starts arguments on purpose when she is in a bad mood to release her own stress. gaslights me. and more. and i’m done, i have had it. i have gotten nothing in return for helping her and even tried to save her from family who were doing shady acts and/or trying to kill her off! all i’m saying is that it may be important to look at both sides of an issue before accusing family of neglect. maybe they tried everything. maybe that “nice old lady” you know was incredibly abusive in her youth and continues to be now. she has done it to almost every member who was actually being helpful but refuses to yell at those who openly tricked her or don’t try to help. sorry for the rant but i just had a breakdown."
r2c8b0,"my grandmother is 89 and has had dementia for several years now, issues first becoming apparent in late 2017.  all in all, she's had a relatively slow decline compared to some other people, so there is that to be thankful for.  the past 6-8 months though, things have been moving a bit quicker.  she still remembers who everyone is for the most part, but is going through periods of confusion, especially when sundowning.  starting around 6 months ago she started confusing my grandfather for her father late at night maybe once or twice a month, now it's 3 or 4 nights a week.  she's also imagining scenarios that never happened.  for instance, the other night my grandfather went to pick up takeout.  i stopped by the house, and she asked, ""do you know where papa is?""  i said he's picking up food.  she responded, ""not that papa, my father.  he was sleeping in the bedroom and next thing i know he wasn't there and his car is gone.""  my great-grandfather never lived with them, and has been dead for 25 years.  my mom and dad have been divorced for 20 years or so, but he still comes by holiday's usually.  he didn't eat at my house with us tonight because he was sick.  she asked about him, and when i said he was sick she said, ""oh is that why he rushed out of my house earlier?  he didn't even so goodbye.""it's just hard to deal with, holidays were always huge with my family, especially my grandparents.  it's definitely hitting me that this is the last year she's going to really know where she is and what's going on.  if she's even alive next year, as much as i hate to say that, she's 89 and it's a realistic possibility she won't be.  it's just rough.  and i admit i feel guilty because i snapped a few times tonight after being asked the same question 10 times.  i'm usually good with dealing with it, and rarely snap, but i had been up since 5am and cooked literally every dish and dessert for 8 people by myself."
kilvc8,"we only tell her that dad needs some tests in the hospital when she asks where he is. for the most part she just responds ""ok"". but last night and this morning she seems to remember that her husband has been out for several days already. not sure what else to do and how to tell her"

azwnr0,"looking for some advice. my father has memory issues from a tbi back in 2014, and his neurologist has been treating my father with a protocol similar to someone with dementia. in early january my mother passed away suddenly in her sleep, and she was the main care taker of my father so when she passed we had him temporarily move in with my wife and i until we could figure out a sustainable long term solution. every day while with us he would ask when my mother was coming home from the hospital... at first we would have the long, hard conversation that mom had passed away. he'd cry, be upset, etc. the next day he would again ask when my mother was coming home and if we could go visit her. after a week of the questions we started to play into his question and lie to him saying we spoke to her earlier, she'd be coming home soon, etc. this was on the advice of several people including my mother-in-law who works in a memory care unit. she said that if telling him the truth every time he asked was too hard for both him and myself then maybe it would be best to lie to him. fast forward to now - about 2+ weeks ago we moved him into a senior care center with a memory care unit. he's not a patient at the memory care unit, but they deal with dementia and alzheimer's patients and we feel like it's a good fit for now. almost immediately from when i left after moving him in he began calling my phone constantly asking if we could go see mom, when is she coming home, etc. then he started calling all the local hospitals, and in a panic called me asking what was going on and why couldn't he find mom. i drove over to the senior center and we had the long, hard talk again. he cried, got upset... the usual when we would have the conversations. but then the next day he remembered our conversation... and again he remembered the day after. we went out for dinner and he remembered 4 days after i told him. he would ask me what happened, how did she die... questions like that. i was so relieved that maybe things were getting better. then day 5 - he calls me and asks when mom is coming home again.   i'm basically at a loss. if i tell him the truth, he doesn't remember. if i lie, he calls me every 15 minutes asking when we can go visit, are there any updates on mom, etc. i haven't had more than 12 hours away from him to even begin grieving the loss of my mother, and i seriously don't know what to do anymore. last night i couldn't even go out to dinner with my wife for our anniversary without him calling me every 5 minutes. i had to turn my phone off - i felt so awful doing so but i'm at the point where if i don't shut it off i'm going to lose my phone. &amp;#x200b;has anyone dealt with some sort of similar situation and if so - do you have any advice? like i said - i'm at a complete loss at this point as to what i should do. i appreciate any and all help / advice. thanks."
b6fl2v,"as my title says, i am really really struggling to cope with what i feel like is the loss of my my grandma due to her severe dementia because really it's like she hasn't been alive for the last 5 years even though physically she is still alive. i'll try to give some background information but i really don't know a whole lot since my mom and aunt have been handling everything but my grandma is early 70s and i am currently 22 but was around 17 when i feel like i really lost her to her dementia. no one else in our family has experienced dementia or alzheimer's or anything similar let alone in their mid 60's so it was something that was totally out of left field and i never expected and i don't think i have really processed it until this year to be honest. i'm graduating university in june with two degrees (esl and spanish), getting married in august and moving out of state in september. i always looked up to her so much and she was such an amazing, strong, independent and progressive woman and it crushes me that she can't see who i am now because i think she would be so incredibly proud of me. all of this may seem sort of childish but it's really been weighing heavily for the last nine-ish months that even though she is still alive, she won't be at any of these events and even worse to me is that i can't even let her know about all these exciting things in my life because she has such severe dementia. i'm just incredibly sad because she has always no matter what been extremely proud of me and loved me so much that i just wish with all my heart she knew about what i'm doing. i feel like it would all be easier to cope with if she had passed five years ago because that's so final and you can carry out the grieving process and such but instead this feels like such a purgatory since i can visit her and talk to her and tell her everything that's happening but i know that she cannot understand and it breaks my heart because i love my grandma so so so much and it's so heartbreaking to see her like this and to not be able to tell her about everything happening in our lives because yes her body is still here and functioning to the best of it's ability but she herself as i'd always known her has been gone for five years. thank you so much if you read all this i just feel like i've really been bottling this up and am now coming to the realization of how much it has effected me and wanted to reach out to a community who has most likely struggled with the same feelings and am wondering how any of you got through it or if you're going it through it now even."
4s7paw,"i assume you all are far more educated on this than i am, i'm just trying to figure out how i should go about doing something.so my grandfather just died of cancer last night, but his wife (they still lived together) has pretty bad alzheimer's. he died right next to her and it's been about 20 hours now, but she still doesn't know. each time my mom or my dad has tried to tell her, she laughs and doesn't get it. she either thinks it's a joke or she says ""he just needs sleep.""do we just let her live in an ignorance is bliss scenario, or do we keep trying to tell her that her husband is dead? and if we do tell her, how should we go about doing that? a direct approach didn't seem very effective."
vq6hc3,"hello. my mother at 62 was diagnosed with vascular dementia last august. she is what is described as a long hauler. she had to quit her ebay business that she ran from home. fortunately she now receives social security. her primary caretakers are myself (her 30 year old lives at home son who works a 9-5 type office job) and my dad (who works at home for a call center job with some shifts starting at 3:45 am till 12:15 pm dealing with u.k. clients). we have gotten her on medication and vitamins. for the most part it hasn’t been horrible. she and my father are amazing and have done their best. recently though she has what she herself named “figments.” where when she looks at my dad. she doesn’t see my dad. it’s someone who looks like him. a brother sometimes. another person with the same name. not the father of her two kids. my dad would try holding her hand, looking at old photos, telling stories, showing her matching rings, but now she’s not believing him. she doesn’t mind these other people, but she’s afraid she’s hurting her husband by being with them, or upset when i call them dad. and so far much to my surprise the only one she’s been confused on is dadi hate to start my 1st post in this group with a question, but any tips or strategies to help any of us would be appreciated. thanks"
ke158s,"i don't know if this is the best place to post here, but i have never dealt with dementia before and i have no idea what to do. i seem to be one of the only ones aware of what's going on with her, but i don't know how to help her, or even if i can at this point in time. my grandma has been acting very rude and strange lately, and her facebook posts have been getting more and more incoherent. she has always been politically minded, but she used to be coherent and mindful of people's different perspectives.  i have been avoiding her for the most part because we don't really click well to begin with, but i checked my emails and noticed she has been sending me strange political conspiracy nonsense in all caps lock (which is very unlike her). it's not even the usual q-anon conspiracies we are all likely familiar with, although i think she has been influenced by that, it's a mix of her own strange delusional thoughts. if she were around my age, i'd honestly think she was a disorganized schizophrenic. her typing is starting to remind me of my own mental illness. of course, this led to an argument because i thought it was very distasteful of her to bombard my emails (and my facebook too) with such presumptuous, inflammatory nonsense. it led to a number of other things, basically her saying vague statements throughout that had no relevance whatsoever to the conversation and didn't prove any points she so adamantly insisted on having. she also wasn't respectful of me saying that i don't appreciate having political or religious talk shoved down my throat like that, i would rather talk about other things because i don't agree with any of her points. she dismissed all that and made it out like it was my fault for being not being receptive, but she's always been a narcissist, making everything about her.  she used to be more socially aware though. she had the nerve to tell me i'm not mentally ill (i'm on the schizophrenic spectrum!) and it hurt my feelings so bad i lashed out at her pretty sharply. but then i reflected on our argument and realized that she is tangential (worse than me), incoherent and is rapidly losing her sharpness. sadly, she doesn't believe that mental health is a real thing so i unfortunately think she's in total denial for now. it's still early in the symptomatic stage and i don't want to assume that it's dementia when it could be other things, but she is reluctant about getting help. i can't even use my schizophrenia as a coaxing mechanism (""see grandma, i got help"") because she does not believe that i am mentally ill.what is strange is that my father is a low functioning schizophrenic, and when she was younger she was willing to call the mental institution and get him help multiple times, so she recognized he was crazy, though she always dismissed psychology as a subject and said it ""wasn't a science"" (rolls eyes). i know dementia is a brain disease and not exactly a mental disorder, but her lack of insight into any mental health issues is allowing her to be cognitively dissonant and in complete denial that she needs help herself. i know after reading through the symptoms of dementia that no matter what happens, i need to understand her point of view and understand that it is her brain malfunctioning, it's not her will to behave like this. that being said, it is very hurtful because it puts my mental health at a serious compromise.  i'm not exactly known for being emotionally fluent and supportive myself, especially when i feel like i'm blatantly being disrespected. we have always had different opinions on politics and religion and her randomly, sporadically lashing out disturbing nonsense at me is terrifying, and triggering me to have positive symptoms. it reminds me of how my dad verbally abused me during his schizophrenic episodes; i now need therapy again and have been disassociating something awful. it reminds me of my own mental illness, but at least i have the self awareness to know something is wrong with me, and to try to be nice and respectful in spite of it. i'm worried the rest of our family won't catch on until it's too late because many of them are in denial of mental illness and even 'like' some of her word salad posts. to be fair, she has always been abrasive and opinionated, so it's not like a completely new personality, just her behaving and saying strange things. she also used to respect science and health experts but of course covid19 changed all of that. she keeps calling it the ""flu"". i explained multiple times this isn't the same viral strain as the flu - it's as if she's not capable of taking in new information. she also started talking about sex extremely graphically around an 8 year old girl doing homework the other day, which is completely unlike her. she would have never done that around me or my friends when we were 13, let alone 8. the girls stepdad snapped at her and told her to stop.anyways, i know i'm not the best person to be her caregiver considering with her (potential) dementia and my schizophrenia, we are both so blatantly honest towards each other in rude ways. it just doesn't work. i'm trying to get other family members to keep an eye on her and i will do a welfare check on her if i have to, but i honestly don't know what else to do. i can't live with her, last time i did i was running naked in the woods because i thought the planes in the sky were government drones she was using to spy on me; that's how much she makes me nuts. i love her because she's my grandmother, but, damn me, i just don't have much respect for her as a person. but i still want her to get the help she needs despite everything. and yes, i have told her i think she has dementia though i wasn't polite about it, i was still hurt at her dismissing my schizophrenia and i don't know if i can forgive her for that. of course everything i say is one ear out the other. she's still driving and shopping and stuff, and she has a husband but he's slowly dying of diabetes, and he's just as ignorant as she is in a lot of ways so he is no help. neither is my schizophrenic dad, hence my need to potentially call a welfare check on her.   sigh.if anybody has any suggestions, i would greatly appreciate it - and i'm sorry for rambling."
esgk15,"i am the only support for my 77 yo widowed mother who has moderate dementia.  she is in assisted living (not memory care yet) but lives 10 hours away from me.  she has a handful of local friends and relatives but all are even older than her and have their own medical issues.  none can help in any way other than occasional social interaction.  this means i am attempting to manage all things including finances, legal, medical, etc...., for her from afar.  while i love her, we have never been close.  there is no bad blood, we are just very different people and she has ""disapproved of my lifestyle"" ever since i became an adult and left home 27 years ago.  until i was alerted by her panicking financial advisor that she was nearly broke 1.5 years ago, i had very little involvement with her life....which suited both of us just fine.  we perhaps talked on the phone once every 6 weeks or so and i would visit for 2-3 days once a year.  she has never had any interest in her grandchildren and could not have said what my husband or i do for a living at any point in my adult life.  after the alert from the financial advisor, i uncovered all kinds of ways mom was no longer able to manage herself, including runaway type ii diabetes, months of backed rent, driving without car insurance, pets that were in dire need of medical attention, hoarding, improperly managed meds, bounced checks and late fees all over the place, etc.... that she was unable to manage due to poor cognitive functioning.  so, a lot has happened in the last year.  i finally have a handle on most things financial/legal/medical.  now i am grappling with some secondary issues.  the most pressing being her anger towards me.  i could use some tips on how to ""enter her world"" when she is agitated on the phone.at least once a week and sometimes multiple times a day, she will call me (or my husband) about one very specific topic.  she only calls either of us when she is upset about this.  but even when i call her, the conversation often goes to this topic immediately:  ""everyone thinks i am too stupid to manage my own (fill in the blank here...finances, medical appointments, meds, meals, etc.....).""  she will go on to insist that she was managing just fine until i stepped in and that my involvement is unnecessary (not true). that she never agreed to my involvement (not true, she had the dpoa drafted without my knowledge).  that i am not managing her affairs properly (she believes this to be true because she accidentally reprograms her tv and then thinks i failed to pay the cable bill).  sometimes she will rant elaborate stories about how she selected and moved to her facility all on her own (not even a little bit true) so there is no reason for me to be involved.  she worries i am going to come take her car next (that is true but we have never discussed it).  she feels she is being treated very poorly and tells me she certainly hopes my child does not treat me this way in the future or hopes i am not treating mil this way.  once we are there, i cannot get in a single word.  i never react with anger....but even if i was inclined to, i simply cannot get a single word in anyway.  she gets more and more upset until she either hangs up on me or tells me she hates me and then hangs up on me.  these rants typically go on for 10-20 minutes non-stop.  once it was so bad and vicious that the director of the facility overheard and called me after she hung up to try and console me.  this has been going on for about 9 months.  i try not to take it personally but it does upset me....taking care of her affairs has created so much anxiety that it has (temporarily, i hope) wrecked my life....so getting this abuse on top of that is a hard pill to swallow even if i know it is the illness talking.  and obviously, she is upset too.  and from a  practical standpoint, i cannot get or give any information during calls when this happens.  i am her dpoa but not her guardian so she can and does still make many of her own decisions....which often requires communication between us.my sister, who lives even further away reports that mom rants these same things (about me) to her too.  mom does not get upset with/at my sister.  they have always had a much closer relationship and my sister is not the one doing any of these things.  so at least mom has one ""safe"" loved one to talk to.  i have started letting all of mom's calls go to vm and i don't call back aside from the very rare times there is a legit reason for the call.  but i still need to be able to call her to get business done and to check in.  any ideas on how to redirect or ""enter her world"" to set a new call in the right direction?  there are countless other things that upset her but they are far easier for me to empathize and redirect.  but since these are really about me, or more specifically my involvement in her life, i am at a loss."

ltrj9h,"does the awareness of having dementia stop?i'd say our loved one with dementia is mid stage, maybe getting into stage 6. her husband is the care giver. i can't say for sure which stage, i am sure behind doors she is unfornately worse. she has lewy body, seems to change rapidly. lots of delusions. mood swings, high anxiety, no short term memory, lost the ability to do tasks, sundowners. she's aware enough to know she has dementia, avoids family members because she is embarrassed of how she behaves or can't do tasks. does that awareness fade?i have tried to talk to her about, say she can tell me anything, we support her, she says she is fine and changes the topic. i was hoping making her feel comfortable and supported, she doesn't have to hide. she wants to pretend she doesn't have dementia, i have to respect that. she isolates herself, makes up excuses to why she can't visit or have visits. her husband has told us about her diagnosis, we all play along as if its not noticable to keep her happy. my husband misses her, she is his mother. how long could this avoiding us go on for?"

2ighzx,"i'm hoping someone can offer advice.  my grandfather died about 10 days ago (age 94).  my grandmother (age 92) has a metric ton of loving family members around her constantly and will until her passing.  she's being well taken care of.  the thing is, like clockwork, every 10-15 minutes, she asks where her husband is.  someone says, ""he passed away, grandma.  we went to his funeral yesterday.""  her response ranges anywhere from sadness to indignation that no one has told her and ""why didn't i get to go to the funeral?""  (of course, she did.  the marines handed her the flag that is sitting on the desk beside her.) anyway, i like to solve problems.  i'm here, hopefully, to find out if this was a good idea or a horrible idea.  i thought that it might be a good idea to sit down at the table with her and my dad and my sister and laminate all of the sympathy cards and related things and put them into a notebook that she cold look through.  i asked her if she wanted to do this ""project"" together and she thought it was a great idea.  so, we all sat down and did it and she was the one tasked with actually adding the sheets to the notebook.i also wrote a note and added it to the begining that said [paraphrasing], &gt;dear grandma,  it is ok to not remember.  as you go through this notebook, &gt;think about all the people that love and care for you.  grandpa has passed &gt;away.  it's ok to not remember, but he had no doubt that you loved him. &gt;love, j3r3meso, throughout the day, she would pick up the notebook and she would stop at my note and to herself say, ""grandpa has passed away"" like it was news.the upside is that she isn't actually asking people as often.  so, it's reducing the level of frustration with some members of the family that have less patience than others.  somehow, i think she actually knows what is inside the notebook and she's going there to remember.  i just don't know if this is a bad idea and causing more or less suffering or what would cause the least suffering.any educated insight (whether through training or through experience) would be appreciated.  any resources would be appreciated.**tl;dr:  is it a bad idea to constantly remind my grandmother that her husband has passed away?""**"
oxsugu,"disclaimer that i do not know a lot about dementia and i have been fortunate not to have anyone close to me suffer from it. i would love any education or resources on the subject i’m about to discuss, thank you! i have a neighbor with dementia. she lives completely alone in the house next door and was never married and never had kids. sometimes caretakers come by but they aren’t there 24/7. her extended family seems to have estranged her, or they don’t live anywhere nearby; regardless, i firmly believe they aren’t really trying to give her the support she needs, but that isn’t really my business. the matter which concerns me is that when she’s alone, she screams constantly. she sounds like she’s being tortured, brutally murdered, you name it—and this screaming goes on for hours and hours, sometimes all night long. she says things like “no, no, please!” and “thats everything i have!” or “please get out!”, “please help me!” her screaming is bloodcurdling and it disturbs the entire neighborhood, particularly my family, because she truly sounds like she’s in pure agony (and i know she might be). none of the neighborhood seems sure what to do about it, because no one really knows her personally, but it’s really difficult to just go about our lives while it sounds like someone is being constantly tortured a few doors down. i feel awful. she’s been my neighbor ever since i was little and the only time she interacted with me was to tell me not to park in front of her house, so i can’t imagine she built a good rapport with many of our other neighbors either. but i still feel bad hearing her go through this, and on another hand it is not sustainable to deal with this type of disturbance every night when we’re trying to rest, etc. so what can i do or who can i call in a situation like this, to come help her and try to calm her down?i’m a black woman and i’m incredibly reserved about calling the police into my neighborhood, especially in a nonviolent situation like this, so would prefer not to have to do something like that. it’s also already been done before but didn’t seem to be of much help. thanks!"
gtj2bm,"i hope this is allowed here. i have been reading for a few weeks and the posts are helpful.i just snapped. i was doing things in the house and she sent a person that was coming to buy things away.  it wasn’t her fault, but i lost it on her because while she is forgetful, she also just doesn’t have any sense...like at all. (note: she is pretty early dementia)it made me realize my real problem. i don’t think we can care for her because, i don’t like her. she has done some really hurtful things to my husband, her husband, me, really everyone and i have not really forgiven her. i really resent her and all her bad choices. she now doesn’t have any other options and this is just leaving us stuck.  i am so freaking mad at the situation and i finally just snapped for a dumb reason. anyone else in this same boat? anyone else caring for someone they have unresolved issues with? how do i get over this? i feel really angry all the time and i know it is effecting her too. i can’t put my husband in the middle or make this any harder on him either."
d5rkt8,"my mom (mid 70’s) has the beginning symptoms of dementia. my father, sibling, and i all agree, but her doctor claims she’s fine. and she thinks she’s fine, so we’re getting nowhere with a diagnosis. i feel like i’ve had to start going behind her back to keep her safe or patch things up with her friends. she gets into arguments because she can’t remember things. she’s always been the type to start long, drawn-out feuds over with friends and family, and it’s gotten worse as the dementia symptoms started. so i’ve started calling her friends and telling them about her dementia whenever she tells me another “lee’s not talking to me, and i don’t know why” story. not so they’ll let her off the hook entirely, but so they’ll understand why she’s changed. she also has a type of heart disease, and is seeing a different cardiologist. after she mentioned the upcoming appointment i felt like a secret agent getting the doctor’s name out of her, then calling his office the next day to let him know, so that he can suggest that my father attend the appointment. otherwise she’ll only hear what she wants to and ignore all his advice because she’s scared of the tests she needs. my father’s not a pushy guy, and just wants to let her do what she wants. he has the right to make that decision, but watching this play out is both heart-wrenching and frustrating. he’s willing to let me go behind her back, telling friends and talking to doctors-i think because he doesn’t want to be the bad guy. my sibling agrees with what i’m doing, but their spouse is also very sick and they just don’t have the time to help deal with this. i know i’m lucky that my mom made it to 70 before the onset of her dementia, that my dad can, and wants to, take care of her, and that i have a sibling to vent to, who helps with local stuff when they can (i live across the country from them). but this all still really sucks."

b2uk7d,"hello all,newbie here, and this is my story. i (25m) live with my grandmother (65f), who at the same time, is a parent to me as i have been living with her since birth. over the past five years or so, she has slowly been experiencing cognitive decline. her memory is foggy, she forgets where she places things, forgets what day/time/month/year it is (and is constantly asking me what day it is etc), and suffers from symptoms of paranoia regarding theft of possessions and things of that nature. the reason i am posting here is because, about a month ago, she remarked to me how she wanted to go see her sister (who, for context, lives 2000 miles away) and how we had already seen her that past weekend. when i told her that was not the case, she flipped and got argumentative with me, so i dropped it. i try to explain in succinct and helpful ways about things etc when she asks, but to no avail. most of our conversations either begin with her yelling at me, getting mad at me for being so ""abrasive"" towards her, or end with her telling me to shut the hell up (or bringing up past transgressions i have made against her in the past). it seems that she is extremely distrustful of me because of these past issues, and as a result, she seems to believe she is fine. however, i have talked with her sister, as well as her counselor and medication prescriber about these issues, and they agree that it is not a psychosis, but appears to be dementia. she also has trouble taking medication properly (she takes more than the prescribed amount and often runs out before she should).however, my grandmother firmly and adamantly believes that ""she is not that bad"" and that ""it's just adhd""... furthermore, a neurologist who she saw a few months ago suggested a neuropsychological examination to be done, both in order to determine what is going on, and also have a more broad picture of the underlying issues... i just do not know what to do anymore, and it's gotten to the point where her providers are asking me to look after everything for her. and remembering my own issues or appointments etc, on top of her stuff is becoming frustrating, unbearable, and exhausting... i do not have poa or anything of the sort, but her medication prescriber has mentioned to me that we should look into getting that set up.. i just don't know where to turn, what to do, or how to proceed because she fights me and her doctors at every fucking turn... because of this not knowing, i have begun to just give up on helping her and have developed an apathy towards her issues, but at the same time, i want to help her... i just don't know how... (to add, she is eligible for medicare in two months, but does not qualify for medicaid, so i don't know where i stand with long term care options, nor whether or not i can have her admitted locally for this issue if i am concerned for her safety since i don't have poa or anything)... any help?thanks"

hob2ax,"first off let me start off by saying i am no stranger to dementia or alzheimer's.  my mom's sister died of early onset alzheimer's at age 56. (she was diagnosed at 50), and we watched as the disease swiftly took her and although it was 19 years ago, i have never forgotten.  now my mil, who is 86, was just brought home to die on july 6th.  that was her final wish.  she wanted to die at home.  she is currently in the final stages and i am all too familiar with what that looks like.  my husband however, is not.  so i calmly show him to look for facial expressions and respond to them in a way that you are somehow able to communicate with her  and how she searches you with her eyes.  but she can barely talk.  she mouths ""yes"" when you ask her something, but other than that, she says nothing.  however, if you say something to her, and you ask ""if you understand, squeeze my hand"".  she will squeeze your hand! repeatedly.  she doesn't grip it, she squeezes on and off on and off.i want to believe she is still in there somewhere knowing we are there.  i also played some music for her. when i played some music that she knew from back home in europe, she blinked her eyes, and looked directly at me and they lit right up.  but then it was like she was gone again when her eyes drifted off somewhere else.  i can't bare to see my husband as he watched his last living parent die of such a horrific disease.  i know what the disease does and i know what it looks like, but i can't relate to him, as it was never a parent i have lost but only a relative (who for all intents and purposes i was extremely close to).i just need some support on how to help him start to accept and get used to how she is at this point in time and this is how it's gonna look like as she transitions into the death stage.  she is currently only sipping water from a tiny sponge and eating baby food.  her eating or drinking has not stopped yet.i am just grasping at straws here.  i found this sub in hopes i could just let my feelings out. thanks for listening."

kbtzmt,"original post [here](first off, thank you so much for the advice. it definitely made us feel better about our decision to not tell her. so we decided not to tell her but to celebrate her brother today at the same time as the funeral. i was unable to be with her because i’ve developed a cough and didn’t want to risk spreading something to her. my parents made her favorite childhood breakfast and sweets this morning. we all shared stories of him and just facetimed each other. my grandmother said mine and my brothers name for the first time in 6 months when she saw us on the phone. we noticed my grandmother was using past tense whenever she referred to her brother. towards the end of brunch she said “my brothers dead. he died a few days ago.” she went back to her cookie and acted like nothing happened. she just seemed to know something happened to him and could feel that he wasn’t there anymore. again thanks for all the advice. sorry for any typos or rambling. i’m sick and it’s been emotional week. i’ve lost two family members and have a third on life support right now."
c63vlr,"hi there, my grandfather was recently admitted to a care facility but he has had dementia for a while. my mum calls him every day and visits as often as she can (it's in a different city from where she lives) and she called me yesterday to vent a bit. basically he started asking about his parents (he's 91 btw) and she feels bad having to tell him they've been dead for a while. i suggested she just played along and tells him they're fine or something, but i'm not sure if this is the right way to go. do you play along with their world or do you try to correct them? she also said there are theories that when dementia patients start talking about dead relatives it means they will be joining them soon, which upsets her of course. he also repeats himself a lot (i've heard his childhood story at least 50 times) but we managed to get through it just by listening. any advice on answering his questions would be really good though. thanks!"
o7yelw,"my family has been watching my mom degenerate for the last couple of years. my dad took her to the hospital yesterday for fainting spells and the doctor admitted her because she fainted while she was there. she’s been in since and is now blowing things out of proportion, saying that everyone is yelling at her. i had to actually block her from texting or calling me because she keeps claiming the other patient in the room is yelling now and i can’t say anything to convince her she’s safe. (she had childhood trauma she’s buried for decades.) i personally think she’s acting out because she knows when they run tests they’re going to see her dementia symptoms, so i don’t blame her for being scared, but this has to happen. i can’t even visit her in the hospital because of covid where we live. just dealing with grown daughter guilt right now. :-("

j8tif8,"ok, so my dad (m88) was diagnosed a couple of months ago. vascular dementia, after numerous strokes &amp; tias. he became impossible to care for at home. he has type 2 diabetes, and this has damaged his gut to the point where it gets backed up. basically he couldn't get to the loo in time, shat everywhere. they tried everything, adult diapers, all that, no good. so now he's in a care home, and my mum had basically done her grieving, figured the man she married was long gone. now the care home are sending her video messages of him holding up a banner saying ""i love you"". she's in tears, i'm in tears too. i don't want to abandon him if he's still in there, he's not dead yet, but i don't want her to be suffering either, if they're making him do this &amp; he has no idea what he's being made to do. the damned place never answers their phone, either. what to do?"
khy22c,"my mother lives with me and today she was telling me that she felt off, couldn't focus or concentrate, like she was in a tunnel. i told her that she needed to rest, but she insisted on prepping for dinner. i went to continue my work. when she was done she said she was taking a break in her room &amp; was going to call her mom to see how she was doing. i was hoping she misspoke because my grandmother has been gone for 3 years now.  about 10 minutes later i get a text from her (something we usually do). she asked if i had my grandmother's phone number because she couldnt find it. i immediately got my son to help me check on her. she seemed perfectly fine, with the exception of thinking grandmother was still alive. as soon as we told her grandmother was gone, she immediately broke down, sobbing like i've never seen. for about 30 minutes we explained to her not only where grandmother was, but where she was, why and when. at times acting so vulnerable/young, still crying. i've never seen her like this. we convinced her to lay down and rest. about 30 minutes, maybe more, she came out with christmas gifts she had wrapped yesterday, and put them under the tree. like it had never happened. i haven't brought it up yet, not sure that i should. should we have told her about grandma, or just wait til this passed? should i tell her what happened?also, she has had headaches this evening. i'm wondering if we should take her to the hospital. my grandmother had dementia, but in her late 90's. mom is 68."
dphy6x,"went to see my great-grandma the other day. she’s practically suicidal at this point and definitely on her way out. she refuses to eat or drink much of anything, but she managed to drink a small cup of tea while we were there. my grandma managed to get her attention long enough to show her a video of her great-great-grandson, but it didn’t really mean much to her. she doesn’t know any of us anymore. she’d been calling me sarah for years, but now she doesn’t address me, period, or any of us for that matter. my grandma asked if she was ready to see grandpa and jesus. she said nothing, but nodded slowly. when we left, my grandpa said it was time for us to go home. she said two words, the only time she spoke while we were there: “me too.” my grandma went to pre-plan the funeral today. we don’t know if it’ll be a month, a few months, or a year."
a2esvl,"my mom has suddenly become convinced that her grandfather is dying and she needs to fly across the country to see him one last time. the thing is, he's been dead for over 50 years. usually i just go along with her delusions, but this one requires impossible action. i tried telling her that he was already gone, and reminding her that he asked her to come visit just before he died, and she did. for a second there was a flicker of recognition (she's been strangely obsessed with that story for the past year or so, telling it over and over) but then she doubled back down. i even tried pointing out that he would have to be about 120 years old by now. she laughed, obviously recognizing the ridiculousness of thr idea, but then went back to insisting she has to go see him.i hugged her and told her i loved her, but i don't know  how to do that since i don't know where he is. i don't know what else to tell her. ideas?"
dcmj8m,"my grandma has mild dementia. her son, my uncle, recently passed away due to an unforeseen circumstance. i don't want to get too in depth about it but, my uncle has not kept in much touch with my family, we have a bit of a dysfunctional family. we got notified from the hospital that he passed. my parents do not want to tell my grandma because they think it'll put her health at risk (i.e. faint, depression, etc.) and potentially even lead to her death. i understand where they are coming from but, i think its right for her to know. how should my family approach about this, should we really just keep it a secret and not let her come to the funeral or something?"
dcmmh0,"my grandma has mild dementia. her son, my uncle, recently passed away due to an unforeseen circumstance. i don't want to get too in depth about it but, my uncle has not kept in much touch with my family, we have a bit of a family drama/dysfunctional family; we got notified from the hospital that he passed. rest of my family doesn't want to tell my grandma because they think it'll put her health at risk (i.e. faint, depression, etc.) and potentially even lead to her death. i understand where they are coming from but, i think it's right for her to know. how should my family approach about this, should we really just keep it a secret and not let her come to the funeral or something? if we do tell her, how can we tell her in a manner that will not have a drastic affect?"
rb1p5o,"tldr: neighbor has taken power of attorney from family friend, is stealing from her, gave her covid, and has turned her against usfor close to 20 years the family has watched after our elderly neighbor, who has no living family.let's call her beth. we've taken her meals 4-5 nights a week (thousands of meals in total), took care of her yard, and countless other small things. since she's gotten older we have checked on her every single day for years. she's considered part of the family, and is very loved. mom considers her like a second mother. my brother (before he moved to college) used to go over 2-3 evenings a week and talk with her for hours.she's been having memory trouble for a couple of years, but starting about 3 months ago she started thinking someone was breaking in at night and moving things around, and that she's being watched through her tv.another neighbor (courtney, whom beth has never liked), started telling beth her suspicions were true. ""someone is breaking in at night"", ""someone is watching you through your tv"", etc.about 6 weeks ago beth lost an envelope with some money in it. not sure how much, but probably not a lot. courtney blamed a member of our family for taking it, and beth believed her. i personally believe courtney took it. you don't know our family, but the person courtney blamed is an absolute pure soul. she could never harm anyone.since then beth hasn't spoke to anyone in the family. she won't answer the phone or the door.a week ago there was an ambulance at beth's house. we didn't know what was going on until this morning.turns out courtney carried covid in on beth, and beth has been in the hospital since. additionally, beth is on a low sodium diet, and we've found out that courtney has been feeding her fast food everyday, and that beth's legs are badly swollen from fluid retention (which has never been a problem).it also turns out that courtney has beth's power of attorney, which we found out from another neighbor.we're sure that courtney is stealing from beth (and blaming us the whole time). she also has no regard for beth's mental or physical health.this is a terrible situation, which has caused us much pain. i'm not as close to beth as other members of the family, but putting this into words brought tears to my eyes.what do we need to take to the police to have courtney taken out of the picture, and how can we get beth help?any help is greatly appreciated."
hrq19m,"mom (88) has been in a memory care facility for just under a month. from what my brother (the hardass poa) is saying about her most recent pcp visit, she's probably never coming home again.  i asked him what he tells her when she asks when she's coming home,  and he went on a long blaming rant rather than answer the question so i don't know that we'll ever be on the same page.it seems cruel to keep stringing her along with ""we'll see what the doctors say next week/next month"" and ""of course i'll take care of you when you come home"".  she knows where she is; she used to have hospice clients there.  i""m really struggling with how to respond to her questions, while she still has enough awareness to grasp the truth of the situation.how do you decide?"
pf1194,"i can't say for certain but i'm pretty sure my grandma has some form of dementia. she's 86 and doesn't have very good vision so she keeps seeing things, she says to be quiet because her mother is sleeping or that she can't go to her bed cuz her mom is there even though her mother has been dead for decades, she keeps mixing me up with my uncle and dad. she keeps seeing more kids and just all-around things that aren't real.  whenever she does something like this i usually try to answer very vaguely like when she talks about her mother i just say she's not here and don't mention that she's dead. i only start arguing that she's getting something wrong when she does things like tries to go home at 12 pm when she is at the only home we have, or when she stays up at 1 am waiting for the burial of her parents. so i wanted to ask, should i keep being vague about things or should i disagree and try to explain that she's seeing things or getting them wrong?"
c98t5q,"i have been a caretaker for my grandma who has been diagnosed with dementia, but is pretty lucid. normally she's very alert and the only memory problems she has are remembering names or she might ask you the same question a couple times in a row. two days ago her daughter (my mother) passed away. we told her, of course. she hadn't seen my mom in several moths because she is also bedridden and my mom lived in the nursing home and wasn't mobile. ever since we told her, approximately every 5-10 minutes or so she asks whoever is in the room with her (almost always me) ""where's my child?"" i don't think it's that she doesn't remember because instead of answering ""she's in heaven"" i ask ""where do you think she is?"" and she says ""heaven"". does anyone have any idea why/what she's actually asking? and what should i answer? i feel so selfish for getting annoyed with her, but it's driving me absolutely crazy."
re12os,my dad is out of town. she keeps forgetting and asking me where he is all the time. so i just started telling her that he’s out with his friends and he’s coming back later. my siblings thought i was being insensitive but she literally keeps forgetting everything so i don’t see how that can be harmful.
m1gigg,"going by this chart:my grandmother is currently between stage 3 or 4.  i'd say she's been at stage 3 for about the past three years now, but in the last year she's moved closer to stage 4.  can't say she's 100% there yet, but getting close.  in the past few months though, she's started to have 1-2 much more severe episodes, that last anywhere from minutes to hours.  for example, last month she got into an argument with my grandfather when they were alone.  she says to him, ""i can solve this right now!""  she then proceeds walk into the next room, and start calling my grandfather's name and asking him to come settle an argument she's having with someone.....another example would be today.  i gave her and my grandfather a ride to get their vaccination.  for the entire 30 minutes, she thought i was her brother.  she called me by his name, asked me questions as if i were him, asked about ""our"" sister, brought up a story about ""our"" dad.  this is the first time anything like this has happened, i didn't really know how to respond, and didn't want to get her worked up before her appointment.  i just told her i didn't want to talk much because there was a lot of traffic.  now, i see her seven days a week.  she has never once, ever, not known who i was.  and like i said, these incidents are rare, only once or twice a month, and started back in maybe nov/dec.  98% of the time, her symptoms put her around stage 3/4.  i know this disease is different for everyone and hard to predict how it will advance, but has anyone else experienced something similar?  is this kind of typical....happens once in a while for people around her stage.....or is this a bad sign that the disease is going to pick up pace and she might start to decline very quickly?"
opk55k,"mom died last thursday. she fell in her memory care home and broke her hip the week before. she had surgery to fix the hip but never made out of icu/recovery. for now, i'm just glad that she's next to me here in the airport. i can actually care for her now. i'm taking her home to my place. she'll be safe there. i cannot fathom the idea of leaving her in some hole in a concrete wall. i'm focusing on making it through the next few hours only. lot's of time for crying and reconsiling the overwhelming and unexpected guilt. for now, i'm keeping her safe."
knewvq,"i don't know how often this was posted before, but even if it is twice a day i still feel i need to tell it to everyone that could use it.to set the story:although corona is pretty big right now we sat together at christmas with my grandma, who was pretty far into her dementia. sentences were never complete and most of the stings of words she could manage were just gibberish. she still lived in her own home, but hat a caretaker that was there 24/7well, christmas eve rolled around and after dinner we sat around the christmas tree and as per tradition we played the ildes christmas music we could get our hands on.and as the music set in i could se my grandma just lit up. her eyes open and slowly swinging with the music. after a while she started to tell story's of long ago from times she forgot moths or even years ago. times when she was a young teenager. it held on for quite a while. she wasn't magically cured, but she woke up to an extend even her best days didn't reach in months. yesterday she passed away. the last 3 days she was already completely gone, bearly breathing and none responsive. this evening was the last time i saw the person she really was, with her wit and humor. although i'm an atheist and stopped believing in santa claus long ago, this was a real christmas miracle for me and the best gift i could have received.music is just unbelievably powerful and can do things far beyond my understanding."
mlfxh8,"my mom is 71 and this past year her memory, ability to comprehend things, and speech has been getting worse. i thought about how it might be because she lives alone in her apartment (recently downsized right before covid hit last year) and so her social skills aren’t what they use to be. she gets very confused, he forgotten my name and my son’s name (he’s 8 months). she will brush all this off. her fear is going to a “nut house” as she calls it since her mother went to one when my mom was a child. so lately she’s been texting nonstop things that don’t make sense. her sentence structure just doesn’t make sense and when you talk to her, she leaves out the big points and seems to focus on little details, it’s very hard to have a conversation with her. she also thinks she’s going to get kicked out of her apartment, which is for senior citizens. the other day she asked mgmt if she could watch the lobby tv and they said no. it’s not really intended for personal use. so she goes to her apartment and calls me saying she’s going to get kicked out and she’s in trouble over it. things like this will happen several times a week. she broke her tv awhile ago and it won’t work now. she furniture around and broke her bed doing so. i can’t really do much to help right now since i’m working from home full time with a baby about 30 minutes away, but it’s like she doesn’t get that. we’re waiting on scan results next week to see what it could be. in the meantime, she texts me throughout the day and night and it’s driving me crazy."

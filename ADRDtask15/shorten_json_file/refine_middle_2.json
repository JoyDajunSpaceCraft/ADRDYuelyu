jumbled and horrendous but over the course of time i was able to fix it up and even aced several times to be considered somewhat of a prodigy in my school and then there was the fact that my intrigues

english along with my completely westernized upbringing given my father made me an oddity in my indian school where i experienced severe bullying for a long tenure of time without any particular individual whom i could call as a \"friend\" well that was until i graduated to highschool and made some friends at the age of 17 but as ill fate would have one of my friends passed away from dengue ...after that college disappointed me severely as everyone there below subpar with the sole exception of maybe a single bloke i befriended along with a single teacher back at that time i started to plan for immigration and dropped out because of some complications then due to some problems i couldn't immigrate and the covid lockdowns ensued shortly , nevertheless i was severely depressed and almost was simply existing if anything until i found about scp and other overpowered fictional verses which i used as a means of getting out of my stultified tenor ...i would also like to bring into

myself under different contexts repeatedly using different dialects and accents to keep my vocabulary and lexicon reet and honed , i even used to think about how it would be if i was in some other countries which i had not visited yet ( these helped me to write a lot of stuff as i used to write stories a lot if anything ) moving on , i never was under any form of delusion or such actually , if

immediately assumed and imagined my minor gastritis as a potential stomach cancer ...after ig healed off with the aid of homeopathic medicines from a local scottish doctor , i was under the impression that i had brain cancer back in 2019 whilst i was immigrating and that was due to a migraine most probably as i am quite inclined to register , nevertheless i was absolutely petrified and used to cry

a simple canker sore on my tongue .", "now ..on 26th september i was having some problems falling asleep for a few days and decided to google my symptoms ( the worst mistake that i ever did ) and it showed me about prion diseases especially sfi and scjd these absolutely terrified me on spot and i started to cry...for the next few days i was having severe panic attacks , heart palpitations , muscle twitches and even memory problems and such i was having severe problems falling asleep but because of the aid my family ( my parents ridiculed me but my uncle's family was extremely supportive to say the least ) provided i was finally able to curb that thought away a few days ago and returned to a normal sleeping pattern , now ...my problem started eversince i was under the impression that i had a prion disease ...i was having severe problems whilst reading ( mostly missing out words and re reading once to grasp the gist of the sentence or paragraph ) these where actually symptoms of sfi apparently which scared me as well ( note that this never happened before this or even if it happened it wasn't that prominent at all ) so i left it out but even then after my sleep improved when the said problem was persisting i just had to google it again and i found out about all different types of dementias and especially ftds ....this scared the fuck out of me since it matches my symptoms no one in my family ever had any form of dementia except maybe my grandmother who was already 97 years old .", "but it never even bothered me as i still was able to learn and store multiple informations in my mind ( i literally debated scp in different branches with different languages  ) but since a few months i was forgetting some old knowledge ( which could very well be because there is literally an endless amount of info whilst it comes to scp ) and had troubles recalling and mispronouncing names...this scared me especially when i learned about ftd , even now i'm still able to remember new info and even have a perfectly working short term and working memory to the point that i can remember the conversation of bystanders i heard on the pavement or similar , also i have developed severe short sightedness in my left eye which i discovered on 28th september , i also had some episodes of hypnogogaic hallucinations where i used to see grotesque images or dream like sequences whilst falling asleep along with spasms and twitches ...it is also to be brought into attention the fact that i had a lot of hypnic jerks way before the problems started months ago and i always have had sleeping problems where even a single day of allnighter ( back even a year ago it was extremely rare ) would literally cause a nigh mental breakdown if anything .", "i noticed that i am extremely emotionally expressive and pessimistic if anything eversince the lockdown but with the smallest hint of reassurance i can literally do a 360 and become quite headstrong until another depressive issue grips me in it's throes ( which is mostly caused by a tertiary causes like quarrels amongst my parents or other family members , seeing my former classmates , financial woes or something similar ) i get extremely gutted and dour sometimes even having severe problems to fall asleep .", "now in the context of anxiety apart from the aforementioned instance where i already stated my worries about my father...ever since the lock down i literally haven't went outside other than to fetch groceries or stuff like that , haven't met with the single friend i had and always had worried about financial woes and be bogged amidst the constant squabbles of my family having quarrels ( which sometimes resorted more along the lines of physical    skirmish ( bloody hell ...took me like 2 minutes to remember this ) and then thinking how my dreams and ambitions where for naught ..i sometimes used to cry as well since i saw all my classmates living luxuriously or well established , or because of how skint i was or even have sleepless nights over the thoughts of my parents ever increasing age and for the fact that how if something was to happen to one of them i would proverbially and literally loose my mind and if something was to happen to me they would be completely helpless .", "i do not wish to be a liability to my already aged parents and they have so many hopes and dreams in regards to me that i am just merely sobbing and stifling a cry whilst drenching my pillow covers each and every night at bed as of the moment from the thoughts of developing alzheimer's or some form of ftd ( i'm also worried about developing lewy body  dementia as well since sleep problems are a presenting symptom there as well )the main predicament that has been absolutely gnawing and nagging me from the inside is that i have ppa which results in one losing their very concept of language , however i'm only experiencing this problem regarding comprehension or reading ever since i read about prion diseases , i'm losing so much hair because of stress...i'm literally crying ..my long luscious black hair was my pride and joy...i used to decorate it with multiple coloured ribbons and play with them now they are just a sickly shell of their former selves...ever since i had developed the severe stress i kept on having comprehension problems and later on ever since i read about ppa since i had reading problems ...i found that i might have ppa or other ftd which further scared the living jibbies out of me , i keep reading words wrong and miss words simultaneously as well like i read \"potions\" as bloody \"potatoes\" only last day as for my word recall problems i generally remember the word i'm seeking in less than a few seconds but sometimes it can be delayed then there is the fact that sometimes i have troubles articulating my speech and words ....i'm literally at my wit's end as of the  moment if i am being honest ...also i would like to bring into notice the fact that the first time i took alprazolam was when i was in middle school and even before that i used lick alprazolam tablets as i confused them with candies when i was a kid ( i know it sounds super wonky but that's that ) .", "literally before my problems i never had any problems with comprehension and even finding words ..heck the only thing i can relate to is probably how sometimes i usually used to forget names of movies or stuff and had to brainstorm for a few moment...that's about it .i would also wish to notify the fact that i always have swirls , patterns , cones and colour blobs when i close my eyes but that has been happening for a very very long time iirc so i never even paid much of a quip of an eyebrow if anything ....i also should bring in the fact that i was assured that i was gonna die last year and later called dibs at the fact that i'm gonna kick the bucket this year , it's all too harrowing and simultaneously straining for me to say the least...i don't even have a large family as most of my paternal or maternal relatives don't fancy to keep any ties with us and thus we are completely left alone to fend for ourselves..the only thing i can do is to just..wait and watch where my predicaments take me..i beg any neurologist or psychiatrist present..please help me..my mom and dad albeit they may seem crude , extremely self centred , indignant and callous are everything to me...i cannot live without them so i beg you...please tell me whether i have something truly sinister and nefarious so that i can take somewhat appropriate steps so that atleast they can live somewhat of a comfortable life in my due absence ."]}}, "qjypy7": {"hiw": ["she can still sort out her meds, but for how long?"], "valid_context": {"she can still

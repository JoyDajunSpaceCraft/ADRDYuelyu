disease.let's examine them in turn:* healthy eating.", "solving puzzles and math problems, reading, and learning a new skill such as surfing the web, help light up the brain, decrease the buildup of plaque, and [keep alzheimer's at bay](## what is lewy body dementia (lbd)?up until a few years ago, lewy body dementia (lbd) was not a familiar term to the general public.", "unlike people with alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia, patients with lbd exhibit:* strong psychotic symptoms (hallucinations)* extreme sensitivity to antipsychotic medications* day-to-day symptom variabilityin addition, lewy body dementia is twice as common in men as in women (alzheimer's occurs equally in both genders) and is rarely genetically linked.## what are lewy bodies?lewy bodies are abnormal structures in the midbrain: microscopic protein deposits found in nerve cells that disrupt the brain's normal functioning, causing it to slowly deteriorate.", "this overlap leads to frequent misdiagnosis.## what are the signs and symptoms of lewy body dementia?many of the symptoms of lewy body dementia bear a striking resemblance to alzheimer's or parkinson's disease dementia.", "a brain scan can detect mental deterioration, but not the actual lewy bodies.a thorough medical history that focuses on the pattern of symptoms and looks particularly for the hallucinations and sleep disturbances that are common to lbd patients is the optimal route for diagnosis, once other possible conditions have been ruled out.## what is the treatment for someone with lewy body dementia?being diagnosed with an incurable illness, especially one that involves dementia, can be an overwhelming experience.", "however, depression and sleep disorders can and should be treated with medications

together as frontotemporal dementias:* pick's disease,* primary progressive aphasia,* semantic dementia.while up to seven million americans may be afflicted with ftd, pick's disease accounts for just five percent of all progressive dementias.", "it is frequently misdiagnosed in the early stages as depression, mental illness or alzheimer's disease, because of the manner in which symptoms initially appear.## what causes frontotemporal dementia?as in lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia is the result of a build-up of protein in the affected areas of the brain.", "while the cause is still

problems we are having about neighbours, where the mother has dementia.i apologise if this just sounds like im whining and by no means am i attempting to belittle the awful situation the neighbours must be living with.the context of the situation:based in the essex, uk and have lived in our purchased semi for about 3 years now with our 2 young kids.all started about a couple of days into living here we heard screaming next door along the lines of \"xxx where are you\" over and over for about 30 mins along with banging of doors or furniture.i went round to to see if everything was ok, the daughter (in her 30s/40s) said all is ok, just her mum with dementia and she panics if she can't physically see the daughter.", "also stating she is her mothers carer.from that point on, we've had 3 years of the mother progressively getting worse in frequency and severity of the screaming and banging, i believe the main term is sun downing and typically starts about 6am until about 9/10am and again from about 5pm until she goes to sleep, which can sometimes be 1am.it isn't constant, and sometimes not everyday, but it is getting more frequent.the early stuff typically wakes us all up and the late stuff prevents me from getting to sleep or staying asleep.", "in the past 6 months, i've probably only had a handful of uninterrupted evening or nights sleep.in speaking to the daughter, it is very apparent she isn't quite all there herself, in her actions, what we can hear and the way she generally conducts herself.", "in the past whenever we've gone round to ask if she can settle her mother (due to either the kids now being in bed or the obscenities being screamed being so clear we don't want the kids to hear it), the only response we get from here is her medications are strong enough or she just looks at us almost as if we've caught her out (hope that makes sense, her reaction and response just seems really strange).this then typically follows with what i can only assume is the daughter then locking her mother in her bedroom, as you can clearly hear the mother screaming at the daughter to get off her followed by rattling of the bedroom door along with crying and attention seeking (screaming that she's fallen over and can't get up, but we never hear the daughter coming to her aid).we have also in the past needed to go round because the daughter took to screaming back at her mother when she was doing it, thankfully this didn't last more than a few weeks after we spoke to her to make her aware we could hear her doing it at any volume she chose.the mother is at her worst when her son is home, we think he is also not all there mentally and we can only assume is away at some form of centre as it's clear he can't take care of himself.", "in his 30's, slow speaker with some form of nervous twitch and typically watching children's tv.in the past, which i can only assume was before they put a lock on her door, when he was home, from about 6am till about 8am, you'd hear him slamming a door screaming \"go away\" continuously.when he is home, the mother is more agitated and her sun downing screams always seems to be in response to him.", "for example screaming \"not funny, get off me\" or telling him to f off, even if there is no indication that he is anywhere near her.", "(from what we can hear) his reactions to the mother are also terrible, he shouts at her when he's had enough of her sun downing.the other scenario that's worst is the weekend, it's like the daughter either goes into a coma or just has headphones on full volume, as the mother will be screaming and banging from 6am anything right up to 12pm and any attempt to knock on their door goes unnoticed.as you can probably gather, they are loud, but also the sound carries right through our house.", "nowhere is safe from it.", "we have made the daughter aware of these facts several times, but there is usually only an evenings difference in her actions/volume and none in the mothers.we've spoken to the daughter with no solution apparently in sight due to not only the horrible situation this must be for her, but also the fact she doesn't seem capable of dealing with anything other than her mothers basic needs.we've also spoken to the social services team who have the mother on their caseload.", "to whom we have told all of this and some things i've missed off.", "the reply is typically, we'll look into it, followed by \"we've instigated a care plan for her\"this doesn't appear to result in anything, so feels like we've just been palmed off.", "probably because they appear to work on the basis of only dealing with issues where the basic needs are not being taken care of.i think complaining to the council won't really help, i don't think you can reasonably prosecute someone with dementia and expect anything to happen.", "plus once we complain to the council, that is then something that goes against us if we try to move, as it has to be legally declared.im not sure if any noise complaint made verbally to your neighbours also has to be declared when selling, so this also puts us in a bind as we probably won't be able to get a successful buyer.", "so moving might be off the agenda.i can only assume the mothers basic needs are being catered for and i have no proof otherwise, so social services probably wont intervene or take her into care.being screamed at or left in her room appears to not come under their definition of elder abuse or putting the mother in an unsafe situation either based on the replies we had from them.i've tried headphones at night, which only works whilst i lay on my back, which i rarely seem to get to sleep that way.", "laying on my side with either inner or outer headphones just hurts my ears after a few minutes.ear plugs don't fully work, the banging just carries through the whole house.we put soundboard plasterboard over the walls in the living room and insulation in the floorboards upstairs in our room, which is next to the mothers.", "neither have really made any impact, as the sound is just too loud and the banging carries through the joists.i don't feel any conversation about this with social services have been taken seriously and from internet searches on noise with unwell neighbours, it seems to come down to either put up with it or use earplugs.it really does feel like the only solution we have is to wait for the mother to die."]}}, "5cdmw9": {"hiw": ["anyhow i understand my granddad has 'vascular dementure' which is constricting of the veins?", "should i seek any

actual.", "i call the police again, this time they send multiple cruisers, at this point she's crawled back into her house (she literally broke down the rest of the fence and squeezed through it to get into our backyard) and has transformed back into a sweet little old lady again.", "she talks to the officers this time, and tells them that we are just playing pranks on each other and there was no need to call the police.", "definitely not the case considering i have no idea who she is and have never even spoken to her.my landlord contacted an officer on the police's mental health unit the next day and the officer asked if we'd be comfortable going over to her house (with him supervising, and her permission) and formally introducing ourselves to our neighbor.", "we had zero problem with that, so we did so.", "she was perfectly lovely, her house was utterly immaculate inside and she had a sweet little dog who she clearly loved and cared well for.", "she was kind although she did ask me slightly aggressively how many children we have, to which i replied none.", "i did compliment her on her lovely outdoor decorations which i always do (truly) admire.", "the mental health officer

doorbell rings again.", "this time i run downstairs and am about to answer the door, seeing as i've met this lady now, and stupid ol' me thinks maybe i can talk to her and figure out what's bothering her and smooth it all over.", "i stop short when i hear her start ranting and raving about how i stole all her decorations and then she proceeds to start ripping my wreath and all my outdoor decor off our front entryway, smashing all our items very hard against the frosted glass window on the side of our door.", "alarmingly hard.", "this repeats a few more times.", "we decided to take out a formal trespassing complaint because we don't know what else to do and it's becoming increasingly alarming/disturbing/upsetting to have this happen.", "i don't see her getting arrested as a solution at all,

anyone who has suggested it to her (the mental health officer and a social worker who has stopped by multiple times) and at this point isn't even admitting she's having hallucinations anymore, she flat out denies she has any issues whatsoever.", "a few weeks passed after we took out the complaint, but the knocking and harassing started up again, this time she called the police and filed a complaint that we had burglarized her home, stole her dog (who was barking in a room upstairs) and we also stole a firearm from her home and left it on her front step.", "that last bit was particularly chilling, a. because it meant that she has a firearm and b. because our neighborhood is full of young children running around during the day and the idea of a loaded firearm sitting on her front mat in plain sight for a few hours (or god knows how long) midday makes me want to throw up.the door knocking and bell ringing has died down a bit, but has now turned into almost constant banging on the interior walls we share in the duplex.", "when i shower she smashes stuff against her walls and screams at me.", "when i use the toile or make any noise in the bathroom at all, she is often standing in her adjacent bathroom saying directly at the wall \"i can hear you in there.\"", "not sinister at all.", "almost none of this happens to my partner, or rarely occurs when he is home.", "she seems highly observant so i'm sure she can tell whose car is whose and notes when each is gone.", "to the point where i've had my partner use my car for a week just to give me some peace.", "i can't pretend to apply logic to this situation but maybe she feels threatened by his presence, he's certainly a much taller male whereas i'm on the smaller end of most females.", "but again she may well be hallucinating so who knows what she sees or thinks is going on with us anyway.", "when she's not actively banging on the walls she is hulk-smashing things inside her apartment, moving objects around that sound far too heavy for a 76 year old to move around, talking to herself frantically and chain smoking nonstop which is seeping through her walls into our unit.", "she has called both our landlord and the police and blamed the smoking on us and says we are ruining her house.", "neither of us smoke.our landlord served her an eviction notice after the umpteenth time she violated our order, and she quieted down for almost exactly the 14 days she had to comply with the order.", "then right as rain she started up again.", "it's stuff like that that makes me frustrated, because she seems to have some self awareness of the situation.", "our landlord finally decided that rather than evict her he'd do a nonrenewal of her lease which is coming up in august to give her more time to find a suitable place to live.", "this is somewhat of a relief, i guess (for us, certainly not for her, realistically where is she going to go) but it's ratcheted up her aggression to a freaking 12/10.", "she's home all day, and with the newfound information that her mortal enemies ie us have caused her to be driven from her home, she now lies in wait in her entryway for us to leave the house and on multiple occasions has started walking quickly towards me as i'm trying to get into my car.", "i've called the police about this and all they say is to \"avoid a confrontation\" and oh also, \"assume she has a firearm.\"", "i am not a gun owner, no desire to be, but i've at least bought pepper spray which maybe i can spritz in her direction before she shoots me in the head.", "at this point i am scared to leave the house, which sounds ridiculous, but it's true.", "i also hate being in the house now too, for what it's worth.reading everyone's posts has been really helpful, though in many cases deeply upsetting and profoundly sad to read all of your situations.", "they make me understand the behavior a little bit, although of course this is not someone i am emotionally attached to or have history with like a parent or grandparent or other relative.", "knowing her illness is causing this behavior is one thing, but all the same it's hard to not think she's just a compete raging control freak jerk set on making our lives a living hell.", "it often feels like she is a predator and the behavior is very unpredictable and quite aggressive.", "the police don't seem to take this particularly seriously, and whenever they are called and come by, the majority of them smile and say \"oh yeah we know \\_\\_\\_\\_, she's a sweet old lady\" and in one case i quote, \"i'm a softie so i don't think we should take her in.\"", "it's like, live here for 2 days, then get back to me.", "again, i don't pretend to know what the solution is here, i did call the mental health officer to make sure he knew she'd need housing in august and he said he'd offer her some resources, but the last few times he's checked on her she's gotten very aggressive and slammed the door in his face.", "it's a tough case because she's still quite self-sufficient at this point but is nasty as all get out to who she wants to be.anyway, i'm trying to have compassion here and of course at

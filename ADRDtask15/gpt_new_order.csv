vrxgk6,"My grandmother is mid stage, and in the past month or two, something new that has come up, is a couple times a week she will get upset and insist she's not in her house, despite living there for 51 years.  This will go on for hours, sometimes the whole day.  She gets very depressed and upset over it.  She remembers her address, she remembers the city, but she insists she is living in an apartment in ""a town I don't know the name of"" and goes on and on about how much she hates it there and wants to go home.  Telling her it is her home, and trying to get her to recognize some of her belongings doesn't help, it just makes her very mad and she starts yelling that she's not crazy.  Telling her she will be going home next week, and everything will be back to normal then doesn't help either.  She remains depressed and upset and lamenting about wanting to go home right away.  Trying to redirect the conversation to another topic doesn't help either, she goes right back to talking about wanting to go home.  We're not sure *what* to say to her on the days she gets like this.  Is this one of those things where there is nothing to do?  We just have to deal with her being upset/depressed on these days?

io70fz,"Hi, I'm new to this sub. I just wanted to ask those of you who have parents or loved ones with dementia or Alzheimer's what you say to your loved one who is asking to go home. My grandmother-in-law is getting to late stages, and every day she asks to go home, or says she's going home soon. She's been living with all of us (MIL, wife, and me) for nearly 4 years, and we moved to Tennessee almost exactly a year ago. She insists that she has friends somewhere else and she's going to go visit them... Or something. I don't believe she has a troubling amount of anxiety during the day, not enough to say she wants to be safe, and that's why she's asking. We think it's most likely that she's just remembering house she lived in before the stroke in Florida, since it's the last place she had friends and such.  What do we tell her when she keeps begging and begging to go to a place she hasn't owned in half a decade?"
hz2kfb,"Hey. My grandmother (88) has alzheimers/dementia. It was at an okay stage but it deteriorated when my aunt, her youngest daughter who lived with her and her kids, got cancer and eventually died less than a year later. She saw her body so that she would believe us and grieved and cried and everything. Afterwards, my other aunts started having her stay with them for a while and she was basically moving between like 3 houses every couple of months which i now realize is really bad as this destroys routine and consistency but what's done is done.   Anyway, she finally returned home yesterday which she didn't remember at all or her grandkids who lived there until she actually saw the house. When she got there she began to ask about my aunt. She can't speak very well and her sentences are very very loose and vague but we can make out that she's asking about her. It's been brought up a couple of times and no one know show to address. We just switch conversations and try to distract her. We're not sure if we should keep doing this or show her a picture of her and ask her if this is the person she's asking about? But to do that we'd have to be ready to tell her she's no longer around and deal with the circumstances of that.  I think it wouldn't hurt her to forget about her as incredibly painful as that sounds considering she took care of her all her life. It would only cause pain and confusion. I'm not sure what to do.

h80j9y,"My grandparents are stuck with us because of COVID-19 and have been in the US since February (they live in Mexico). They were staying with my aunt up North and recently came down to try to get back home. They have been staying with us for a couple of weeks, and it is so tough watching my grandmother. She is in mid to late stages of Alzheimer's, and it deeply saddens me. She looks for my grandfather when he is right next to her and very visible. When she goes to the rr, she can't find the toilet, forgets to wipe and wash her hands. She forgets she eats right after she eats. She wakes up distressed, trying to figure out where she is and who the heck is around. She's clueless a lot of the times and doesn't notice when people get home or when they are speaking to her. She doesn't remember who I am, or who her children are. When she speaks to us, she mostly thinks she's speaking to strangers. I don't know how to deal with this. I apologize if this sounds rude or something; I have never been in this situation. Throughout my years of studying psychology, I have learned a lot about Alzheimer's but never had to witness it firsthand. I am afraid of what's to come as I know that it only gets worse from here. I wonder if she knows she's a little lost or if they lose that part of themselves too. I wonder how much it tears her children apart (my mother and aunt included) if it's affecting me too. They are much closer to her.

5q2li7,"Shortly after my Grandfather died, my 83 year old grandmother chose to live with my family. The last few years have been fine until just before Christmas. After researching the subject, she has what I would consider Dementia and her regular doctor would agree but has not written a formal diagnosis as of last week.  This last week has been a frightening experience for my whole family. She has begun wandering around the yard disoriented and wanting to call 911 because ""nobody is around anymore.""  I've come to the realization our family is not equipped to face this challenge. She has access to the outside from her room and I'm waking up after 2-3 hours in fear of what happens next.  We have intentions of moving her to a Memory Care facility. Tonight I could not sleep, thoughts of her screaming at me for betraying her for moving her to a safer environment.  What are my steps? What do you wish someone would had told you in this situation? What things do I have to know?  Thank you for your time and advice.

lb0jpk,"My grandparent has vascular dementia and lives at home with one of her older children. I go over to help give company when I can, and I think the hardest part is making her feel at home. She constantly asks when we are leaving to go home, as she thinks she isn't in her house and wants to go back to what we assume is the house she grew up in with her parents in a different state.   How can I answer her questions to make her feel at home? She mostly asks when we are leaving, if she needs money or how to pack for the trip. Every day when it's not freezing outside and in some that it is she packs her car with random things like she is going somewhere or brings things up and down the stairs trying to get ready. We of course have the keys hidden but leave the car doors unlocked because she can get angry when HER car isn't available to her. I've made a sign for her bedroom door that says her name and plan on making a memory book with a picture of her in her house with some family so she can maybe make the association on her own. But nothing really seems to make her feel better and she gets more and more restless and hard to deal with by the day.  I usually try to answer that she is home and that her family lives with her, and try to point out things in the house that she knows are hers -paintings she has done, or take her to her room to give her a tour. Sometimes she realizes that it is her house but usually not and she often answers with ""I didn't know that."" This is how every conversation goes and I just wonder if anyone has any tips for how to answer or make her feel more comfortable without trying to force the information on her?

6ohvbz,"hi there,   there is a trip to a camp that our family has made every year for 50 years. it's a regional conference for churches which my grandparents have always loved.   however, many people in their generation have passed on or are not able to travel. also... grandpa passed away a few months ago from a very brief bout of cancer.  most of the time grandma does not seem to be aware that grandpa has passed away, she is calm when we don't mention him outright and can get very very upset sometimes when his illness and death are recalled. it's like she's experiencing it all over again, with the added pain that she can't go visit him or see him again.   they were married 65 years.  this will be the first year without grandpa. she is 88. she can walk around and is very familiar with this camp in one sense, but in another sense she doesn't even remember that she still lives in her own home. she is aware that she has a relationship with her daughters and me, but does not recall the type of relationship (mother/daughter, granddaughter) or our names or how long we all know each other or, again, where she even is at the time (one of our homes which she should know)...   so any tips please?! how to keep track of her while retaining her dignity and self respect. we have a room in the lodge right across from the bathroom and i want to hang a sign on the door with her name or our family name so she will think to herself ""well, this must be my room.""  is it realistic to ask friends from the camp to keep from talking about grandpa's illness and death too much? i would rather have her recall happy memories/her emotions about being near him and connected to him.

vte8ql,"My grandmother is 89 years old and got diagnosed with alzheimers last year. My grandmother is 89 years old and got diagnosed with alzheimers last year. She is ""on the list"" for the local nursing home meaning if she'd end up in hospital or we *really* can't take care of her anymore she can go there if there's a free room. Me and my mom are so sick of taking care of her, so beyond fed up with it. My mom has dealt with this incredibly stubborn woman for 30 years, and now that her mental state is declining rapidly its all way too much. But ofcourse in her eyes we don't do anything for her and don't care for her. She comes to our house at 3am, not knowing that its nighttime, and we have to get her back to her house. Whenever she comes along she also insists on doing whatever I'm doing."
buwe56,"Hello!  &#x200B;  My 90-year-old grandmother has dementia. She lives in a care facility and is visited by one of her children once a day- we have a schedule set up for her so she never has a day without a visit.  &#x200B;  The problem is, she doesn't remember being visited, and will tell whoever is there that day that no one ever visits her, that she hasn't seen x person in months (they were there two days ago), etc. I know we are not supposed to correct her as this causes confusion and distress, but she is already highly distressed. She has always been all about her family, and she gets extremely distraught feeling like her family is gone and no one ever comes to see her. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Why does John never come visit me?"" and occasionally aggressive- ""Why haven't you come to see me in so long?""  &#x200B;  What can we do in this situation? How can be reassure her that her family is there for her without making her more upset? It's so upsetting to us to see her so upset, I just wish she could comprehend that her children do come to see her every day.

v65ziz,"In the past year, my 94-year-old grandmother has slowly started to forget things. We recently brought her to live with us and she still thinks she's at her home in Mexico. She truly believes that she's in her home even though she's actually in the U.S living with my family. Luckily she still remembers my family but has forgotten a lot of other people. My question is what do I do to help her? Are these the early stages or are we way past that? Should I let her think she's in her home so she won't want to leave?"
27zjyu,"I think my mom might be exhibiting early signs of Alzheimer's. She's 57.  We have been noticing some mood changes in the last 5-10 years - mostly more aggressive behavior or being oblivious to things around her. She's become addicted to online games (angry birds and the like). She also doesn't sleep, but ends up falling asleep at work instead. And just today, while talking to my sister, she forgot her Granddad's name.   I only talk to her about once a month, but my sister talks to her daily (usually about my niece). My sister and I both live thousands of miles away from Mom & Dad, so it's not an easy thing to go check up on them in person. I usually make the trip once or twice a year.The burden of taking care of my parents will inevitably fall to me, as I am more financially stable and have no children.  My question is: How do I get her to recognize problems and see a Dr?We've tried addressing her declining mental state the past few years, to no avail. Mom is defensive and Dad is overwhelmed and in denial. But something needs to be done.  What were your first steps with an affected relative?  "
8ihlxu,"Advice? My grandmother has dementia (my dad's Mom - I live at home while attending college). She lives in a retirement home in our city. No one really knows just how much she's aware of. A speech therapist came recently to work with her, and my grandmother struggled with very basic questions (things like ""how many children do you have""). She was previously diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia and takes antipsychotics to control delusions. Even if it's some novel drug treatment that will help her feel better (even if the happiness - or at least sedatedness - is ""fake""). Everyone in my household is very busy. Though a big part of why we don't visit her too often is because of our hectic schedules, it's also because seeing her is so difficult. In addition to her very diminished communication skills (sometimes spending time with her feels like hanging around a brick wall), what further complicates the situation is past baggage. My grandmother was very narcissistic when she was younger, and while she didn't alienate her family completely, there was definitely bad blood between her and all of her children. Her daughters in law also have a lot of bad blood with her - it's hard not to, because she could be very nasty before the dementia set in. - and it's a *very* nice facility). As such, her other two children - my aunt and uncle - have essentially abandoned the situation. They don't come and visit her ever, and have placed the burden of her care on my father, because he's always been her ""favorite"" son (he's the oldest). I want to visit her more often, but being around her aggravates my own depression greatly and puts me in a very morbid mood. Both of my parents are older, so thinking about how this could happen to them makes me feel sick to my stomach. Being around someone who's quality of life is so poor, particularly when we weren't very bonded to begin with, is also hard - I feel like I'm too weak to deal with this. Advice?"
82mpl4,"So, my grandfather passed away this Sunday and my family didn't want to tell my grandmother until a better time as her blood pressure and mind was calmer. Come Tuesday night, her sons came to tell her that her husband has passed at the age of 90+. My grandmother is about 86.   It has only been around 10 hours since she was given the news. As a family, we know that she has memory issues. At about 3:00AM, she got up and started walking and I got in front of her by asking what you are doing. She asked me where her husband is.   I'm not sure how bad her dementia (or if it's alzheimers) is. She sort of has a fixed schedule throughout the day where she would eat at certain times, start cooking rice and etc. She doesn't do anything but sit around, nap, sleep or stare into the distance.   She does ask a lot of questions as to where everyone is. If I was working overnight (which I don't anymore) and etc. She knows when my mother comes home because she works a fix schedule.   How do you cope with this? (I fear that continually telling my grandmother that her husband has passed away is bad for her health and that we have to continue to say he is at the hospital). (As well as, she has severely bad hearing, so, communicating with her is a very hard task.)

s3vqo,"My grandma has Alzheimer's disease. Every night, she would always say  that last night she slept across the street at some stranger's house with my mom. We tried to tell her that she never spent a night there, but she insisted that she is right, and she would get mad every time we tried to convince her otherwise. She said that every morning, my mom would greet her outside our house.   I'm not sure what I should do with this situation. Should we comply with her and agree that she spent every night sleeping across the street? Or should we continue to try to convince her that she never slept across the street. I am really confuse. HELP?

ijkey3,"So my grandma (75) on my mom’s side has Alzheimer’s and it’s been a while now. My grandpa takes care of her but my mom (47) does a lot too to help such as cooking food, cleaning her house and all that. And then there’s me (21) I see my grandma a couple of times a week because we live super close. Basically my grandma keeps forgetting that she is retired from work and so everyday she gets dressed and goes walking to her “work” (it’s a 5-6 mins walk from her house). We always tell her that she’s retired everyday but it doesn’t seem like she’ll ever understand or remember and I understand that there isn’t much we can do right? But my mom is having a hard time accepting all this and all she does is YELL at my grandma. I can’t take it anymore. I can see my grandma being confused and I see that she’s getting dizzy. I know for a FACT that you should not show anger or frustration in front of someone who had Alzheimer’s and DEFINITELY TO NOT YELL AT THEM. She is making her feel bad that she can’t remember. Just now she told my grandma “are you trying to punish us?” Am I wrong for being absolutely disgusted with what she is saying. I have told my mom over and over again that we can’t act like this in front of her and that it is not her fault that she’d forgetting. We cant make her feel bad for it, she doesn’t know. And when I explain this to my mom she yells at me because I’m not the one really “taking care” of her and says “maybe you should cook and bathe her maybe you’ll understand”. Okay like I get it it’s hard but like you’re not helping at the end if you’re talking to her aggressively.  My mom also forces her to put on manicure when my grandma says that she doesn’t want to. Idk man there’s other things but I don’t know what to do...
"
ij0ez8,"My mom has mild dementia (with a mental health issue also). She can still cook, clean and drive to familiar places. But has very little short term memory (forgets that she just ate something). And has become paranoid, delusional and taking out her anger on my frail Dad. So they are moving to a retirement community near me.   But every time we tell her she is moving, she get agitated. So to reduce that we agree that she is moving next year, not this year. But it's going to happen in 3 weeks. I'm just dreading the fall-out. I'm dreading that I'm turning my Mom's world upside down and she has no idea it's coming.   Anyone deal with this?

40becj,"My grandma is in a nursing home after breaking her hip (a blessing in disguise as it finally got my parents and aunt to understand she couldn't live at home even with a 24h nurse anymore). Anyway now that she's there, she's much happier, and doesn't cry and beg you to take her home, so it's much easier to go visit. I love to see her, we talk about what nail polish we like and all sorts of girly fun things. But she doesn't know that I'm her granddaughter all the time so she'll talk to me about more serious things too sometimes. I always feel she's much happier when I just talk to her and go along with whatever she is saying. I never correct her unless she asks me a question and I feel like it makes her happier. However my mom and aunt still try to remind her of things, like that my grandpa died or that she's not at home/work/wherever. I just feel like why tell her, why remind her of these things? I wouldn't want to find out every day that my husband died. But I don't know. Am I wrong in playing into her delusions so much? I just want to make her as happy as possible but I don't want to do something that would adversely affect her either. This is all so confusing and I guess I just need an outsiders opinion because I don't really have anybody to ask.

sw2a2b," Hi all. My mom has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia at the age of 73 and is struggling badly with the diagnosis and her changing cognitive ability. She is likely experiencing some sundowner-like symptoms. She is crying a lot, often in the evenings, repeating things like ""I just want to be me"".   She's always been a powerhouse in the family, thinking of herself as a bit of a matriarch--always caring for others, taking care of house and home, etc. Very ""in control"" of herself and, in her eyes, her family. That said, she's clearly not coping with me needing to take over handling the finances, or my sibling and I doing more around the house. I've tried to get her to talk about what she's feeling. I imagine there is a grieving process involved here, voluntary or involuntary, for all of us.   She's also been a caretaker for our father for a few years now--he is not in good shape physically, and we are faced with the fact that we will need to move them out of their house and into a place that is equipped to care for them. My wife and live out of state, but I'm within a day's drive and am spending more time with my parents as I can. My sibling lives in here in the same town with them.  Last week, her doc told her that this could be the most difficult time of her illness because she is still alert enough to be aware of it and of her mental struggles. She even hinted that things would get easier when she is no longer cognitively aware enough to know of her illness. I don't know the truth of that, but I'm reaching out here, with tears in my eyes, asking for kind words and any advice.

p70eyt,"My mom is in her third year of diagnosed dementia and she does a lot of things that annoy and agitate me. I try to be good but it's hard. She keeps calling me on the telephone and inviting me to dinner and I tell her that I don't live at home and I'm thousands of miles away. she'll say ""well you can go home and just use the key and get in"". I'm like ""Mom, I don't live at the house anymore"" and she's just falls stone silent, doesn't understand, and then says ""well, where are you""? and I explain it to her again.  she'll ask where do you sleep and I'll explain it to her again. I don't even want to pick up the phone anymore when she calls but if I don't she will literally call and call and call and call and each one she'll leave a message. I'll have eight or nine phone calls with messages to scroll through. they're all like 5 minutes long and she's just rambling. I wish my father would take the phone away to be honest or just let the plan expire on her but then she would probably just use his phone and do it. I just wish he would put her somewhere or get her help to keep her distracted and have her mind put to work. It seems he wants that + 1  so he doesn't feel lonely when he goes out to eat or events. He doesn't actually want to have a conversation he just wants to make statements about things. He doesn't listen to myself or my brother about getting her help or putting her somewhere he's just like whatever. I'm going on a trip with them in another couple of weeks and I'm kind of dreading it now because I think she's going to be overbearing and horribly annoying. I think one of the main reasons that I was invited was so my father can go off on his own and leave me with my mom. Well fool me once shame on you. I'll keep my fingers crossed that's not the case but I know my father all too well. Sorry this was a rant but the situation is driving me crazy."

9o0rq5,"My mom has been on the decline with Alzheimer's for the past 10 years or so.  Within the past year her symptoms have gotten much worse (she's 71 now).   Until the past couple of weeks her moods ranged from confused, but chipper to confused and depressed.  But increasingly she just wants to go ""home.""  She packs and unpacks constantly.  And the past few days her mood has become staunchly defiant and angry --- she believes her delusions are real (she talks to inanimate objects all day) and that all of the real people around her are trying to fool her.  She's told me that I and my Dad deserve to die.  I have had to physically restrain her from breaking windows with whatever heavy object she gets her hands on.  Even lately though she's calmed down around dinner time to eat and take her meds, but not tonight.  She went to bet at 6:30 without food and refused to eat or take her pills.  She is clearly at the point where everyone (including her) would be happier if she could be in a quality care facility.  (We seriously try to accommodate her in every way we can).  But we simply don't have the funds to do so.   In fact, we rely on her SS income just to help pay the bills.  Does anyone know good ways to deal with a loved one with dementia who becomes increasingly hostile while still being able to provide care at home?  We really just try to be nice to her, take her for drives or give her hugs (when she'll accept them).

qa9jux,"""Hey, I renovated my kitchen."" Hello. Although I kind of knew that she was showing symptoms of it, now I realize how bad it actually is. My mother doesn't really have a strong relationship with my grandmother, they normally see each other once or maybe twice a year, they also live pretty far away from one another. She went upstairs, and showed us CABINETS and WARDROBES full off unnecessary stuff, which she compulsively bought. Rows and rows of the same cleaning product, toilet paper, et cetera. My mother asked if it was okay to see her that same day, which my grandmother initially accepted. However, just 30 minutes or so before the appointment she said she wasn't 'feeling well' so my mother shouldn't come. She didn't, but a couple of days later she did. When my mother arrived, she found her own mother lost in dementia. ""Hey, I renovated my kitchen."" She did not recognize both of us. We brought some food, because she is terribly skinny and keeps forgetting to eat. Care: She can not live by herself without help anymore. We can't go there every day to take care of her, but, there is a friendly neighbour at the other end of the street who helps her and chats with her occassionally. He is truly a kind man, but it is also very strenuous for him. He is getting literal physical pain because of the intensity of taking care of my grandmother, poor soul. We have contacted my grandmother's doctor (she has not been officially diagnosed yet) who is very, lazy I would call it.

kc18vq,"A few years ago my grandmother was in hospital (aged 88) and because of the medication she was under, she kept showing common tropes of that of a person with dementia (delusion, forgetting peoples names, etc.) and was placed in a ward with patients of the same illness.  She checked out of hospital after about a month and went back to normal every day life. She broke her hip last year and had to be in hospital again for about three months. She behaved the same kind of way she did last time and it took her a few days to fully recognise her house when she finally returned home (for the most part she would only recognise a couple bits of furniture).  She's 91 now and she's aware her memory isn't what it used to be. She'll spend a great deal of time when I visit talking about the exact same things (religion, what she's watching on TV, etc.). I noticed last time I was there she confused me for my brother and kept referring to us by the wrong name. She also told us that she's lived in her house for the last sixty-odd years and raised six children there, as if my brother and I never knew that.  A few months ago she asked to take a picture of my granda and brighten it up in photoshop since she never liked how it came out, and I brought it back a few months ago. Last time I was down at her house with my brother she was convinced it was my brother that had altered the picture and even gave him money for it.  I want to try and visit her as often as I can and I want to know what I can do to when I visit her (how to stay patient when she gets confused, how to keep her on track with the conversation, etc.). I know this may sound insensitive to some people on this sub and I apologise for that, but I don't know where else to go

hjg1z2,"Any advice on communicating a move?  We are moving my Grandma from assisted living into an adult family home on Friday. I’m trying to figure out the best way to tell her Friday that she is transitioning to her new home. She is very attached to her current place of residence, but can no long afford it and needs higher level of care. She is not going to want me to touch any of her things, so I’m not sure how logistically this is going to work.   I tried telling her yesterday about the move, saying that I’m excited we found her a beautiful home to live in, with a couple other ladies so she will never be lonely. I gave her a lot of positive points, but she got very upset and told me I’m throwing her out with the trash and that she refuses to move. She of course remembers nothing today... I’m just quite concerned as to how to make this as best a transition for her as possible?

l10qa9,"I live with my grandma, 82, and my mom. My grandma has pretty bad dementia but its just recently been getting worse and worse and we sometimes don't know what to do about it. We are struggling hard at not snapping at her when she sees stuff or tries to do things. Its hard but we are trying.   One concern is when she tries to do things she physically can't. How do I get her to stop without getting her upset? She thinks she's young and can do it all.   The biggest problem we are having right now is she thinks she isn't home some nights when its the worst. She will scream at us and cry and persist that she isn't home and she needs to be taken home right now. She will refuse to take off her shoes and won't listen to us trying to calmly tell her she is home. I've gotten her to calm down a couple times by walking with her to her bedroom, showing her all my deceased grandpas things and making her understand she is home but there has to be a better way. She sat and cried for 15 minutes straight tonight bc she didn't understand why we wouldn't just take her home. Im younger, 25, and I think she's beginning to not recognize me, so she thinks I'm a stranger and it fuels her thinking she isn't home. Its breaking my heart. I think her head is about 20 years back rn, which would make sense as to why she can't recognize me and why she thinks she isn't home, because she didn't live here then.   Any advice? I'm becoming lost as to how to help her.

She seems to think someone brought her here sometime during the day. It gets bad to the point where she has packed suitcases of her stuff so she could go home. I'm worried that she is going to try and actually ""go home"". Thankfully, we do not have a car so I don't have to worry about that but I'm still scared she's going to run away in the middle of the night. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this?

She’s currently livid with my father for taking her car so she’s resentful of anything he does.  Long story short, today I asked her what she remembered about yesterday and she said “nothing.”  So, with that being said, she’s on schedule to move within the next few weeks but due to her forgetting when she gets angry whenever her independence is questioned, we’re afraid of how to approach breaking the news to her.  Any advice would be great.

eo539k,"My 71 year old mother has been dealing with Alzheimer's for many years. I've been bathing her about a year now. Dad turns off gas and locks doors ( supplying details to give a frame of reference ).  She often talks about going home to check on her parents (gone for 20 years) or kids (I'm her youngest at 34 years old) or whatever. She yells at my dad to take her home all the while saying their current home  is actually her house her dad got for her (it isn't).  We are managing, but what's best to say to her? When she pleads to me to pick her up and take her home? Most if the time, I can change the topic and she forgets eventually, but sometimes she gets fixated. Do I go pick her up and drive around? Do I gently remind her she is home? Do I just listen? What's best in your experiences?

2rgki6,"Everything sets him off (yelling and berates her), and he becomes focused on things and often freaks out at her if she says or does the wrong thing. My Mom married my wonderful step-father 6-7 years ago. I'm thirty years old, and I'm not too sure how to help out. My step-dad is still highly independent and can still act like himself around other people. I can often have a conversation with him and if I didn't already know it, I wouldn't be able to guess he has alzheimers. I'm seeking out for my mother. She is struggling, because for 3/4 of their marriage it has been a challenge for her and things have slowly been going downhill after the first couple of years of their relationship. She says he isn't the man she fell in love with, though she can see glimpses of him every now and then (which is understandable). I know she is suffering, and that it is hard for her because everything is all about the person with alzheimers, and not the spouse. Her self esteem is suffering and she feels trapped. She says everything sets him off (yelling and berates her), and he becomes focused on things and often freaks out at her if she says or does the wrong thing. I don't know what to do to help her. I love my step-father so so dearly, but it is so hard to watch my mother in this. A big part of me wants to tell her to leave before it's too late and he loses his independence, because she is so young and has so much ahead of her still and the other part feels so guilty to even think of wanting her to do that. Every outcome for both of them breaks my heart. Is she doomed with a life where she has to walk over egg shells and ""be agreeable"" to prevent his freak outs? This is the advice she's been given multiple times. She says he has never been physically violent, but that his anger is very unpredictable/severe and the littlest things set him off. She isn't interested in going to a support group because she doesn't want to sit around and talk about all of the crappy things happening. Can anyone relate to this? I feel helpless."

8ihlxu,"Advice? My grandmother has dementia (my dad's Mom - I live at home while attending college). She lives in a retirement home in our city. No one really knows just how much she's aware of. A speech therapist came recently to work with her, and my grandmother struggled with very basic questions (things like ""how many children do you have""). She was previously diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia and takes antipsychotics to control delusions. Even if it's some novel drug treatment that will help her feel better (even if the happiness - or at least sedatedness - is ""fake""). Everyone in my household is very busy. Though a big part of why we don't visit her too often is because of our hectic schedules, it's also because seeing her is so difficult. In addition to her very diminished communication skills (sometimes spending time with her feels like hanging around a brick wall), what further complicates the situation is past baggage. My grandmother was very narcissistic when she was younger, and while she didn't alienate her family completely, there was definitely bad blood between her and all of her children. Her daughters in law also have a lot of bad blood with her - it's hard not to, because she could be very nasty before the dementia set in. - and it's a *very* nice facility). As such, her other two children - my aunt and uncle - have essentially abandoned the situation. They don't come and visit her ever, and have placed the burden of her care on my father, because he's always been her ""favorite"" son (he's the oldest). I want to visit her more often, but being around her aggravates my own depression greatly and puts me in a very morbid mood. Both of my parents are older, so thinking about how this could happen to them makes me feel sick to my stomach. Being around someone who's quality of life is so poor, particularly when we weren't very bonded to begin with, is also hard - I feel like I'm too weak to deal with this. Advice?"

As I became a teenager it definitely became more manageable but I still didn’t see her a lot because I was in sports and school and whatever the excuses. It’s just low vibes and my uncle doesn’t really get along with my grandpa and it’s just a mess. There’s not enough interaction or high energy to keep her wheels turning. I didn’t even give her a chance. or so it feels. My only problem is that I would have to pick up my whole life and move to Missouri, I’m in Arizona. It was just because I didn’t want to or feel like it or just because it was awkward sometimes."
8ihlxu,"Advice? My grandmother has dementia (my dad's Mom - I live at home while attending college). She lives in a retirement home in our city. No one really knows just how much she's aware of. A speech therapist came recently to work with her, and my grandmother struggled with very basic questions (things like ""how many children do you have""). She was previously diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia and takes antipsychotics to control delusions. Even if it's some novel drug treatment that will help her feel better (even if the happiness - or at least sedatedness - is ""fake""). Everyone in my household is very busy. Though a big part of why we don't visit her too often is because of our hectic schedules, it's also because seeing her is so difficult. In addition to her very diminished communication skills (sometimes spending time with her feels like hanging around a brick wall), what further complicates the situation is past baggage. My grandmother was very narcissistic when she was younger, and while she didn't alienate her family completely, there was definitely bad blood between her and all of her children. Her daughters in law also have a lot of bad blood with her - it's hard not to, because she could be very nasty before the dementia set in. - and it's a *very* nice facility). As such, her other two children - my aunt and uncle - have essentially abandoned the situation. They don't come and visit her ever, and have placed the burden of her care on my father, because he's always been her ""favorite"" son (he's the oldest). I want to visit her more often, but being around her aggravates my own depression greatly and puts me in a very morbid mood. Both of my parents are older, so thinking about how this could happen to them makes me feel sick to my stomach. Being around someone who's quality of life is so poor, particularly when we weren't very bonded to begin with, is also hard - I feel like I'm too weak to deal with this. Advice?"
adtm6y," My grandmother has dementia, I’m not 100% sure as I don’t think anyone has officially had her tested, it’s just “dementia”. My grandmother has dementia, I’m not 100% sure as I don’t think anyone has officially had her tested, it’s just “dementia”. A couple of times I have found notes in her room with her name, my grandfathers name, their address and phone number, kids names, and usually the words “help” or “take me home”. Or should we look at sending her straight to a memory care unit?"

ht22nh,,"Grandma wants to go “home” hey guys, joined this sub for a little advice. my great grandma is 95 and has had alzheimers/dementia for a few years but it’s only gotten kind of bad the past year or so. me and a few other family members take turns coming to her house to watch her, and also have cameras at the house for when no one is there. 23 years ago, she moved out of the house she had been in for most of her life, and moved into her current house when she married her husband (he’s now passed away). her old house was sold to my aunt but it looks nothing like it used to, anyway. sometimes, like today, she’ll constantly say she wants to go home. when i say this is home, she’ll say something along the lines of “this is my home yes but i don’t live here, i want to go where i was this morning” even though she slept here the night before. i don’t have a car so i can’t bring her to my aunt‘s house anyway to go along with it, but even when someone else was here my aunt got tired of having to deal with her coming up there almost daily. what should i do in this situation?"
vrxgk6,,"How To Deal With Her Not Recognizing Her House my grandmother is mid stage, and in the past month or two, something new that has come up, is a couple times a week she will get upset and insist she's not in her house, despite living there for 51 years.  this will go on for hours, sometimes the whole day.  she gets very depressed and upset over it.  she remembers her address, she remembers the city, but she insists she is living in an apartment in ""a town i don't know the name of"" and goes on and on about how much she hates it there and wants to go home.  telling her it is her home, and trying to get her to recognize some of her belongings doesn't help, it just makes her very mad and she starts yelling that she's not crazy.  telling her she will be going home next week, and everything will be back to normal then doesn't help either.  she remains depressed and upset and lamenting about wanting to go home right away.  trying to redirect the conversation to another topic doesn't help either, she goes right back to talking about wanting to go home.  we're not sure *what* to say to her on the days she gets like this.  is this one of those things where there is nothing to do?  we just have to deal with her being upset/depressed on these days?"
io70fz,,"""I want to go home"" hi, i'm new to this sub. i just wanted to ask those of you who have parents or loved ones with dementia or alzheimer's what you say to your loved one who is asking to go home. my grandmother-in-law is getting to late stages, and every day she asks to go home, or says she's going home soon. she's been living with all of us (mil, wife, and me) for nearly 4 years, and we moved to tennessee almost exactly a year ago. she insists that she has friends somewhere else and she's going to go visit them... or something. i don't believe she has a troubling amount of anxiety during the day, not enough to say she wants to be safe, and they why she's asking. we think it's most likely that she's just remembering house she lived in before the stroke in florida, since it's the last place she had friends and such.  what do we tell her when she keeps begging and begging to go to a place she hasn't owned in half a decade?"
lb0jpk,,"How to deal with grandparent that thinks they aren't at home or that they constantly have to be going ""home""? my grandparent has vascular dementia and lives at home with one of her older children. i go over to help give company when i can, and i think the hardest part is making her feel at home. she constantly asks when we are leaving to go home, as she thinks she isn't in her house and wants to go back to what we assume is the house she grew up in with her parents in a different state. how can i answer her questions to make her feel at home? she mostly asks when we are leaving, if she needs money or how to pack for the trip. every day when it's not freezing outside and in some that it is she packs her car with random things like she is going somewhere or brings things up and down the stairs trying to get ready. we of course have the keys hidden but leave the car doors unlocked because she can get angry when her car isn't available to her. i've made a sign for her bedroom door that says her name and plan on making a memory book with a picture of her in her house with some family so she can maybe make the association on her own. but nothing really seems to make her feel better and she gets more and more restless and hard to deal with by the day.i usually try to answer that she is home and that her family lives with her, and try to point out things in the house that she knows are hers -paintings she has done, or take her to her room to give her a tour. sometimes she realizes that it is her house but usually not and she often answers with ""i didn't know that."" this is how every conversation goes and i just wonder if anyone has any tips for how to answer or make her feel more comfortable without trying to force the information on her?"
snhq8e,,"The starting signs of dementia, what are they? my grandmothers memory has been deteriorating for a while now but recently she has started forgetting a lot of conversations we've had and i'm starting to think she's forgot my visits too. she angry with me all the time, thinks i'm doing nothing to help her but i've been supporting her a lot. she's scared, i understand that but its heartbreaking knowing she is so angry when i'm trying my best. it's just me and her and i'm so out of my depth. we're no where near her needing to go in a home but she says she never wants to and i can just move in with her. but i know there will come a day i can no longer handle it by myself. i'm terrified of the future and i'm worried it's more than just bad memory due to her age."
kc18vq,,"I suspect my grandmother is developing dementia and need to know how to go about it a few years ago my grandmother was in hospital (aged 88) and because of the medication she was under, she kept showing common tropes of that of a person with dementia (delusion, forgetting peoples names, etc.) and was placed in a ward with patients of the same illness.she checked out of hospital after about a month and went back to normal every day life. she broke her hip last year and had to be in hospital again for about three months. she behaved the same kind of way she did last time and it took her a few days to fully recognise her house when she finally returned home (for the most part she would only recognise a couple bits of furniture).she's 91 now and she's aware her memory isn't what it used to be. she'll spend a great deal of time when i visit talking about the exact same things (religion, what she's watching on tv, etc.). i noticed last time i was there she confused me for my brother and kept referring to us by the wrong name. she also told us that she's lived in her house for the last sixty-odd years and raised six children there, as if my brother and i never knew that.a few months ago she asked to take a picture of my granda and brighten it up in photoshop since she never liked how it came out, and i brought it back a few months ago. last time i was down at her house with my brother she was convinced it was my brother that had altered the picture and even gave him money for it.i want to try and visit her as often as i can and i want to know what i can do to when i visit her (how to stay patient when she gets confused, how to keep her on track with the conversation, etc.). i know this may sound insensitive to some people on this sub and i apologise for that, but i don't know where else to go"
8a726n,,My 79 year old mom has dementia. She is calling almost daily looking for my dad that passed away almost 30 years ago. What is the best way to deal with this? in addition to the title we have a young couple that are providing day to day services for my mother so she can stay in her house. the problem is that she is now constantly convinced that my dad should be home any minute and calls me looking for him. it takes a few solid minutes of explaining that he passed away about 30 years ago and that i'm here for her. my question is...what is the best way to answer her questions? do i just keep explaining the current situation to her? is there a better option? i'm not a big reader but i'm open to suggestions on reading material regarding this situation. thanks reddit.
o1j3lh,,"How do we tell my grandma she’s moving to memory care? hi all, looking for advice.my grandma has short term memory loss that has progressed within the past 6 months.we had an at-home doctors/memory facility visit yesterday. she’s currently livid with my father for taking her car so she’s resentful of anything he does.long story short, today i asked her what she remembered about yesterday and she said “nothing.”so, with that being said, she’s on schedule to move within the next few weeks but due to her forgetting when she gets angry whenever her independence is questioned, we’re afraid of how to approach breaking the news to her.any advice would be great. thanks in advance!"
cb4h2j,,"Great Grandma With Dementia my great grandmother has been battling with dementia for the past couple years and just recently got officially diagnosed. i’ve been going over to her house a few times a week to help take care of her and i didn’t know it would be this hard. i love her to death and seeing her like this breaks my heart and i guess i’m just looking for other people who are experiencing the same thing. sometimes she has an idea of who i am but most of the time i’m pretty sure she has no idea. when i first started it wasn’t terrible because i didn’t mind talking about the same three things for eight hours straight but over time it has made me feel very sad and just.. brain dead i guess is the only way to describe it. she always thinks she still lives in arkansas where she grew up which i understand is very common in people with dementia and alzheimer’s. i’m not really sure what the point of this post is, i guess just to get these things off my chest and if anyone has any advise it would be greatly appreciated."

8egcx4,,"What to Say to Mom... my mom is 64 and has been experiencing dementia since feb 2016. from then until aug 2017, she was in a nursing home. she had a head injury and combined with her medications, she was super out of it in the beginning. over time, she improved to the point where my dad believed he could care for her at home. it quickly became apparent that her being home wasn’t going to work - she has no impulse control... she’s going to get what she wants, come hell or high water, regardless of what anyone says. one day, she snuck out of the house and took a ride from a stranger because my dad wouldn’t take her shopping.  after several weeks of stress, arguments, drama, and police intervention, we finally got her into a new nursing home with a locked dementia unit. she’s been in the new location since late october, and absolutely hates it. she is still in the “earlier” stages of dementia... she’s pretty with it most of the time. every time we visit, she’s constantly telling us she doesn’t belong there (most of the residents are significantly older and have much more advanced cases of dementia), and asks when she can go home. she’s in total denial that she has dementia, even though the doctors have told her she does. since october, she has caused quite a stir at her nursing home. in january, she tried to pack up all her stuff - she thought she was going home, even though nobody told her she was. she tried to reach something on a high shelf in her wardrobe, so she stepped up inside the cabinet. it wasn’t anchored to the wall, and fell over. mom ended up with a broken toe.  a few weeks later, she was repeatedly throwing herself out of bed. the nurses were concerned that she would injure herself beyond her toe, so she ended up staying in a mental hospital for a week. she has been known to scream for help when she needs something, rather than turning on her call light. in a recent care conference, i asked the social  worker if mom was going to be kicked out, and while she didn’t come right out and say yes, she did imply that if the behavior continued, it would be a possibility. last year, she had some baseline cognitive assessments done, and recently underwent the testing again to see if any progress was made.  in response to her latest queries about when she could go home, my dad told her we would see what the doctor had to say at her next appointment, and we’d go from there.  she translates this to mean that she can go home after her appointment. the doctor has already called my dad with the test results and has informed him that he recommends she stay in a locked dementia unit. mom is not going to take this news well.  i’m concerned that she is going to resume her negative behaviors and potentially get kicked out of her nursing facility. it was so hard to get her into this one, i don’t know what we’ll do if she gets kicked out... there are only so many facilities with locked units, and not all of them accept medicaid. just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and how you handled it... thanks for reading this long rant!"
3l6fa7,,"Need help with my mother , no clue what to do. hello , i have just turned 18 , my mother has alzheimer's and the situation is looking dire . she is only 52 , but im guessing its a pretty late stage . she has been repeating the same things for a long time now , she started packing/unpacking/moving things around for no reason the last month . she has a caregiver in the morning when i go to school and my dad is working , my grandma and i look after her in the afternoon (especially my grandma) and when my dad comes back home in the evening he stays with her. this whole responsability juggle works in theory , but its really breaking me , talking to her is really hard , she basically only says hello , and then asks when is my dad coming back home , is he gonna come back home , can she call him to know when he's coming back etc... she seems really troubled all the time my dad is not here and i dont know how to ease her up anymore , i researched and tried a lot of things (asking her about old photos , happy memories , trying to distract her ) but none of them seem to work anymore . she was literally shaking today because she wasnt sure if my dad was going to come back home... at this point i dont know what to do , i feel useless , and the thought that she is only going to get worse scares me a lot (i really fear the day she is not going to be able to recognize me). my grandma already had an heart attack last may because of this whole situation (she was the primary caregiver back then , now i help her out and it is only in the afternoon) so there is also that . sorry for the wall of text , but i am honestly getting desperate at this whole situation , and i see nothing but sadness in the next months/years of my life , if someone has any suggestions i would really appreciate it ."
ew9s02,,"So hard to talk to my mom because she has no short term memory and just wants to go home sorry if this is a long post....my mom's dementia leaves her with pretty much zero short term memory.  approximately 2 months ago she fell and was put in hospital.  my dad has done his best to care for her but he is 85 (mom is 83) and he just can't do it.   she is going to be pannelled and is in a transitional unit in a hospital.  all she wants to do is go home, she doesn't know why she is there (she had broken her shoulder, had an infection, and we found out she has lung cancer).   she consistently thinks she is leaving that day, she thinks she has been fine and doing everything at home (my dad has been doing everything for the last few years including meals, cleaning - all she would do was stay in a chair in her tv room as much as he tried to get her involved and go out).   visiting mom now consists of explaining why she is there (she doesn't have any recollection from minute to minute it seems of what we tell her), where she is, that we are always there (she is so lonely because no one ever visits - she doesn't ever remember anyone visiting her even though my dad is there twice every day and my sister and i try to be there alternating every 2-3 days).   she doesn't remember the people she sees every day at every meal.   i have been trying to do the distracting thing, telling her just gentle basic info that won't upset her (you are almost ready to go home, etc - although she will probably be in a pch) and then talking about the grandkids, family, weather and whatever else,  but it is getting harder and harder to distract her.   we don't know how much time she has left, and it is breaking my heart that all conversations just consist of ""i want to go home? what time is dad picking me up? why am i here?  i don't understand"" etc.   i don't care if she thinks i'm her sister (she does that a lot, and i'm fine with that, i don't even correct her - - if it makes her happy and talking about good memories, i'm all for it) but it is harder to get her on other topics.   also, her comprehension in general seems to be getting worse.     i know that everyone here is dealing with some form of dementia, alzheimers and so forth, and i'm hoping that you can let me know how you deal with a parent or loved one in this situation, and how do you get beyond it emotionally?   i hate myself for saying this, but it makes it so difficult to visit her.  thank you for any advice you can give."
ky6nnl,,"Any suggestions for having a serious conversation about putting mom with dementia into a facility/home? hey all! i hope this post doesn't become super long, but i do have a particular tendency to ramble. apologies in advance. i was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation like my sister and i are. some background: we're both now 29, and mom started exhibiting radical personality shifts and coming up with strange memories as far back as when we were 17 or 18, maybe a little younger. by the time we were 19, we approached my dad to discuss our concerns. dad has been difficult, to put it mildly. power dynamics have been a prominent part of family life. as a result, reasonable discussions with dad about mom's health have been a mixed bag over the years. his long-lasting denial was a huge roadblock. sister moved away several years ago, so her role is now long-distance caregiver, while my dad and i are living together at home with mom. late this year he intends to retire, sell the house, and move across the country (us). his plan is to take care of her himself, hire in-home nurses, etc. mom is, i would say, solidly in stage 6: severe cognitive decline. there's going to be a big chunk of the safety network gone once he moves, as i'm not staying with them. while i'll be flying out with them initially to spend some time with relatives, my final destination is to be moving in with a friend and solidly distancing myself from him and mom. i know my dad better than to think he truly sees me as an important or meaningful part in the equation of my mom's care, so we'll just leave it at that.""we'll cross that bridge when we get there"" is how he handles most things relating to mom's dementia. sister and i firmly believe mom should be in a home or facility, or at least taken to a decent daycare facility. we have firmly believed that for a few years now. when we've tried to broach the subject with him, it never goes anywhere. he seems to feel he can truly handle the end-stage with her at home, whereas my sister and i don't feel he has the correct temperament or experience to handle it. does anyone have advice for how to get through to someone like this? he's wrapped up in his head. convincing him that you might have a valid point is difficult, sometimes impossible. he ran from the responsibility of this for *years*. he has historically taken it as a personal offense about how he cares for her when sister and i discuss her quality of life. and i wish i could say it's a personal offense because he wants to do his best for her, because he loves her, but it's always come from a place of pride. he doesn't want his daughters questioning what he does, because he never wants anyone questioning him. mom has just.. languished for years. left to drive for far too long, left alone for far too long, left to do *nothing* because she can't do anything stimulating without another person helping her. sister and i have felt helpless and crazy so many times throughout this ordeal. this turned into a super long ramble, i'm so sorry. i already cut out a bunch. any help in advance is much appreciated."
rhr2e8,,"VENT: Frustrated, want to leave home, having mixed feelings forgive me for this is going to be a long story.hi! so for context, i have a grandmother who’s probably 100+ years old (father’s side) with insanely terrible dementia. my parents are the only caretakers despite my dad having older siblings (he’s the youngest). she’s been staying with us for several years now as she was in a different country before and it’s just getting worse. i feel incredible sad and sorry for my parents who have sacrificed their time and insanity to take care of someone who’s extremely loud and abusive (verbally and physically) to everyone. she screams calling for her older son who lives literally next door. they refuse to take her in because of her behavior. they’ve completely ignored their responsibilities of taking care of their mother and thus my parents have no other choice but to keep her with us. i wake up early in the morning because of her screams. oftentimes, she does not sleep and will talk and scream for about 3 nights in a row. i know my parents are fully exhausted to the core which is why i keep telling them to ask my dad’s brother to take her even just for a few months but they don’t even try asking. it frustrates me that i want to be able to help them and lighten their responsibilities but it;s like they refuse to be helped. my mother does everything for her; cook, wash her, do her laundry, etc. she always verbally (even physically) abuses my mother, sometimes my father, and i just can;t take it anymore. it also affects me and my sisters because our house isn’t big so we can hear her all the time. my sisters are studying and i work at home. my family is also traditional so they will never have her live in facilities.i’m frustrated and want to cry looking at my tired parents because i know they want this to be over. i’m about to cry as i type this because i just have a lot of emotions. today was too much for and i’m at my limits. i want to run away from this house and live far away where i can’t hear her screaming for her other son. i feel angry, tired, and guilty of all this and i don’t even know what to do or think anymore. i love my parents but i don’t want them suffering from a this. if you’ve reached the end thank you very much.tldr; i’m going crazy trying to help my parents because of my grandmother with the worst case of dementia possible"

3ttjvb,,"I feel like I can't do it anymore. im not sure if there's another subreddit maybe i should post on, but here goes.in the past year, both my parents (dad 78, mom 75) have been diagnosed with dementia. dad's is more mild (mostly cognitive impairment), mom is alzheimer's. we had to move them into assisted living this summer—separately, because mom's dementia and delusions and agitation was pulling dad down a downward spiral.its been a few months now, and things have settled down a bit—though i now realize things never really ""settle down."" but i can't bear to see or call my mom much. now that i know shes being taken care of i find that i'm trying to close the door on her to save my sanity.i see my dad at his residence every other week—we laugh, and have lunch and talk, sometimes do puzzles and stuff.  he's changed a lot, but is still a person and i feel like its worth the hour-and-a-half trip to build on the relationship we have. mom is declining fast. when i visit, she's just fixated on leaving and being reunited with my dad, her husband of 55 years. (they get together once or twice a week—either i or my brother bring him over).she knows who i am, but nothing really sticks, and its the same 2-3 questions over and over. shes not really clear on where she is, or whats happening to her. i feel like 10 minutes after i leave its like i never came.my mother was an over-intellectual, opinionated, demanding spitfire of a woman. seeing her like this is eating me alive. i want to do everything and anything i can to bring her any relief or comfort, but i also pray for her to die.i feel like i'm slipping in quicksand. i get anxiety attacks just calling her—and the calls are just 5-6 minutes long with nothing really said.i have a brother who lives closer, and is very involved in both my parents lives. he hasn't given me a hard time, but part of my issue is trying to make sure i'm doing my share.how do you find the balance between obligation and survival? i feel like i'm at war with myself—part of me says ""you're selfish, you're lazy."" and part of me says ""save yourself."" i know thats normal in this situation, but how can i least start to heal, and find that balance?"
l10qa9,,"First time posting, need advice please:( i live with my grandma, 82, and my mom. my grandma has pretty bad dementia but its just recently been getting worse and worse and we sometimes don't know what to do about it. we are struggling hard at not snapping at her when she sees stuff or tries to do things. its hard but we are trying. one concern is when she tries to do things she physically can't. how do i get her to stop without getting her upset? she thinks she's young and can do it all. the biggest problem we are having right now is she thinks she isn't home some nights when its the worst. she will scream at us and cry and persist that she isn't home and she needs to be taken home right now. she will refuse to take off her shoes and won't listen to us trying to calmly tell her she is home. i've gotten her to calm down a couple times by walking with her to her bedroom, showing her all my deceased grandpas things and making her understand she is home but there has to be a better way. she sat and cried for 15 minutes straight tonight bc she didn't understand why we wouldn't just take her home. im younger, 25, and i think she's beginning to not recognize me, so she thinks i'm a stranger and it fuels her thinking she isn't home. its breaking my heart. i think her head is about 20 years back rn, which would make sense as to why she can't recognize me and why she thinks she isn't home, because she didn't live here then. any advice? i'm becoming lost as to how to help her."

We think my mom has the early signs of dementia and we don’t know to approach it. my(31) mom(63) has always been a loud, vocal and very independent person. over the last year and a bit we noticed a backwards slide which we thought was due to age but now we aren’t too sure.from being a loud person she has suddenly become very withdrawn and quiet and won’t interact with you unless you start the interaction.her short term memory has become really bad (she forgets full days and conversations) and things that she used to be on top of (like finances) have become a bit of a disaster.she is almost completely reliant on my dad and follows him around, will not leave his side and needs instructions from him.i think we have all been in denial about this but it’s become so glaringly loud that we can’t ignore it and don’t know what to do.i know we need to get my mom to a doctor, but she has become so stubborn and i don’t know how we are going to do it. i don’t know if i (i know my dad isn’t) am ready to sit down and talk to her about something like this... how do i talk to her about something like this??anyway, sorry for my rambling. i’ve been so lost and anxious this last week."

(actually that is also not an option but the only response i can offer to her insistence ). she insists she is in fine health now and can go back home. most often in anger, she cuts my calls. how can i turn the conversation to other things? is this the only conversation we will have for the rest of her good life? i miss her old self.  to those who have a similar situation - what do you talk to your parent over the phone when visiting is not an option daily.tldr - my sister recently shifted my mom to a dementia care centre but didn't tell her it's forever so she thinks it was only until her head injury healed. now that it has, she is waiting to be discharged. she calls me daily at all hours to demand this. both of us live in different countries.  she is also very angry with my sister for admitting her there and leaving the country. due to her temper, my younger sis has stopped calling her. at what stage do i tell her she is admitted there forever as both i and my sister are scared of her heart condition."

c7xddc,,"So yesterday was the first time my Grandma forgot who i was my (30m) grandmothers (88) dementia has progressed a lot over the last 2 years. it went from basic things to her not being able to hold a conversation or being left alone. i realize this is the unfortunate path of the disease but it never gets easier. i have lived with her my entire life and have grown from her taking care of me to me now helping take care of her. she always been there, always gives me a reason to smile, even now. the realization that she might have to be put in a home came up the other day and i can't imagine that being any easier for my mother to come to terms with than it was for me. this is going to be hard and i can't help but feel guilty already as she cries when she is alone for a little and is terrified of dying alone. sometimes i hope she passes peacefully in her sleep. i hope i get to be there when she does. i hope i get to hold her hand."

sw2a2b,,"newly diagnosed family--advice or kind words? hi all. my mom has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia at the age of 73 and is struggling badly with the diagnosis and her changing cognitive ability. she is likely experiencing some sundowner-like symptoms. she is crying a lot, often in the evenings, repeating things like ""i just want to be me"". she's always been a powerhouse in the family, thinking of herself as a bit of a matriarch--always caring for others, taking care of house and home, etc. very ""in control"" of herself and, in her eyes, her family. that said, she's clearly not coping with me needing to take over handling the finances, or my sibling and i doing more around the house. i've tried to get her to talk about what she's feeling. i imagine there is a grieving process involved here, voluntary or involuntary, for all of us. she's also been a caretaker for our father for a few years now--he is not in good shape physically, and we are faced with the fact that we will need to move them out of their house and into a place that is equipped to care for them. my wife and live out of state, but i'm within a day's drive and am spending more time with my parents as i can. my sibling lives in here in the same town with them.last week, her doc told her that this could be the most difficult time of her illness because she is still alert enough to be aware of it and of her mental struggles. she even hinted that things would get easier when she is no longer cognitively aware enough to know of her illness. i don't know the truth of that, but i'm reaching out here, with tears in my eyes, asking for kind words and any advice."

gunpel,,"I just need to vent! my great grandma was diagnosed with dementia when i was in middle school, i’m 22 now and she’s been living with us for about 9 years. when she got sick all of her kids abandoned her and said that we caused her to have a nervous breakdown, they now pretend she’s dead and have left all of the “mess” to her granddaughter (my mom) and all of her great grandkids. my grandma has been slowly getting worse and worse and it’s been incredibly hard for everyone here. she has some good days where she is in a good mood and then bad days where she’s super combative and screams at people, screams if you try to help her or anything. my mom has been away on vacation for a couple days so i’ve been home with my grandma with very little help (my sister is basically nocturnal so she takes over at night if my grandma gets up). lately as soon as i wake up in the morning my grandma is already up and yelling for my mom. she often does that even if she actually doesn’t need anything, she’ll call on her way to the bathroom, while she’s watching tv anything really. past couple days as soon as she wakes up she’s already really pissed off and hard to handle. the other day she had very quietly taken off her underwear (diaper) and then put on a pair of pants on each one of her legs and then peed all over herself. i got that lovely present as soon as i came downstairs in the morning 😂. today she’s already decided she doesn’t want to properly use her walker and when i tried to help her she started screaming at me. i’m just so done and so tired. it’s slightly taboo to vent frustrations to anyone who doesn’t understand alzheimer’s and hasn’t cared for them. all i hear is “think of how scary it is for her” and i get that but that will never take away my frustrations. i was supposed to be going on a vacation as soon as my mom got home, to get a break from my grandma, but my friend (rightfully) went to a blm protest so now i can’t be anywhere near her for risk of exposure to covid for my grandma so i have to cancel the whole thing. it’s only 9:30 and i just want to have a nice cry. thanks for reading if you did! if anyone has any experience with this please feel free to share i just don’t know anymore."
rohv89,,"Help with reorganizing? hello all,just some background:i (32m) have been caring for my mom (70, early to mid alz/dementia) and my father (74, cancer) for over a year. unfortunately my father's battle with cancer was lost earlier this month (rip, he went peacefully). here's where i seek advice. i'm picking up the pieces at the moment between financials, caring for my mother, etc, and i know one of the cardinal rules for caring for a loved one with dementia is not to break routine and structure, but my father was her rock and kept her grounded in life so that's already a big challenge. unfortunately his passing comes with quick changes around the house, reorganizing, etc. i have to think both emotionally and practically. long story short...we need to clear the house, and her inability to cope with losing things is rooted so far in her past that it would be an issue even without the mental conditions. i obviously have my own personal concerns but i'll leave those out.what would be the best methods to ease her into a change mindset? she was gifted a new purse today and the stress of moving things from the old broken and ratty bag to the new one caused her to snap at my sister. if this is a indicator of what is to come with the house as a whole, i don't know if we will be able to plan rationally. i want her to be as involved as possible and am willing to compromise.i love my mother but taking control of the family at 32 while trying to regain a lost 1+ of my own life plans is daunting. i know i will have to be the one to compromise and adapt, but it's still a bit depressing. any advice from veteran caretakers?"

d3dn4n,,"Need some advice for dealing with a difficult parent with Alzheimer’s and the power dynamic that my parents had that is now working against starting the care my Mom needs. to being with my mother was diagnosed with dementia (probably alzheimer’s from having a grand-mother go through it but getting her to go back to the doctors has been difficult) about six months ago.  at that time they called us and told us what was going on and that they would like us to move home (we live about a 14 hour drive away from them at the moment) and build an extra house on their property to be able to help my father out with the long term care that my mother will require.  me and my wife agreed and made plans to move back home in about 2 months from that time.  we decided with my father that we would take what is my mothers workshop (she does crafts for a living) and use that to live in while the house was being built.  at first this was fine, then as things started coming out of the shop my mothers attitude changed and became aggressive towards my father about the changes being done.  it finally came to a crashing halt about a month before we were set to move back in a phone call that had my father just say forget the whole thing.  luckily my wife could rescind her notice to her work and we hadn’t given notice to where we rent but it was still a bit jarring to say the least.fast forward to this last week back home visiting them.  my mother is farther along than i realized from the phone conversations i’ve been having with her.  she repeats herself sometimes within just minutes of saying something and forgets she’s the one that came up with certain ideas just earlier in the day.  she’s always had a problem with not letting go of the past and complaining a lot but now with alzheimer’s its gone to a whole new level.  it’s like all the crappiest things that ever happened to her is on constant rewind in her head.  this of course has not helped my parents relationship.  my father has always kind of just let my mother be in charge and given her a bit of a wide-berth on anything she had an issue with.  so now that dynamic between them is keeping us from going forward with any real help for them.  he needs help because he cant leave her alone and no one is there to really help him.  i’m an only child and they really don’t have anyone else to lean on for help.  even if he could find someone to come sit with her so he could get some time away she would just hold it over is head that he left her for how ever long before the next thing happens that bothers her.  i see this already aging him (he’s 73) and its not even been a year yet.  my mother can be a very sweet person but she had a difficult childhood and tends to linger on the negatives and isn’t able to move on or fully forgive.  so here’s my dilemma.  me, my wife and my father all want us living next to them to be able to help him moving forward with her.  my wife has medical assistant training and worked in a nursing home for years so she has hands on experience with this.  we’ve been renting for years and we’ve already been looking into buying a house so being able to build a house for us on my childhood homestead which me and my wife love would be nice.  also being able to help my mother through this would be rewarding for myself.  my mother has and even is at times on board with all of this, until she’s sat and worried about it so much that she freaks out on my father about it, and then when it gets to the nuclear level he caves.  me and my wife have i think been able to finally get him to see that he needs to take the wheel and make some hard decisions even when there is going to be a fight involved at some point.  he agrees but to be honest i’m not sure if i can fully trust him on it since he always does cave in the end, its what happened six months ago and i don’t know if he’ll do it again when push comes to shove.so now the question is how do we get her onboard with this.  my father needs it to happen so i don’t end up losing him from the stress alone and we need to have some stability in knowing how to plan our lives moving forward.  the plan is as of now for us to move back home in may and start building a house on their property close enough to their house to help but not so close as to be in their way.  the idea of changing any part of their house always ends in her freaking out eventually about it, even if it was originally her idea.  for right now i convinced my father to take my mother out of the discussion process of this as it seems giving her any information to dwell on usually leads to her worrying about it until she lays into him about it.  we don’t want to just surprise her with it but i’m also not sure how to approach it in a positive way but with the understanding that this isn’t really a decision she can veto.  if anyone has any suggestions or best practices in dealing with maybe something similar to my situation i am all ears.  i looked up a lot of best practices but those are more general and i’m in need of a bit of nuance.  any help would be much appreciated."

awpv92,,"My grandma has dementia my (24m) gram is 84 years old and has dementia. she played a very significant role in my upbringing and i love her to death. she made us and especially me her priority growing up couldn’t be any more kind, gentle and caring. my grandpa died three years ago and really set things in motion i think for the disease taking control of her life. she no longer can live by herself and has been moving back in forth between my families house and my aunt and uncles house 4 hours away, staying for about 4 months each time. she stays in a room next to mine which is connected by a door. each night, sometimes up to nine times, she opens that door and peeks in to see who is there. the disease doesn’t allow her to remember that it is my bedroom, therefor every time it’s as if she is seeing me for the first time that day, and is relieved. she asks if i want to come in and watch tv or look at pictures with her because she doesn’t like being alone. she was married to my grandpa for around 63 years and honestly was not alone very much of her life, so this i understand. i also understand that she no longer recognizes our house our house. when i watch tv with her in her bedroom at night, she will say things like “why are all my things here? we’re leaving tomorrow morning to go to the next house”. she also has paranoia about other people being in the house, so she will say she needs to pack her things just in case the people think about stealing something of hers. her bags will be packed in the morning. she will often times pace the house late at night, and i will sometimes find her and take her back to bed and explain to her that we are home. “my parents are asleep, my siblings are asleep, and your room is right next to mine. it’s okay gram, it’s just us and we are perfectly sound and safe, let’s get back to bed”. she will go back to bed and feel better after that. every morning she wakes up and does not know where she is. sometimes it’s as if it is 2008, sometimes it is 2000 or sometimes it is 2019. she will peek through the door to my bedroom in the morning and see me and be instantly relieved she sees someone she knows. it makes me really happy to see her happy in that moment. my gram is also to the point where bathing and self care has declined. she can go weeks without showering but when asked says she showered this morning. it’s also to the point where she doesn’t brush her teeth, and when she goes to the bathroom it is always diarrhea, so cleaning herself is a necessity. when asked to bathe or shower she gets defensive and counters with remarks such as “you’re the one who needs to shower, you smell.” it has become an extreme stress for myself and my family. my gram also has glaucoma so her eyesight is iffy, causing her to have paranoia with what she sees combined with dementia. she will think she sees people in the yard while looking out of the window, and think they are stealing things out of the shed. she hasn’t driven in years, but thinks on the daily her car was stolen because it’s not in the driveway and she drive here this morning. her overall personality is changing, along with her memories and perspectives. it is hard to think positive most days because dementia is a disease that has no positives, only negative declines. i am mostly a reader here on reddit, but for some reason felt the need to post what is going on an what i’m feeling. with past dealings of depression and anxiety within myself, dealing with the progression of dementia within my gram has been really difficult."

eo539k,,"Advice on how to speak to my Mom my 71 year old mother has been dealing with alzheimer's for many years. i've been bathing her about a year now. dad turns off gas and locks doors ( supplying details to give a frame of reference ).she often talks about going home to check on her parents (gone for 20 years) or kids (i'm her youngest at 34 years old) or whatever. she yells at my dad to take her home all the while saying their current home  is actually her house her dad got for her (it isn't).we are managing, but what's best to say to her? when she pleads to me to pick her up and take her home? most if the time, i can change the topic and she forgets eventually, but sometimes she gets fixated. do i go pick her up and drive around? do i gently remind her she is home? do i just listen? what's best in your experiences?"
ltgslc,,"Is my grandmother showing early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease? my grandma recently turned 84. she has been a strong-willed, smart, and independent woman for years and still is to this day. she raised seven children and went through a troublesome marriage for years. it’s fair to say she’s been through hell and back. she’s one of my role models and i hope i can be as good of a person as she is one day. however, in recent years, especially the last few, my family and i have noticed a slip in memory and very slight personality changes. most of these things are small and not significant. in the past year, these things have slowly become more noticeable. i do not live far away from my grandmother and am with her almost everyday for hours at a time. (i’m still in school) i’m really grateful to be able to be around her often because it’s a blessing for any elderly person to have company. when i’m talking with her, i never notice a large difference from how she’s been for years. she rarely asks me a question twice... the exception may be if she asks where our cats are. i may let one outside and a few minutes later she will be unsure of where it is. she has had me help with writing out bills/important forms for the past 2 years...but could still do it herself if she needed to do so. i do notice that it takes her longer to think of the right words to use or to describe what she’s talking about. she also occasionally forgets to take her “morning” medication and will end up taking it around noon or 1:00. but this doesn’t happen all the time. she doesn’t use technology besides tv. i’ve noticed she sometimes struggles to use the same remote she’s used for the past ten years. not with changing the channel or anything, just turning it on and off. we have to use multiple buttons to get everyone off. she rarely ever calls people on the house phone unless they call her and she can easily find the missed calls. i think she has slowly developed issues with organization for awhile now, she receives so much mail and can almost never sort through it all. i feel like any issues she has relate to short-term memory though.she is a very active lady. it’s not an uncommon occurrence to see her outside working in flowers or the garden. this was the case this past summer too. she doesn’t get lost or become disoriented while out in public. we haven’t been in stores much since covid but when we do go she doesn’t act any different than she did before. but she rarely goes alone and hasn’t for years. i have no idea if she would still be able to drive and direct herself. (she was never one that went out everyday anyway. ) when she is with me, she knows where we are in town and doesn’t act confused. she still does dishes, laundry, etc.(she has lost an interest in cooking for a long time now. i wouldn’t contribute that to memory, even when i was younger and she was in her early to mid-70s she claimed “i cooked for years with my kids, it isn’t much fun no more” and would laugh. nonetheless, she still makes soup or easy to make items.) i hate to write so much, but i promise i am getting to where i begin to have real concerns...in late 2019, my grandmother had a knee replacement after suffering with knee pain for years. it would hurt for her to walk, and it was a relief for her to get the surgery. (i’m so thankful she got it before covid, because she almost postponed until the spring.) she recovered with no issue and walks perfectly now. but before surgery, she would get her hair done once a week. she used to paint her nails often. and she would always try to wear “pretty” outfits. after the surgery and since the pandemic began, i’ve noticed a decline. she just seems sad and doesn’t seem to be her old self. (she has suffered from depression in the past) i know the pandemic has been hard on almost everyone, but i just have a weird feeling that my grandmother has begun to lose hope and will never be the same. when talking with her recently, she expressed some concern about her memory when i asked. and she even went as far to say, “i know i probably have alzheimer’s or am developing it. but i can’t sit and fret about it everyday. there’s nothing i can do, so i’d rather not discuss it.” when i pressed further about why she has lost hope, she said that she feels like “she goes backwards instead of forward” and that it “doesn’t matter anyway” because “no one comes to visit.” she is very aware of the pandemic and has taken all precautions...but our family did visit more in the summer and fall. i know the winter has been bad with covid..but we did have a few small get-togethers individually socially distanced. she’s always been a people person and i think seeing almost no one besides me has taken a toll. she doesn’t seem to struggle with personal hygiene. she can’t easily take baths or showers anymore because of balance and other issues. she can take a bath or shower if someone is here, and i usually am. but i know she fears falling otherwise. so, she usually bathes at the sink. i will add that she hates to wash her hair...and i don’t think it has anything to do with her forgetting about it. she has always had her hair styled and curled with hairspray. in the past year, she hasn’t had her weekly appointments and only goes maybe once every month or 2 months to get it cut. the risk of covid is an issue, and she doesn’t want to get out as much...i understand that. but it’s also a depression issue i feel like too. she still wears appropriate clothing and matches with the season. she just lacks motivation more so now. and she has had a yearly health checkup in recent months, no concerns were ever brought to anyone else. i know her provider has asked about memory before and has given her small “written tasks.” so she must be okay if no health professional has large concerns?... she still gets dressed up and does everything like she used to when she *has* too. but discretionary events never seem to interest her and she will try to get out of them if she can.the most concerning thing probably happened in the past few weeks. we live in a rural area so we have a field and an empty house next door and there are some vehicles left behind... a few days ago, my grandmother claimed there were people in the vehicle “a woman with sunglasses” and when we had snow “there were people up in the field.” there are trees and bushes so i’m wondering if it is a vision issue partly. (i hope) she has had cataract surgery and has a prism in her glasses so she won’t see double (the issue is mostly when she drives.) but she was very adamant about it and no one was actually there. she understood after i explained to her but has brought it up again since. every time it’s the same “woman” but even my grandma is starting to realize no one is there. because she doesn’t “move around” apparently... this issue has happened no where else. when we were out in public she didn’t complain once about seeing something that wasn’t there. so i’m hoping that’s just a vision thing 🤞🏻 and for further reference, my great grandmother (her mother) had alzheimer’s for many years and finally reached the point where she could no longer do basic functions. (eat, drink, etc.) she was 86. my grandmother was the primary caregiver for her so she has told me many stories. i hate to write all of that and not be concise and clear about what her symptoms are...but it’s not one thing or another and i can’t really summarize without explaining personal stories. if you read this, thank you and i’m sorry for taking sooo long. i personally feel like my grandma is probably developing mild/early alzheimer’s. i would just like reassurance if any can be given. it scares me to death that she may have this awful disease. but i’m also still very thankful that she is still largely the same person i have always known. she has lived 84 long years and i pray she has many more. i’m so blessed that i have been able to live close to her and spend time with her more than almost anyone in the family. and i find peace knowing that she will have people no matter the  outcome. thank you again for reading!"
hz2kfb,,"reminding an alzheimers patient that a loved one is dead hey. my grandmother (88) has alzheimers/dementia. it was at an okay stage but it deteriorated when my aunt, her youngest daughter who lived with her and her kids, got cancer and eventually died less than a year later. she saw her body so that she would believe us and grieved and cried and everything. afterwards, my other aunts started having her stay with them for a while and she was basically moving between like 3 houses every couple of months which i now realize is really bad as this destroys routine and consistency but what's done is done. anyway, she finally returned home yesterday which she didn't remember at all or her grandkids who lived there until she actually saw the house. when she got there she began to ask about my aunt. she can't speak very well and her sentences are very very loose and vague but we can make out that she's asking about her. it's been brought up a couple of times and no one know show to address. we just switch conversations and try to distract her. we're not sure if we should keep doing this or show her a picture of her and ask her if this is the person she's asking about? but to do that we'd have to be ready to tell her she's no longer around and deal with the circumstances of that.i think it wouldn't hurt her to forget about her as incredibly painful as that sounds considering she took care of her all her life. it would only cause pain and confusion. i'm not sure what to do."

dk2jc7,,"Just wanted to share a happy/amusing tidbit. so just some backstory, my grandmother is 84, and she's had dementia for quite a few years, but it's very gradual, fortunately. she still remember names, but most of the time she is not able to match the names correctly anymore. we've moved for 8 months now, but there are times she thinks that it's a hotel and she wants to go home, or she just want to go back to the old house. so sometimes she really leaves and goes out, but we have a helper at home whose priority is to follow her if she goes out when no one is at home. so yesterday, in the late morning, she left again, and i went to bring her home because she was acting up and imagining things happening to her again. at one point, she said that she didnt know who i was. normally she does, because we live together, but of late there are times when she doesnt. so after i brought her home, i drove her out for lunch. on the way home, i asked her again, whether or not she recognises me. and again, she doesnt. the conversation is as follows, and in mandarin:me: do you know who i am?   grandma: no.   me: if you dont know who i am, arent you afraid to be in the car with a stranger?   gm: no. i'm not even afraid of guys, why would i be afraid of a girl? i know qi gong (taichi). she is 142cm and like 35kg. but she is fearless, bless her. typing this out now seems like it's nothing much, yet i had a good laugh when it happened. i guess i just wanted to share, that despite all the depressing shit that comes along with dementia, there are also times when a comment comes along that lightens the situation, or that things might not be as bad as they seem, and that they're still there behind all that. while dementia patients have it bad, a lot of credit have to go to the caretakers as well, and that'd be whoever is reading this, so keep up the good work! and remember that your life is still yours, and you still need to do your own thing and not be suffocated by the caretaking."

a19y2o,,"Grandma and Me i recently found this subreddit and i’m hoping to pull support and well as support others going through similar situations. i just needed a place to vent and clear my thoughts. please let me know if this isn’t right place. my grandma was diagnosed with both dementia and alzheimer’s back in the late 1990s. i understand how lucky my grandma and my family are that she didn’t show tell-tale signs until 2008-ish. my whole life, my grandparents helped raise me and my three siblings. my father’s house was conveniently next door to them. my brothers and i loved it! eventually, my grandma wanted to move 6 hours north of where we lived. their home would be in the middle of no where. we simply thought they wanted to spend their golden years in a area similar to both of their home states. when we would go up for visits, we realized she was having more and more difficulty in the day to day. she would feed her mini-horses 5 or more times because she would simply forget. it  would get worse. she wouldn’t follow a conversation and get frustrated. as a young child, i didn’t know much and i got frustrated with her. a cardiac event in 2016-ish caused her and my grandpa to move back to the city. she was flown from her property to the hospital near her. it could have been much worse. we are forever grateful this was done before the golden hour was up. unfortunately, things got worse. in december 2016, i remember getting a call from my aunt, explaining a terrible incident that had happened. i had to rush over to practically baby-sit my grandma. my grandpa desperately needed a break. skip to the next week, we had no choice but to place her in a group home. she had completely forgotten who her husband was. it was now a unsafe place for him. she believed he was a terrible man, doing terrible things to her. my grandpa was a sweet, caring man. i saw her occasionally but it wasn’t enough. i kept kicking myself to see her but it was so rough. i couldn’t do it. i just couldn’t. my grandpa’s health was worsening too. he was in and out of the hospital all throughout 2017. unfortunately he passed in january 2018, just shortly after his 79th birthday. it was rough and my own resentment to myself was only getting worse. i did not see her from early 2017 to literally today. i forced myself to drive to her. her group home is in my own neighborhood. i’m so glad i saw her. she remembered my face and we talked about whatever she wanted. of course, the conversation didn’t flow but i didn’t care. i was with my grandma. i couldn’t believe i had forgotten what her face looked like with her wrinkles, how her blue eyes shined bright when she was happy. i realize i am lucky to have her remember me and i promised to her i will see her more often."
peuj0u,,"Extremely inconsistent dementia? my grandma is 90 and has had dementia for over 5 years now. it’s bad (she doesn’t recognize the house she lives in now and has lived in for 70 years) but sometimes it’s exponentially worse than others. yesterday she didn’t recognize her friend from childhood that she’s talked to every day for 80 years on the phone, or the caretaker that’s living with her, and insisted she was being held prisoner and wanted to escape. today she acted like nothing happened yesterday and has been mostly with it (except she still doesn’t recognize the house). the only difference is that today, a family member visited and took her out of the house. grandma has been much calmer and less combative and delusional. is it common for someone with dementia to have such huge swings like this? what can cause such rapid shifts day to day and is there any way to prevent them?"

rgk9zg,,"Visiting grandma with dementia hi everyone, i'm a bit torn about this so i thought maybe someone here had some helpful advice.my grandma (92) lives in a nursing home, and has dementia. she hid it for a good while, but it became apparent just how bad it is when my grandpa died last year. she thinks she is temporarily in the hospital and wants to go home, but by home she means the family farm, where she hasn't lived since she was a teen. she sometimes recognizes my dad and aunt, but often she doesn't, since she thinks they are kids. other than them i don't think she recognizes a lot of people very often.and here is my dilemma: my dad recently mentioned to me that she might be getting close to death and if i would want to visit her a last time i should do so soon. my grandma was a lovely part of my childhood and it pained me so much that i didn't get to see my grandpa before he died. but on the other hand, she will most likely have no idea who i am, but she will fake it since she has gotten used to that after hiding it for so many years. so maybe a visit will just stress her out without doing anything good for her? right now my last moment with her was at my granddads funeral where she in a clear moment marched over to me, took my hand, looked deeply into my eyes and said ""he loved you very much you know?"" which is quite lovely.so yeah, i'm torn about if i should go see her or not, thoughts and advice is appreciated"

hvjl8g,,"Help! Moving mother to dementia care hi. thanks for taking the time to read (and maybe respond) to this. 5 days ago i moved my mother, 80, into dementia care. she has alzheimers and had been living alone. she was kind of managing, with me doing everything, plus a cleaner to deal with all the food she'd leave rotting in the sink etc, but had no short term memory (eg we'd order food somewhere and 30 seconds later would try and order again) and very confused long term memory (couldn't remember her brother had died, or where i had grown up, for example). she was right on the precipice of getting lost; couldn't remember her address and would frequently ask how to get home from the one local restaurant she would go to—50m from her flat. she  often gets confused about whether she was awake or dreaming etc.so, based on that and advice from doctor and family (my aunt is a retired aged care nurse) moved her into a home. she thinks it temporary while work is done on her apartment. she is very unhappy and i can understand why. it's a really nice home in a modern building with a garden, hair dressers, cafe and quite a lot of residents; certainly not cheap. but despite her memory issues and confusion, she is still quite alert and in much better shape than most of the residents; lots of people in wheelchairs nodding off etc. of course, she thinks she is totally fine and looks around at all the ""old people"" who ""have dementia… or worse!"" and is very disturbed. she's refuses to try and talk to anyone and just hides out in her room.basically she is caught in the grey area between not being able to safely operate in the world, but not being so out of it that she just takes it all in her stride. with covid re-spiking in sydney (by 'spiking', i mean 12 cases yesterday), the homes have all gone back in to lock down so only window visits and no taking her out.my great fear is that i have put her in too early. the home and her friends say no. i'm struggling with a lot of guilt, grief and anxiety about what i've done. does anyone have any experience they could share about this issue—ie a parent being put in care who can't seem to find other residents at 'their level' and how to maybe make her life easier for her?thanks!"

qa9jux,,"I don't know what to do. hello. my grandmother has dementia, i recently found out. although i kind of knew that she was showing symptoms of it, now i realize how bad it actually is. my mother doesn't really have a strong relationship with my grandmother, they normally see each other once or maybe twice a year, they also live pretty far away from one another. i think when we visited my grandmother in 2018, she was already being a bit forgetful: occasionally repeating words and phrases in sentences. in 2019/begin 2020 we visited her again, she did not seem to recognize me at first when she opened the door. she went upstairs, and showed us cabinets and wardrobes full off unnecessary stuff, which she compulsively bought. rows and rows of the same cleaning product, toilet paper, et cetera. i don't think that we really visited her after that. (until recently)just a few weeks ago, my grandmother (she is usually very cold and blunt) called my mother in a deeply emotional state, begging her to come by once. my mother asked if it was okay to see her that same day, which my grandmother initially accepted.however, just 30 minutes or so before the appointment she said she wasn't 'feeling well' so my mother shouldn't come. she didn't, but a couple of days later she did. when my mother arrived, she found her own mother lost in dementia. my grandmother has formed this narrative which she says every single time when she's talking to someone: ""oh, did you know i got fired from my job? the business closed down."" this was 15 years ago.""hey, i renovated my kitchen."" 10 years ago. yesterday, i went with my mother to see my grandmother. she did not recognize both of us. we brought some food, because she is terribly skinny and keeps forgetting to eat. my mother had to explain that she was her daughter, i think she understood that. she kept asking for my age, and awkwardly asked me what my name was, and where we lived. care: she can not live by herself without help anymore. we can't go there every day to take care of her, but, there is a friendly neighbour at the other end of the street who helps her and chats with her occassionally. he is truly a kind man, but it is also very strenuous for him. he is getting literal physical pain because of the intensity of taking care of my grandmother, poor soul. we have contacted my grandmother's doctor (she has not been officially diagnosed yet) who is very, lazy i would call it. he refused to get help for my grandmother and was overall just lacking. after some pushing, we have managed to get a caretaker to take care of my grandmother, but onfortunately, it starts in januari! my grandmother still has a driving license and is still driving, which should be taken from her. i don't know what stage she is in, however, i would guess stage 5 of alzheimer's. damn, i just realized how much i wrote. if anyone actually read all of that: thank you. i don't know what we can do at this point."

ayn3xw,,"Any suggestions on how to make a relative with dementia more at ease during a visit? i have a great-aunt who i've been told has symptoms of dementia as of late.  coming from a very, very large family, she is not a close relative (it was the norm to see her about once every 5 years), but she has always been incredibly outgoing.  it has always been her personality to meet everyone in the room and remember details about that person.  i'm sure the essence of her personality has not changed, but i know it must be very challenging/frightening for her to have such an integral part of herself be afflicted in her 90's.  i just want to make sure she feels at ease if she can't recall who i am during a visit, mid-conversation (i'm hoping i can schedule a visit when i'm on that side of the country soon).  any insight from anyone suffering dementia or alzheimer's disease, from anyone with loved ones who do, or from any care-workers would be greatly appreciated.  thanks!"

adtm6y,,"Should my grandmother move to a memory care unit or in with my parents? my grandmother has dementia, i’m not 100% sure as i don’t think anyone has officially had her tested, it’s just “dementia”. i don’t think my family really understood until recently how bad it was.  from my research, she’s a late stage 5, early stage 6 alzheimer’s. she’s been “a bit forgetful” for about 10 years now, but in recent years we learnt that she doesn’t shower, doesn’t cook, has regular accidents etc. when she’s stressed or anxious she has difficulty with names/faces, but is generally good with her family or people she’s known a long time. my grandfather recently passed quite suddenly and we had to move her into an aged care facility as she can’t live by herself.  this also revealed to us how much she relied on him to not look sick. her condition has significantly worsened since being there, she’s always confused, upset, angry. it’s not a dementia friendly place at all and the nurses aren’t the best at handling it. there’s no cues as to what time of day it is, the building is confusing and hard to find the dining/lounge room, etc. she has regularly said that she may as well not exist anymore as she has nothing to live for and she’s mad at the family for dumping her there. a couple of times i have found notes in her room with her name, my grandfathers name, their address and phone number, kids names, and usually the words “help” or “take me home”. my parents have a “guest house” that they currently use as an air bnb, and are considering moving her in there. from my mum and my research, it’s a dementia friendly space and there are slight modifications we can make to make it more enabling for her.  we’d also get home help, a morning or overnight nurse etc. we could bring her furniture from home, give her simple tasks, take her out for activities. more important than that is that she’d be around family more, have more independence and get her self confidence back. from my research she’s a late stage 5, early stage 6 alzheimer’s we’re aware that as she moves through stage 6 and into stage 7, she will get worse and will need to go into a dementia specific care place. is it worth moving her now, to my parents, only to move her again in a year or so?if she does move in to my parents (it’s actually a separate unit, self contained but with easy access to their house), what extra care would she need that we might have overlooked. or should we look at sending her straight to a memory care unit?"

tpoqy8,,"I'm about to tear my hair out.

azwnr0,,"Seeking Advice - My Father Does Not Remember My Mother Passed Away 2+ Months Ago looking for some advice. my father has memory issues from a tbi back in 2014, and his neurologist has been treating my father with a protocol similar to someone with dementia. in early january my mother passed away suddenly in her sleep, and she was the main care taker of my father so when she passed we had him temporarily move in with my wife and i until we could figure out a sustainable long term solution. every day while with us he would ask when my mother was coming home from the hospital... at first we would have the long, hard conversation that mom had passed away. he'd cry, be upset, etc. the next day he would again ask when my mother was coming home and if we could go visit her. after a week of the questions we started to play into his question and lie to him saying we spoke to her earlier, she'd be coming home soon, etc. this was on the advice of several people including my mother-in-law who works in a memory care unit. she said that if telling him the truth every time he asked was too hard for both him and myself then maybe it would be best to lie to him. fast forward to now - about 2+ weeks ago we moved him into a senior care center with a memory care unit. he's not a patient at the memory care unit, but they deal with dementia and alzheimer's patients and we feel like it's a good fit for now. almost immediately from when i left after moving him in he began calling my phone constantly asking if we could go see mom, when is she coming home, etc. then he started calling all the local hospitals, and in a panic called me asking what was going on and why couldn't he find mom. i drove over to the senior center and we had the long, hard talk again. he cried, got upset... the usual when we would have the conversations. but then the next day he remembered our conversation... and again he remembered the day after. we went out for dinner and he remembered 4 days after i told him. he would ask me what happened, how did she die... questions like that. i was so relieved that maybe things were getting better. then day 5 - he calls me and asks when mom is coming home again.   i'm basically at a loss. if i tell him the truth, he doesn't remember. if i lie, he calls me every 15 minutes asking when we can go visit, are there any updates on mom, etc. i haven't had more than 12 hours away from him to even begin grieving the loss of my mother, and i seriously don't know what to do anymore. last night i couldn't even go out to dinner with my wife for our anniversary without him calling me every 5 minutes. i had to turn my phone off - i felt so awful doing so but i'm at the point where if i don't shut it off i'm going to lose my phone. &amp;#x200b;has anyone dealt with some sort of similar situation and if so - do you have any advice? like i said - i'm at a complete loss at this point as to what i should do. i appreciate any and all help / advice. thanks."

esgk15,,"Help with ""entering their world"" i am the only support for my 77 yo widowed mother who has moderate dementia.  she is in assisted living (not memory care yet) but lives 10 hours away from me.  she has a handful of local friends and relatives but all are even older than her and have their own medical issues.  none can help in any way other than occasional social interaction.  this means i am attempting to manage all things including finances, legal, medical, etc...., for her from afar.  while i love her, we have never been close.  there is no bad blood, we are just very different people and she has ""disapproved of my lifestyle"" ever since i became an adult and left home 27 years ago.  until i was alerted by her panicking financial advisor that she was nearly broke 1.5 years ago, i had very little involvement with her life....which suited both of us just fine.  we perhaps talked on the phone once every 6 weeks or so and i would visit for 2-3 days once a year.  she has never had any interest in her grandchildren and could not have said what my husband or i do for a living at any point in my adult life.  after the alert from the financial advisor, i uncovered all kinds of ways mom was no longer able to manage herself, including runaway type ii diabetes, months of backed rent, driving without car insurance, pets that were in dire need of medical attention, hoarding, improperly managed meds, bounced checks and late fees all over the place, etc.... that she was unable to manage due to poor cognitive functioning.  so, a lot has happened in the last year.  i finally have a handle on most things financial/legal/medical.  now i am grappling with some secondary issues.  the most pressing being her anger towards me.  i could use some tips on how to ""enter her world"" when she is agitated on the phone.at least once a week and sometimes multiple times a day, she will call me (or my husband) about one very specific topic.  she only calls either of us when she is upset about this.  but even when i call her, the conversation often goes to this topic immediately:  ""everyone thinks i am too stupid to manage my own (fill in the blank here...finances, medical appointments, meds, meals, etc.....).""  she will go on to insist that she was managing just fine until i stepped in and that my involvement is unnecessary (not true). that she never agreed to my involvement (not true, she had the dpoa drafted without my knowledge).  that i am not managing her affairs properly (she believes this to be true because she accidentally reprograms her tv and then thinks i failed to pay the cable bill).  sometimes she will rant elaborate stories about how she selected and moved to her facility all on her own (not even a little bit true) so there is no reason for me to be involved.  she worries i am going to come take her car next (that is true but we have never discussed it).  she feels she is being treated very poorly and tells me she certainly hopes my child does not treat me this way in the future or hopes i am not treating mil this way.  once we are there, i cannot get in a single word.  i never react with anger....but even if i was inclined to, i simply cannot get a single word in anyway.  she gets more and more upset until she either hangs up on me or tells me she hates me and then hangs up on me.  these rants typically go on for 10-20 minutes non-stop.  once it was so bad and vicious that the director of the facility overheard and called me after she hung up to try and console me.  this has been going on for about 9 months.  i try not to take it personally but it does upset me....taking care of her affairs has created so much anxiety that it has (temporarily, i hope) wrecked my life....so getting this abuse on top of that is a hard pill to swallow even if i know it is the illness talking.  and obviously, she is upset too.  and from a  practical standpoint, i cannot get or give any information during calls when this happens.  i am her dpoa but not her guardian so she can and does still make many of her own decisions....which often requires communication between us.my sister, who lives even further away reports that mom rants these same things (about me) to her too.  mom does not get upset with/at my sister.  they have always had a much closer relationship and my sister is not the one doing any of these things.  so at least mom has one ""safe"" loved one to talk to.  i have started letting all of mom's calls go to vm and i don't call back aside from the very rare times there is a legit reason for the call.  but i still need to be able to call her to get business done and to check in.  any ideas on how to redirect or ""enter her world"" to set a new call in the right direction?  there are countless other things that upset her but they are far easier for me to empathize and redirect.  but since these are really about me, or more specifically my involvement in her life, i am at a loss."
ss4ies,,"MIL Asks the Same Questions Over and Over...and Over for background, my 82 yr old mil has dimentia (i don't know the specific level or formal name). she isn't able to drive, cook, she forgets names, she can't be left alone,etc. she lives 1000 miles away and we haven't been able to spend much time with her over the past few years. the past few years have been tough, but the past few months have been extremely challenging for her. she lost her husband two weeks ago and because of her condition we decided to sell her house and move her into a memory care facility. because we live out of state, living with her is not an option. as i write this it sounds horrible that we haven't included her in the detailed conversation, but she wasn't able to understand and contribute to conversations with her husband and family months ago.my wife and family quietly packed up part of her house without discussing it with her until the end. they explained that she was moving to a place where she can be cared for and safe. my wife and her flew to our house and told her that she was staying with us for a while. the reality is that we're getting her place at the memory care facility ready for her to move in shortly after her things arrive. she only remembers a few pieces of the conversation (s) about moving, and incorrectly remembers the details frequently. she will tell us that someone (she knows it was family but doesn't remember who) came in last week and started packing up the house. then she said that someone told her that she was moving but she didn't have other details. my wife will explain that they packed up their house and they're trying to figure out the best place for her to live. luckily, she understands that she can't stay in her house alone which is very helpful. this conversation happens again and again and again. my mil brings this up somewhere between once an hour and as frequently used every five minutes. my wife had that conversation 10 times in less than an hour and a half tonight. she also wakes my wife up multiple times per night to have the same conversation. how can we either help her understand and remember the plan, or reduce the frequency of having the same conversation? we have been truthful with her about the plan (except that we have decided on moving her to a facility) but she forgets within minutes....not sure what to do from here."
mubl3c,,"Is It Common For Someone With Dementia to Not Fit Into Any ""Stage""? my grandmother is 88, she was formally diagnosed by her pcp with dementia about 1.5 years ago, we started noticing some minor issues maybe 2.5 years ago.  the thing is, she doesn't really fit into any of the ""stages"" of dementia.  if you go by the 7 stages, or just a more broad early, mid, late, she's all over the place with symptoms.  in the last few months there's been a handful of times she hasn't been able to recognize me, my mom, or my grandfather.  she doesn't think we're strangers, but confuses us with someone else.  two month ago i picked her up for a doctor's appointment around noon (usually she is very good at this time of day) and she thought i was her brother for the entire ride there.  on the way home though, she knew i was her grandson.  two weeks ago she thought my mom was her sister.  just last night, she woke up in the middle of the night and refused to believe my grandfather was her husband, she thought he was her father.  but in between those incidents, no problem.  she recognizes everyone just fine.  even this morning when i stopped by she knew exactly who i was, and was back to knowing who my grandfather was.  honestly, these more severe issues are an outlier.  i'd say 75% of the time she's relatively fine, and things come across are simply more age related forgetfulness that you would expect from someone who will be 89 in six months.  for example, if i go over when the news in on, we can talk about current events.  she knows what's going on, and she understands it.   the majority of the time it might just be mixing up what day it is, repeating some family gossip she already told me a few days before (so she still has the ability to make new memories), or screwing up while cooking dinner because she forgot something in a recipe.  on a day to day basis she gets dressed on her own, she cleans the house, she goes up and down from the basement to do laundry (though sometimes she forgets the right settings on the machine), she goes grocery shopping, and she even still writes out the checks to pay the bills when they come in the mail. but she's got these off and on periods of severe confusion, and her pcp has diagnosed her with dementia.  it just doesn't make any sense to me, and i've begged my grandfather to take her to a specialist or just *anyone* for a second opinion to make sure there isn't something else going on (maybe a medication issue) but he refuses.  not because he's an asshole, but he's just very old school.  their pcp of 30 years gave a diagnoses, she gets mad if he talks to her about her symptoms, so he just deals with the issues and placates her.  so i'm just wondering, maybe i'm in the wrong here, and something like this is common....the ""stages"" are more mixed and not rigid, and this is just a normal case of dementia.  it's just....""fishy"" to me.  i want the best for my grandmother in her final years, and i feel like i'm the only family member who is researching this and not just accepting the opinion of a 75 year old pcp diagnosing an 88 year old with dementia and not looking into it further."

d66ykq,,"Help for someone in denial??? hi all, new here! i believe my mil has dementia. she is 70. her cognitive function,  memory, and ability to complete daily tasks have been declining gradually over the last few year. some examples- forgetting her sons’ names, being disoriented to the day of the week or the month, forgetting our garage code that she used to use daily, and then writing down the letter “r” instead of the number 9 when i told it to her, getting lost on the way to our house and not being able to follow written directions or a map, etc....the worst symptom of all, though, is the paranoia. luckily it hasn’t been focused on any family members yet, but she has zeroed in on her neighbors. she believes they are trying to kill her pretty much daily. she also thinks they are stealing from her and messing with her car.  (of note, the exact same thing happened at her old place so we moved her only for it to happen again.) we’ve had her staying at our house for the last week and now she believes they have followed her here and have been terrorizing her by standing outside her window and yelling that they are going to shoot her. we obviously know this isn’t true since we live here and have dogs that would go crazy if that was really happening. we have tried gently to get her to see that none of this is happening, but to her it’s 100% real and there is no convincing her otherwise. she then gets mad at us for thinking she’s “crazy.” (we would never ever use that word, but that’s the word she uses.)so here’s my question.... she obviously needs help, but how do we convince her? she has no established doctor. i doubt she would sign a dpoa right now.  i did get her an appointment with a new pcp that she agreed to go to in order to get her back pain checked out. i asked over the phone if we could speak to a nurse or doctor beforehand to voice our concerns, but they wouldn’t allow it. is this standard practice? i understand with hipaa they cannot give us info on her, but that’s not what we are asking for. we just want to make sure they have the whole story so they can do their best assessment. i’m afraid that will be difficult to do while she’s in the room and i know she can hide her symptoms fairly well. i’d love any help or advice! this is all so incredibly frustrating and i know this journey is just beginning for us."

(to add, she is eligible for medicare in two months, but does not qualify for medicaid, so i don't know where i stand with long term care options, nor whether or not i can have her admitted locally for this issue if i am concerned for her safety since i don't have poa or anything)... any help?thanks"

qkgqrg,,"How to cope with grandma’s dementia? Feeling lost. i’m not sure where else to go.my (25f) grandma (81f) got diagnosed with vascular dementia about 6ish months ago. however, i noticed her personality has slowly changed over the years (for the past 7ish years she has become more angry, says things that aren’t socially acceptable to say/says offensive things, talks about death often or how old she is, cries more often, etc.) - i watched her turn into a different person for the past few years &amp; it’s been weird. idk if it was the dementia slowly developing or if she just had a personality change.now, knowing she has dementia her behavior makes a little more sense. but over the past 1-2 months it has gotten really bad. she would call me 5-7 times a day so i had to block her number &amp; unblock it when i had time to talk. also, i will mention that i moved out of state from my family about 7 months ago, but went back to visit a couple weeks ago and got to see her. it was hard because she just looks like a shell of who she used to be. last night i got a call from my dad (her son) that she was in the hospital &amp; he broke down. i have never heard him cry like that. apparently she wouldn’t eat or drink anything &amp; became unresponsive. i also broke down &amp; immediately felt so much guilt for blocking her number &amp; felt bad i couldn’t be there. i just got home from visiting a few days ago. i was begging the universe to give me a chance to talk to her. an hour later she randomly woke up &amp; started cussing out the nurses (sounds about right for her), but i got a chance to talk to her &amp; this was the first time i had ever heard her not make any sense. she was saying my grandpa beat her with his cane (he can barely walk on his own, let alone pick up his cane). she was beaten by her husband in her first marriage (not my grandpa) so i’m wondering if her dementia is causing her to experience ptsd or something? i couldn’t help but burst into tears hearing her talk like this. her voice was full of suffering &amp; i can barely stand to watch her deteriorate like this. i’ve never lost a close loved one before. i have no idea how to cope with the guilt, fear, sadness, etc. i’m going to therapy this week, but i wanted to hear what other’s on here had to share. thank you in advance."
ke158s,,"Grandma might have dementia, isn't self aware and won't get help. i don't know if this is the best place to post here, but i have never dealt with dementia before and i have no idea what to do. i seem to be one of the only ones aware of what's going on with her, but i don't know how to help her, or even if i can at this point in time. my grandma has been acting very rude and strange lately, and her facebook posts have been getting more and more incoherent. she has always been politically minded, but she used to be coherent and mindful of people's different perspectives.  i have been avoiding her for the most part because we don't really click well to begin with, but i checked my emails and noticed she has been sending me strange political conspiracy nonsense in all caps lock (which is very unlike her). it's not even the usual q-anon conspiracies we are all likely familiar with, although i think she has been influenced by that, it's a mix of her own strange delusional thoughts. if she were around my age, i'd honestly think she was a disorganized schizophrenic. her typing is starting to remind me of my own mental illness. of course, this led to an argument because i thought it was very distasteful of her to bombard my emails (and my facebook too) with such presumptuous, inflammatory nonsense. it led to a number of other things, basically her saying vague statements throughout that had no relevance whatsoever to the conversation and didn't prove any points she so adamantly insisted on having. she also wasn't respectful of me saying that i don't appreciate having political or religious talk shoved down my throat like that, i would rather talk about other things because i don't agree with any of her points. she dismissed all that and made it out like it was my fault for being not being receptive, but she's always been a narcissist, making everything about her.  she used to be more socially aware though. she had the nerve to tell me i'm not mentally ill (i'm on the schizophrenic spectrum!) and it hurt my feelings so bad i lashed out at her pretty sharply. but then i reflected on our argument and realized that she is tangential (worse than me), incoherent and is rapidly losing her sharpness. sadly, she doesn't believe that mental health is a real thing so i unfortunately think she's in total denial for now. it's still early in the symptomatic stage and i don't want to assume that it's dementia when it could be other things, but she is reluctant about getting help. i can't even use my schizophrenia as a coaxing mechanism (""see grandma, i got help"") because she does not believe that i am mentally ill.what is strange is that my father is a low functioning schizophrenic, and when she was younger she was willing to call the mental institution and get him help multiple times, so she recognized he was crazy, though she always dismissed psychology as a subject and said it ""wasn't a science"" (rolls eyes). i know dementia is a brain disease and not exactly a mental disorder, but her lack of insight into any mental health issues is allowing her to be cognitively dissonant and in complete denial that she needs help herself. i know after reading through the symptoms of dementia that no matter what happens, i need to understand her point of view and understand that it is her brain malfunctioning, it's not her will to behave like this. that being said, it is very hurtful because it puts my mental health at a serious compromise.  i'm not exactly known for being emotionally fluent and supportive myself, especially when i feel like i'm blatantly being disrespected. we have always had different opinions on politics and religion and her randomly, sporadically lashing out disturbing nonsense at me is terrifying, and triggering me to have positive symptoms. it reminds me of how my dad verbally abused me during his schizophrenic episodes; i now need therapy again and have been disassociating something awful. it reminds me of my own mental illness, but at least i have the self awareness to know something is wrong with me, and to try to be nice and respectful in spite of it. i'm worried the rest of our family won't catch on until it's too late because many of them are in denial of mental illness and even 'like' some of her word salad posts. to be fair, she has always been abrasive and opinionated, so it's not like a completely new personality, just her behaving and saying strange things. she also used to respect science and health experts but of course covid19 changed all of that. she keeps calling it the ""flu"". i explained multiple times this isn't the same viral strain as the flu - it's as if she's not capable of taking in new information. she also started talking about sex extremely graphically around an 8 year old girl doing homework the other day, which is completely unlike her. she would have never done that around me or my friends when we were 13, let alone 8. the girls stepdad snapped at her and told her to stop.anyways, i know i'm not the best person to be her caregiver considering with her (potential) dementia and my schizophrenia, we are both so blatantly honest towards each other in rude ways. it just doesn't work. i'm trying to get other family members to keep an eye on her and i will do a welfare check on her if i have to, but i honestly don't know what else to do. i can't live with her, last time i did i was running naked in the woods because i thought the planes in the sky were government drones she was using to spy on me; that's how much she makes me nuts. i love her because she's my grandmother, but, damn me, i just don't have much respect for her as a person. but i still want her to get the help she needs despite everything. and yes, i have told her i think she has dementia though i wasn't polite about it, i was still hurt at her dismissing my schizophrenia and i don't know if i can forgive her for that. of course everything i say is one ear out the other. she's still driving and shopping and stuff, and she has a husband but he's slowly dying of diabetes, and he's just as ignorant as she is in a lot of ways so he is no help. neither is my schizophrenic dad, hence my need to potentially call a welfare check on her.   sigh.if anybody has any suggestions, i would greatly appreciate it - and i'm sorry for rambling."

(of course, she did.  the marines handed her the flag that is sitting on the desk beside her.) anyway, i like to solve problems.  i'm here, hopefully, to find out if this was a good idea or a horrible idea.  i thought that it might be a good idea to sit down at the table with her and my dad and my sister and laminate all of the sympathy cards and related things and put them into a notebook that she cold look through.  i asked her if she wanted to do this ""project"" together and she thought it was a great idea.  so, we all sat down and did it and she was the one tasked with actually adding the sheets to the notebook.i also wrote a note and added it to the begining that said [paraphrasing], &gt;dear grandma,  it is ok to not remember.  as you go through this notebook, &gt;think about all the people that love and care for you.  grandpa has passed &gt;away.  it's ok to not remember, but he had no doubt that you loved him. &gt;love, j3r3meso, throughout the day, she would pick up the notebook and she would stop at my note and to herself say, ""grandpa has passed away"" like it was news.the upside is that she isn't actually asking people as often.  so, it's reducing the level of frustration with some members of the family that have less patience than others.  somehow, i think she actually knows what is inside the notebook and she's going there to remember.  i just don't know if this is a bad idea and causing more or less suffering or what would cause the least suffering.any educated insight (whether through training or through experience) would be appreciated.  any resources would be appreciated.**tl;dr:  is it a bad idea to constantly remind my grandmother that her husband has passed away?""**"
oweamy,how can you help someone trust that you're telling the truth when they see things with their own eyes that tell them differently?,"how can you help someone trust that you're telling the truth when they see things with their own eyes that tell them differently? (lbd) my mother was diagnosed with dementia about three months ago. it began with my sister and i wanting to get her off of narcotic pain medication that we suspected was making her memory worse and degrading her personality. once the painkillers were gone we realized it was something else. sometimes it's benign, like a mouse in her house or horses walking by the windows. she says that when nobody else is there, he has another woman an whole new family. she swears that there is pornography all over the house and she sees naked women on her husband's bed. it's not just that these things are really bad in terms of dementia progression, but they're absolutely heartbreaking for me to hear because i know they're causing her severe emotional trauma. she tells me she just wants to live out the rest of her days (she's only 60) in peace and doesn't want to deal with an unfaithful spouse.my parents divorced when i was just a teenager (36 now) and it was because my father was unhappy in the marriage and while he didn't actually cheat, it was emotional cheating (if that makes sense) with another woman and it really broke my mom's heart. now she's reliving all that horrible stuff again, but this time it's not even really happening. sorry for the rant. i'm just looking for advice from anyone who might have dealt with this kind of thing in the past. i'm really at my wit's end here and i feel absolutely powerless and hopeless."

awcs30,,"Possible early dementia and too mean to deal with about six or seven months ago, my husband and i and our children moved in with my mom (66). she had been in not-so-great health for a while and showing occasional signs of cognitive decline. i am her only child and my dad died 25 years ago and she never remarried. before we moved in with her i missed her and worried about her all the time.shortly after we moved in, i started seeing more bizarre behavior. her forgetfulness was increasing but she could still work 2 days a week and pay her bills, things like that. but what was deeply troubling was her anger and hatefulness. this was new. she particularly hated my husband in a paranoid way, frequently insinuating that he was abusive to me and the kids, telling me lies about him (or things she remembered wrong? she sometimes confabulates real memories into composite memories that didn't happen. i don't know.) if he breathed wrong, she would take offense and sulk. i wasn't exempt- if i disagreed with her about anything, in the most casual and polite way, she'd sulk for days. she'd give the grandchildren (5 and 1) the silent treatment just to get at me. every other day, she was sulking and/or being nasty. one time she didn't like that we made the 5 year old finish his hot dog before he could have dessert, and she threw her entire dinner in the sink and wrote on the walls in sharpie. we only were able to live there for a few months when one day she started banging on the walls and calling my aunts &amp; uncles, telling them that we had basically taken over the house and that we were mistreating her, that we don't let her sit in her chair (????), and who knows what else. when my uncle came over she was screaming that i had yelled at her for cussing (she doesn't cuss and i don't mind cussing, this did not happen) and that i yelled at her about the garbage cans (this was a confabulation. 3 nights prior, i had told her i don't mind being the one to take the trash out, and that she shouldn't worry about it. later that night, she was being mean to my husband for no reason again, and i asked her to stop. but i didn't yell)so, she was having a crazy episode of fury and now all my extended family was involved, so my family and i grabbed some stuff and got an apartment, and did not go back. she called and left nasty messages a few times right after. we have seen her 1 time since then (that was december 30th), on my 5 year old's birthday. she acted as if nothing had happened, as if our entire relationship wasn't destroyed. i know she didn't forget, she just didn't want to talk about it. i am having a lot of trouble deciding how to look at this. on the one hand, she is not the mother i grew up with. she very obviously is dealing with some sort of decline. i know it's hurting her badly to be suddenly alone and to not see her grandkids. i feel for her in that her entire immediate family is gone and rarely speaks to her now, and she probably doesn't have an accurate memory of whyon the other hand, she's not so far gone that she's oblivious to reality. like i said, she can take care of her affairs, work 2 days a week, and intentionally keep herself together long enough to fool people who don't live with her. so she has awareness most of the time. and i can't stomach the way she treated me and my family when all we wanted was to be there for her. if she had a diagnosis or was so far gone that she was obviously obviously losing her whole mind, i would feel worse and get over my anger and try to help her. i don't know what to do. i don't want to be spiteful or cruel to someone who is sick, but i am just so disturbed. please help. ps: she will not ever go to a doctor. never. if i even tell her to get checked out, she will be so offended it'll be another fiasco."

(i'm sure some of you have loved ones that do the same thing, but i am fairly new to this, so i don't have the right words to describe it.)she says we are laughing at her, have tried putting her in jail, and acts like we are out to get her or mostly as if we are tricking her and lying to her.she went to the doctor on thursday and they doubled her from half a pill in the morning and night to a whole pill in the morning and night of seroquel to help with the paranoia and aggitation.so, my question is, how do you keep it together when talking to your loved ones? it is always the same and i try to remain objective, but she accuses me of being happy about it probably because i'm not crying or shouting? what does she want?they moved a couple hours away about a decade ago, so i cannot just swing by to see her or check in on her. she has called me multiple times today, and it has gotten worse and worse as the day goes by.do i stop answering the phone so she doesn't get hurt by her mistaken perception of what i say?how do you have anything meaningful with your loved ones when it's like this? i mean, if talking with her just upsets her more, am i supposed to do it or avoid it? i don't always know what she will be like on the phone when she calls, so what should i do?"
rak5zu,"if so, what did you tell them?","if so, what did you tell them? she's 93. he passed away about two months ago at age 98. she and both of my parents were right there with him, in bed with him and holding him as he slipped away. my grandparents were married over 50 years. things we've tried and their results thus far:* telling her the truth, option 1. this results in her sobbing and shaking with fear for hours into the night. then my mom is a mess too because having to retell it all and go through her mom re-learning this info is so awful. * telling her he's at an appointment or some other kind of ""away and not here right now"" fib. i know he had a lot of ptsd after being in wwii and the korean war, and would always openly talk about how much he missed his (deceased) first wife.we're out of ideas on what to tell her. my mom can't keep doing this, her mom can't keep doing this, and i don't live with them so i'm not there to provide any in-person help. i also worry that inconsistencies in what she's being told might be adding to her confusion and distress. i think it might be best for a story to be chosen and then stuck to. it's also my mom that she looks to for confirmation of whatever's being told to her."
s6zjsn,,"Mom’s impactful memory loss. hi! first time posting. my mother (70 f) has been diagnosed with moderate dementia based on her decline over the last 18 months and her score on the moca test. she declined 20% in the last 18 months. to compound this, my dad (70 m) passed 4 months ago, who was her sole caregiver, though he never saw it that way. he was the person who was with her all day, scheduling her appointments (which she is not capable of doing herself) and making sure she had all of her meds ordered and taken care of. we are looking for a way to tell her how impactful her memory loss is to us, her caregivers (my sister and i, 32 and 30 respectively, and her brother 76) and how we need her to accept some help. she has gotten lost while driving but had gotten better with using her phone’s gps to help her get around. she forgets many scheduled things and repeats similar stories upwards of 5 times in a short time frame. we are in the process of hiring companion care to keep her company and help her around the house a few days a week. along with being frustrated, we know this isn’t her fault but it does impact our lives by worrying about her daily. any suggestions for gently bringing up and reiterating how impactful this is for her family and how we can work together to make this journey a little easier for all of us?  thanks for your help!"
f17k55,,"Grandma w dementia lost her sister my grandmother's sister passed last night. my grandmother has dementia, she knows my name still but her short term memory is gone, she can't make coffee or get something, she passes the room and she'll forget what she went for. i am an ftm and have been very much passing as male for 4 years but she still calls me ""she"" so that's how far it's gone i guess (for reference, it's unimportant to the story, i don't mind it).she won't remember that her sister is dead i think or will she? what if she asks about her? should we remind her or should be be like ""we'll visit her soon"" and then never go and she'll forget we promised? or do serious things like this make an impression deep enough for her to remember it?"
rl6ef1,,"Mom called my mom called today and said there was a man in the house she did not recognize.  i asked if it was my dad and she responded by saying her dad has been dead for years. i asked if the man in the house was ****, my dads name, and she had no idea how i knew him.  my heart sank and i’m finally having to face how bad her memory has become.  this is brand new to me and i have no idea how to deal with this.  please provide any and all advice you can; i would really appreciate it"
dcmmh0,,"Grandma has dementia - her son passed away. Need advice. my grandma has mild dementia. her son, my uncle, recently passed away due to an unforeseen circumstance. i don't want to get too in depth about it but, my uncle has not kept in much touch with my family, we have a bit of a family drama/dysfunctional family; we got notified from the hospital that he passed. rest of my family doesn't want to tell my grandma because they think it'll put her health at risk (i.e. faint, depression, etc.) and potentially even lead to her death. i understand where they are coming from but, i think it's right for her to know. how should my family approach about this, should we really just keep it a secret and not let her come to the funeral or something? if we do tell her, how can we tell her in a manner that will not have a drastic affect?"
9e036t,,"How to tell my Dad that my Mum has passed away? using a throwaway as i don't usually use reddit for personal stuff.as the title suggests, my mum sadly passed earlier this week. my dad's (80's) dementia is quite advanced and he's been in residential care for a few months now. he remembers that he's married but he doesn't realise that the wife in his head is the woman he was living with for 50+ years prior to going into care.i'll be going to see him in the next couple of days and i have no idea how to break this to him or even whether he'll understand.can anyone give me any pointers on how to approach this with him? happy to answer any questions and thank you in advance."
p478zi,,"Mom called me 3 times within the hour to tell my my grandmother died not sure if this is the right place, but i’m so frustrated and at a loss here. my mother (63) had a tbi 2 years ago and her memory has gotten progressively worse. yesterday, called me to tell me my grandmother died and we talked for about an hour. and about 30 minutes later, she called me to tell me that my grandmother (mom’s mother) died again, forgetting we had just spoken about it. then about an hour later, she calls me in tears, saying she is so confused and doesn’t remember if she told me that my grandmother died. at this rate, i’m terrified she won’t even remember her own name by the end of the year. we have always had a strained relationship, particularly during the past few years. it’s totally devastating that her memory is worse than my 86 year old grandfather’s at this point and she is only 63."
aohx5i,,"Not sure how to deal with the fact that my mom have early onset dementia (possibly) sorry if my post is a bit incoherent and long, it is 3am here and i'm in bed with my phone as i can't sleep. just going to write whatever is on my mind and edit later.  i'm not sure what replies or advice i'm looking for but there is no one i can talk to irl and i guess i just need a listening ear. so i am an international student and i'm not home often. yesterday, i got a message from my sister telling me that she is going to take my mom to the doctors for an official diagnosis. this news can't come at a worst time as i am not home when all of this is going down during the biggest holiday of the year (chinese new year). growing up, my mom always had bad memory and a hard time processing what is being said to her (she has adhd, depression, dyslexia, bpd and other learning disabilities). we would tell her a story and it would take her several tries to get it or to follow the storyline and there's a high chance she will forget most of it later, at least the details anyway. she has a hard time pronouncing words as english is not her first language and would quickly forget whatever is taught to her, even something as simple as learning to use facebook even if we taught her repeatedly. so for a long time, we always thought that it was just her normal self. but the past year (according to my dad and brother), she actually forgot her way home a few times, made late credit card payments or paid bills more than once, lost her phone twice in a week, swears she brought her wallet out only to find it at home later.despite all the difficulties she has, this is not normal behaviour even for her. my mom is trying to chalk it up to side effects of her anti depressants and bpd meds but i'm extremely worried and so is the rest of us. i know that our family do have a history of alzheimer's which is confirming my worst fears. if it is officially true, i don't know what i am going to do. i love her so very much even though we are apart a lot due to my overseas education from when i was 16. even if i say it very rarely or don't show my love often, i do love her and i wouldn't know what i'm going to do when things get worst. i don't want her to be alive but not mentally present, i don't want her to not remember me, i don't want her lose her memories of us. i don't want her to forget that we love her very very much and that she love us too. i don't want to put her in a home, i don't want to watch my dad watch her slip away, i don't want her to forget that she love to cook, to drive, to paint, to do all the things she love doing now. i don't want her to lose all of that. i just love her so much and i'm not sure if i can handle it. i'm lucky that i have 2 other siblings but as the oldest i would have to take charge. i love her but i love living where i am right now and i know i will have to move back and i don't want to secretly hate her for making me give up my life for her even she did sacrifice everything for me. i don't know what my sister will do if she loses her memories and language skills. they already have a hard time communicating as my sister is english educated and my mom knows a limited amount of broken english.before her diagnosis of bpd, she would go into episodes of crying, screaming and risk taking behaviour. she drove into a road divider once. i was 16 and scared. my dad was in denial and having an affair. i escaped overseas using education as my excused to run as far as i could, abandoning my younger siblings to take care of her. i'm not sure if i will be strong enough this time for them and to take charge. i might possibly hold a grudge that i have to go home. i'm feeling so confused, upset and guilty....  for my possible resentment, for being selfish for not spending more time with her.  i love her very much, i'm just not sure if i'm strong enough to handle it."

kbutpp,,"How does my family tell my grandfather (M87) that his son has passed away? hello kind folks. my uncle (m60ish) recently passed away. my grandfather lives in a memory care facility and my parents want to deliver the news today. they say he deserves to know, but i feel like telling him is just going to cause him undo strife, as he will ultimately have a hard time remembering what has happened (he often forgets the names of my siblings and i, not to mention our significant others). he has other memory problems too, such as days of the week or what’s going on with covid. does anyone have experience with this? your guidance is much appreciated. thank you."
swlo2h,,"Early warning signs for my mom? dementia doesn’t run in my family, but in the past year i’ve noticed things in my mom that aren’t really justified by her age (59). she’s constantly having trouble remembering names of actors/actresses or tv shows and movies, and just last week we began rewatching better call saul. things that happened 1-2 episodes ago are completely gone in her head, and she’s asking me about them like it’s the first time she’s heard about it.i told her the show’s set in 2002 3 days ago, and she asked me today again. some detail in an episode yesterday mentioned in today’s episode, she asked about it today like she heard it for the first time. it’s honestly frightening, i hope she’s just not paying attention…what other signs can i look out for?"

lb0jpk,"My grandparent has vascular dementia and lives at home with one of her older children. I go over to help give company when I can, and I think the hardest part is making her feel at home. She constantly asks when we are leaving to go home, as she thinks she isn't in her house and wants to go back to what we assume is the house she grew up in with her parents in a different state.   How can I answer her questions to make her feel at home? She mostly asks when we are leaving, if she needs money or how to pack for the trip. Every day when it's not freezing outside and in some that it is she packs her car with random things like she is going somewhere or brings things up and down the stairs trying to get ready. We of course have the keys hidden but leave the car doors unlocked because she can get angry when HER car isn't available to her. I've made a sign for her bedroom door that says her name and plan on making a memory book with a picture of her in her house with some family so she can maybe make the association on her own. But nothing really seems to make her feel better and she gets more and more restless and hard to deal with by the day.  I usually try to answer that she is home and that her family lives with her, and try to point out things in the house that she knows are hers -paintings she has done, or take her to her room to give her a tour. Sometimes she realizes that it is her house but usually not and she often answers with ""I didn't know that."" This is how every conversation goes and I just wonder if anyone has any tips for how to answer or make her feel more comfortable without trying to force the information on her?
","How to deal with grandparent that thinks they aren't at home or that they constantly have to be going ""home""?"
io70fz,"Hi, I'm new to this sub. I just wanted to ask those of you who have parents or loved ones with dementia or Alzheimer's what you say to your loved one who is asking to go home. My grandmother-in-law is getting to late stages, and every day she asks to go home, or says she's going home soon. She's been living with all of us (MIL, wife, and me) for nearly 4 years, and we moved to Tennessee almost exactly a year ago. She insists that she has friends somewhere else and she's going to go visit them... Or something. I don't believe she has a troubling amount of anxiety during the day, not enough to say she wants to be safe, and that's why she's asking. We think it's most likely that she's just remembering house she lived in before the stroke in Florida, since it's the last place she had friends and such.  What do we tell her when she keeps begging and begging to go to a place she hasn't owned in half a decade?",I want to go home
vrxgk6,"My grandmother is mid stage, and in the past month or two, something new that has come up, is a couple times a week she will get upset and insist she's not in her house, despite living there for 51 years.  This will go on for hours, sometimes the whole day.  She gets very depressed and upset over it.  She remembers her address, she remembers the city, but she insists she is living in an apartment in ""a town I don't know the name of"" and goes on and on about how much she hates it there and wants to go home.  Telling her it is her home, and trying to get her to recognize some of her belongings doesn't help, it just makes her very mad and she starts yelling that she's not crazy.  Telling her she will be going home next week, and everything will be back to normal then doesn't help either.  She remains depressed and upset and lamenting about wanting to go home right away.  Trying to redirect the conversation to another topic doesn't help either, she goes right back to talking about wanting to go home.  We're not sure *what* to say to her on the days she gets like this.  Is this one of those things where there is nothing to do?  We just have to deal with her being upset/depressed on these days?
",How To Deal With Her Not Recognizing Her House
lskmfe,"I’m venting, this is long but I need advice and someone to tell.  I’m 20 and my grandma has had dementia for the last couple years, she’s slowly deteriorating but this year has been the hardest for me. Mainly because of how aware I became of the issues and her situation.  She lives in the midwest and I live and grew up on the east coast so I didn’t get to see her a lot when I was growing up. I didn’t love going to her house as a kid because I just always felt a homesick and there wasn’t a lot going on over there and I could never sleep. As I became a teenager it definitely became more manageable but I still didn’t see her a lot because I was in sports and school and whatever the excuses.  She lives with my grandpa still who is just a old fart and used to order her around the house all the time and her son (my uncle) has lived there his whole life and he’s just a lost soul who drinks, he means well. The dynamic of that house is the last bit ideal for someone with dementia too. It’s just low vibes and my uncle doesn’t really get along with my grandpa and it’s just a mess. There’s not enough interaction or high energy to keep her wheels turning. I’m also 1/2 grandchildren and the only girl in my family since my grandma had all boys, and the other grandkid is a boy. Anyways I feel an immense guilt and responsibility to go and help her and take care of her. From never seeing her a kid and knowing she always wanted a daughter and i was the closets thing to a daughter and I never even got to see her. And I didn’t like calling her when I was kid and I wish I would’ve just called her. I feel like I missed out on years of love and stories from her and she missed them from me. I didn’t even give her a chance. or so it feels. My only problem is that I would have to pick up my whole life and move to Missouri, I’m in Arizona. And it just feels like I could be doing so much to help her and make these last years really amazing for her. and If I don’t go I’m going to live with the guilt of not being the best granddaughter I could’ve been, i don’t even feel like i was a good one at all. It took me 20 years to realize how much i truly love and care about her, I just wish I would’ve called her more growing up and seen her more. It was just because I didn’t want to or feel like it or just because it was awkward sometimes.   I call her as much as I can now but it’s hard and draining. I always cry and spiral and she always mentions to me that I should come visit her. She deserves the world and I just wish I could give it to her.   I hope this all made sense, I just got off the phone with her so i’m emotional and all over the place and conflicted. I just need some advice or a sweet message lol
",Feeling guilty and responsible towards my grandma
kc18vq,"A few years ago my grandmother was in hospital (aged 88) and because of the medication she was under, she kept showing common tropes of that of a person with dementia (delusion, forgetting peoples names, etc.) and was placed in a ward with patients of the same illness.  She checked out of hospital after about a month and went back to normal every day life. She broke her hip last year and had to be in hospital again for about three months. She behaved the same kind of way she did last time and it took her a few days to fully recognise her house when she finally returned home (for the most part she would only recognise a couple bits of furniture).  She's 91 now and she's aware her memory isn't what it used to be. She'll spend a great deal of time when I visit talking about the exact same things (religion, what she's watching on TV, etc.). I noticed last time I was there she confused me for my brother and kept referring to us by the wrong name. She also told us that she's lived in her house for the last sixty-odd years and raised six children there, as if my brother and I never knew that.  A few months ago she asked to take a picture of my granda and brighten it up in photoshop since she never liked how it came out, and I brought it back a few months ago. Last time I was down at her house with my brother she was convinced it was my brother that had altered the picture and even gave him money for it.  I want to try and visit her as often as I can and I want to know what I can do to when I visit her (how to stay patient when she gets confused, how to keep her on track with the conversation, etc.). I know this may sound insensitive to some people on this sub and I apologise for that, but I don't know where else to go

o1j3lh,"Hi All, looking for advice.  My grandma has short term memory loss that has progressed within the past 6 months.  We had an at-home doctors/memory facility visit yesterday. She’s currently livid with my father for taking her car so she’s resentful of anything he does.  Long story short, today I asked her what she remembered about yesterday and she said “nothing.”  So, with that being said, she’s on schedule to move within the next few weeks but due to her forgetting when she gets angry whenever her independence is questioned, we’re afraid of how to approach breaking the news to her.  Any advice would be great. Thanks in advance!","How do we tell my grandma she’s moving to memory care?

8r2kdc,"This is going to be a lot, and probably really long... I appreciate anyone who manages to get through some of it. I've only very rarely frequented this sub Reddit, as I've kind of just felt lost and didn't feel up to reading it all. I hope that my less-than-sugarcoated approach to writing about my experience with my mom does not offend anyone. I also wrote this over the course of several, sleep-deprived hours. We all have our coping mechanisms. I'm not great at finding humor in this still. There's a lot of dirty laundry from the past that prevents that, still.   I'm 26 (27 in a couple months), living with my parents, and my mom has early on-set dementia. She has pretty much three settings:  1) Desperately loyal housewife: She goes to extreme lengths to please my dad, which recently included forcing her bedroom door closed while I was trying to get in to get toilet paper so I could pee at 2 in the morning. When she's like this, she's extremely paranoid about doing something to upset my dad (even though he really doesn't get mad at her.) When she's like this, she'll often make sweeping statements about how ""Oh we all love him, he's so wonderful, aren't we lucky?"" Considering the past problems our family had before my mom got sick, it's pretty tough to hear.  2) Bitter, vicious bitch: Self-explanatory. Yes, I know it's not ""really"" her, and no, I generally don't let it affect me. Our family has always had a pretty screwed up power dynamic, and my mom always had her passive-aggressive side and a hot temper. Trying to discern in my memories which times were really her and which weren't have been a thorn in my side.   3) Confused child: Meek and confused, very much needs help to get a basic command done. We see a lot more of this these days.   So yeah, that's my mom in a nutshell. She's been deteriorating for years, but my dad wasn't on board and was in denial right alongside her. My sister and I ended up feeling like we were in some twisted Twilight Zone where we were seeing things, maybe *we* were the ones going crazy, because no one else would admit to seeing what we did. Eventually my sister got a chance to move out, I didn't, and here I am.   I've finally figured out what I want to major in and pursue in my life. I've been at the city college on and off for years, working on and off at crap jobs, going back for a semester, rinse, repeat. I've been massively depressed for more than half of my life and fell into the trap of ""well I can handle it."" Now I've aged out of my dad's insurance, I have no job, and am living off of about $800 left of financial aid until I find a job. I'm gonna be fine; my dad doesn't let me starve. He will pay for gas if he needs to. But I still feel like I'm just incredibly stupid and useless and doing it all horribly, stupidly wrong. It feels like life isn't worth living when up against the utter crap I can't seem to fix or get out of. My mom is dying, my family is screwed up, my dad is still in denial in some ways, and I just can't seem to find it in me to love anything about myself enough to think I have what it takes to have a good life. The person I always thought would be there to help me figure things out is gone. I have to work so hard to keep my emotional state hidden from my mom because all it does is make her feel upset or scared. I'm so tired.  I'm trying really, really hard to prove I'm useful to my dad, because you guessed it, living at home and not having life figured out is a huge self-esteem downer. I do as many errands as my dad throws at me, and will do them at the expense of my time, my gas, and plans I previously had. I handle all of the grocery shopping, I take my mom to appointments if he can't, I am the primary caretaker for our four animals, two cats and two dogs. While I cannot afford to pay for any of them, I schedule their vet appointments, I take them in, I medicate them for fleas and anything else that pops up. I make sure they have food and water, I clean up the litterbox and any messes. I keep my dad apprised of anything going on with them. I make sure my mom eats something. I let him know when we're low on things like dish soap, toilet paper, and paper towels. I cook cold dishes that can last for a few days at a time, most often something like a pasta salad. I try and keep track of what my mom is eating and what she isn't (anyone else have dementia family members who have new cravings every few months?) I notify him of anything out of the norm with my mom. I have worked really, really hard to avoid getting upset with my mom or losing my temper. I'm much better than I used to be, but of course could always use improvement.  None of it feels like it's ever enough. I'm still stuck at home. Despite the few moments where I feel like I'm doing enough to prove it's okay for me to be home still and figuring things out, there are always the long patches of me telling myself no, you're doing it wrong, you're useless. I live in a very expensive state, so moving out by myself is really not an option. Some days I struggle to get myself out of bed, let alone to look for a job. It induces such panic and anxiety in me to even think about going back to the dead-end jobs I used to work, but what else is there when you just have a high school diploma still? I just wish I could feel like what I'm doing is enough, but I don't.   TLDR: My life is a mess. Triangle of take care of mom, get a job and work to save and live, and go to school are constantly at odds with each other and out of balance and I honestly just feel like I'll never be able to feel like I'm doing anything enough. My dad insists he never wanted my sister nor I to be responsible for my mom, and yet when we go over the list of everything that wouldn't get done if we stopped being involved... it goes on. We're afraid he'll wake up one day and lose his mind.  Is there anyone out there who has anything remotely similar to this situation? Thanks for reading up until now. This has all been coming on for months, and it just kind of boiled over last night with me feeling really, really awful about not having a job and my own income. I feel like such a failure, and my mom is gone and not here to help me figure out life. She walks around like a ghost with greasy hair, unkempt clothes. I can't force her to shower. I can't force her to wash her hands. I don't think she's even on a single medication related to dementia, like anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers. I can't force my dad to get a caretaker. And when we finally get one, the relief I'll feel will quickly be replaced with the realization that I no longer have a purpose in this house, and that I'm just wasting space.  Thanks.",Am I doing everything wrong?

vte8ql,"My grandmother is 89 years old and got diagnosed with alzheimers last year. She lives in her own seperate house on our (me and my parents') property. She is my dad's mother. She is ""on the list"" for the local nursing home meaning if she'd end up in hospital or we *really* can't take care of her anymore she can go there if there's a free room.  Me and my mom are so sick of taking care of her, so beyond fed up with it. My mom has dealt with this incredibly stubborn woman for 30 years, and now that her mental state is declining rapidly its all way too much.

I'm 29. We get groceries for her, cook her food, take care of her cat, clean her house when we're allowed, take care of the garden.  But ofcourse in her eyes we don't do anything for her and don't care for her. She always asks for my dad cause he's the good guy. We also steal everything from her and especially me, she ""knows what I'm doing"" whatever that may be.

She shows all the symptoms of Stage 5, but thankfully hasn't gotten much worse over the last year. At her best, she remembers who I and my kids are but perhaps just sames and us being familiar faces. At her worse, she thinks her husband (my dad) is still alive (he died 25 years ago) and she lives back at her parents house (40 years ago).  Anyway, after moving her to a nursing home a few months ago and admittedly I delayed this for too long as I didn't want to admit she was that badly off.

She looks happy, eats on time, sleeps and has even started back watching TV and reading!  However, her sister (who doesn't live near us and has only a vague idea of her condition) wants to come visit her, but also wants to take her back home and to places she used to visit.  I get she has some noble intention, but my mother is very easily confused, so much so that 2 months ago when I brought her last live in caretaker to visit her.

She's also the kind of person who will tell the rest of my family about my apparent 'cruelty' to my mom.   Before this blowout I've her some many Alzheimers's care guides that reccomend trying to confuse them as little as possible. One even went as far as to say, once the transition to the new home has been made, it is critical that no more abrupt changes be presented as that can lead to mental disassociation, causing undue stress.   So Reddit, should I give in to my aunt's wishes?

8ihlxu,"My grandmother has dementia (my dad's Mom - I live at home while attending college). She lives in a retirement home in our city. At this point, she's very much ""out of it"" - it's very difficult, if not impossible, to hold a conversation with her, as her communication is severely limited (a lesion was recently found on the speech center in her brain, although we don't know how old it is). She has memory issues as well and seems to be confused chronologically. No one really knows just how much she's aware of. A speech therapist came recently to work with her, and my grandmother struggled with very basic questions (things like ""how many children do you have"").   Pretty much the only time she shows emotion nowadays is when she a) cries at random, or b) begs my dad not to ""take her back to that place"" when he's bringing her back to the retirement community after a doctors appointment. She obviously doesn't want to be there and we feel as if she's depressed. It makes me feel awful thinking about what her quality of life is - she essentially sits on her couch all day long until someone comes to take her to her meals or give her medication and other care. She was previously diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia and takes antipsychotics to control delusions. Before moving to the retirement community, her communication skills were still quite good, but she had issues with persecutory delusions and some smaller lapses of confusion.   Is there anything that can be done for depressed patients like her? Even if it's some novel drug treatment that will help her feel better (even if the happiness - or at least sedatedness - is ""fake"").   Everyone in my household is very busy. Though a big part of why we don't visit her too often is because of our hectic schedules, it's also because seeing her is so difficult. In addition to her very diminished communication skills (sometimes spending time with her feels like hanging around a brick wall), what further complicates the situation is past baggage. My grandmother was very narcissistic when she was younger, and while she didn't alienate her family completely, there was definitely bad blood between her and all of her children. Her daughters in law also have a lot of bad blood with her - it's hard not to, because she could be very nasty before the dementia set in. She was not an easy or pleasant woman to be around and refused many of the measures that were taken to try and help her before her decline (didn't want to take her pills, didn't want to exercise and would skip her classes, didn't want to be social or reach out to the friendly people in her facility, etc. - and it's a *very* nice facility). As such, her other two children - my aunt and uncle - have essentially abandoned the situation. They don't come and visit her ever, and have placed the burden of her care on my father, because he's always been her ""favorite"" son (he's the oldest).   Does this situation resonate with anyone here? I want to visit her more often, but being around her aggravates my own depression greatly and puts me in a very morbid mood. Both of my parents are older, so thinking about how this could happen to them makes me feel sick to my stomach. Being around someone who's quality of life is so poor, particularly when we weren't very bonded to begin with, is also hard - I feel like I'm too weak to deal with this. I also get the feeling that everyone is just waiting for her to die, because she doesn't seem to enjoy life anymore.   I've tried talking to my parents about possibly trying to find a therapist/counselor who works with dementia patients, even if it's only for the social interaction, but they aren't sure if it would help because of her memory and communication issues. I wish there was some antidepressant or other drug she could take to improve her mood, but I don't know if that would help either, especially since she's already taking such strong psychiatric medication.  Advice?

fp3kwe," I found out today from my sister that my mom has decided to move my grandma into a memory care facility. For some background, my grandma has been suffering from Alzheimer’s for several years, but in the last couple of years it has really advanced. She was living alone after my grandpa died 6 years ago and was doing fine for a while, but in the last year and a half it became really clear that she couldn’t and shouldn’t live alone, her Alzheimer’s was advancing so fast and she was incredibly lonely. My mom moved her in with her and my dad almost exactly a year ago. My parents also raise my 14 year old nephew so their hands really are full. They have had guardianship of him since he was 3 weeks old. My mom also has caregivers come for about 5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her sisters don’t help. I try to help as much as I can. But my mom has gotten to the point she is miserable and can’t do it anymore. My grandmother is to the point where if you aren’t right in front of her, she doesn’t remember you exist. And even if you are in front of her, she’s not totally sure who you are besides her daughters (and that’s sure to change before long). I understand where my mom is coming from, I do. She can’t ever go visit her own young grand babies out of state if someone can’t stay with my grandma. She can’t leave the house really unless my dad or one of my grandmas caregivers are there. My grandma is constantly arguing about the same things: she never believes that she’s been fed, even if it was 5 minutes earlier. She will hardly bathe. She never remembers that she lives there or who she lives with.  More recently, with COVID-19 she is mad frequently when my mom tells her she can’t go to church or go shopping (her favorite past time) and she of course can’t understand or remember what COVID-19 is, so it’s the same conversation 15x a day. I guess my mom has now decided she can’t continue living like this, I just worry about my grandma moving again. My mom knows that moving her into memory care will cause her to decline further quickly. I hate the thought of her being even more scared and confused than she already is, with no familiar faces to look for at any given time. Of course we will visit her as much as possible, and luckily the place they are trying to get her into soon is 2 miles down the road from me.   I guess I’m just wanting to know what you alls experience has been with moving a loved one into memory care.

jdlndz,"Throwaway because I don't want such a personal text on my main account.  I'm  35M. My mother (59F) has finally been diagnosed with early-onset  Alzheimers a few weeks ago. She had been having symptoms for a few  years, which we always attributed to the strong medications she takes  for a rare vascular disease she has. Her dementia progressed very, very  quickly. Just two years ago she was a little forgetful but you could  have a normal conversation with her, she still drove herself to errands,  etc. One year later she's completely taken by the dementia, having very  aggressive episodes (she tries to hit my father constantly - she's  never been aggressive before), paranoia, can't hold a memory for more  than 5 minutes, forgets she's already home and gives tantrums wanting to  ""go home"". You know, all the symptoms of Alzheimer in a moderate to  late stage.  I live about 200 miles  away from her. She lives in a small countryside town with my father and  my elderly grandmother (her mother). I had been sort of a distant son  for the past decade because of relationship issues I had with them  growing up. Nothing really traumatic, but my upbringing drove me away  from them. I moved to a big city and visited them about 3 or 4 times a  year, talking weekly-ish on the phone. Now this is happening and I'm  getting closer to them again, especially my father, to give him support.  He is taking this pretty badly and is getting desperate, not knowing  how to deal with her condition. Nobody is prepared for this. I'm trying  to visit them at least once a month, but COVID makes me very afraid to  go. They're in a small town with very few cases, while I live in my  country's largest city with tens of thousands of cases. My fear is  unknowingly bringing the virus to them, since they all have high-risk  conditions if they're infected.  My  father (63M) had to quit his job to become her 24/7 caregiver.  Thankfully I have a good job in the city and I'm able to help them  financially, but I'm not rich by any means. He's still a few years away  from being eligible for retirement. I feel like she's getting quite  close to having to be put in a long-term care facility, which is crazy  expensive in my country. At the same time, she still has some good days  and we'd feel awful to send her away.  To  add insult to injury, she has a lot of sisters but apart from one,  they're all ganging up against my father and making the situation worse.  We don't want their help, we just need them to not be part of the  problem. This is the hardest situation we have ever dealt with in our  lives and they keep making it worse out of pettiness, ignorance and  family drama.  Anyway, I guess I  just wanted to vent. I know plenty of people here are or have been in  similar situations. I'm open to advice or any kind of feedback.  Thank you for reading.",Mother with early-onset Alzheimer's and I'm feeling completely lost.

hahcz7,"Hi All,  I want to start this by saying, I think you're all incredible. This community has been so lovely to me when I've reached out and it making all of this feel more manageable.  My grandma has mid-late stage alzheimers. We finally got her assessed last week by a geriatric care team as recommended by her GP. They ruled out a UTI or any other infection and have placed her on an antipsychotic to help with her delusions (was seeing intruders in the house).   My mom has kind of taken the lead with all of this, with her siblings kind of falling in line even though there have been a few missteps. She's been incredibly strong and the biggest complaint I've heard from her was ""I wish I could fix it"".  Tonight my mom hit a wall and the floodgate was released.   My heart broke when I heard her say she missed her mom. I miss who my grandma was too, she was a spitfire, witty, naughty and so cheeky, an amazing story teller and loved to giggle with me on the phone. But I also know the way I'd feel if this was my mom would be different.  My mom is also devastated for my grandad. My grandma has some awful sundowners and is HORRIBLE to him and I can only imagine how hard it is for him. She was also pretty bad to my mom last week, convinced that she was my grandad's illegitimate daughter and told my mom that she would never love her.   So reddit, I turn to you. What do I do? What do I say to my mom? Especially when a lot of the good in my grandma is gone and there are only small moments and flickers of it.   I'm just wondering what you wish someone had said to you if you went gone through this grief process.  My mom knows there's no fixing it and that all we can do is make sure my grandma is healthy and safe, and if some happy comes, that's great too.  Thank you for reading my ramblings. Much love and good vibes to you and yours <3

u3aiaa,"I'm not even sure how to ask about this.   Short-ish version:  I want to know if it's OK to have my mom over to *her own house* for holidays.   My only experience with this sort of thing is with my spouse's family situation. With their family, they do not let the grandma go to her old house any more. She gets upset and doesn't want to leave. I was told by my wife not to bring my mom back to her old home, as it would cause trouble or upset her like how her grandma got upset. Both my wife's grandma and my mom have to go back to their nursing homes each day, so they can't stay at their old homes. They both have Alzheimer's, but it hasn't progressed so far for them not to remember their old houses.   Long version:   My mother is in skilled nursing / memory care. I sometimes take her out to places for lunch, ice cream, or go shopping. I have to make sure to get her back to the nursing home every time, because it's important for her to always take her scheduled medicine (and have nurses available around the clock).   She still owns her house, and I've been taking care of it for years.  Since she hasn't been there in a long time, most of her possessions are gone, things have been fixed up, some rooms have been repainted, there are new appliances, and the yard looks different. I basically tried fixing it up, just in case we had to sell it to pay for my mom's care.   Well, Medicaid took care of things, and they said that we can keep the house.   So then we had this nice house, all fixed up. We have been wanting to do more things there. We did Halloween there, and we want to do Easter over there. My wife and I have been looking into selling our house for a while (since before my mom went into memory care), so it actually works out well for us to stay at my mom's house. I talked to my mom about this already, and she thought it would be a good idea for me to stay there to make sure it was taken care of.   I was thinking about getting my mom for Easter and having her join us, but I don't know if that is a good idea. I don't want to make her upset. I would also feel real guilty about doing stuff with family but not have my mom there at her own house.   But I'm afraid that she might see her old house and not want to leave. Or maybe she will see her old house, realize how much of it has changed and get really upset. It's also possible that she won't remember the house at all.   Has anyone else been in a situation like this?

My parents are the only caretakers despite my dad having older siblings (he’s the youngest). She’s been staying with us for several years now as she was in a different country before and it’s just getting worse. I feel incredibly sad and sorry for my parents who have sacrificed their time and insanity to take care of someone who’s extremely loud and abusive (verbally and physically) to everyone. She screams calling for her older son who lives literally next door. They refuse to take her in because of her behavior. They’ve completely ignored their responsibilities of taking care of THEIR mother and thus my parents have no other choice but to keep her with us. I wake up early in the morning because of her screams. Oftentimes, she does not sleep and will talk and scream for about 3 nights in a row. I know my parents are fully exhausted to the core which is why I keep telling them to ask my dad’s brother to take her even just for a few months but they don’t even try asking. It frustrates me that I want to be able to help them and lighten their responsibilities but it;s like they refuse to be helped. My mother does everything for her; cook, wash her, do her laundry, etc. She always verbally (even physically) abuses my mother, sometimes my father, and I just can;t take it anymore. It also affects me and my sisters because our house isn’t big so we can hear her all the time. My sisters are studying and I work at home. My family is also traditional so they will never have her live in facilities.  I’m frustrated and want to cry looking at my tired parents because I know they want this to be over. I’m about to cry as I type this because I just have a lot of emotions. Today was too much for and I’m at my limits. I want to run away from this house and live far away where I can’t hear her screaming for her other son. I feel angry, tired, and guilty of all this and I don’t even know what to do or think anymore.

My step-dad is still highly independent and can still act like himself around other people. I can often have a conversation with him and if I didn't already know it, I wouldn't be able to guess he has alzheimers. He struggles with things such as remembering how to log onto the computer, he can't tell time on an analog clock, but he can still go out on his own to shop and visit people.   I'm seeking out for my mother.

I know she is suffering, and that it is hard for her because everything is all about the person with alzheimers, and not the spouse. Her self esteem is suffering and she feels trapped. She says everything sets him off (yelling and berates her), and he becomes focused on things and often freaks out at her if she says or does the wrong thing.  I don't know what to do to help her. I love my step-father so so dearly, but it is so hard to watch my mother in this. A big part of me wants to tell her to leave before it's too late and he loses his independence, because she is so young and has so much ahead of her still and the other part feels so guilty to even think of wanting her to do that. Every outcome for both of them breaks my heart.  Is she doomed with a life where she has to walk over egg shells and ""be agreeable"" to prevent his freak outs? This is the advice she's been given multiple times. She says he has never been physically violent, but that his anger is very unpredictable/severe and the littlest things set him off. She has also been told to ""always carry a cell phone, even at home"" just in case things get bad.   She isn't interested in going to a support group because she doesn't want to sit around and talk about all of the crappy things happening.  Can anyone relate to this?

That said, she's clearly not coping with me needing to take over handling the finances, or my sibling and I doing more around the house. I've tried to get her to talk about what she's feeling.

They were staying with my aunt up North and recently came down to try to get back home. They have been staying with us for a couple of weeks, and it is so tough watching my grandmother. She is in mid to late stages of Alzheimer's, and it deeply saddens me. She looks for my grandfather when he is right next to her and very visible. When she goes to the rr, she can't find the toilet, forgets to wipe and wash her hands. She forgets she eats right after she eats. She wakes up distressed, trying to figure out where she is and who the heck is around. She's clueless a lot of the times and doesn't notice when people get home or when they are speaking to her. She doesn't remember who I am, or who her children are. When she speaks to us, she mostly thinks she's speaking to strangers. I don't know how to deal with this. I apologize if this sounds rude or something; I have never been in this situation. Throughout my years of studying psychology, I have learned a lot about Alzheimer's but never had to witness it firsthand. I am afraid of what's to come as I know that it only gets worse from here. I wonder if she knows she's a little lost or if they lose that part of themselves too. I wonder how much it tears her children apart (my mother and aunt included) if it's affecting me too. They are much closer to her.
", Grandmother with Alzheimer's
hvjl8g,"Thanks for taking the time to read (and maybe respond) to this. 5 days ago I moved my mother, 80, into dementia care. She has Alzheimers and had been living alone. She was kind of managing, with me doing everything, plus a cleaner to deal with all the food she'd leave rotting in the sink etc, but had no short term memory (eg we'd order food somewhere and 30 seconds later would try and order again) and very confused long term memory (couldn't remember her brother had died, or where I had grown up, for example). She was right on the precipice of getting lost; couldn't remember her address and would frequently ask how to get home from the one local restaurant she would go to—50m from her flat. She  often gets confused about whether she was awake or dreaming etc.  So, based on that and advice from doctor and family (my aunt is a retired aged care nurse) moved her into a home. She thinks it temporary while work is done on her apartment. She is very unhappy and I can understand why. It's a really nice home in a modern building with a garden, hair dressers, cafe and quite a lot of residents; certainly not cheap. But despite her memory issues and confusion, she is still quite alert and in much better shape than most of the residents; lots of people in wheelchairs nodding off etc. Of course, she thinks she is totally fine and looks around at all the ""old people"" who ""have dementia… or worse!"" and is very disturbed. She's refuses to try and talk to anyone and just hides out in her room.  Basically she is caught in the grey area between not being able to safely operate in the world, but not being so out of it that she just takes it all in her stride. With Covid re-spiking in Sydney (by 'spiking', I mean 12 cases yesterday), the homes have all gone back in to lock down so only window visits and no taking her out.  My great fear is that I have put her in too early. The home and her friends say no. I'm struggling with a lot of guilt, grief and anxiety about what I've done.   Does anyone have any experience they could share about this issue—ie a parent being put in care who can't seem to find other residents at 'their level' and how to maybe make her life easier for her?  Thanks!

5q2li7,"Shortly after my Grandfather died, my 83 year old grandmother chose to live with my family. The last few years have been fine until just before Christmas. After researching the subject, she has what I would consider Dementia and her regular doctor would agree but has not written a formal diagnosis as of last week.  This last week has been a frightening experience for my whole family. She has begun wandering around the yard disoriented and wanting to call 911 because ""nobody is around anymore.""  I've come to the realization our family is not equipped to face this challenge. She has access to the outside from her room and I'm waking up after 2-3 hours in fear of what happens next.  We have intentions of moving her to a Memory Care facility. Tonight I could not sleep, thoughts of her screaming at me for betraying her for moving her to a safer environment.  What are my steps? What do you wish someone would had told you in this situation? What things do I have to know?  Thank you for your time and advice.

adtm6y,"My grandmother has dementia, I’m not 100% sure as I don’t think anyone has officially had her tested, it’s just “dementia”. I don’t think my family really understood until recently how bad it was.  From my research, she’s a late stage 5, early stage 6 Alzheimer’s.   She’s been “a bit forgetful” for about 10 years now, but in recent years we learnt that she doesn’t shower, doesn’t cook, has regular accidents etc. when she’s stressed or anxious she has difficulty with names/faces, but is generally good with her family or people she’s known a long time.   My grandfather recently passed quite suddenly and we had to move her into an aged care facility as she can’t live by herself.  This also revealed to us how much she relied on him to not look sick.   Her condition has significantly worsened since being there, she’s always confused, upset, angry. It’s not a dementia friendly place at all and the nurses aren’t the best at handling it. There’s no cues as to what time of day it is, the building is confusing and hard to find the dining/lounge room, etc.   She has regularly said that she may as well not exist anymore as she has nothing to live for and she’s mad at the family for dumping her there. A couple of times I have found notes in her room with her name, my grandfathers name, their address and phone number, kids names, and usually the words “help” or “take me home”.   My parents have a “guest house” that they currently use as an air bnb, and are considering moving her in there. From my mum and my research, it’s a dementia friendly space and there are slight modifications we can make to make it more enabling for her.  We’d also get home help, a morning or overnight nurse etc.   We could bring her furniture from home, give her simple tasks, take her out for activities.   More important than that is that she’d be around family more, have more independence and get her self confidence back. From my research she’s a late stage 5, early stage 6 Alzheimer’s   We’re aware that as she moves through stage 6 and into stage 7, she will get worse and will need to go into a dementia specific care place.   Is it worth moving her now, to my parents, only to move her again in a year or so?  If she does move in to my parents (it’s actually a separate unit, self contained but with easy access to their house), what extra care would she need that we might have overlooked.   Or should we look at sending her straight to a memory care unit?

6ohvbz,"hi there,   there is a trip to a camp that our family has made every year for 50 years. it's a regional conference for churches which my grandparents have always loved.   however, many people in their generation have passed on or are not able to travel. also... grandpa passed away a few months ago from a very brief bout of cancer.  most of the time grandma does not seem to be aware that grandpa has passed away, she is calm when we don't mention him outright and can get very very upset sometimes when his illness and death are recalled. it's like she's experiencing it all over again, with the added pain that she can't go visit him or see him again.   they were married 65 years.  this will be the first year without grandpa. she is 88. she can walk around and is very familiar with this camp in one sense, but in another sense she doesn't even remember that she still lives in her own home. she is aware that she has a relationship with her daughters and me, but does not recall the type of relationship (mother/daughter, granddaughter) or our names or how long we all know each other or, again, where she even is at the time (one of our homes which she should know)...   so any tips please?! how to keep track of her while retaining her dignity and self respect. we have a room in the lodge right across from the bathroom and i want to hang a sign on the door with her name or our family name so she will think to herself ""well, this must be my room.""  is it realistic to ask friends from the camp to keep from talking about grandpa's illness and death too much? i would rather have her recall happy memories/her emotions about being near him and connected to him.

buwe56,"Hello!  &#x200B;  My 90-year-old grandmother has dementia. She lives in a care facility and is visited by one of her children once a day- we have a schedule set up for her so she never has a day without a visit.  &#x200B;  The problem is, she doesn't remember being visited, and will tell whoever is there that day that no one ever visits her, that she hasn't seen x person in months (they were there two days ago), etc. I know we are not supposed to correct her as this causes confusion and distress, but she is already highly distressed. She has always been all about her family, and she gets extremely distraught feeling like her family is gone and no one ever comes to see her. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Why does John never come visit me?"" and occasionally aggressive- ""Why haven't you come to see me in so long?""  &#x200B;  What can we do in this situation? How can be reassure her that her family is there for her without making her more upset?

kdcxcj,"For context, my mom, grandma, and I have lived in the house we currently live in for 9 years. The past few months, my grandma has mentioned going home every night. She seems to think someone brought her here sometime during the day. It gets bad to the point where she has packed suitcases of her stuff so she could go home. I'm worried that she is going to try and actually ""go home"". Thankfully, we do not have a car so I don't have to worry about that but I'm still scared she's going to run away in the middle of the night. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this?

hz2kfb,"Hey. My grandmother (88) has alzheimers/dementia. It was at an okay stage but it deteriorated when my aunt, her youngest daughter who lived with her and her kids, got cancer and eventually died less than a year later. She saw her body so that she would believe us and grieved and cried and everything. Afterwards, my other aunts started having her stay with them for a while and she was basically moving between like 3 houses every couple of months which i now realize is really bad as this destroys routine and consistency but what's done is done.   Anyway, she finally returned home yesterday which she didn't remember at all or her grandkids who lived there until she actually saw the house. When she got there she began to ask about my aunt. She can't speak very well and her sentences are very very loose and vague but we can make out that she's asking about her. It's been brought up a couple of times and no one know show to address. We just switch conversations and try to distract her. We're not sure if we should keep doing this or show her a picture of her and ask her if this is the person she's asking about? But to do that we'd have to be ready to tell her she's no longer around and deal with the circumstances of that.  I think it wouldn't hurt her to forget about her as incredibly painful as that sounds considering she took care of her all her life. It would only cause pain and confusion. I'm not sure what to do.

82mpl4,"So, my grandfather passed away this Sunday and my family didn't want to tell my grandmother until a better time as her blood pressure and mind was calmer. Come Tuesday night, her sons came to tell her that her husband has passed at the age of 90+. My grandmother is about 86.   It has only been around 10 hours since she was given the news. As a family, we know that she has memory issues. At about 3:00AM, she got up and started walking and I got in front of her by asking what you are doing. She asked me where her husband is.   I'm not sure how bad her dementia (or if it's alzheimers) is. She sort of has a fixed schedule throughout the day where she would eat at certain times, start cooking rice and etc. She doesn't do anything but sit around, nap, sleep or stare into the distance.   She does ask a lot of questions as to where everyone is. If I was working overnight (which I don't anymore) and etc. She knows when my mother comes home because she works a fix schedule.   How do you cope with this? (I fear that continually telling my grandmother that her husband has passed away is bad for her health and that we have to continue to say he is at the hospital). (As well as, she has severely bad hearing, so, communicating with her is a very hard task.)

Recently my grandfather passed away and my grandmother who has dementia is now alone with a nurse at their home…   The thing is this house is really big just for her and my mother is thinking of moving her to an apartment with this nurse.

Or has any advice?   PS: Her dementia is pretty advanced, after my grandpa died she has been saying she wants to go home (she refers to her childhood home)… Because of this my mother says she won’t notice if we move her out of the house because she doesn’t recognize her home right now

qa9jux,"Hello. My grandmother has dementia, I recently found out. Although I kind of knew that she was showing symptoms of it, now I realize how bad it actually is.   My mother doesn't really have a strong relationship with my grandmother, they normally see each other once or maybe twice a year, they also live pretty far away from one another. I think when we visited my grandmother in 2018, she was already being a bit forgetful: occasionally repeating words and phrases in sentences. In 2019/begin 2020 we visited her again, she did not seem to recognize me at first when she opened the door. She went upstairs, and showed us CABINETS and WARDROBES full off unnecessary stuff, which she compulsively bought. Rows and rows of the same cleaning product, toilet paper, et cetera. I don't think that we really visited her after that. (Until recently)  Just a few weeks ago, my grandmother (she is usually very cold and blunt) called my mother in a deeply emotional state, begging her to come by once. My mother asked if it was okay to see her that same day, which my grandmother initially accepted.  However, just 30 minutes or so before the appointment she said she wasn't 'feeling well' so my mother shouldn't come. She didn't, but a couple of days later she did. When my mother arrived, she found her own mother lost in dementia. My grandmother has formed this narrative which she says every single time when she's talking to someone:   ""Oh, did you know I got fired from my job? The business closed down."" THIS WAS 15 YEARS AGO.  ""Hey, I renovated my kitchen."" 10 YEARS AGO.   Yesterday, I went with my mother to see my grandmother. She did not recognize both of us. We brought some food, because she is terribly skinny and keeps forgetting to eat. My mother had to explain that she was her daughter, I think she understood that. She kept asking for my age, and awkwardly asked me what my name was, and where we lived.   Care: She can not live by herself without help anymore. We can't go there every day to take care of her, but, there is a friendly neighbour at the other end of the street who helps her and chats with her occassionally. He is truly a kind man, but it is also very strenuous for him. He is getting literal physical pain because of the intensity of taking care of my grandmother, poor soul. We have contacted my grandmother's doctor (she has not been officially diagnosed yet) who is very, lazy I would call it. He refused to get help for my grandmother and was overall just lacking. After some pushing, we have managed to get a caretaker to take care of my grandmother, but onfortunately, it starts in JANUARI! My grandmother still has a driving license and is still driving, which should be taken from her. I don't know what stage she is in, however, I would guess stage 5 of Alzheimer's. Damn, I just realized how much I wrote. If anyone actually read all of that: Thank you. I don't know what we can do at this point. ", I don't know what to do.
ijkey3,"So my grandma (75) on my mom’s side has Alzheimer’s and it’s been a while now. My grandpa takes care of her but my mom (47) does a lot too to help such as cooking food, cleaning her house and all that. And then there’s me (21) I see my grandma a couple of times a week because we live super close. Basically my grandma keeps forgetting that she is retired from work and so everyday she gets dressed and goes walking to her “work” (it’s a 5-6 mins walk from her house). We always tell her that she’s retired everyday but it doesn’t seem like she’ll ever understand or remember and I understand that there isn’t much we can do right? But my mom is having a hard time accepting all this and all she does is YELL at my grandma. I can’t take it anymore. I can see my grandma being confused and I see that she’s getting dizzy. I know for a FACT that you should not show anger or frustration in front of someone who had Alzheimer’s and DEFINITELY TO NOT YELL AT THEM. She is making her feel bad that she can’t remember. Just now she told my grandma “are you trying to punish us?” Am I wrong for being absolutely disgusted with what she is saying. I have told my mom over and over again that we can’t act like this in front of her and that it is not her fault that she’d forgetting. We cant make her feel bad for it, she doesn’t know. And when I explain this to my mom she yells at me because I’m not the one really “taking care” of her and says “maybe you should cook and bathe her maybe you’ll understand”. Okay like I get it it’s hard but like you’re not helping at the end if you’re talking to her aggressively.  My mom also forces her to put on manicure when my grandma says that she doesn’t want to. Idk man there’s other things but I don’t know what to do...

Anyway now that she's there, she's much happier, and doesn't cry and beg you to take her home, so it's much easier to go visit. I love to see her, we talk about what nail polish we like and all sorts of girly fun things. But she doesn't know that I'm her granddaughter all the time so she'll talk to me about more serious things too sometimes. I always feel she's much happier when I just talk to her and go along with whatever she is saying. I never correct her unless she asks me a question and I feel like it makes her happier. However my mom and aunt still try to remind her of things, like that my grandpa died or that she's not at home/work/wherever. I just feel like why tell her, why remind her of these things? I wouldn't want to find out every day that my husband died. But I don't know. Am I wrong in playing into her delusions so much? I just want to make her as happy as possible but I don't want to do something that would adversely affect her either. This is all so confusing and I guess I just need an outsiders opinion because I don't really have anybody to ask.

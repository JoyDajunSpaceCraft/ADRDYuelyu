started showing symptoms for when she was around 86, maybe earlier. in hindsight it's clear to see why but i believe she started showing symptoms of dementia when she started to accuse my uncle and my cousin (his son) of stealing from her, which she adamantly believed happened. this may have coinsided with some home renovation carried out by the council, i'm not sure if anything was actually stolen but she seriously believed my uncle and cousin did it which led to friction and upset. fast forward a year or so later to the next time i saw her and it was clear that her memory was detiorating, she remembered me but she seemed struggled to remember the last time she saw my nan (her ex-daughter-in-law which visited her the day or week before). as i left in the car (with my mother and aunty) i was upset as it was starting to set in that the grandma i loved dearly was starting to fade away, doubled with the news that my mum told me in the car that she also accused her of stealing several items.these accusations have upset my mum deeply and she has not seen my grandma since (i have since learn that accusing people of stealing happens regularly in those diagnosed with alzheimer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and told my mum that it wasn't my grandma talking).fast forward another 2 or 3 year later to last september and i went to see her with my nan, which was the first time i saw my grandma since the prior visit (i was conflicted to whether i should go to see my grandma anymore or not her and at the time i didn't know accusing family of stealing was connected to her illness). although i was expecting her memory to have worsened i thought she may she have still remembered me. but it wasn't until she asked who i was, who my mother is and how i was related to her did my heart drop. i had to contain my emotion as i was on the verge of crying infront of her and my nan.i haven't seen her since and i am constantly filled with regrets and emotions...would she still have remembered me if i saw her more often? i can't but help thinking that in her time of need i abandoned her and left her without a reason to why i stopped visiting her. what makes it even harder is

lb0jpk,"How can I answer her questions to make her feel at home? My grandparent has vascular dementia and lives at home with one of her older children. I go over to help give company when I can, and I think the hardest part is making her feel at home. How can I answer her questions to make her feel at home? We of course have the keys hidden but leave the car doors unlocked because she can get angry when HER car isn't available to her. I've made a sign for her bedroom door that says her name and plan on making a memory book with a picture of her in her house with some family so she can maybe make the association on her own. I usually try to answer that she is home and that her family lives with her, and try to point out things in the house that she knows are hers -paintings she has done, or take her to her room to give her a tour. Sometimes she realizes that it is her house but usually not and she often answers with ""I didn't know that.""",How can I answer her questions to make her feel at home?

A few years ago my grandmother was in hospital (aged 88) and because of the medication she was under, she kept showing common tropes of that of a person with dementia (delusion, forgetting peoples names, etc.) and was placed in a ward with patients of the same illness. She checked out of hospital after about a month and went back to normal every day life. She broke her hip last year and had to be in hospital again for about three months. She's 91 now and she's aware her memory isn't what it used to be. She'll spend a great deal of time when I visit talking about the exact same things (religion, what she's watching on TV, etc.).

3prph4,"Some advice please! My mom has had alzheimer's for the last 5 years and it's gotten progressively worse, to a point where she needs 24 hour care. At her worse, she thinks her husband (my dad) is still alive (he died 25 years ago) and she lives back at her parents house (40 years ago). Anyway, after moving her to a nursing home a few months ago and admittedly I delayed this for too long as I didn't want to admit she was that badly off. We had live-in help stay with here prior to this and probably has a rose-tinted view of her condition. She sometimes does this to my kids and my son, in his innocence,  said ""I think I should stop visiting grandma, I think she gets confused and upset trying to remember how she knows me and I don't want to cause her any more pain"". I've explained this to her sister (my aunt), and even told her that her visit alone could be upsetting to her (however, I'm not going to stop her from seeing her).

Before this blowout I've her some many Alzheimers's care guides that reccomend trying to confuse them as little as possible. One even went as far as to say, once the transition to the new home has been made, it is critical that no more abrupt changes be presented as that can lead to mental disassociation, causing undue stress.

qa9jux,"I don't know what we can do at this point. Hello. My grandmother has dementia, I recently found out. Although I kind of knew that she was showing symptoms of it, now I realize how bad it actually is. My mother doesn't really have a strong relationship with my grandmother, they normally see each other once or maybe twice a year, they also live pretty far away from one another. I think when we visited my grandmother in 2018, she was already being a bit forgetful: occasionally repeating words and phrases in sentences. In 2019/begin 2020 we visited her again, she did not seem to recognize me at first when she opened the door. She went upstairs, and showed us CABINETS and WARDROBES full off unnecessary stuff, which she compulsively bought. Rows and rows of the same cleaning product, toilet paper, et cetera. I don't think that we really visited her after that. (Until recently)  Just a few weeks ago, my grandmother (she is usually very cold and blunt) called my mother in a deeply emotional state, begging her to come by once. However, just 30 minutes or so before the appointment she said she wasn't 'feeling well' so my mother shouldn't come. When my mother arrived, she found her own mother lost in dementia. My grandmother has formed this narrative which she says every single time when she's talking to someone:   ""Oh, did you know I got fired from my job? The business closed down."" THIS WAS 15 YEARS AGO. 10 YEARS AGO. She did not recognize both of us. Care: She can not live by herself without help anymore. We can't go there every day to take care of her, but, there is a friendly neighbour at the other end of the street who helps her and chats with her occassionally. He is truly a kind man, but it is also very strenuous for him. He is getting literal physical pain because of the intensity of taking care of my grandmother, poor soul. He refused to get help for my grandmother and was overall just lacking. My grandmother still has a driving license and is still driving, which should be taken from her.

This will go on for hours, sometimes the whole day. She gets very depressed and upset over it. Telling her she will be going home next week, and everything will be back to normal then doesn't help either. She remains depressed and upset and lamenting about wanting to go home right away.

lskmfe,"I just need some advice or a sweet message lol I’m venting, this is long but I need advice and someone to tell. I’m 20 and my grandma has had dementia for the last couple years, she’s slowly deteriorating but this year has been the hardest for me. Mainly because of how aware I became of the issues and her situation. She lives in the midwest and I live and grew up on the east coast so I didn’t get to see her a lot when I was growing up. I didn’t love going to her house as a kid because I just always felt a homesick and there wasn’t a lot going on over there and I could never sleep. As I became a teenager it definitely became more manageable but I still didn’t see her a lot because I was in sports and school and whatever the excuses. She lives with my grandpa still who is just a old fart and used to order her around the house all the time and her son (my uncle) has lived there his whole life and he’s just a lost soul who drinks, he means well. It’s just low vibes and my uncle doesn’t really get along with my grandpa and it’s just a mess. There’s not enough interaction or high energy to keep her wheels turning. I’m also 1/2 grandchildren and the only girl in my family since my grandma had all boys, and the other grandkid is a boy. I didn’t even give her a chance. or so it feels. It was just because I didn’t want to or feel like it or just because it was awkward sometimes. I call her as much as I can now but it’s hard and draining. I always cry and spiral and she always mentions to me that I should come visit her.

My mom moved her in with her and my dad almost exactly a year ago. My parents also raise my 14 year old nephew so their hands really are full. They have had guardianship of him since he was 3 weeks old. My mom also has caregivers come for about 5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her sisters don’t help. I try to help as much as I can. But my mom has gotten to the point she is miserable and can’t do it anymore. My grandmother is to the point where if you aren’t right in front of her, she doesn’t remember you exist. I understand where my mom is coming from, I do. She can’t ever go visit her own young grand babies out of state if someone can’t stay with my grandma. She can’t leave the house really unless my dad or one of my grandmas caregivers are there. My grandma is constantly arguing about the same things: she never believes that she’s been fed, even if it was 5 minutes earlier. She will hardly bathe. She never remembers that she lives there or who she lives with. More recently, with COVID-19 she is mad frequently when my mom tells her she can’t go to church or go shopping (her favorite past time) and she of course can’t understand or remember what COVID-19 is, so it’s the same conversation 15x a day. I guess my mom has now decided she can’t continue living like this, I just worry about my grandma moving again. I hate the thought of her being even more scared and confused than she already is, with no familiar faces to look for at any given time.

jdlndz,"I'm open to advice or any kind of feedback. I'm  35M. My mother (59F) has finally been diagnosed with early-onset  Alzheimers a few weeks ago. She had been having symptoms for a few  years, which we always attributed to the strong medications she takes  for a rare vascular disease she has. Her dementia progressed very, very  quickly. Just two years ago she was a little forgetful but you could  have a normal conversation with her, she still drove herself to errands,  etc. One year later she's completely taken by the dementia, having very  aggressive episodes (she tries to hit my father constantly - she's  never been aggressive before), paranoia, can't hold a memory for more  than 5 minutes, forgets she's already home and gives tantrums wanting to  ""go home"". You know, all the symptoms of Alzheimer in a moderate to  late stage. I live about 200 miles  away from her. She lives in a small countryside town with my father and  my elderly grandmother (her mother). I had been sort of a distant son  for the past decade because of relationship issues I had with them  growing up. Nothing really traumatic, but my upbringing drove me away  from them. I moved to a big city and visited them about 3 or 4 times a  year, talking weekly-ish on the phone. Now this is happening and I'm  getting closer to them again, especially my father, to give him support. He is taking this pretty badly and is getting desperate, not knowing  how to deal with her condition. Nobody is prepared for this. I'm trying  to visit them at least once a month, but COVID makes me very afraid to  go. They're in a small town with very few cases, while I live in my  country's largest city with tens of thousands of cases. My fear is  unknowingly bringing the virus to them, since they all have high-risk  conditions if they're infected. My  father (63M) had to quit his job to become her 24/7 caregiver. Thankfully I have a good job in the city and I'm able to help them  financially, but I'm not rich by any means. He's still a few years away  from being eligible for retirement. I feel like she's getting quite  close to having to be put in a long-term care facility, which is crazy  expensive in my country. To  add insult to injury, she has a lot of sisters but apart from one,  they're all ganging up against my father and making the situation worse. We don't want their help, we just need them to not be part of the  problem. This is the hardest situation we have ever dealt with in our  lives and they keep making it worse out of pettiness, ignorance and  family drama. Anyway, I guess I  just wanted to vent. I know plenty of people here are or have been in  similar situations. I'm open to advice or any kind of feedback. Thank you for reading.",I'm open to advice or any kind of feedback.

vte8ql,"It's come to the point where we're both hoping she just won't wake up one day, or she'll get sick so we can take her to the hospital and she has to go to the nursing home. My grandmother is 89 years old and got diagnosed with alzheimers last year. She lives in her own seperate house on our (me and my parents') property. She is my dad's mother. She is ""on the list"" for the local nursing home meaning if she'd end up in hospital or we *really* can't take care of her anymore she can go there if there's a free room. Me and my mom are so sick of taking care of her, so beyond fed up with it. My mom has dealt with this incredibly stubborn woman for 30 years, and now that her mental state is declining rapidly its all way too much. My dad is retired but he spends a lot of time out with his friends and my brother and he generally has a ""just let her be, it's not that bad"" attitude towards my grandma, easy for him considering he's not the one dealing with her most of the time. Me and my mom both work part time and take care of grandma. I'm 29. We get groceries for her, cook her food, take care of her cat, clean her house when we're allowed, take care of the garden. But ofcourse in her eyes we don't do anything for her and don't care for her. We also steal everything from her and especially me, she ""knows what I'm doing"" whatever that may be. She comes to our house at 3am, not knowing that its nighttime, and we have to get her back to her house. She loses her keys all the time so we had to take those. Every Saturday my mom goes to our vacation house with parents to relax and im really glad she can do that, but it also means I have to stay home so grandma isn't alone. The odd time I also get to go to the vacation house grandma has to come along cause wherever I go, she goes. Whenever she comes along she also insists on doing whatever I'm doing. I'm so fed up and so is my mom. We've told my dad that something needs to happen but all we get is a ""well.. she doesn't want to go to the nursing home so, yeah"" and that's it. Done.

8ihlxu,"Does this situation resonate with anyone here? My grandmother has dementia (my dad's Mom - I live at home while attending college). She lives in a retirement home in our city. Pretty much the only time she shows emotion nowadays is when she a) cries at random, or b) begs my dad not to ""take her back to that place"" when he's bringing her back to the retirement community after a doctors appointment. She obviously doesn't want to be there and we feel as if she's depressed. It makes me feel awful thinking about what her quality of life is - she essentially sits on her couch all day long until someone comes to take her to her meals or give her medication and other care. She was previously diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia and takes antipsychotics to control delusions. Before moving to the retirement community, her communication skills were still quite good, but she had issues with persecutory delusions and some smaller lapses of confusion. Everyone in my household is very busy. Though a big part of why we don't visit her too often is because of our hectic schedules, it's also because seeing her is so difficult. She was not an easy or pleasant woman to be around and refused many of the measures that were taken to try and help her before her decline (didn't want to take her pills, didn't want to exercise and would skip her classes, didn't want to be social or reach out to the friendly people in her facility, etc. - and it's a *very* nice facility). As such, her other two children - my aunt and uncle - have essentially abandoned the situation. They don't come and visit her ever, and have placed the burden of her care on my father, because he's always been her ""favorite"" son (he's the oldest). Does this situation resonate with anyone here? I want to visit her more often, but being around her aggravates my own depression greatly and puts me in a very morbid mood. Both of my parents are older, so thinking about how this could happen to them makes me feel sick to my stomach. Being around someone who's quality of life is so poor, particularly when we weren't very bonded to begin with, is also hard - I feel like I'm too weak to deal with this. I also get the feeling that everyone is just waiting for her to die, because she doesn't seem to enjoy life anymore. Advice?",Does this situation resonate with anyone here?

My mother was diagnosed around 3 years ago with mild vascular dementia. Now it's moderate. My dad and brother have been taking care of her, but my brother has a family and my dad is exhausted and can't keep up with the shopping, yard work, etc AND keep an eye on her. She can't see very well (although her eyes are apparently fine). She has extremely poor short term memory. My phone calls with her are breaking my heart. I want to be there for her as she was for me, and I'm always strong for her on the phone, but it's hard to hold back the tears. She's getting worse and worse. Last time it was a struggle to get childcare for my kids (I only brought the youngest). She misses me. She can't use the computer, can't read/write, etc. She has an emergency button on a necklace that's tied to a service that I help set up for her when I was last there, but she wouldn't know to push it now. To give my dad a break, after him resisting for a while, he had her admitted into a care home for a week. I just got off the phone with her today and she's not happy there and misses him terribly, and I felt so awful that I couldn't do anything for her. Her voice was so sad, and she's never really been one to show any sadness to me - she's protected me from that until now. He needs a break anyway, and it'd just make him feel bad.

rhr2e8,"Forgive me for this is going to be a long story. Forgive me for this is going to be a long story. Hi! So for context, I have a grandmother who’s probably 100+ years old (father’s side) with insanely terrible dementia. My parents are the only caretakers despite my dad having older siblings (he’s the youngest). She’s been staying with us for several years now as she was in a different country before and it’s just getting worse. I feel incredibly sad and sorry for my parents who have sacrificed their time and insanity to take care of someone who’s extremely loud and abusive (verbally and physically) to everyone. She screams calling for her older son who lives literally next door. They refuse to take her in because of her behavior. They’ve completely ignored their responsibilities of taking care of THEIR mother and thus my parents have no other choice but to keep her with us. I wake up early in the morning because of her screams. Oftentimes, she does not sleep and will talk and scream for about 3 nights in a row. It frustrates me that I want to be able to help them and lighten their responsibilities but it;s like they refuse to be helped. My mother does everything for her; cook, wash her, do her laundry, etc. She always verbally (even physically) abuses my mother, sometimes my father, and I just can;t take it anymore. It also affects me and my sisters because our house isn’t big so we can hear her all the time. My sisters are studying and I work at home. My family is also traditional so they will never have her live in facilities. I’m frustrated and want to cry looking at my tired parents because I know they want this to be over. I’m about to cry as I type this because I just have a lot of emotions. Today was too much for and I’m at my limits. I want to run away from this house and live far away where I can’t hear her screaming for her other son. I feel angry, tired, and guilty of all this and I don’t even know what to do or think anymore. I love my parents but I don’t want them suffering from this. If you’ve reached the end thank you very much. TLDR; I’m going crazy trying to help my parents because of my grandmother with the worst case of dementia possible  Edit: typo",Forgive me for this is going to be a long story.

My mom has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia at the age of 73 and is struggling badly with the diagnosis and her changing cognitive ability. She is likely experiencing some sundowner-like symptoms. She is crying a lot, often in the evenings, repeating things like ""I just want to be me"". She's always been a powerhouse in the family, thinking of herself as a bit of a matriarch--always caring for others, taking care of house and home, etc. Very ""in control"" of herself and, in her eyes, her family.

8ihlxu,"Does this situation resonate with anyone here? My grandmother has dementia (my dad's Mom - I live at home while attending college). She lives in a retirement home in our city. Pretty much the only time she shows emotion nowadays is when she a) cries at random, or b) begs my dad not to ""take her back to that place"" when he's bringing her back to the retirement community after a doctors appointment. She obviously doesn't want to be there and we feel as if she's depressed. It makes me feel awful thinking about what her quality of life is - she essentially sits on her couch all day long until someone comes to take her to her meals or give her medication and other care. She was previously diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia and takes antipsychotics to control delusions. Before moving to the retirement community, her communication skills were still quite good, but she had issues with persecutory delusions and some smaller lapses of confusion. Everyone in my household is very busy. Though a big part of why we don't visit her too often is because of our hectic schedules, it's also because seeing her is so difficult. She was not an easy or pleasant woman to be around and refused many of the measures that were taken to try and help her before her decline (didn't want to take her pills, didn't want to exercise and would skip her classes, didn't want to be social or reach out to the friendly people in her facility, etc. - and it's a *very* nice facility). As such, her other two children - my aunt and uncle - have essentially abandoned the situation. They don't come and visit her ever, and have placed the burden of her care on my father, because he's always been her ""favorite"" son (he's the oldest). Does this situation resonate with anyone here? I want to visit her more often, but being around her aggravates my own depression greatly and puts me in a very morbid mood. Both of my parents are older, so thinking about how this could happen to them makes me feel sick to my stomach. Being around someone who's quality of life is so poor, particularly when we weren't very bonded to begin with, is also hard - I feel like I'm too weak to deal with this.

fp3kwe,"Any words of wisdom in this situation?  I found out today from my sister that my mom has decided to move my grandma into a memory care facility. My mom moved her in with her and my dad almost exactly a year ago. My parents also raise my 14 year old nephew so their hands really are full. They have had guardianship of him since he was 3 weeks old. My mom also has caregivers come for about 5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her sisters don’t help. I try to help as much as I can. But my mom has gotten to the point she is miserable and can’t do it anymore. My grandmother is to the point where if you aren’t right in front of her, she doesn’t remember you exist. I understand where my mom is coming from, I do. She can’t ever go visit her own young grand babies out of state if someone can’t stay with my grandma. She can’t leave the house really unless my dad or one of my grandmas caregivers are there. My grandma is constantly arguing about the same things: she never believes that she’s been fed, even if it was 5 minutes earlier. She will hardly bathe. She never remembers that she lives there or who she lives with. More recently, with COVID-19 she is mad frequently when my mom tells her she can’t go to church or go shopping (her favorite past time) and she of course can’t understand or remember what COVID-19 is, so it’s the same conversation 15x a day. I guess my mom has now decided she can’t continue living like this, I just worry about my grandma moving again. I hate the thought of her being even more scared and confused than she already is, with no familiar faces to look for at any given time. Of course we will visit her as much as possible, and luckily the place they are trying to get her into soon is 2 miles down the road from me. I guess I’m just wanting to know what you alls experience has been with moving a loved one into memory care. I can certainly see the benefit of having 24/7 care from people experienced with this disease, as well as daily activities and other residents to spend time with. I’m not surprised my mom hasn’t told me yet and my sister had to tell me. I don’t judge her, I see the sacrifices she’s made to be there for her mom while her sisters have failed to step up to the plate, and I admire her for it. My sister said my mom cried when she told her. Any words of wisdom in this situation?

27zjyu,"What were your first steps with an affected relative? I think my mom might be exhibiting early signs of Alzheimer's. She's 57. We have been noticing some mood changes in the last 5-10 years - mostly more aggressive behavior or being oblivious to things around her. She's become addicted to online games (angry birds and the like). She also doesn't sleep, but ends up falling asleep at work instead. And just today, while talking to my sister, she forgot her Granddad's name. I only talk to her about once a month, but my sister talks to her daily (usually about my niece). I usually make the trip once or twice a year.The burden of taking care of my parents will inevitably fall to me, as I am more financially stable and have no children.

qa9jux,"I don't know what we can do at this point. Hello. My grandmother has dementia, I recently found out. Although I kind of knew that she was showing symptoms of it, now I realize how bad it actually is. My mother doesn't really have a strong relationship with my grandmother, they normally see each other once or maybe twice a year, they also live pretty far away from one another. I think when we visited my grandmother in 2018, she was already being a bit forgetful: occasionally repeating words and phrases in sentences. In 2019/begin 2020 we visited her again, she did not seem to recognize me at first when she opened the door. She went upstairs, and showed us CABINETS and WARDROBES full off unnecessary stuff, which she compulsively bought. Rows and rows of the same cleaning product, toilet paper, et cetera. I don't think that we really visited her after that. (Until recently)  Just a few weeks ago, my grandmother (she is usually very cold and blunt) called my mother in a deeply emotional state, begging her to come by once. However, just 30 minutes or so before the appointment she said she wasn't 'feeling well' so my mother shouldn't come. When my mother arrived, she found her own mother lost in dementia. My grandmother has formed this narrative which she says every single time when she's talking to someone:   ""Oh, did you know I got fired from my job? The business closed down."" THIS WAS 15 YEARS AGO. 10 YEARS AGO. She did not recognize both of us. Care: She can not live by herself without help anymore. We can't go there every day to take care of her, but, there is a friendly neighbour at the other end of the street who helps her and chats with her occassionally. He is truly a kind man, but it is also very strenuous for him. He is getting literal physical pain because of the intensity of taking care of my grandmother, poor soul.

                "at first she was very ill, and we realized there was a very large chance covid might kill her.",
                "my mom is 77, has survived cancer and is a smoker.",
                "but what do you know, fysically she recovered somewhat.",
                "she still was weak and needed some oxygen but the fever passed and she seemed to do better.on monday i got some videochats going with some of her cousins whom she's always been close with.",
                "and while she was convinced she wasn't sick and she didn't have a clue where she was, she was still able to have a chat and she was lively.",

                "over the past week her alzheimer's seems to have progressed a year's worth or even more.",
                "she no longer understands where she is or why, she didn't recognize her own brother when he visited, she had a huge problem talking and forming coherent sentences, and worst of all, she was no longer able to swallow food or water.this afternoon we had a talk with the doctor there (my sister via video chat since she is still too sick to travel, no matter how much she wanted to be there), and we all concluded that my mom's quality of life was no longer there and that there was no hope of that improving in any significant way.the only solution was giving her food through a tube up her nose but she keeps pulling out her oxygen so we doubt she would accept such a thing, not to mention that it would only prolong her suffering at this point.",
                "so we have decided, with the agreement of the doctor, to seize all attempts at feeding her.this afternoon, right before the meeting with the doctor, her condition had worsened so much i was genuinely convinced for a second that i had entered the wrong room, because i didn't recognize her.",
                "she did still recognize me for a moment, mask and all, and whispered my name but that is the only coherent thing she said.i am still in shock how fast this virus has turned my mom into an advanced stage alzheimer's patient.",
                "how she went from still living on her own to no longer being able to speak and swallow in the span of two weeks.",
                "since the start of this pandemic my sister and i have been very worried about my mom catching the corona virus because she's such a high risk case, but we never could have imagined how this horrible virus could end things for my mom.i'm still mostly in shock.",
                "tomorrow we're talking with the hospital to get her out of there, maybe to a hospice or even back to her home since she is now officially corona free, so we can make her final days more comfortabele, since that is all we can do now, aside from waiting for the end."
